<h2>            owner auditing to track deletions</h2>
                    
<p>I have a user who is an early adopter of a bunch of technologies, including a couple that help him manage his email. Recently, he has brought to my attention emails that have been deleted from his mailbox:from his sent: folder and from a personal folder
 specifically. The missing emails are all from the same&nbsp; same thread or conversation. I can use message trace to see that he sent or received, but as the emails are over a month old, from early December,&nbsp;they don't exist anywhere in the system anymore. I've
 done the standard recovery options using EAC.</p>
<p>I understand that I can either place an inplace hold or a litigation hold to always be able to retrieve his email, but that is not my biggest concern. My concern is to figure out what/who is deleting the messages rather than just protecting the messages.
</p>
<p>I was hoping to turn on Auditing so that I might be able to track owner HardDeletes and SoftDeletes. Any software would use his login credentials to access his Office 365 email and therefore would be an owner deletion. Or, if he is accidentally deleting
 them, I could see that as well.</p>
<p>While I've turned on auditing for the owner, as seen below, it seems that there is no means by which I can get this information out. I guess I'm just looking for confirmation that this is the case.
</p>
<p>Is there any way to&nbsp;enable auditing for an owner to track HardDelete and SoftDelete and be able to export that information later?</p>

            Short answer is... right now, no.&nbsp; Android and IOS apps run on different operating systems (with different subroutine calls, etc.)&nbsp; and currently there is no 'interface level' or emulator available to make them run on Windows Mobile O/S.

            <p>I have this charger and a Lumia 950, and can confirm that the steps below work. You have full access to the chargers settings via the "Gadgets" app after following the steps are followed and the charger is paired. Its a great charger btw!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to pair the charger using the "gadgets" app, and not via NFC, or the Bluetooth settings.</p>
<p>Also, if you have previously paired any device to the charger, you need to clear it from the charger by doing the following:</p>
<p>Press the button&nbsp;on the bottom of the charger for 8 seconds or so (until the led flashes a few times).</p>
<p>You should also make sure to your phone does not have a saved Bluetooth setting for the charger(check under settings, Bluetooth, or tap and hold&nbsp;the Bluetooth button). If it does, delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, open the gadgets app, and use the + button to add the charger from there. Hopefully, it pairs correctly.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Outlook 2010 and IE11 forcing IE7 compatibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickacentre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2010 and IE11 forcing IE7 compatibility</h2>
                    <p>We have an issue where we support adding our website as a folder into Outlook (Setting the site as the homepage of a folder). This has worked until we have some newer code that is no longer supported in IE7 as we are dropping IE7 support from our software.
</p>
<p>On a machine with IE9 and Outlook 2010 the sites work fine still. However what we are finding is that when you have Outlook 2010 and IE11 on the same machine Outlook 2010 decides to load all pages as IE7 compatible regardless of the meta tags on the page
 which ends up breaking due to our newer code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have found a temporary workaround by using the registry key&nbsp;</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\MAIN\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION]<br />
"Outlook.exe"=dword:00002af9</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this forces outlook to use IE11 compatibility and the problem is resolved and our site loads properly. However, this is not a great thing to have to do on every client machine that may want to embed our website into their Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are curious if there is any other way to handle this either through our site code or some other way that wouldn't require changes on every client machine.</p>

            <p>No, but you can deploy it as a policy if these are managed PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the "Home Page" feature is a deprecated feature in Outlook and could be removed in future releases. It is recommended to no longer build new solutions based on it and to migrate away from it with other solutions. For instance, you can add a link
 to the web page in the Shortcuts Navigation (CTRL+7).</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We're more looking for allowing them to use the embedded browser inside Outlook one way was using the Home Page feature. We've also got an add-in that's available which just uses that embedded browser. I'm thinking at the moment if they are using that we
 might be able to include this registry setting as part of the Add-in installation which would work at least for those using the add-in since it sounds like there's no alternate solution to this issue as these PCs are not managed by us but our clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the embedded browser in Outlook deprecated as well and possibly going to be removed in future releases as well? If so then we probably will look for other alternatives as you mentioned the shortcuts area or other possibilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same problem with my SMS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Full backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard reset solves the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But after full restore, it remains same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some software may have corrupted it?</p>

<p>Looks like some software is the cause of your issue. I would do another hard reset and install my software one at a time just to determine the culprit. I would aslo not do a full restore. Perhaps if you could only
 restore your PIM data and leave the others out.</p>

<p><span>Hi Sudhir,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We'd like to share with you that it is not feasible. For example, our primary domain is contosoA.onmicrosoft.com, we can set an alias (e.g. user@contosoB.com) and set it as&nbsp; the primary email address and username. After that, we can sign into Office
 365 Portal with it. However, the URL format of the SharePoint site remains <a href="https://contosoA.sharepoint.com/sites/**" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://contosoA.sharepoint.com/sites/**</a>. And it can't change to be <a href="https://contosoB.sharepoint.com/sites/**" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://contosoB.sharepoint.com/sites/**</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Appreciate your understanding.</span></p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/618d8e42-183d-4f09-a7b2-79ed3ef3a784" title="DaveMcClure1">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to login to Skype using the old Skype Name/Username instead of your Microsoft account email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if the 2 accounts are linked, the credits will not appear when you sign in using the Microsoft account. Please take note that even they are link, Skype and MS are 2 separate accounts in terms of logging in to Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can only be accessed using the Skype Name/Username where the credits are associated to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you prefer using the MS account as your Skype login, what you can do instead is to transfer the credits from your old Skype account to your MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow the steps from this link on how to transfer your credits: <strong>
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA345/how-do-i-transfer-skype-credit-from-one-skype-account-to-another-skype-account?q=transfer+credits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I transfer Skype Credit?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that Skype and MS accounts are linked, deleting your Skype account will also delete the MS account linked to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other concerns.</p>

<p>I am unable to log in to my original Skype account as it uses the same email address that Microsoft have presumptuously used to create my Windows 10 Skype account (which I did not want).</p>
<p>There is credit in my original account, I don't know how much because I can't log in to access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Mr/Mrs Microsoft.&nbsp; I do not want a new Skype account.&nbsp; I want my old one back.&nbsp; The one with the user name that all my contacts know rather than a new one that nobody knows.</p>
<p>Please stop breaking things that were working brilliantly.&nbsp; You have ruined Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, I have becoming tired of all the nonsense that has come from MS since the decision to throw Windows 7 to the dogs.</p>

<p>If you already have an existing Skype account, you can sign in to it using the Skype name, instead of using the email address. Since Skype is under Microsoft services, you can access Skype using the Microsoft account email address, which is different from
 your old Skype account access.</p>

<p>Hi Lachman01,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please confirm whether you have rolled back to the Office 2013 or still use the Office 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using the Office 2016 and experiencing the issue, you may try to

<p>Hi PaulLachman,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for your update.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For this issue about Office 2016, we can resolve it by installing OneDrive for Business 2016 manually referring to the KB
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3098502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3098502</a> .<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As you meet an error during the process, we need the symptom to clarify and investigate the situation.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Moreover, you have rolled back to Office 2013, you may keep using it. If you'd like to use the Office 2016, could you provide the information I collected above to troubleshoot the issue?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regards,<br />
Felix</p>

                    <span>Powerpoint Slidemaster - title slide layout changes after saving</span><span> |
</span><span>I have made a standard presentation in de slidemaster. All slides and layouts seem to be working fine. I can switch between layouts and I can choose what type of new slide I would like to insert. The final
 presentation looks fine until I've saved and closed it. When I re-open the presentation, the layout of the first slide has changed, including the font type. None of the other slides are affected and when I change the layout to my title slide, it switches back
 without a problem. But when I close and open, the layout of the very first slide has changed again. What am I forgetting?</span>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 for Mac, V15.25, no export to CSV&#63;</h2>
                    This version does not seem to allow contact export to anything other than OLM, which is not readable by Mac Mail. Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Also, no option for deleting messages on server after download?<br />
<br />
Also weird periods of disconnect from one of my 2 email accounts.<br />
<br />
So I can not rely on MSOE to work and I can not get my contacts and messages out for import to another program??? Grrrrr.<br />
<br />
MS says, we no longer support the no subscription issues (sold only last October) and it's probably your ISP.<br />
<br />
ISP says, it's a software issue.

    <title>Software Problem with Shift While Typing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steveheath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Software Problem with Shift While Typing</h2>
                    I am having trouble with typing in Word, PowerPoint and Outlook (email). When I hit shift, the letter still comes out lower case. When I press shift harder, both the first and second letters of the word come out capitalized. I thought I had a keyboard
 problem, but I just bought a new keyboard and it is still happening. Anyone else encountered this?

            <p>I guess that in the first instance there is a problem with synchronisation between the depression of the shift key and your typing the letter;&nbsp; In the second case, you are holding the shift key down for too long - i.e. you have typed pressed the second letter
 before releasing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think it's a matter of pressing harder per se.</p>

            Interesting, but wrong so far as holding down the shift key too long. I hold the shift and type one letter, then release, then type the next letter and both come up capitalized. nThat's why I thought it was the keyboard itself, but the new keyboard does
 the same thing.<br />

            <p>Maybe both keyboards are faulty and the Shift key is sticking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While you can via File&gt;Options&gt;Proofing&gt;AutoCorrect Options&gt;AutoCorrect, set Word to Correct TWO INitial CApitals, there is NO setting in Word that would cause the issue that you report.</p>

            <p>Hi AJ_25,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that you do not like the Outlook.com user interface. However, users who are automatically upgraded or opt-in to upgrade to Outlook.com no longer have the option to switch back to Hotmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Eventually all Hotmail users will be upgraded to Outlook.com. The launch of Outlook.com preview gave everyone an opportunity to learn together as we roll out and scale this new service.
 To ensure a smooth transition for all Hotmail customers, the upgrade will be gradual.
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>For the viewing of emails when user interface was upgraded to Outlook.com, usually issue occurs when a user is using a lower version of the browser. We strongly recommend that you upgrade
 your browser to its latest version for best browsing experience. Please refer to the article below on how to upgrade your browser and Outlook.com supported browsers:</font></span></p>

<p>Once you have upgraded your browser's version, kindly check if the issue persists. If the issue persists, we would need you to answer the following questions for us to isolate the issue:</p>

<p>There is an option called InPrivate Browsing. Don't leave any trace of your browsing history.<br />

<p>You're talking about AutoComplete.&nbsp; This is set at Tools / Internet Options / Content / AutoComplete / Settings.&nbsp; To stop it from collecting and showing this information, uncheck the box for Address Bar. You can continue to use the other options at your
 choice.&nbsp; To delete the address bar history, you must unfortunately delete alll&nbsp; autocomplete entries (you can't just delete that one only).&nbsp; To do so, on that same page, click the button delete AutoComplete History and it will all be gone.&nbsp; Anything else you
 left&nbsp; checked will begin to rebuild as you use the system (though the history will be gone).</p>
<p>InPrivate Browsing will not delete this history and is not necessary as the above is the reason for this information displaying and following those instructions once will resolve it permanently for all sites without needing to change modes.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

 that will allow me to see my browsing history , even on inprivate browsing?<br />
<br />
Answer :<br />
No, it's called private browsing for a reason. <strong>It doesn't save cookies, history</strong> etc. Password your computer if you don't want anyone using it.<br />

            The issue was to remove the history from the address bar - the procedure I posted does that (and although inPrivate Browsing prevents it from happening again&nbsp;(as does the procedure I posted) - another reuest, it does not delete what is already there).&nbsp;
 Furthermore, we don't know if the poster wants cookies saved or other things that inPrivate browsing deactivates - there was no mention of cookies or anything other than history. InPrivate browsing is a more radical&nbsp;solution than necessary to satisfy the request
 (and doesn't even fully satsfy the request).

<h2>            Adding another inbox to my Outbook 2010</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to add another inbox to my Outlook 2010 but don't need to have other subfolder that MS Outlook 2010 come with the software. EX: want the Inbox but not the Junk email, RSS Feeds, Search Folders, Draft, Sent Items, Deleted Items ... and other
 folder. Is this possible?</p>

            There is no need to create an entirely new Outlook data file just so you can have another "Inbox." You can create as many message folders as you want within your current data file, but obviously you cannot name another&nbsp;folder "Inbox." You can direct messages
 to other folders using rules.

    <title>Windows 10 OneNote app sucks. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike 311  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 OneNote app sucks.</h2>
                    <p>I don't understand why we are being steered toward this app and away from the desktop version which had so many more features.&nbsp; You can't slap a more vivid shade of purple on a stripped down app and call it OneNote. There's so many note-taking apps out there
 and none of them comes close to OneNote 2016.&nbsp; The OneNote app is definitely creating alot of space for those apps to grab a larger share of the market.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scrolling through several pages of Word printouts is painful on my computer; slow and choppy.&nbsp; Not to mention, I can't just drop a Word file onto the OneNote page and have it printout.&nbsp; I now must convert it to a PDF, insert it, then make it printout from
 there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about the Outlook functions which are now gone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not going to go on and on about what's wrong with the app since so many before have done that already.&nbsp; I'm just adding my voice to those who know that the OneNote app is an inferior product and it's important for Microsoft to hear it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The OneNote app should offer everything that the desktop version offered, and I would assume even more.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Microsoft, you are slowly taking away the things that keep me from buying a Mac.&nbsp; This isn't an
<em>upgrade&nbsp;</em>when you give us something with less features than its predecessor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I totally agree with Big Mike. &nbsp; The things that the App doesn't do is waaaayyy too long to list and I used almost all of them on a regular basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am continually amazed at the decision making within Microsoft.&nbsp; Perhaps Microsoft didn't believe that there were enough users to justify continuing with the full OneNote version.&nbsp; Who knows, but I believe that many people were starting to use OneNote desktop
 version because of how easy it was to use with Surface Pro and other touchscreen devices.&nbsp; So after finally providing the best tools to take advantage of this brilliant piece of software and after people start using it they decide to take it away.&nbsp; So disappointing.&nbsp;
 Although this seems to be the way with Microsoft...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Microsoft Phone - Loved it now it is gone</p>
<p>- Microsoft watch - Great watch</p>
<p>- Microsoft Groove - Go get Spotify you will like it better than us</p>
<p>- So on and so forth</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone at Microsoft would like some free advice on how to better serve your best, longest, loyal customers please feel free to reach out to me.</p>

<p>I completely agree, Big Mike 311 -&nbsp;</p>
<p>OneNote "App" is absolutely horrible.&nbsp; It is not at all easy to use, features that are OH SO IMPORTANT (like Integration with Outlook and macro capabilities to name a couple) are non-existent.</p>
<p>Come on Microsoft, this is ridiculous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            As far as I can understand your post, it means that MS has no product strategy for desktop users. They only care about mobile users... making a distinction between mobile and desktop users amounts to the same problem of making a distinction between online
 and offline shoppers. I am using a Surface Pro as my only device... at home or on the move... Am I a mobile user or a desktop user?&nbsp;

            Isn't that just the 2016 version though? As in, no new development or improvements? Maybe that will be a good thing in the end, though...

</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to outlook.live.com, it changes to outlook.live.com/owa.&nbsp; I have set the browser to request the desktop site, but I still get the site that looks like that gahdawful Windows 10 mobile.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no "settings" icon in the upper right area.&nbsp; If I tap "options" at the bottom of the screen, there is no listing for preview pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The preview pane is beyond annoying, especially when it opens spam that is of a prurient nature.&nbsp; I just want a list of my folders and messages; I have no need to preview the message.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Download Network Setup application from Marketplace, it will automatically detect the MMS settings from your SIM. If not, you can ask your operator to send you the MMS Settings through text message or manually configure it using the Network Setup application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <br />
On SIM locked devices, even after unlocking, this application will not configure the Internet and MMS settings.</p>

<h2>            Error&#40;s&#41; Updating - Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Evaluation copy. Build 14295.rs1_release 160318-1628</h2>
                    I have: Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Evaluation copy. Build 14295.rs1_release 160318-1628<br />
This versions will expire on - "12/31/2016 4:29:44 PM".<br />
Every time I try and use Windows Update, I keep having the following errors...<br />
0x80240fff<br />
0x80070017<br />
0x80240017<br />
Everything just says "failed to update."<br />
It seems to download fine, but when it comes to installing that's where it starts hanging, locking up and then crashes and turns up the codes.<br />
<br />
I've tried updating from CMD, stopping and restarting the programs even clearing out the windows SoftwareDistribution folder.<br />
Tried running the Microsoft WindowsUpdateDiagnostic and wushowhide programs even used CMD to reset the Store settings.<br />
I even tried a 3rd party program that allowed me to download the updates and install them and that failed.<br />
Nothing will allow me to apply my updates<br />
<br />
I'm really trying to avoid a fresh install, have a 4TB HDD and about 500GB of programs installed.
<br />
I've also tried to roll back to my earlier windows build but it confronts me with a prompt saying "the files needed to go back are or were removed from this PC."<br />
<br />
I'm at a loss, really preying an expert can help walk me threw a fix and help me keep my PC from expiring.<br />
Also I'm no computer expert, but I do know my way around a PC if someone provides the steps needed for me to follow.<br />
Thank you and looking forward to the help.

</p><blockquote>I have: Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Evaluation copy. Build 14295.rs1_release 160318-1628<br />
This versions will expire on - "12/31/2016 4:29:44 PM".<br />
Every time I try and use Windows Update, I keep having the following errors...<br />
0x80240fff<br />
0x80070017<br />
0x80240017<br />
Everything just says "failed to update."<br />
It seems to download fine, but when it comes to installing that's where it starts hanging, locking up and then crashes and turns up the codes.<br />
<br />
I've tried updating from CMD, stopping and restarting the programs even clearing out the windows SoftwareDistribution folder.<br />
Tried running the Microsoft WindowsUpdateDiagnostic and wushowhide programs even used CMD to reset the Store settings.<br />
I even tried a 3rd party program that allowed me to download the updates and install them and that failed.<br />
Nothing will allow me to apply my updates<br />
<br />
I'm really trying to avoid a fresh install, have a 4TB HDD and about 500GB of programs installed.
<br />
I've also tried to roll back to my earlier windows build but it confronts me with a prompt saying "the files needed to go back are or were removed from this PC."<br />
<br />
I'm at a loss, really preying an expert can help walk me threw a fix and help me keep my PC from expiring.<br />
Also I'm no computer expert, but I do know my way around a PC if someone provides the steps needed for me to follow.<br />
Thank you and looking forward to the help. </blockquote>

</p><p>Hi Shawn</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that your computer is already in the initial stages of Expiring that version of the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The license for Build 14295 expires in 10 days (7/15/2016). You should already be seeing the warning messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that you download the latest ISO for the preview (Build 14366) and perform a new install or upgrade3 install (if possible). This newer build has an expiration date of 10/1/2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should get you back in the upgrade groove and allow you to install the Anniversary Upgrade later this month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download Windows 10 Insider Preview ISO:<br />

removed all usb devices except keyboard and mouse.<br />
Check in the registry and it was already set that way. The other option was not available.<br />
Only issue I can maybe see is that I have a 4tb HDD divided into 4 parts. (OS / Restore / Installed Software / Music)

            I currently do not have a drive to copy this to... also this option only allows me to do a clean install, losing all my settings and customized tweaks...<br />
My valid Windows 7 Ultimate Signed Edition is no longer valid as Microsoft informed me when I tried to do a restore once before... leaving me with only a Windows Vista Ultimate valid serial.... if I gotta lose it all I may go back to a Linux or other open-source
 distro. feeling bummed

<p>Hi Anthony - thanks for that link. &nbsp;I found that previously when googling the issue. &nbsp;I was hoping for something
<strong>more specific</strong>. &nbsp;The sync error is not specific and therefore I can't tell what the problem is from that and therefore the guide on sync issues
<strong>doesn't help</strong> because it assumes I know what the problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily this morning I saw this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/911cf820-3929-4a5c-a2fa-10b8b814fd6e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/911cf820-3929-4a5c-a2fa-10b8b814fd6e" /></a></p>
<p>So I there issues sync sections. &nbsp;But <strong>which sections</strong>?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike DePouw</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is you're GPU driver up to date? if not try and update it. Here is some websites for update utilities:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html</p>
<p>http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/auto-detect-tool</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is up to date the problem might be that the driver you have installed doesn't support OpenGL.</p>

            That is the Public build of Windows 10 and Minecraft works fine on many systems suggest you update drivers on your system and check Minecraft support site, as this forum is for testing newer builds of Windows 10 before releasing to the public and is not

            Joe, 10586.318 is the public build. Isn't 10586.338 the build for the slow lane?

            Yes you are right I was just seeing 10586 as I don't have anything on the slow ring, but the poster needs to check with Minecraft support as I haven't seen many posting about issues with Minecraft on here.

<h2>            What&#39;s the difference between hotmail and outlook on Windows Phone&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;I had my windows live/ hotmail (I'm not sure on the difference there) on my phone and then downloaded outlook.&nbsp; Its the same email and they seem to be virtually identical. Now my calender events are doubled.&nbsp; So which one should I keep? Is one better
 or do they different things? But I really don't need two applications for 1 email account.&nbsp; Thank you.

            Yea, you don't need that second one. The one used to initially set up the device, which should be seen as the Microsoft Account in settings,&nbsp;should be all you need. You can just delete that other one in settings. Outlook as an option is there if you have
 more than one MS supported account, such as *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;or live.com.&nbsp; You set up your phone with whichever makes sense to you and use Outlook for the others. What makes sense to you is if one account is more personal and the other business,
 or you use one for good friends and the other everyone else, something like that. The key is that the base account the Microsoft Account cannot be changed without totally resetting the phone, so pick an account that at least you plan to keep.
