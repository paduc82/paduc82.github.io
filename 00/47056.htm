<h2>            &#34;There was a problem starting nvcpl.dll&#34; How to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I seem to have this problem since I had a power cut on my computer. The error shows up on windows start up. When I searched on the internet for any kind of fix, I found out that it had to do with my nvidia video card. It said that it was in some way
 infected with Windows 7 Home Security 2011 and that I couldn't open any .exe files. But I could run .exe files just fine. The problem is on my gpu. It seems like it is not working properly. I realized this when I played a multiplayer online game I would often
 play and it started to lag in-game. I thought at first it was because of my internet connection, but it wasn't that. I didn't have hardware acceleration turned on, which made me think that I found the solution, as I used to have it on. I tried turning it on
 in chrome://settings but it didn't work. Every time I checked at chrome://gpu, almost all of them were Software Only. Well I tried to force hardware acceleration by enabling it in chrome://flags but it still didn't work. I was confused and I didn't know what
 to do. I searched about this error again and it was suggested to update or reinstall nvidia drivers. That's what I did. I installed the Nvidia Driver Setup but when I opened the setup it said it couldn't continue because my hardware isn't compatible. I was
 so annoyed at this point! I tried checking for updates in Nvidia Experience and during that process, another error shows up saying: "There was a problem starting streamci.dl" and the setup crashed! I just don't know what to do! Please Help me out!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to know why chrome doesn't allow hardware acceleration and if my gpu is working properly or not.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I also can't seem to open nvidia control panel.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>JoaniDisho</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not recommended to suddenly cut the power of your computer. Nvcpl.dll is related to Nvidia Control Panel. To troubleshoot the issue, please reinstall the drivers for your graphics card but this time put a check to the option
<strong>Perform clean install</strong>. This will remove any files that has been corrupted from the previous installation of the drivers. When installing the driver, choose
<strong>Custom installation</strong> instead of <strong>Express</strong> to see the option on performing a clean installation of the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Personalized Settings not responding&#63; Black screen&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    After doing windows updates and restarting my laptop, it allows me to sign in, but instead of loading my desktop screen it just turns black. A small box comes up that says "Personalized Settings (Not Responding)" I'm lost. What is the problem and how do
 I fix it?

<p><br />
Interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; The "black screen" part of your symptom could mean that&nbsp; explorer.exe&nbsp; has crashed and not been able to restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why you might then see this second symptom, except that it sounds like something which could be a part of explorer.exe
 recovery procedure, e.g. it reminds me of a procedure that came up automatically never to be seen again when W8 was first installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, while you have a black screen you could try starting Task Manager and use it to start other things.&nbsp;&nbsp; First though, it would be useful to differentiate about whether you have a "black" screen or a "blank" screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. if there is a fringe
 of light around the edges and if it is just quite dark but not as dark as it would be if powered off, "blank" screen might be a more accurate description.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you might be able to see things if they were added to it, which would be less likely if it was
 black.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, can you move your mouse and see a pointer moving across the darkness?&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I think that would be an example of a "blank" screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, to start Task Manager you would press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and use the Task Manager item in the menu that keyboard shortcut would bring up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you could use its Prcesses tab to see if&nbsp; Windows Explorer&nbsp; appeared there.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not you could use TM's File,
 Run... command to start it by entering there:&nbsp; explorer.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, another possibility that some people have been seeing is their primary screen inexplicably switched to a phantom second monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then pressing Win-P, CursorUp, and Enter&nbsp; to try changing the Second Screen setting may be a simpler more effective
 procedure to try to get something showing on the monitor that you are looking at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
FYI</p>

            I can't remember the make and model of the pc, all I remember is buying it in around 08-09. I have microsoft security essentials or windows security essential's or whichever one it is. I got the message about 3 day's ago. There is no error msg, it simply
 say's some file's are missing to insert windows xp service pack 3 to repair the file's to their original state, or something like that. As I do not have the disk I have run the scan thing and am now looking for somewhere to take it to. &nbsp;Lastly no I am not
 trying to install it as it has been installed on my computer for several year's.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.

            Hi Jack, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />If your PC is in a continuous repair loop, you can perform a clean installation which will resolve the issue most effectively. Since your PC came preinstalled with Windows 10, the license is built-into the motherboard and so you won't need to worry about reactivation once you've reinstalled Windows - it should activate automatically.
<br />
<br />Here's an article that explains in detail how to clean install:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/for...</a>
<br />
<br />You'll need an 8GB or larger USB flash drive, and the media creation tool from this link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-10-create-installation-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/...</a>
<br />
<br />On another PC, follow the steps in the article I linked and you'll be able to clean install Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

<p>Hi. Thanks, ive got the iso file downloaded and tranferred to a usb drive, back to the blue screen of death loop i choose use a device and ive tried it both ways, with a cd/dvd and the usb, both choices tell me that there is no cd/dvd option, no usb option.
 I looked for the media creation tool but dont know if thats a seperate download or if it should be in the iso file. Also the iso files downloaded as zip files, i unzipped them before transferring to the usb. Should i have NOT unzipped. Please advise.</p>
<p>Thanks Graeme</p>

            The ISO file won't be bootable, which is why you can't see it as an option. You'll need to download the Media Creation Tool to make your USB drive bootable, and it'll also download the Windows installation files to the USB drive at the same time.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go!

<p>Hi Graeme, so i think my snag is that i keep getting routed to a page because the operating system im using wont support the windows 10 media creation tool. I guess i should have mentioned i am trying to download to an XP operating system. Any suggestions
 ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<br />Use Rufus to create bootable USB if you have an ISO file:

            I see! In that case, do you have another PC running Windows 7 or later that you could use the Media Creation Tool on?
<br />
<br />Otherwise you could try burning the installation ISO to a disc, then booting from that. Let me know if you need help with it!

<h2>            Windows 7 wont boot past the Logo screen at startup, restore does not work, cannot repair automatically</h2>
                    
<p>After turning my computer on after being off all night the boot up froze at the win7 logo screen.&nbsp; Using the installation disk I ran start up repair, after restart it boot into windows no problem.&nbsp; I then backed everything up and ran AVG anti-virus, no virus
 detected. The next time I restarted the boot froze at the logo screen again. I tried the same start up repair trick but it continued to freeze at the logo screen. I tried all other options on the win7 install disk to no avail.&nbsp; The start up repair, the only
 thing that ever helped, reported the following information.</p>

<p>As I said, it freezes at the logo screen so I do not think I can boot into safe mode. If there is another way to do this I am willing to try. I am running ubuntu off of a live CD and have access to my windows drive if that helps me trouble shoot.&nbsp; If we
 can avoid a total reinstall of win7 that would be great.&nbsp; Thanks to anyone who can help.</p>

<p>At boot windows 7 32bit would hang at the windows logo. Nothing special, just starting the computer after being turned off for the night. I used the Win7 install disk for the 'repair my computer' options. &nbsp;None of them fix the problem. When I run startup
 repair over and over it will boot up with no problem 1 out of 10 times (approx). When start up repair does not work the computer restarts at the win7 logo screen. Each time start up repair does not work I get the following error message</p>

<p>I tried all of the recommended fixes. &nbsp;The only thing that&nbsp;consistently&nbsp;works is running the following two lines of code from the command prompt off the install disk</p>
<p>bootrec.exe /fixmbr<br />
x:\boot\bootsect.exe /nt60 all /force &nbsp;&lt;---where x: is CD drive letter</p>
<p>after running these two lines of code&nbsp;in the command prompt off of the install disk and restarting,&nbsp;it will boot up correctly . When it boots correctly everything works just like it should including sharing between computers, streaming to 360, website hosted
 on my computer, wireless adapter. After it boots up correctly and then is restarted I get the same problem of restarting at the win7 logo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really dont want to reinstall the OS if at all possible. Because running the two lines of code works&nbsp;consistently&nbsp;I feel like this should at least pinpoint the problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you to anyone who can help.</p>

            If after running the two lines it works I got one question have you run your antivirus and also Malwarebytes it free you could have a virus or malware that it causing the problem.&nbsp; Have you google the windows 7 would hang at the windows logo and tried
 some of the things there?&nbsp; I notice one person who had this probem it was they type power supply he was using which I do not understand. Without more info on your system and more about your installation like is this just after you installed it or has it been
 working fine for a while, it is hard to help more than say google it.<br />

<p>when I am able to boot into windows I have run updated AVG and found no virus. I keep a fairly robust firewall and run nightly AVG scans, I believe virus/malware is unlikely.</p>
<p>I have googled the ____ out of this and tried anything anyone has suggested. More specifically I have tried everything on the page I linked to with no luck besides the two lines of code I previously mention.&nbsp; Booting into startup repair from the CD and running
 that code is not an acceptable option everytime I want to start my comptuer.</p>
<p>I installed Windows 7 about 5 months ago and have experienced no problems till this happened.</p>
<p>If these lines of code fix the problem on a one time basis but the problem reoccurs I think we have pinpointed the problem.</p>
<p>If there is any other info I can provide please ask.</p>

=========================================<br />
<br />
If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy
<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already
<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />
<br />
If you need to make repair disks - these help repair Windows not re-install.<br />

<br />
=========================================<br />
<br />
These "may" help : (see Recovery Options or Windows 7 disk info above)<br />
<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Windows 7&nbsp;disk</p>
<p>Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.</p>
<p>If needed after those you can&nbsp;retry System Restore from the Recovery or Windows 7 disk.<br />

<p>Hi Pneuvo,</p>
<p>Good tip when the drive will not initialize properly though to be honest it rarely will help<br />
in the issue above. It is often used when a IDE drive is moved to a computer with a different<br />
chipset.<br />
<br />
These are the suggested entries&nbsp;:</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\IntelIde]<br />
"ErrorControl"=dword:00000001<br />
"Group"="System Bus Extender"<br />
"Start"=dword:00000000<br />
"Tag"=dword:00000004<br />
"Type"=dword:00000001<br />
<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PCIIde]<br />
"ErrorControl"=dword:00000001<br />
"Group"="System Bus Extender"<br />
"Start"=dword:00000000<br />
"Tag"=dword:00000003<br />
"Type"=dword:00000001<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>So you are saying that moving a drive to a computer whose Motherboard has a different chipset is a rare occurrance?&nbsp; Perhaps so.&nbsp; Mine was a SATA drive moving between two machines, one of which apparently used AHCI and the other not.&nbsp; I don't claim to understand
 it.</p>
<p>Sounds like you can get the same problem report in a wide variety of circumstances.&nbsp; Makes me think the report needs to collect more info?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
No I am saying that if a drive is not moved that needing to reset those would be&nbsp;a rare occurance<br />
as the chipset is still the same. However moving a boot drive to a new motherboard/computer is<br />
very problematic anyway and usually calls for a re-installation though it can be done.<br />
<br />
Certainly worth checking I suppose.</p>

            Windows 10 will install the logical corresponding edition, in this case Windows 10 Home 64 bit. For convenience, both editions are included, so if you have more than one computer running a variety of editions you can upgrade them using one installer.

<h2>            Netflix Won&#39;t Install on Windows 8.1 Error Code 0x80070057</h2>
                    I have a fresh install of Windows 8.1, and I've been trying to download Netflix so I can use it without Chrome sucking up all my RAM. The only problem is, when I try to install it, I continuously get error code 0x80070057. I have tried numerous fixes,
 including booting in safe mode, updating display drivers, resetting Windows Store, creating a new store cache, and running multiple Windows troubleshooters. To add insult to injury, I have downloaded multiple other apps, and they all downloaded and installed
 perfectly. Netflix is the only one so far that is unable to install. Somebody please help me.

            I've been trying for days also to get this fixed. It was working fine before i went to Windows 10 then i did a fresh install of windows 8.1 and bam.. same exact error. Microsoft or netflix needs to fix this issue. I've talked to two netflix techs also
 on this issue. If you look @ the window store reviews for netflix you can see everyone is having the same issue with installing now.

This problem can be solved easily for the time beign by just downloading an app that installs those two DLLs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Windows Store App</li><li>Search for Flixster</li><li>Install the App Flixster</li><li>Wait for the installation to finish</li><li>Then search for Netflix</li><li>Install Netflix</li></ol>

            The Flixster App doesn't show in my store - I am in Australia so maybe its not available to us? Does anyone know of other apps that use the DLL files that Netflix is looking for?<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just change your location to United States and you will be able to find Flixster in the Store</p>
<p>. The solution worked for me. My question: What Flixster installs that Netflix need is any component or library?</p>

                    <p>Please help.&nbsp; I previously owned a Windows 7 PC at home and would remote into a Windows 7 PC at work.&nbsp; This connection would allow my home PC to use all of the monitors on my work PC and dual displays at home. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a Windows 10 PC for home and am unable to replicate the same condition I had with Windows 7 and multiple displays being replicated at home from my work PC.&nbsp; I have read many old post from 2017 that are closed and have no resolution for this issue.&nbsp;
 Can I configure Windows 10 desktop connect to use all of the monitors on my Windows 7 PC, like Windows 7 would?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I had no choice but to purchase Windows 10 with a new PC.&nbsp; If I knew this was going to be an issue, I would have stayed with my Windows 7 machine.</p>

<h3> mdhmissy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kodak ESP C315 Printer won&#39;t work with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Have had Dell laptop Windows 8.1 for almost a year. Updates regularly/automatically. Had the printer a little longer and has worked FINE until last week. It suddenly stopped working although it showed as connected wirelessly and online.&nbsp; Upon further research
 it stated via pc that it was OFFLINE (but it was NOT). I tried doing everything from unplugging printer to checking for updated drivers to uninstalling/reinstalling to no avail. Contacted Kodak yesterday and was on the phone over an hour with them remotely
 redoing everything. The software is updated and showing on the PC but the printer is not showing on the PC now. I have searched and looked and, even thought it is "there", it is not. After remotely uninstalling, reinstalling and trying to fix it, I was told
 to contact MS/Windows that it was a problem with Windows 8. This is both a new PC (overall) as is the printer that is a necessity for homeschooling my son. Any help?? Kindly, Melissa

            <p>Hello again Susana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if this happens with other apps which use the camera, such as Skype? Or does the camera work with other apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does work with other apps, try doing a refresh. This <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/restore-refresh-or-reset-surface-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
guide</a> clarifies how to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not work with other apps, try uninstalling/reinstalling the driver for the camera. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>Go to
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Desktop</span></li><li><span>Swipe from right and click on
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Settings</span></li><li><span>Click on
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Control Panel</span></li><li><span>Open
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Device Manager</span></li><li><span>Choose
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Imaging Devices<br />
</span></li><li><span>Choose
<strong>Microsoft LifeCam Front</strong> (NOTE: after completing step 8, complete these steps again but choose&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft LifeCam Rear</strong> for this step)</span></li><li><span>Choose the
<strong>Driver</strong> tab</span></li><li><span>Choose to uninstall (DO NOT DELETE)<br />
</span></li><li><span>Restart the Surface Pro 3</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If neither of these work, reach out to our Assisted Support team. You can contact them

<h2>            Invited to take the 60 Seconds to Windows Challenge but was not explained the rules or restrictions. Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em>sweepstake</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to start by saying you win a Microsoft Contest but you cannot claim the prize!<br />
<br />
When my daughter and I were visiting a Microsoft Store in Mission Viejo, CA about 2 weeks ago, we were each given a chance to participate in the&nbsp; â€œ60 SECONDS TO WINDOWS CHALLENGEâ€ SWEEPSTAKES.&nbsp; I took 18 seconds to complete the test and my daughter took only
 9 seconds.&nbsp; We were informed by the store staff at the time that if one of us was chosen as a daily winner in the â€œ60 SECONDS TO WINDOWS CHALLENGEâ€ contest,&nbsp; we would win a prize worth about $1000.&nbsp; Three days later, we received an email from a Microsoft
<span>Promotion Coordinator (</span><span>Marden-Kane, Inc.) informing us that my daughter had been chosen as a daily winner and the prize was a "Vizio CT Thin &amp; Light notebook PC".&nbsp; My daughter and I were both very excited until I read the 3 attachments in
<span>Promotion Coordinator (</span><span>Marden-Kane, Inc.) informing us that my daughter had been chosen as a daily winner and the prize was a "Vizio CT Thin &amp; Light notebook PC".&nbsp; My daughter and I were both very excited until I read the 3 attachments in
 the </span><span>Marden-Kane, Inc email.&nbsp; Below are the names of the 3 attachments (forms).<br />
<br />
1) 60 seconds to windows challenge- Affidavit of Eligibility 8-2-12.pdf<br />
2) 60 Seconds to Windows Challenge_Official Rules_Final 8-6-12_updated.pdf<br />
3) W9- Nov 2005 Form5.pdf<br />
<br />
One of the forms states that a sweepstake participant must be 18 years or older.&nbsp; My daughter was much younger than 18.&nbsp; When I contacted
</span><span>Marden-Kane, Inc to see if my daughter can claim the prize, I was informed that, according to the rule, my daughter was disqualified for the prize because she was under 18 years old.<br />
<br />
My question is that why did Microsoft invite a its store customers to participate in a sweepstake promised a winning prize before explain the office rules and restrictions?&nbsp; It created a sense of false promise, at lease for my daughter and me.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />

            I think this is definitely something worth taking to a small claims court. If you were with her at the time of signing up for the&nbsp;sweepstakes, you gave adult consent. Try again to explain your situation to Marden-Kane, and if they don't contact a lawyer
 if it's worth going through the hassle. Another thing you can do is contact Microsoft directly and explain your situation.&nbsp;

<h2>            My pc freezes after about half an hour of playing games.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, a few days ago i started experiencing a problem where my pc would just freeze after playing games for about half an hour and i have no idea why! I do not remember downloading anything the days leading up to the problem occurring. When the game freezes
 i have no other choice than to hold down the button on my pc that is meant to turn it on. Before the crash occurs. (Mind you i am playing a first person shooter online game) The players on my team and the enemies team just go invisible, and only the name tags
 are visible. If im lucky i can shut the game down before it crashed, and then play for about half an hour more until the same thing happens again. Please help me solve this problem if you can. Thanks!</p>

<p>From what you have described it may be an issue with the network adapter going to sleep or even the entire pc going into a power down mode.</p>
<p>Have you had the same issues playing SP games or other tasks on the&nbsp; device ?</p>
<p>The only other issue could be the psu may be having issues.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for your reply! I don't think that it has something to do with my ethernet cable, because when the crash happens my ping usualy doesnt get higher. Also, not sure what you mean by "SP games" but i've expiernced the same problem doing other tasks
 like browsing the internet, i noticed that in taskmanager it says that 5gb of ram is getting used from playing the game and doing nothing else, perhaps that could somehow be related to the problem?

            Hi Jesper,<br />

            <p>I encountered the same problem. I manually configured my DNS server in Network and Sharing Center &gt; Change Adapter Settings &gt; Ethernet&nbsp; Controller &gt; Internet Protocol Version 4 Properties.
</p>
<p>I used 8.8.8.8 as my Preferred DNS Server and 8.8.4.4 as my Alternate DNS Server.</p>
<p>Now everything works.</p>

            <p>Thanks very much Patrick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately my skills don't extend very far - I have managed to find my way as far as your instruction "Change adapter settings" but then I am lost and cannot find "Ethernet Controller" or "Internet Protocol Version 4 Properties".&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In particular, I cannot see anything resembling "preferred DNS Server"&nbsp; or&nbsp; "Alternate DNS Server".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further help would be very much appreciated as I have not found anyone else who even understands my problem - and that includes my local Computer Expert shop !</p>

<p>dont take my advice to heart, but it just may be that you need a new router. the longer a router is used the more it'll start to lag and get buggy. If thats not it try getting a cable that connects directly from your router toyour xbox</p>

2 suggestions :<br />
<br />
1. If this problem is recent, and if you remember a date when you did NOT have this problem, do a system restore.</p>
<p>Pick a date when you did not have this problem as your restore point.<br />

            Hey Thanks I think that I figured out that all of the files have been made into LNK files ! Don't know how or don't even know what that means. But when I open properties and the general tab, it says that they are LNK files. Do you know &nbsp;what that means
 and how I can change them back to what they need to be !? &nbsp;I &nbsp; also have a ton of pics that I DO NOT want to lose. If I do do a system restore will I lose my pics ! I just downloaded them and erased the cards that they were on. &nbsp; Thanks for any help ! &nbsp; Susan

System restore will NOT erase pictures you had downloaded.<br />

            <p>Hi, It's me again !&nbsp; Well I am trying to do that system restore that you told me to go to under the Windowns 7 Forum. It's trying, but it says that there is antivirus not letting it do it's job and that I need to disable it. I have taken off one that I had
 and I still have Norton on there. It won't let me disable it, but I think it ran out anyway and I have to renew. Do I need to unistall all of the things that say Norton on them also ? Also there is something called Registry Mechanic, is that an antivirus program
 too ? One more question !&nbsp; Am I supposed to have internet explorer on the program list also ? If it is supposed to be there it isn't !&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for ALL your help,&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's almost time for me to call the Geeks !</p>

<b><u>lnk</u></b></a> &gt; follow the instructions #1 to #6 at the top.</p>
<p>.......................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Now to your questions<br />
<br />
1. Norton ....<br />
When it comes time to uninstall Norton, you will need Norton Removal Tool to get rid of all components of Norton.</p>
<p>Here is the link to install Norton Removal Tool<br />
<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Uninstallers/Norton-Removal-Tool.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Uninstallers/Norton-Removal-Tool.shtml</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Registry Mechanic :<br />
STAY AWAY from ANY registry cleaners. <br />
In the hands oc experienced users, it could be helpful.<br />
In the hands of novice users, it is a time bomb.</p>
<p>No. registry cleaner is NOT an ant-virus application.</p>
<p>3. Internet Explorer :<br />
Yes, you have one that comes with your Windows 7.<br />
If your Win 7 is a 32-bit, you'll see one.<br />
If your Win 7 is a 64-bit, you'll see 2, one for 32-bit, one for 64-bit.</p>
<p>Where is Internet Explorer ?<br />
click Start button &gt; left column, clcik All Programs &gt; Internet Explorer is on the list &gt; when you find it, click it.</p>
<p>Another way to find it is ...<br />
&nbsp;click Start &gt; in the search box, type internet explorer &gt; look up at top left, you'll see Internet Explorer shown at the top &gt; click it.<br />

            <p>I did that to find internet explorer. It comes up with a window that says.: Windows can't open this picture because either photo viewer doesn't support this file format or you don't have the latest updates to windows photo viewer. When I go to all programs,

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Boot sequence set to just Windows Boot Manager and will not run windows from my USB</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I had to return a hard drive to a company as it was malfunctioning. Before this, I created a windows 10 media installation on my flash drive. Later, I did receive my new hard drive and put it in my PC. Then I tried using my flash drive to ultimately
 get into windows when it would not work. I have went into BIOS and done a lot of research to no avail. However, what I did find was that the boot sequence is now only "Windows Boot Manager" and there are no other options. Is there any way to boot my flash
 drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a difference between creating the installation media directly to the Flash Drive, and downloading a ISO to put on a Flash Drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A ISO that is copy\pasted to a Flash Drive will not normally be bootable... The files on it can be used for a "Upgrade" running from within Windows, but not a Clean Install that requires booting...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have the ISO you can put it on a Flash Drive that will be bootable with a free tool called RUFUS... There are multiple options to do this, so I included a screenshot as to what the settings should look like for a UEFI Bios machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just put in the Flash Drive and Browse to the ISO... Select "GPT"... Note that this ISO is for a older version of Windows 10, but the process is the same...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be your best bet... Make sure to select that you are creating this for another machine...</p>
<p>Otherwise it may create one for the machine you are using, and may or may not work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully you will not have a similar problem wioth your Flash Drive being usable...</p>
<p>For a period of time, some Windows 10 builds were trashing Flash Drives when deleting partitions, and\or trying to format them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up needing to use a 3rd party Disk Management utility to clear wht Windows messed up...</p>

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may not be new to you guys, but this issue occurred after the service tech replaced the motherboard of my laptop and did a fresh install of windows on my drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already installed the necessary drivers. Everything seems to be working fine EXCEPT ONE (so far)</p>
<p>The Dell Update Application.</p>
<p>I am also keeping in touch with Dell about this problem. Nothing seems to be working. I read something online about accessing "services.msc" but the things they're doing ARE NOT IN MY SERVICES WINDOW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is Dell Inspiron 14 7447</p>
<p>Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you guys can help me.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Here's what I told the people from Dell:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I partitioned my Hard Drive (Disk C and Disk D) and what I only did was to do a fresh install of Windows on Disk C (Where I have my system files).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So everything was done, all necessary drivers were already installed and everything's working fine EXCEPT for the admin privileges. I'm using an Admin Account (which is the only account I have since the fresh install) but it doesn't act like one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Dell Update" Application is just one of the things that I noticed with this error. Attached is the screenshot of the said error. Any alternate link Dell provides me for this Application won't let me install it.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19952b79-0511-43a7-9cea-a5a288a68902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19952b79-0511-43a7-9cea-a5a288a68902" /></a></p>

    <title>windows 10 crash with kindle for PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tcyuen1  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 crash with kindle for PC</h2>
                    Recently, I moved the content of directory from drive C to drive D, may be due to that, the kindle for PC does not work anymore. I uninstall and reinstall the app but to no avail. During the installation, there is a message that the installation cannot
 find the content directory and then change to D:\document\my kindle content. Sometimes, the application can open and register my account, but when I try to download the digital content in my library, the system will crash. There is message that it will be
 reported to Microsoft. Does any one face similar problem?

            Hi,
<br />
<br />When you suffer the Windows 10 crashes, it is recommended to test the hardware on both of the devices firstly. Maybe you happen to encounter the same issue due to other reasons instead of the Windows 10 Anniversary update.
<br />
<br />1. Check the USB ports and the cable. Make sure the ports and the cable are available for both charge and files transformation.
<br />
<br />2. Test your Kindle on other computers to see if the Windows 10 crash or the blue screen of death still persists. (Note: It is reported that the crashes occur on almost all brands of Windows 10 Anniversary PCs, like Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc., but we still suggest this so that you can make sure which device cause the problem.)
<br />
<br />3. Update your Kindle OS or firmware to make it compatible with the Windows 10.
<br />
<br />
<br />Please let me know, if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards:
<br />Engr. Malik Yasir

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />â€œWe are aware of an issue with a small number of Kindle Voyager and Paperwhite e-Readers causing an unexpected behavior when plugged into Windows 10 devices after installing the Anniversary Update. We are currently working on an update to address this issue.â€
<br />
<br />&lt;Update 9/13/16&gt;
<br />
<br />After the launch of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Microsoft received reports that a blue screen error may occur when connecting one of a small number of specific Amazon Kindle devices:
<br />
<br />Stop Code: SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED
<br />
<br />What failed: partmgr.sys
<br />
<br />The Windows Update released on September 13th for Windows 10 addresses this issue.  If you were receiving a blue screen error when connecting a Kindle device, please install the latest Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />

<h2>            How do I keep &#34;English-International&#34; as my DEFAULT keyboard entry preference in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I want "English-International" to be my default keyboard entry preference. &nbsp; I have upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10. &nbsp;Every time my computer goes into sleep mode, it reverts back to "English-United States." This did not happen in Windows 8. &nbsp;With
 Windows 8 it only reverted when the computer was rebooted. &nbsp;I have tried to follow instructions regarding switching default language preferences in "settings," but there is no language choice called "English International," so I feel that is not the same thing
 as keyboard input preference. The English-International keyboard is perfect for me because I frequently write in English and Spanish, and it is very easy to make the Spanish punctuation marks. &nbsp;Right now, I do have an icon for my input method in the lower
 right hand corner of the task bar. &nbsp;I am able to toggle between English-International, English-United States, and Spanish-Mexico. &nbsp;So with some effort I can get back to English-International. &nbs

            <p>Hello Shari,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, by making a language as a default under Region and language will set it as&nbsp;a default. I mean going to
<strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Time and language &gt; Region and language </strong>and clicking
<strong>Set a default </strong>for a language make it as default system language. Doing this will make a language as a default one and it won't get changed even after restarting your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess there might be some problem with the User Profile causing this behavior. Suggest you to check this issue by setting up another User Profile to see if it makes any difference.
 Once you set up another User Profile, check and see if the same thing happens there.</span></p>

            Hi Yashwanth, &nbsp;Thank you for trying to help me, but you missed the point of my question. &nbsp; As I said before, I am not trying to set a "language" as a default. &nbsp;I am trying to set a "keyboard input method" as a default. &nbsp;There is a difference. &nbsp;I want the
 default language for my keyboard input method to be ENG INTL, which is " United States - International Keyboard." &nbsp;(Please re-read my original post for more details.) &nbsp;If you look at the task bar along the bottom of your laptop, on the right hand side next
 to the date and time, it will tell you your keyboard input method. &nbsp;You can choose from many and have them there so you can toggle between them by clicking on the icon. &nbsp;The default seems to be ENG US, which is English language, United States keyboard. &nbsp;If
 I click on that icon I see my other choices I've picked in the past, ENG INTL (English language, international keyboard), and ESP (Spanish language, Latin American keyboard). &nbsp;I want &n

<p>
</p><p>Yes, setting language will automatically sets the keyboard input method to the desired. Say for example, if you set English-International as your display language, then it will automatically sets keyboard input as International keyboard layout. Moreover,
 after setting language and clicking on the <strong>Options </strong>will give you an option to choose keyboard input language.</p>

I figured out the exact steps to take (from the help through this forum) so if anyone else is in need&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start &gt;Settings &gt; Time and Language &gt; Region and Language &gt; Additional Date Time and Regional Settings &gt; Language/Change Input Methods &gt; Options<br />
<br />
Then delete the unwanted keyboard under the "Input Method" title.&nbsp;
