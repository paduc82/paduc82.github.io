<h2>            Game keeps crashing</h2>
                    
<p>FM4 has crashed a couple of times for me now. I will be in the middle of a race or in the auction house and suddenly it crashes to the dashboard. I also noticed that at the dashboard, it does not recognize the disc, but if I hit A, it does start it. Another
 strange thing is with the FM4 disc in, on the dashboard, it does not list any of my games in the game library, but if I insert a different game, all is fine. It also said that I have 60000 credits for importing my FM3 profile but I could not see them in the
 game.</p>
<p>Couple of things to note here. I downloaded the bonus track and cars in the dashboard before I even played the game. I also imported my FM3 profile. It is possible that I have received a defective disc.</p>

    <title>Debit card on Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeeshan mhaskar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Debit card on Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Visa debit card (Verified by Visa) attached to my Microsoft account at billing.microsoft.com</p>
<p>I am able to purchase apps/games from Windows Store and Windows Phone store</p>

<p>But the problem is that the same card doesn't work on Xbox Live marketplace on 360 and XBL Games app on Windows 8 ( Can't purchase DLCs of Adera and extra content of Gunstringer) although I could easily buy apps / games from Windows Store .. Just in-app
 purchasing is blocked</p>
<p>I am unable to add the card on xbox.com as it says the card is not authorized</p>
<p>I am aware that auto renewal works only on credit card but I have auto renewal OFF in my settings , that might be the reason why card isn't getting authorized</p>

<p>Microsoft you are losing a lot of young customers in developing countries who have a debit card but don't have a credit card</p>
<p>I am unable to purchase content worth almost $30</p>
<p>Btw I stay in India</p>
<p>I hope you solve this problem .. Merging Xbox Live payment system with billing.microsoft.com will also do</p>

<p>Have you checked all the info, payment acct + other, is current, at <a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://commerce.microsoft.com</a> ? <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If so, suggest you contact a Billing Agent. You can choose Option 1 after finding your country's support line: See
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/XBLnumbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/XBLnumbers</a> ...<br />
&nbsp;<br />
but a faster way to speak to a Billing Agent is to go to <a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://xbox.com</a> - sign in there if you can - then go to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?xr=footnav#0:2:5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Yeah man ..</p>
<p>I am buying apps/games on Windows and Win Phone Store for past 4-5 months</p>
<p>If anything would have been wrong , the purchase wouldn't have taken place</p>
<p>Problem only comes while buying from Xbox Live on 360 and from Games app on Windows 8 which apparently use different billing system than commerce.microsoft.com</p>

<p>Hey there Zeeshan! Is this Visa a prepaid card that you load money on and then use? If so, some of these are not compatible with the Marketplace. Some do have the ability to, but you must make sure that both online payments and recurring payments are enabled
 with the provider. This can sometimes be done through a website, but you may need to call them about it. Let us know how that goes, thanks!

<p>It's not a prepaid card actually .It's a debit card which supports online payments .. I think the problem lies in recurring payments which isn't supported by my card mostly . I had called Phone support , they said me to buy a credit card (which isn't possible
 right now coz I am a student ) . Anyways I have Auto renewal OFF on xbox.com .. Xbox Live should atleast allow us to buy Microsoft points which don't need recurring payments unlike XBL Gold . Thanks to this **** billing system I am unable to buy DLCs and other
 in-app purchasing on Games app of Windows 8 which uses XBL billing system .. On Xbox 360 I could atleast buy MS Points prepaid codes but I am helpless when it comes to Games app on Windows 8 which doesn't even support MS Points .. I hope Xbox team changes
 their payment policy and make it relaxed like commerce.microsoft.com</p>

<p>Please don't bump old threads. It's best to create your own if you have a questions. Prepaid codes are generally region locked so there is no guarantee a US card will work in India.</p>

    <title>Setup Has failed to validate the product key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pjn228  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setup Has failed to validate the product key</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to upgrade from Windows 1511&nbsp; 10586.420&nbsp;&nbsp; to later insider previews.&nbsp; I did a clean install of this from a dowloaded iso- overwriting a previous Windows 10 install. I have a valid key which is activated. I even entered it again and reactivated
 it to make sure.&nbsp;I have a valid insider login and have logged in successfully.&nbsp; The computer is listed on my list of recognized ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My insider setting are set to receive preview updates, and I am set on "fast"</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, no upgrades at all have happened and my status says "up to date" </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I downloaded the 14366 Iso from MS ---thinking I could update that way.&nbsp; Opening it from within windows 10 and double clicking startup exe,&nbsp; the program runs, but then stops saying&nbsp; "Something has happened, setup failed to validate this product key.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I can think of, - cleared softwareupdate downloads, deleted softwareupdate.old, restarted updates,
</p>
<p>nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>I know there was a downloadable "fix"&nbsp; for this problem with Windows 8, can someone help me with this?</p>
<p />

            <p>Oh I was so hopeful- So OK, yes I changed the key to my Win 7 Ultimate Key- PYBW3-etc and it accepted it and activated my Win 10 installation - but darn it- still getting the same refusal -when I run setup exe-&nbsp; "Update failed to validate the key..."</p>
<p>I also checked my services- Auto Updates, BIT, Server, Workstation, TCIP/NetbiosHelper, IKE, all running</p>
<p>I used disk cleanup to get rid of all temp files</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Frustrating</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone suggested adding a registry key to HKEY/LOCALMACHINE/Software/MS/Windows/CurrentVersion/Windows update/OSUpgrade&nbsp;&nbsp; add DWORD: AllowOSUpgrade=1</p>
<p>(That did nothing)</p>

            <p>Are you using Windows Live Mail? Just a guess, but it sounds like you have the Reading Pane to the right of the message headers instead of below. If you have the Reading Pane button, click on it or look for View | Layout on the Menu Bar or whatever WLMail
 uses now. I personally do not use that program.</p>

<h3> lisalammert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 email app not sending mail</h2>
                    <p>I just updated to Windows 10 today (8/1/15) and from one of my main comcast mail account, I cannot send any emails out.&nbsp; Also, at the top of the email screen, I have a message that reads "Your Comcast account settings are out-of-date".&nbsp; When I hit the [Fix
 account] button, it brings up the email box with my user account name and a box for the password.&nbsp; When I enter my password, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the advanced settings for the incoming and outgoing server information and the port numbers look like they were uploaded from Windows 8 correctly but the format is not the same as it was in Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how the server information reads in the Windows 10 e-mail box:&nbsp; </p>
<p>incoming server - imap.comcast.net:993:1</p>
<p>outgoing server - smtp:comcast.net:587:1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a second comcast email account I setup with the same server information and it works fine in sending out e-mail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is a Windows problem.&nbsp; I don't want to delete the account because I will lose all current e-mails and e-mails in my folders.&nbsp;&nbsp; Help!!!</p>

            Same problem here. Cox gets the email (using just my first half of my email - no cox.net in the user name) and refuses to send mail. &nbsp;I don't know whether it's a port problem or the user name. &nbsp;I tried using different user names (name for incoming) and
 *** Email address is removed for privacy *** for outgoing) and no joy there. &nbsp;I don't see a way to change the server ports. &nbsp;Anyone know how?

            <p>This problem is not limited to comcast/cox - I've got the same issue with another provider.

<p>
</p><p>After getting in contact with my ISP&nbsp;they investigated a bit and found that the HELO/EHLO entry&nbsp;that the&nbsp;Mail&nbsp;App&nbsp;passes to the server doesn't 100% conform&nbsp;&nbsp;RFC specs.</p>

            I'm having the same problem with Cox. Spent nearly two hours with the techies and final was told they really didn't support Windows 10. I tried putting the port numbers as part of the address (SMTP.cox.net:587:1) but doesn't fix anything. &nbsp;I finally reloaded
 Outlook and ran into another problem. My address book files were converted to the new .contact file format during the upgrade install and the .pst files no longer exist. As a result I have no contact info usable in Outlook. Anyone have an idea on how to change
 .contact files to .pst format. &nbsp;Thanks again Microsoft for another well thought out upgrade!

 on the same computer, it's just the Windows 10 mail app that doesn't work...</p>

            Just an update, Outlook 13 is working fine and I was able to solve the Contacts problem I was having so I'll just ignore the Windows 10 mail app until Cox and Microsoft figure out a solution.

            I understand what the problem is, I don't know how to fix it.&nbsp; The problem comes from the fact that Cox requires your user name, (your email address minus the @cox.net) and password to log into the POP/IMAP server and there's no way to enter this AND the
 email address in the account settings, the email app makes the user name and email address the same.&nbsp; If you enter your user name in the account setup, you can login and get your email, but you can't send anything because the From: field, which cannot be edited,
 contains only your user name which is NOT a valid email address.&nbsp; If you use your email address in the account setup, you cannot login and get your email.&nbsp; Either Cox needs to change and allow your email address to be your user name also or the email app's
 setup needs to be modified to allow you to enter both&nbsp;your user name and your email address as separate items.&nbsp;UPDATE: we have alerted the Mail app product team, they are aware of the problem, and a fix i

            <p>basically mail client is rubbish in windows 10, nobody can get a decent answer from idiots at Microsoft as to why this is happening to loads of people, they recommend using the win 8 trouble shooter for apps, but it doesn't work with win 10 despite them
 saying it does, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>easiest way out of this is to use a decent email client that is much better at handling multiple addresses &amp; that is to download the excellent &amp; free Mozzila Thunderbird, u can unify all accounts to show at once, &amp; make new personal folders to store mails
 you want to keep to refer to later, I used it for years, &amp; have tried to make the new win 10 client work but am now giving up, Microsoft would like us to use all the apps that come free with win 10 &amp; so would I, but they have to work &amp; sadly a number of them
 don't, so its back to the old reliable standards, </p>
<p>WILL MICROSOFT EVER MAKE A COMPLETE PACKAGE THAT WORKS I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so carry on using the reliable 3rd party software, &amp; just use the basics of WIN 10 to run your system,</p>
<p>Win 10 another miserable failure on the basis that not all of it actually works??? oh dear &amp; it seemed so promising.</p>

<h2>            Acer Aspire 7741G-6426 - How to restore my network drivers&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I recently installed Windows 8 Developer Preview over my Windows 7 (pure accident, long story). I reinstalled my Windows 7 again and removed the Windows 8 Developer Preview, but now I have a problem. My Windows 7 does not recognize neither my LAN&nbsp;driver
 nor my WAN driver... I have no way of connecting to the internet to install the drivers. I have an "Acer Aspire 7741G-6426" Laptop. I am unsure what drivers I am suppose to download/install because I cannot figure out what they are. Please help me! I've been
 searching for hours with no luck!<br />
<br />
P.S. I have a Windows.old folder in the root of my drive, if that helps.

    <title>Windows 10 and hotmail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 and hotmail</h2>
                    <p>Ever since installing Windows 10 I have tried using the mail in Windows 10, but it is the biggest piece of **** that Microsoft has put out,</p>
<p>it will delete mail for no reason and it puts ever sender into the mail contact list including DO NOT REPLY and SPAM that slips by.</p>
<p>I use Hotmail from the MSN home page which works better, the problem I am having since installing Windows 10 is that I have a contact with a bad email in it. I try and delete it but I keep getting the message "&nbsp;YOUR REQUEST CAN'T&nbsp;BE COMPLETED RIGHT NOW.
 PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER." I have been trying for 3 days, and I keep getting the same message.</p>

<p>Thank You very much for you quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what you mean by web or app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I launch Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am going to windows 10 mail I click on start and then click on mail. I don't normally use Windows 10 mail, to many quirks, it moves things to the delete folder by its self, and puts every sender in the mail list, it doesn't matter if it's a DO NOT REPLY
 or&nbsp;the rare SPAM that makes it through and I find it really hard to believe that they didn't put in an edit for the mail list. Is there a way to get rid of that worthless piece of garbage?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use Hotmail, I launch Edge which brings my home page which is MSM, when it comes&nbsp;up I click on Hotmail, when in Hotmail I go to people and try and delete the bad entry</p>

<h2>            Error 0X000003EB</h2>
                    Spent two hours on the phone today with HP manufacturer and Dell laptop support.&nbsp; Both techs using remote access were unable to successfully install HP Deskjet D1530 driver to Windows Vista 64 bit o/s.&nbsp; Both claim Windows OS problem.&nbsp; Microsoft website
 says this printer and driver are compatible.&nbsp;&nbsp; HP tech used several workarounds and a temp profile and could still not get it to work.&nbsp; Error message 0X000003EB.&nbsp; I've read the other answers and we tried those but it does not work.&nbsp; Is this a compatible device?&nbsp;
 Any help is appreciated.&nbsp; thank you.

<p><span><span>Hi
</span><span><span>Patricia
 HP</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Steps I would suggest are:<br />
</span></span><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you have mentioned you have installed 64 bit operating system on your<span>&nbsp;
</span>computer, check if you are installing the 64 bit driver for the&nbsp;printer.Check for the manufacturer website</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList?os=2100&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=&amp;cc=de&amp;lang=&amp;product=3568420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList?os=2100&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=&amp;cc=de&amp;lang=&amp;product=3568420</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Try installing the basic drivers related to the printer, and check if the drivers get installed.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Make sure you have logged in as the administrator of the computer and then try installing the driver<br />
</span></span><span><span><br />
4. Try to install the printer in clean boot and check if that will resolve the issue. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as
 a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I understand the free Xbox One game release for this month is NHL 2019. However, in Singapore, we recieved Race the Sun instead. Similarly, previous month, we did not receive the Earth Defense Force game. Can the release worldwide be of similar titles?<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to install other updates?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>KB2833957 is the Security Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 on Windows 7 Service Pack 1.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try installing the update in clean boot state to check if any third party application
 is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
 After troubleshooting, refer to the section “<b>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</b>” to return the computer to a
<b>Normal startup</b> mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>You may also refer to the article to troubleshoot the issue with installing updates:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try to download the update manually and then install it on the computer:</span></p>

<p>If you have that skyrim bundle, that means you have the newest xbox, so you should have the new updated dashboard. So to change the language just fallow these steps. you might need google chrome to translate to help.</p>
<p>1. Turn on your xbox and sign in to your gamertag to get into xbox dashboard.</p>
<p>2. press the RB till you go to all the way to the end of the right, it might say ajuste for "settings"</p>
<p>3. press the icon that shows a xbox 360 standing straight up, which is the first icon. it might say sistema for "system"</p>
<p>4.again press a on the first button that shows a picture of an xbox standing straight up but this time it i might say configuración de la consola for "console settings"</p>
<p>5.you should pick the 3rd button, it should say idioma y la configuración regional for "Language and Locale"</p>
<p>6. pick the first button it should say idioma for language.</p>
<p>7. The first button should be english. just pick it and it should change your xbox language to english</p>

<p>Hello iva1212,<br />
<br />
Its up to the game developer to have multiple language options within their game's menu's. Skyrim does not have any sort of menu option to change the language.<br />
<br />
The way that Xbox LIVE's downloadable content system works is that it will give you the content in whatever region you have your account in. So it seems you purchased this console in the United States, but you live in Mexico and have an account registered in
 Mexico. Since the account region is in Mexico, then any sort of downloadable games you redeem will automatically be in your countries main selectable language, which in this case is Spanish.<br />
<br />
The only way to change the language of an Xbox LIVE account is if you have the option when you follow the instructions given
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/kinect/dashboard-or-hub-in-another-language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>, please look under Change Xbox LIVE language. If you do not have any sort of drop down that lets you change your regions language then unfortunately,
 you'll be stuck with the Spanish version of this game. Microsoft is not able to switch this game out for the English version for you.<br />
<br />
In the future, if you wish to purchase games in English, please make sure that you purchase the games on hard disc as this will give you the best chance of seeing if the games are in English or in another Language. Since you purchased your console in the United
 States all NTSC games should come in English unless otherwise stated.<br />
<br />
Thank you, and sorry for the inconvenience.&nbsp;</p>

Hi</p>
<p><span><span>You may have a corrupted user account.</span></span></p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you tried another mouse?
<br />
<br />Go into Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Mouse device, from Driver tab choose Roll Back, or if not available choose Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />If this doesn't resolve it go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello Guy,</p>
<p>I try some options like this on the post and the problem is available, but the interesting is that the problem is available on some programs like Steam, Notepad and Skype (only old version 7) On the lastest version 8 the problem is gone and this is very
 strange (The problem isn't available on file manager for example). I don't know what the problem with AMD drivers or apps.&nbsp;</p>

            Isolate if the problem is with the mouse by trying another mouse to compare.  Does it do the same thing?  If so  then the problem is the mouse.
<br />
<br />See if there is a tiny Reset button on the bottom of the mouse, 
<br />
<br />change its battery, 
<br />
<br />change it's USB port, 
<br />
<br />uninstall it's driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.

            I try this option, but this is very strange for me that the driver version on my mouse is so old. This is the driver version on my mouse. I will wait for the new Windows update and driver update and I hope that this problem will be resolved soon.I have
 this problem since first Creators Update.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76466bbf-bd36-4799-8068-cb41fde0a64c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76466bbf-bd36-4799-8068-cb41fde0a64c?upload=true" /></a>

<h2>            Family Safety, Web Filtering - Block large list of IP addresses</h2>
                    Is it possible to add a large list of IP addresses to the Block List using a wild card or similar, to prevent access to a web site that uses a very large number of IP addresses?

You could create a rule in your router's firewall settings or else create appropriate rules in the Windows firewall:
