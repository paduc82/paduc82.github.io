    <title>Unlicensed user still receiving emails in Mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unlicensed user still receiving emails in Mailbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanna know what will happen if I removed Exchange Online license on my user but remain to have Office ProPlus license. As far as I know, the Mailbox of that users shouldn't receive any emails. But in my case, it stills receives email when the email
 is sent on the same tenant. Sample below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>User1 (no exchange online license)</p>
<p>User2 (has exchange online license)</p>
<p>Gmail user</p>
<p>
</p><p>User1 can't receive mails from Gmail (which I think right)</p>
<p>User1 can receive mails from User2 (same tenant user) - Is this the right behaviour? Or am I facing some issue here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, we're using AD Connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi KennethBetco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, if you're in cloud-only environment, it's not feasible for the unlicensed user to use email service. Because the mailbox of the unlicensed user will be deleted in Exchange Online server and the user cannot access the mailbox anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you mentioned you're using Azure AD Connect, so do you have on-premises Exchange server deployed in your organization? If so, the mailbox could still exist in on-premises Exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<p>Thank you Marvin for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't have Exchange server on-premise, hence we have Lotus Notes on-premise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why I'm a bit confused why the Mailbox of that user was still receiving mails. As my knowledge it shouldn't be receiving anymore.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi KennethBetco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my test in the lab, I cannot send emails to the user without Exchange Online license and get a Non-Delivery Report. To better understand the situation, I'd like to collect the following information before we process further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How many licenses do the user have? Please capture a screenshot in Office 365 Admin Center &gt; Users &gt; Active User &gt; Product licenses &gt; Edit.</p>
<p>2. Where does the user access his mailbox? In Outlook Web App (OWA), or in Outlook desktop client?</p>
<p>3. Can you <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a> and use the following command to further check his mailbox status?</p>
<p><strong>Get-Mailbox -Identity "&lt;user mailbox&gt;"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Are all internal users able to send emails to this user?</p>
<p>5. What's the type of the mailbox?</p>
<p>6. Could this user send emails to internal users?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi KennethBetco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not familiar with Lotus Notes on-premises environment since it's not provided by Microsoft. And I cannot reproduce this issue because I tested in my Office 365 in&nbsp;<strong>cloud-only</strong> environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, it seems the user mailbox is stored in Lotus Notes and you just forward the email to Office 365. To my view, if the mailboxes are stored in Lotus Notes and the emails are sent from Lotus Notes, it could be an expected behavior
 that the user could receive emails. Because the email is delivered by Lotus Notes email server rather than Exchange server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you have further questions on this issue, I suggest you contact Lotus Notes support to confirm the user mailboxes situation, which may help find the root cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<p>I have the same situation</p>

</p><p>We have a O365 Cloud account hooked up via AD Connect to our local domain controller.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I found the user had left an annoying rule in place and was delivering incoming mail to a group mailbox.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Just to check I sent an email to his unlicensed account and got an auto reply.</p>

<p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay getting back to you since I was out of office. Based on your description, the situation is more complicated since you have both on-premises environment and online environment. In cloud-only environment, after you unlicensed the user,
 it's correct that the user mailbox won't be available. However, the behavior could be different in various environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this scenario, I suggest you post a new thread in our forum and provide more details about your situation. Our engineers will focus on your own issue and provide specific assistance for you.</p>
<p>

    <title>Unable to redeem my Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013 account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexandercaldwell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to redeem my Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013 account</h2>
                    <p>Recently my computer was showing Internet unavailable. I do not know why this happened.</p>
<p>I refreshed my computer which then enabled my access to the Internet, but discovered I could not access my Word and Excel files on my Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013, which I purchase last December.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On trying to get it back I managed to obtain the icon. On clicking this the box saying "Thanks for your interest..." and " Now lets get started" showed up with the choices of
</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy</li><li>Activate</li><li>Try.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>On clicking Activate another box came up asking for my 25 character Product Code, which I entered and clicked on Continue. This revealed another box saying "Add this to an account", which I do not understand and the only way out of this box was to click
 on Redeem Online. </p>
<p>This took me into My Account, but only to say that "Office isn't associated with this account". I do not understand this as my e-mail and password is exactly what I used to register the account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I must explain that the e-mail and password used was new since my original e-mail and password was not recognised and getting me nowhere and an option came up to select a new account. On that I created a new account using the new e-mail and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But no matter which e-mail and password I use I just keep going around in circles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the information on My Account page where the sentence &nbsp;"Office isn't associated with this account", there are 3 choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>"If already activated office sign out then sign in...." (this is what I have selected each time)</li><li>"If not activated use product key......." "Activate Office Now"&nbsp; </li><li>"If you don't have Office you can buy......"</li></ul>
<p>Having always selected the top option of signing out then signing in, I am always returned to the same My Account Page with the above information and 3 choices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone guide me as to what needs to be done to get this Microsoft Office accessible to me for using and accessing my files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alexander </p>

<h2>            Deleted old Hotmail account - now senders receive bounce back emails</h2>
                    Having upgraded my old Hotmail account to a new Outlook address, everything was working fine and my forwarded work emails were arriving, so I decided to delete the old Hotmail address. Since this action, anybody sending me emails to my work address now
 gets a bounce back message form the hotmail address. Their emails are arriving in my Outlook and the actual work address but they are also getting the bounce back in both mail boxes - confusing for my customers and for me and causing many communication issues
 for my business!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community and sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that if you've deleted an email address there will be a prompt that the mailbox for the deleted email address will no longer be available, which is why your&nbsp;customers are receiving a bounce message when sending to your old&nbsp;Hotmail address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly recreate the old Hotmail address as an alias of your new Outlook email address so your customers could resume sending emails to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to this article for more information on how to create an alias in your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/add-alias-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use aliases to add email addresses to your account</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to clarify the issue, when you said 'Their emails are arriving in my Outlook' is it in Outlook.com or Outlook mail client like Outlook 2013?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would also like to ask you to provide us the old Hotmail address and new Outlook address in the private message area so we could check it on our end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi RoseeG,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It‚Äôs my pleasure to help you for your questions. The answer is NO, an unlicensed user does not have any administration rights to manage a licensed user‚Äôs contacts and calendars.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In an office 365 tenant, if a user want to manage other user‚Äôs contacts and calendars, the prerequisite is that this user has been assigned
<strong>a valid license</strong> at first, and then this user must have related access permissions or delegate permissions of other users‚Äô contacts and calendars.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I can hear the drive working when a disc is put in, but it isn't talking to the OS and nothing is showing in Explorer.&nbsp; Have tried manually adding key to registry and the suggested fixes from various forums without success.&nbsp; The drive worked fine in Windows
 8.1 and the 10 Preview was installed as an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thread suggested removing iTunes as a possible fix.&nbsp; The laptop doesn't have iTunes installed on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hi Lana,<br />
<br />
Based on my test, the issue is already fixed in Office Insider Fast builds (Version 1621, Build 7628.1000).<br />
<br />
If you need this feature right now, you can install the Office Insider Fast builds referring to the
<strong>Install even earlier preview builds of Office 2016 (Office Insider Fast builds)</strong> section of the article below:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-Office-365-commercial-customers-can-get-early-access-to-new-Office-2016-features-4dd8ba40-73c0-4468-b778-c7b744d03ead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How Office 365 commercial customers can get early access
 to new Office 2016 features</a><br />
<br />
However, for enterprise use, we suggest you wait for the next release of the current channel, and the fix will be included then.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jiaxing

    <title>Problem with Excel not responding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregorudov‰ç  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Excel not responding</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Excel 2013-32 bit is crashing everytime I try to do something with graphs (e. g. formating os). Sometimes I get "excel is not responding" window, and sometimes I get a message "There is not enough memory available to solve...". If i watch excel.exe in
 task manager, it only uses around 200 MB of RAM max, so that can not be the problem.
</p>
<p>I also tried with Excel 2007 and 2016-64 bit, and I still get the same error. I think there is something wrong with Windows 10 and Office. Was there any bad windows 10 updates recently, which is causing Excel to crash?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My operation system: Windows 10 PRO</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer specifications:</p>
<p>i7 7700HQ 2,8 GHz</p>
<p>32 GB RAM</p>
<p>1060 GTX 6GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response</p>

<p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried online and quick repair, but the problem still remains. I unistalled Excel and reinstalled it and it doesnt work (I tried on Excel 2007, 2013 and 2016).&nbsp; Problem occurs on multiple files, but only on this computer (on other computers there
 is no problem) and only when I try working with graphs. Everything else seems to work perfectly. I created a new file just to test it and when I try doing something with graphs, I get this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So since the file works fine on other computers, there must be something wrong on my excel app. Can there be something blocking it from accessing needed amount of RAM?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all the methodes from your article and it doesnt work. Im using BitDefender. I uninstalled it and tried opening the file and the problem was still there. I checked for malware and nothing seems to pop-up. By scanning for known issues I only get this
 message (You have Microsoft Office Home and Business 2013 installed. It does not support the Information Rights Management feature). Maybe there are some malware infections that malwarebytes doesnt detect.

<h2>            Downloaded excel documents are opening as Read-Only</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am currently using Dropbox for all of my file storage. However when I download the files to edit them offline it automatically opens them as read only and I am unable to edit them.</p>
<p>I have turned off the protected view and am still having this issue.</p>
<p>Is there anything else that can be done?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>hi oliver,</p>
<p>you may try right clicking the file and its folder&gt; properties &gt; untick <strong>
read-only</strong> and click<strong>&nbsp;unblock</strong> if appears &gt; apply &gt; ok to see if you can opened it in edit mode directly.</p>

    <title>Automatically populating a label template with numbers. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scott seifert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatically populating a label template with numbers.</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to automatically fill in an <a href="http://www.avery.com/avery/en_us/Templates-%26-Software/Templates/Labels/Identification-Labels/Multi_Use-Label-36-per-4x6-sheet-5418_Microsoft-Word.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Avery 5418 template </a>with a sequence of numbers. Ideally I'd type the first number into the top left box and it would fill the rest in sequence (3456 -&gt; 3457 -&gt; 3458 and so on). If the template was in the form of a table that would be easy enough but it's
 actually a series of text boxes so I do not know where to start. What I was thinking was to use Excel to automatically generate the document or to create a macro in Visual Basic but I haven't been able to find any resources online on how to do this, specifically.

            mAH is the amount of energy that a battery is capable of storing. So, the higher it is, the longer a battery should last and yes you can use a battery with a higher mAH as long as the voltage is the same and it fits.

<p>I am looking at my battery:&nbsp; Nokia&nbsp; BL-5C&nbsp; 3.7V&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.7V is voltage?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is 1020 mAh a good lasting battery ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>are there better ones?</p>

<p>The BL-5C is a fairly standard battery which I happen to have a lot of experience with because it is also the battery in the 6230i's. It is a good battery and used to last me 3-4 days of normal usage, which is plenty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, 3.7v is the voltage.</p>

<p>re nokia 6263 battery</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next question:&nbsp; <strong>What is the life span for this battery, more or less - given normal use, before replacing the battery or upgrading to another phone&nbsp;?&nbsp;
<u>Battery OK&nbsp;for t</u></strong><strong><u>wo, three&nbsp;years, or .....???</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed lately that the battery charge status goes half-way after a 24 hrs, sometimes 36 hrs. I also noticed it fluctuates depending how long I leave phone&nbsp;on the charger -- short charges, battery performs better in my case though.</p>
<p>I also use the radio Mon-Fri maybe 6 hrs (i.e., at the office) no radio on Sat/Sun, and volume setting for radio is two notches/bars, which I consider to be low.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know on avg, people change/upgrade phones every 18 mos.&nbsp;per what I've been reading.&nbsp; I plan to keep this phone a little longer than avg.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2-3 years? I have a 6230 and two 6230i's, all still on their original batteries. The 6230 must be at least 5 years old now. However, I must admit that I cycle my phones so they don't get used too much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I do is I charge the batteries before it drops below half bars and every couple of months I let it drain. Seems to work for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, don't be a slave to your phone or battery. You've bought is so use it as you wish and charge it as required. If it needs a new battery then so be it. BL-5C replacement batteries are easy get and are quite cheap.&nbsp;</p>

            I have tried it, and to my attempt it only works with the row the name is on. All other information remains in the same place while all other columns and rows are sorted. So lets say I was wanting to sort in descending order having Bob be first in my list.
 The serial number 888888888 remains in the same place while the rest moves to the top of the document.

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Certified technician willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, can you please share a sample workbook via OneDrive or DropBox (or add a screenshot)?
<br />
<br />I'm not sure I corretly understood how data are placed in the sheet.
<br />

            You need something common to keep the rows together. There's no way to 'associate' them in Excel otherwise. So for example with your first record, you need to add a unique identifier to each record (maybe the name) and then ideally a sequence number to keep them in the desired order.
<br />
<br />So for example:
<br />
<br />Name Sequence Address Number Serial Number
<br />Amy         0          11 Right Street xxx-xxx-xxxx0000000
<br />Amy          1          xxx-xxx-xxxx1
<br />Amy         2          xxx-xxx-xxxx2
<br />Amy         3          xxx-xxx-xxxx3
<br />
<br />And then you would sort by Name as the first field, Sequence as the second.

            I need to have a look on your workbook to provide you the right solution.
<br />
<br />Request you to please prepare and upload a sample / dummy file sans confidential / sensitive data to Onedrive and share the link? It will help me to give prompt and high quality solution.

    <title>How to export outlook.live.com Calendar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reviewboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to export outlook.live.com Calendar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I would like to export my outlook.live.com Calendar to a non-Microsoft app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instructions that I have found by searching suggest doing a File -&gt; Export, but when I have selected my outlook.live.com Calendar (tab) I don't have an Export choice in my browser's (Firefox) File menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying this with I.E. I see a File -&gt; Import and Export.... menu item, but the 'Import and Export' wizard appears to only allow me to export
<em>Favorites</em>, <em>Feeds</em>, or <em>Cookies</em>.</p>
<p>Do I mis-understand how to access the Export function?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, has the procedure changed?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any guidance.</p>

            <p>The File&gt;Import &amp; Export advice is for Office Outlook, the mail client you install on your PC. It has nothing to do with Outlook.com's calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log into your calendar and select Options gear&gt;Options&gt;Publish. Right-click the ICS URI and choose "Save target as". This will give you an ICS file you can import into another program, provided that program can import ICS files.</p>

            Unless there is a particular need to convert the files, you can leave them in the existing formats. Office 2016 can seamlessly handle all corresponding Office files from Office 97 onwards, without loss of functionality.

I think the more new devices will come, the more the H.264 will dominate it all.

    <title>Mobile 6.5 contacts saved information. THREE diffrent type of contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonas h&#246;gberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mobile 6.5 contacts saved information. THREE diffrent type of contacts files</h2>
                    In my phone 6.5 in contacts, I see <strong>3 typs of small images</strong> . Saved like "card" on simcard and TWO typs saved on the phone.
<br />
<br />
one pic like the simcard<br />
one pic like a card with a person on the card<br />
one pic like a card with 2 small person more like in front but not on the card. <br />
<br />
I have manage to sync my phone to Ubuntu Evolution but only one type of the contact are sync in to the program.
<br />
<br />
Both card typs have I made my self by taping in the information. But in them that looks like 2person have i stared with name and only email (after filled in with more info).<br />
<br />
Have tested with a contact that works to sync to fill in email. That sync and update information correct<br />
Have tested with a contact that don't work to sync to fill in mobile nr etc. That still don't sync or change the card image.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
What's the kind of diffrens is the card? Why are the different? What is the type "fil" contacts are saved in?<br />
<br />
I haven't find any REAL BIG HANDBOOK of windows mobile that can give me needed information. If any one have like a "WINMOBILE BIBLE" please post a link please.

<p>Greetings Jonas H√∂gberg!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Phone forums!</p>
<p>I'm not quite understanding the problem with the "3 types of small images" versus the "THREE different type of contact files" mentioned in the subject line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you didn't indicate which application on your 6.5 WP device you were using to view the contacts.&nbsp; Typically you can only have one pic per contact in WP 6.5 and Outlook, but then&nbsp;it may be that&nbsp;the inclusion of Ubuntu Evolution in this equation has&nbsp;created
<p>Because you are using Ubuntu Evolution in the equation, I would think that their forums&nbsp;*might* be the more appropriate to ask your questions...</p>

            <p>I also am facing the same issue/bug. This is an app specific issue and that means, the only available solution is to remove and re-install the app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also important to note that the app is INSTAGRAM BETA not INSTAGRAM. Since the app is beta, it will have issues such as these.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also consider using alternative INSTAGRAM apps on the store until this issue is fixed by Instagram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also hit up the REVIEW section of the app and post a review. App developers do use the reviews as a primary way of obtaining feedback.
