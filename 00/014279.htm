<h2>            Someone else&#39;s Facebook profile picture is included when I&#39;m sending emails.</h2>
                    <p>My Outlook account is sending a Facebook picture of someone who formerly had my current email address. My account does NOT have the third party connection option checked. On the third party connection page, the photo of the other person is shown next to
 Facebook and that person's name. How do I get rid of this????? It appears that&nbsp;mine is a common problem and the standard answer is to disconnect your third party connections; however, I do not have that option selected. The offending FB photo is sent even
 if I upload my own photo or have no photos attached. &nbsp;Obviously, I can not alter the other person's FB account settings.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Dhenz</p>
<p>I am having a similar problem with outlook email. I've never had the facebook account. It looks like someone had opend facebook account and used my outlook email address. This facebook account appeared to be suspended, but still, the man's photo image of
 the facebook keeps appearing on the email every time when I send the email to the recipient who is allowing to show public content from third party. The man's facebook photo image and his name written on unknown language are shown under
<strong>Content from third party netowoks page. </strong>If recipient click on "Don't show public content from third party networks"then the facebook photo image will not be shown with the email.
</p>
<p>Under <strong>Profile </strong>an image of my photo is showing but my photo image does not show when I send an email. In my email settings, under
<strong>showing public content</strong>,"Don't show public content from third-party networks is selected.</p>
<p>However, profile image is showing under <strong>sent folder</strong>. Under <strong>
my profiles</strong>, facebook profile is not listed. Please help me to solve this issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Frank</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that you want to set up Outlook mail app as the default mail app on your device. However, this option is not available as of the moment due to the device manufacturer's product limitation. This will still depend to them if they will make this
 option available in the future. Though, you can still forward this as a feature request to our product team as a consideration for future Outlook release. If you think that the app needs some tweaking to make it more efficient, then we highly advise that you
 make a comment in our Feedback page. Our developers are collating suggestions for the improvement of your experience in using Outlook. The features and the visuals of apps are updated with the help of users' feedback. Click this

    <title>Where did the pen attribute&#47;drawing shortcut toolbar go in OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aim9x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where did the pen attribute&#47;drawing shortcut toolbar go in OneNote 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was an avid user of OneNote 2007 during graduate school (I did my M.S. in Aeronautical&nbsp;Engineering and used a ThinkPad x41 tablet to take notes). A major advantage of OneNote is being able to change pen colors, pen weights, draw precise shapes, and insert
 screen clippings.&nbsp; You <em>cannot </em>do this with traditional&nbsp;pencil and paper.&nbsp; When you take notes in engineering classes with OneNote (and possibly many other classes), one of the most frequent things you do is change the pen attributes.&nbsp; This is because
 we are always drawing diagrams, writing and highlighting equations and inserting shapes (for example, we draw a lot of "velocity diagrams" for turbomachinery problems where using different colors and weights helps convey different&nbsp;concepts).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>One of the things I really liked about&nbsp;OneNote 2003/2007&nbsp;was the&nbsp;pen/drawing shortcut toolbar that appeared on the bottom of the page.&nbsp; You could very quickly change pen colors, weights, add shapes, screen clippings, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;In OneNote 2010, MS appeared to
 have dropped these nice external dockable/undockable toolbars for a single "quick access toolbar" and a ribbon interface.&nbsp; To change pen colors, etc, I now have to stop what I'm doing and reach to the "Draw"&nbsp;ribbon just to change something as simple as the
 color of the pen.&nbsp; While it may seem like a minor annoyance, it really adds up when taking lots of notes&nbsp;and frequently changing pen attributes (to the point where I chucked my installation of OneNote 2010 and went back to OneNote 2007.&nbsp; Thank God I hadn't
 taken that many notes with it&nbsp;before I relized what a pain it&nbsp;became.) There isn't even a right-click shortcut menu that allows you to change the pen attributes.&nbsp; In addition, it also appears that there is no way to move the "quick access toolbar" to the bottom
 of the page either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless I missed something, I would politely ask MS to implement the following changes (either via an update or maybe the next version of OneNote):</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The ribbon is nice but give us back our custom toolbars.&nbsp; Allow us to place toolbars&nbsp;anywere on the display we want.&nbsp; The ribbon is not the answer to everything.&nbsp; For exampe, if I want to place the contents of the "Draw" ribbon in a nice toolbar on the
 bottom of the page for quick access to pen tools, I should be able to do so.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Allow users the option of moving the entire ribbon to the bottom of the page (or even the left and right sides of the page)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Give us the ability to add our pen toolbar to the quick access toolbar, and allow us to move it anywhere we want.&nbsp; Merely allowing us to move the quick access toolbar to the top and bottom of the ribbon doesn't cut it.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Add a pen/drawing shortcut menu to the right-click menu.</p>

    <title>Serious Battery Drain Lumia 640 LTE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 88three  say:</h3>
<h2>            Serious Battery Drain Lumia 640 LTE</h2>
                    <p>One of the biggest battery hogs on my Lumia 640 LTE, used to be the messaging+skype app for Windows 10 Mobile but with their separation then introduction of the Skype Preview app, that became a thing of the past. Microsoft's Edge browser, however, has persisted
 in spectacularly draining most of the juice on my phone ever since the big upgrade and I can't figure out why.<br />
I'm sharing these screenshots of my phone's battery usage monitoring info and maybe you guys can tell me if this is normal or something's wrong somewhere. I've tried everything from soft and hard resets, never allowing Edge to run in the background, changing
 to the dark theme for the phone and disabling a whole bunch of apps. The&nbsp;ONLY app that consumes double digit percentage numbers in terms of drain is&nbsp;SPECIFICALLY Edge<br />
I'm constantly on the phone, mostly shuttling back and forth between the Groove, Twitter, Instagram, Windows Central and Edge but why is it ONLY Edge that seriously drains the battery?<br />

<p>I've tried this a few times before ... Reset it back to Denim (Update 2) then started afresh without restoring from a back up. Also, every time there's a cumulative update, the phone successively updates to the latest version then I reset it without restoring
 from a back up and start afresh. For the bunch of times that I've done this, the result is always the same: Edge sucks the heck out of my battery (and yes, I've used the feedback app to voice this concern before)</p>

<p>I'm sorry but have you even gone through my original post? There's just ONE app that's draining my battery at a very unusual rate and that's Edge. As the screenshots show, in one week of use, JUST THAT ONE APP uses 70% of my battery; the next app accounts
 for only 7%. I'm&nbsp;constantly on my phone and make&nbsp;pretty heavy use of it. Most of my interactions end up with a browser session because I usually need to look up something or the other and that's where Edge gets me. I'm constantly going back and forth from
 Twitter to Instagram to Windows Central to MSN News and eventually Edge, so why is it the ONLY ONE that drains my phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've taken this phone through more soft and hard&nbsp;resets than I care to remember, gone&nbsp; back to 8.1 then started the upgrade process all over again a bunch of times but the end result is always the same. Internet Explorer on 8.1 DOESN'T have the same effect
 so what gives?</p>

</p><p>I've&nbsp; reset the phone quite a few times back to Denim (update 2) and everything runs smooth. In fact, I get two days of moderate to intense use on a single charge EVERY TIME. Like I said before, Internet Explorer on 8.1 DOES NOT have the same results as
 edge on 10. I don't even bother with the battery saver or background apps on 8.1 and just leave everything at the default values with no problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was a hardware issue, shouldn't battery drain be a little more insane for various apps and not just one? What kind of hardware issue would it even be in the first place that would cause just one app to drain 80% of the phone's battery all on its own?
 If this persists, my battery lifespan will get affected and&nbsp;I will end up having to get a new one (something I don't plan on doing since it too might suffer the same fate;&nbsp;I'd rather just get another phone from a different ecosystem)</p>

<h2>            Outlook Live is NOT secure</h2>
                    I would like to know when the issue of Outlook Live is NOT secure will be fixed? I have tried virtual help no help there, I talk to a young lady who told me that it was alright nothing will happen I had nothing to worry about or use inprivate, then I sent
 a message to support and a young man called me back and told me the problem will be fixed in 3 days. Well more than that have went by and nothing is fixed. I sent another message today and someone was suppose to call me back in 197 minutes well those minutes
 went by and no one called. What is it that Microsoft support don't want to help is it because I have the free email??? Will someone please help me with this problem???

            I dont know when it will be fixed - they are aware of the problem. The problem is the sender is linking to images on an http server. Outlook.com itself is secure and remains secure - but because of the way the pages load, the url doesn't update when you switch messages and the not secure message doesn't go away.

            Thank you lc28 for the detailed information. Given that its happening in different browsers there is something a bit more going on here... a few scenarios:
<br />
<br />1. You have an extension in Edge and Chrome that is injecting code in your viewing, this will cause a perfectly fine secure website to warn you because of the local code being injected by the extensions. The way to test this is to disable all extensions/add-ins in your browser settings then see if it help.
<br />
<br />2. Your ISP is injecting code .into your browser session - this could be a banner, or something similar and will be reported as not secure even though the site itself is secure
<br />
<br />I can't confirm this is what is going on, but I can assure you the sites you are visiting are secure but additional code/ads/frames added in by a 3rd party may not be.
<br />
<br />Some background info here (links to a 3rd party website):

            No worries, I completely understand. While I cannot see your computer, I'd almost guarantee its something that your ISP is adding in. Now lets say that is what is going on:
<br />
<br />1. It's low risk as its between you and your ISP who provides the internet connection. Even if its not HTTPS, I don't think this is a huge risk for you.
<br />
<br />2. I'm certain your experience on most modern websites (like Microsoft) are indeed https. This means everything in transit is encrypted. 
<br />
<br />3. If you are using WIndows 10, have Windows Defender enabled (by default it is) and you keep your computer up to date from a software perspective, you are in good hands.
<br />
<br />Here is some more information about Defender and what it does for you in Windows 10:

<h2>            I deleted my Outlook.com account but can&#39;t recreate - it says address is taken</h2>
                    I created a new Outlook.com account about a week ago but then deleted as several details were wrong it so I could set it up correctly.<br />
I quickly tried to re-setup the account but the system said the address is taken but at the logon prompt it suggests it isn't taken.<br />
I have waited a week in case there is some sort of timer to wait for but still no go.<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />

            <p>Patel, thanks for your input, but actually I think you've misunderstood what I'm trying to do.

<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to count non-blank entries in column&nbsp;<strong>L</strong> if the entry in column

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I tried modifying your suggested formula, but it returns the count for only the ACTIVE projects:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">=COUNTIFS(PROJECTS!$J:$J,{"ACTIVE","COMPLETED"},PROJECTS!$L:$L,"&lt;&gt;"&amp;"")</p>

            <p>teylyn, I like your solution - I only needed to include the PROJECTS! work sheet name for the L:L range...</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM(COUNTIFS(PROJECTS!$J:$J,{"ACTIVE","COMPLETED"},PROJECTS!L:L,"&lt;&gt;"))</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess this formula is basically solving for the sum of ACTIVE projects with L:L entries not blank and COMPLETED projects with L:L entries not blank, but is more compact than my solution. I like it. And it works correctly.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the history of this case I have a "slightly" different view. Anyway...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you're looking to simplify your initial formula elegantly and by elegant you mean at least no duplication. Other criterion?</p>
<p>Asking as I don't like to guess + I saw something that didn't makes sense at all recently meaning that what does isn't necessarily what is desired/implemented. And BTW duplication doesn't necessarily mean inefficiency...</p>

            Hi Maharith,
<div><br />
<div>Your question is a bit too vague to answer. Please explain more about what you mean by "combine". Are you wishing to attach one table to the other, insert various columns or rows, or are you wishing to add content from one table cell to another?</div>

            If they are identical then just select all rows and columns of one of them and click Cut.

            Still guessing here because you're telling us absolutely nothing definitive...<br />
<br />
In all probability one or both of the tables has been <i>dragged</i> or directly has had its
<b>Text Wrapping</b> property set to <b>Around</b>. Floating tables cannot be merged with other tables.<br />
<br />
Make sure that the <b>Text Wrapping</b> property for <i>both</i> tables is set to None, then do as I suggested before.<br />

            <p>Hi Rob9494,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your post, you are receiving error 80C805E2 when trying to sync the primary Microsoft Account on your Samsung Ativ S.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, please sign in to the following link and check if you have Two step verification turned on, if it is on, please temporarily turn it off and try syncing your phone again:</p>
<p><a href="https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, on the phone go to Settings &gt; Backup. Please turn off the Text message backup, then restart your phone, and check if the primary Microsoft Account is syncing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know how you get on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br />
Sheena M.</p>

    <title>Cannot install Windows Mobile Device Center on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c11higgins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install Windows Mobile Device Center on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello!</span></p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My company recently purchased a rather important software package and I've been tasked with rolling it out. &nbsp;Everything went smoothly until it was time to install an instance on my laptop running Windows 8.1. &nbsp;It was stated &nbsp;that before I install the software,
 that I need to install ActiveSync. &nbsp;So no problem, here's the disk, let's install it. &nbsp;No bueno! &nbsp;So I figure, oh it's just an old program, maybe there's a newer one. &nbsp;There is, the&nbsp;Windows Mobile Device Center. &nbsp;So I go to the download page...First off, I
 can't ever get the "validation tool" to run and generate a code for me to download it, so I have to depend on my Google-fu to find another copy out there in the wild. &nbsp;So I finally get the x64 version of&nbsp;Windows Mobile Device Center, I run the program, and
 all I get is a flash of the installshield wizard starting to run. &nbsp;Literally I see the screen for one second if not less, then it goes away. &nbsp;I then think maybe I could get the x86 version to run. &nbsp;No dice. &nbsp;That program actually runs but tells me that it's
 not supported by my system (x86 vs x64).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I reached out to the software company but their only advice was to "not use any mobile devices with the software until Microsoft comes out with an update". &nbsp;I am not sure how to hold out hope for a program that was made for Vista to get an update for Windows
 8.1 anytime soon...especially since according to this page&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft%20Windows%20Mobile%20Device%20Center&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;ModelOrVersion=6&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft%20Windows%20Mobile%20Device%20Center&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;ModelOrVersion=6&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1</a>&nbsp;It
 should be working just fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any advice for me? &nbsp;I'm going to start troubleshooting installation issues. &nbsp;I've dealt with them before, but Windows 8 and 8.1 sometimes act like completely different beasts than what I'm used to using. &nbsp;For the record, I've installed
 all of this on my Windows 7 machine and it's working fine. &nbsp;However, I am required to run 8.1 on my primary and I don't want to keep switching back and forth, as this software is going to be one of my daily duties.</div>
                </div>

            Hello. It would be best to get the MS download. The validation tool can be tricky. Have you used different browsers? You can try running the program in compatibility mode or run as administrator.

<div><br />
<div>What functionality of WMDC will be using? It has lost some functionality in Win 8. There is pretty much zero chance of MS updating WMDC since it is mainly used for the defunct Windows Mobile OS.&nbsp;</div>

            Ok, so I was able to get past the validation tool by completely enabling every Active X control there was, adding everything Microsoft to my trusted sites, and I also had to pray a little.
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, I have the same issue that I had before. &nbsp;The initial screen just flashes for a second and then disappears.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&gt; &nbsp;What functionality of WMDC will be using?</div>
<div><br />
<div>The software we purchased uses mobile devices to scan assets and then sync up with the host database.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have absolutely zero hope of the WMDC tool being updated in any way, as so much has changed since it was released. &nbsp;All I can hope for is that I can get it installed somehow, as I know others have done. &nbsp;Hopefully someone can get me there!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, I'd like to add that I've ran this tool:</div>

<div>and it made no difference.</div>

            Hello. I assume you are using a Windows Mobile bar code reading device. That sync may still work in Win 8. The Outlook sync functions don't seem to anymore. &nbsp;So installing setup in compatibility mode did not work? What happens when you connect the device
 USB? Make sure you disable all security software.&nbsp;

            <p>I have just successfully downloaded and installed WMDC 64bit on my Windows 8.1 machine.</p>
<p>Initially it seemed to install, and appeared on my start screen, but when I tried to run it nothing happened.</p>
<p>The issue I was having was the registry permissions. I have previously had the same issues with windows 7.</p>
<p>These are the steps I took</p>
<p>1. uninstall WMDC&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Open the registry and navigate to: </p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion</p>
<p>Look at the permissions make sure the local machine Administrators group AND the TrustedInstaller have FULL permissions.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Click on the advanced button and change the owner to the administrators group (you will need to be in this group)</p>
<p>4. Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permissions (I got some error message here but never mind that)</p>
<p>5. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Svhost</p>
<p>6. Look at the permissions make sure the local machine Administrators group AND the TrustedInstaller have FULL permissions. (previously the trustedInstaller did not have permission to this folder for me)</p>
<p>7. Re-install WMDC</p>
<p>8. Plug in you Mobile device, and it should now fire up WMDC and&nbsp;connect</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

            As I said, Outlook will send to any valid email address. It is telling you that you are not entering a valid email address, and you aren't.

<h2>            How Can I Tell &#40;in VBA&#41; if a Shape Can Have a 3D Format&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>A macro of mine is looping through a bunch of shapes on a slide, giving them a 3D look.&nbsp; The line of code below bombs when I get to the "msoShapeCan" shape.&nbsp; The error thrown is "Run-time error '-2157024809 (80070057)': The specified value is out of range.</p>
<p>theShape.ThreeD.BevelTopType = msoBevelCircle</p>
<p>I assume I get this error because the "msoShapeCan" cannot be given a bevel.&nbsp; What, in VBA, tells me that this is the case?&nbsp; Is there something like a "HasThreeD" property?&nbsp; I want to bypass all the shapes that are not "3D Ready".</p>

    <title>Power Map - is mapping custom areas possible&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexis kiteos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Map -  is mapping custom areas possible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been asked to investigate if it is possible to map custom areas in Power Map using a KML file. I've done quite a bit of internet searching and haven't been able to find a clear answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The end goal is to map geographic areas our sales branches deal with (using a file created by our IT department) to use as a layer in Power Map reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've got so far. I found a file online with coordinates for UK postcodes where one column in the table has many longitude and latitude coordinates mapping points to make a polygon of the area. The file lists just the first part of the postcode,
 e.g. EN1, EN2, N1, AL7 etc etc. I wanted to try mapping this first as a test before IT allocate resources to creating a sales branch map. &nbsp;If you use Power Map to map the UK postcodes just based on the first parts of the post code, it's pretty good, but not
 perfect, especially on very small areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done it using Bing Maps and Google Maps, but wanted to be able to do it in Excel so that I could create custom reports with data from various sources easily and quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if anyone knows if you can create customer areas within Power Map using your own coordinates, and if so how, your help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alexis</p>

            I think I've found the answer, although it wasn't the answer I had hoped for...<br />
<br />
I am trying to create custom 'region charts'.<br />
<br />
I just tried to set latitude / longitude coordinates as regions, and got an error which said...<br />
<br />
"Region charts work with Country/Region, State/Province, County or Zip/Postal Code data."<br />
<br />
So it seems you can only map regions using recognised region names. It's a shame, because when you get down to postcode level it doesn't map too well.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it might be included in future versions, as to me it would be incredibly useful.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for your input.

            You should should be able to do it.  Look for the little ball in the bottom right corner of the selected cell. Click and drag it.
<br />
<br />Here are some articles on auto fill
<br />
<br />AutoFill Won't Work as Expected 
<br /><a href="http://excelribbon.tips.net/T011634_AutoFill_Wont_Work_as_Expected.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://excelribbon.tips.net/T011634_AutoFill_Wo...</a> 
<br />AutoFill is a great tool for filling cells with data. What do you do when it doesn't work like you expect, however? Here's some ideas to examine
<br />
<br />Clean data quickly with Flash Fill 
<br /><a href="http://chandoo.org/wp/2015/08/01/introduction-to-flash-fill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://chandoo.org/wp/2015/08/01/introduction-t...</a> 
<br />Excel has many powerful &amp; time-saving features. Even by Excel’s standard, Flash Fill is magical. Introduced in 2013, Flash Fill is a rule engine to Excel’s fill logic. Every time you type something in a cell, Excel will try to guess the pattern and offers to fill up the rest of cells for you. That is some serious time saving magic. Let’s understand what Flash Fill is and few sample use cases.
<br />
<br />Copying Cells to Fill a Range <a href="http://excel.tips.net/T002353_Copying_Cells_to_Fill_a_Range.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://excel.tips.net/T002353_Copying_Cells_to_...</a> 
<br />Excel provides two really helpful shortcuts you can use to fill a range of cells, either horizontally or vertically. These shortcuts will help make you r data-entry tasks a breeze.
<br />
<br />Enhanced Filling

<br />Using the AutoFill feature of Excel is very handy. If you want to expand the utility offered by the feature, all you need to do is change how you click the AutoFill handle.

                    <p>I need to add a formula to excel to show variance on actual versus budget and have it show as a positive or negative.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Actual is approx. 120000 vs budget of 204000</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using =(budget/actual)-1 I'm getting an answer of 69%, but I need to show this as a&nbsp;negative as actual is lower than budget, but can't work out how to do this?</p>

            <p>If you use =1-budget/actual with your numbers (120,000 and 204,000) you get -70%.</p>
<p>This is the number you asked for but is it meaningful?</p>
<p>Suppose actual = 50 and budget = 200 (or 50,000 and&nbsp;200,000)&nbsp;then the formula gives you -300%
</p>
<p>But what does this mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with actual = 50 and budget = 200&nbsp;,&nbsp;=actual/budget-1 gives -75% tell us we have 75% of the budget left - seem more meaningful to me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 120,000 and 204,000 it returns -41.2%. I have 41.2% of my budget unspent</p>
<p>And if actual = 500,000 while budget = 200,000 it give +50% -- we have overspent the buget by this amount</p>

            The text entry form field that you can use in "legacy" protected forms does not support any formatting that isn't applied to the entire field.<br />
<br />
If all your users have at least Word 2007, you can use content controls instead of legacy form fields, and in that case you can use a "rich text" content control that supports the same kind of formatting as in ordinary text. To lock the parts that are outside
 the content controls, select the whole document, click the Group button in the Controls section of the Developer tab, and click Group in the dropdown menu.<br />
<br />
If a form using content controls is opened in Word 2003 (with the Compatibility Pack applied), the controls will be treated as ordinary text and the grouping/locking won't be supported. For those users, you'll have to stick with a legacy form, and you can't
 have formatting in the fields.<br />
