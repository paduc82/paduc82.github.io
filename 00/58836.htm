<h2>            Web Cam Videos not playing</h2>
                    <p>Having upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 web cam videos are no longer playing in any media. Packard Bell are not supporting my particular notebook type&nbsp;and say that whilst Windows 10 will load, not all functions may work properly.</p>
<p>The problem appears to be around MP4 format and I get an error code 0xc00d36b4 in the Films &amp; TV media option.</p>
<p>I have also had the AMD Radeon HD6310 driver update fail numerous times in automatic updating in Windows Defender since the upgrade.</p>

            <p>Having re examined the Windows defender&nbsp;history I have found that the AMD driver was in fact uploaded and installed at the 5th attempt. It would seem to me that this driver update is the cause of the problem. As it is the latest driver AMD are saying there
 is no new update.</p>
<p>I have seen from other categories on this platform, and other sources, that I am not alone in this problem and that there isn't currently a solution and neither Microsoft nor AMD&nbsp;appear to be&nbsp;addressing it.</p>

            Having experimented a bit more I now find that .jpg photos won't open using the new "photos" app with messages about "codec" incompatibility or the app not opening. Photo's will however still open using either Microsoft office picture manager or Windows
 Photo viewer.

<p>Yesterday Microsoft automatically downloaded and installed&nbsp;a new version of the AMD Radeon HD6310 graphics driver. On checking I am now able to play videos recorded on my web camera. Have just checked and I can also play the Windows 10 "Get Started" tutorial

<h2>            I have no sleep option on my PC running windows 10.</h2>
                    I have a Dual Boot 32 bit PC running Windows 7 and windows 10.&nbsp; When I boot windows 7 I have all of the power options that have been available for years, like sleep and hibernate, etc.&nbsp; But when I boot windows 10 I don't have any power option for sleep
 on the settings screen.&nbsp; Also when I hit the power icon in win 7 it asks if I want to shut down, sleep, restart, etc.&nbsp; But the power icon in win 10 doesn't have a tab for sleep. I have the latest 10 Creator version and was hoping that would fix the problem,
 but it didn't.

<p>Thank you for the information. Following up on this, it's possible that the adapter does not support the newer versions of Windows. Replacing it may help if you are using a desktop computer. Additionally, we'd like to ask a few more questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Before updating to the latest Windows Update, did it work with Creators Update?</li><li>Have you followed the <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_personal/how-to-enable-hibernate-and-sleep-in-power-options/2bca761d-a35a-4d07-9e7b-dc2c8f2330b3?auth=1">article</a></strong> mentioned above on
 how to put back the Sleep option on your computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, you can check your network adapter by going to <strong>Device Manager</strong> &gt;
<strong>Network adapters</strong>. Right-click the item below the Network adapters and select
<strong>Properties</strong>. Click on the <strong>Power Management</strong> tab and uncheck
<strong>Allow this device to wake the computer</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</p>

<p>Hey Sprockevis,</p>
<p>The problem description is very generic here. Providing the exact error message would have helped us in giving a clear cut resolution. If there’s any specific error message, please post it so that we can focus on the same.</p>
<p>In the meantime you may follow these basic troubleshooting steps for Supreme Commander. The steps should more or less be the same for other games concerned unless the issue&nbsp; is specific to the game in which case we’ll need the exact error message or code.</p>
<p>Supreme Commander is compatible with Windows 7 and so is Grand Theft Auto 4. Hence this isn’t a compatibility issue but points to something else. As for Empire Earth 2, there’s no information with us as in whether it is compatible with Windows 7. As such
 you may gather this information from the game vendor.</p>
<p>To eliminate commons issues that can hamper game installation, please follow these steps.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;When you insert the Strategic Command CD in your CDROM drive, does it initiate the installation 1. process?</p>
<p>If the setup doesn’t start at all, or if you are using the AutoPlay menu to install the game, try executing the
<strong>setup.exe</strong> or <strong>install.exe</strong> directly from the CD.&nbsp; If the setup halts part way through the install process, it could be a dirty or scratched CD. Cleaning the CD and reinserting it will verify the status of the CD.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Verify your computer meets the requirements of the game.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Run the game as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Right-clicking on the executable file and selecting “<strong>Run as Administrator”</strong> should be good enough for this.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;Download the latest Direct X from Microsoft website to eliminate any issue related to Direct X.</p>
<p>Here’s the link you can download from.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/resultsForProduct.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;productID=9C954C37-1ED1-4846-8A7D-85FC422D1388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/resultsForProduct.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;productID=9C954C37-1ED1-4846-8A7D-85FC422D1388</strong></a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Disable User Account Control as this can interefere with the installation.</p>
<p>Refer: <br />
<strong><br />
What are User Account Control settings?<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/What-are-User-Account-Control-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/What-are-User-Account-Control-settings</strong></a></p>
<p><br />
6.&nbsp;Other programs running in the background can cause issues with the program install.<br />
Disable your antivirus and other security software installed. Alternatively, you may choose to keep your computer in clean boot state to ensure that there is no hindrance from third party services.</p>
<p>Refer: <br />
<strong><br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></a></p>
<p>Once the installation completes, keep yourself up to date with the latest patches.</p>
<p>Here’s where you get the updates for Supreme commander:<br />

    <title>Disk manager shows a restore partition of 999 Mb even after clean - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beard57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk manager shows a restore partition of 999 Mb even after clean install</h2>
                    <p>I notice that in computer management, disk manager, my Surface Pro 128 is showing a labelled "restore" partition of 999 Mb even after a clean install. The other restore partition of approx. 700 Mb,&nbsp;that was created during install, has been backed up and
 removed which caused that partition to be removed from disk management, however the 999 Mb restore partition remained. Can any one tell me why it is there and how to get rid of what looks like almost a Gb of wasted storage.</p>
<p>The first time I backed up the computer and deleted the restore it created a new partition of approximately 700 Mb on drive D instead of adding the recovery space to C Drive! It actually created a new drive designation and assigned the D designation! The
 second time I did a compete format and restore the removal of the restore partition integrated correctly to C Drive, but the mysterious 999 Mb restore partition remained. I have run "clean system files"&nbsp; and no change.</p>
<p>The 999 Mb partition will not allow me to do anything with it in disk manager (only Help).</p>

            <p>hm thats odd - I've installed about 11 machines with 8/8.1 and the option to remove partitions, yielding unallocated space then the option to format that unallocated space works fine here.&nbsp;And it wouldn't be the extra space an SSD reserves to swap with worn
 out bits. A bit stumped here then, sorry -_-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beside the point but when you do format, use the new GPT method - more reliable ^^</p>

<h2>            Screenshot take ages to upload</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please tell me why it's taking my Xbox One X about 30 minutes to upload a simple screenshot to Xbox live? My connection is wired, my&nbsp;upload speed on average is 18.48 Mbps and my NAT type is open with IPv4 &amp; 6.&nbsp;This has been going on for months now and is starting to get really annoying. Especially when friends upload their screenshots within seconds. I mean, at this point even my game clips which are 100+MB are uploading quicker than a screenshot. Something's clearly not right.</p>

Does that happen with screenshots from any game? <br />2. Has your console always taken this long to upload screenshots specifically, or did this start recently?&nbsp;</p><p>3. Do you see any difference if you test by having a different profile attempt to upload a screenshot on the same console/connection?&nbsp;<br /></p>

<h2>            Low volume Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently just bought my Surface Book 2 directly from the manufacturer so I suppose nothing should be damaged.</p>
<p>However, my Surface Book 2 volume is significantly much smaller compared to my other laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried and updated the '<span> Reatek </span>High Definition Audio (STT)' and trouble shoot the problem</p>
<p>but the results came back as nothing wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not increase my level above the 100% level which is still really soft to listen to and it got worst with online recorded videos.</p>
<p>Could anyone please offer a resolution?&nbsp;</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I hope I can help you today
<br />
<br />Check the sound settings and change it if necessary. This is the way to review and define the sound output device:
<br />
<br />Go to Start and then select Settings&gt; Sound.
<br />
<br />Do one or both of the following actions:
<br />
<br />In the Sound section, select the device you want to use for playback (for example, Surface built-in speakers, external speakers or a helmet) as the output device. When this device is selected, it is also set as the default.
<br />
<br />In the Input section, select the device you want to use for recording (for example, the built-in or an external microphone) as the input device. When this device is selected, it is also set as the default.
<br />
<br />If you are using a communications application, such as Skype, you may want to set up your communications device separately when using speakers or a helmet. This is the way to set up a communications device:
<br />
<br />Go to Start, and then select Settings&gt; Sound&gt; Sound control panel.
<br />
<br />Do one or both of the following actions:
<br />
<br />Select the Playback tab, choose the device you want to use for playing communications (for example, the built-in Surface speakers, external speakers or a helmet) and then select Set as the default communication device.
<br />
<br />Select the Record tab, choose the device you want to use for recording communications (for example, the built-in microphone or an external one) and then select Set as the default communication device.
<br />
<br />if this does not work I will leave this link with more information

</p><p><span>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>May I know what Skype application are you on?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may check the links below to identify if you're using the classic version of Skype for Windows Desktop or the new Skype version on Windows 10 (Skype UWP) application.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Classic version of Skype:</strong>

<p>
</p><p>You may also update the drivers on your computer and uninstall and reinstall Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Updating drivers:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Quit Skype first.</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select the Windows logo/Start button, type Device Manager, and select it from the list of results.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select Update Driver.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select Search automatically for updated driver software.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
If these steps don't work, try reinstalling the driver:<span>&nbsp;</span>Open Device Manager, right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device, and select Uninstall.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Restart your computer afterwards.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Uninstalling and reinstalling Skype:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure that Skype is no longer running. (<strong>Or you may simply press Ctrl Alt Esc, click Skype and then click End Task</strong>).
</li><li>On your keyboard, <strong>press the Windows key and R key simultaneously</strong>. Then, the run windows will appear.&nbsp;
</li><li>On the run window, type in <strong>appwiz.cpl</strong> and hit enter. </li><li>Look for Skype and uninstall it. Then,&nbsp;download the latest version of Skype from this link:
<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a><br />
After completely uninstalling and re-installing Skype, try to make a call and share sound system.</li></ul>

<h2>            Time and date stuck in 2088</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got an old Acer laptop recently upgraded to Windows&nbsp;10. The&nbsp;date is stubbornly set at&nbsp;2088, the month and time is wrong also, and not correctable in settings, as you can only scroll back as far as 2058, unless you spend 5 minutes getting to 2015 month
 by month. The computer reverts to 2088 on start up, even if you correct the date in the bios. Its a big problem as Chrome won't work without the correct date, and my anti-virus won't update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated!</p>
<p>

            <p>I have the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Windows 7</p>
<p>2. No recent changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Arc touch mouse works perfectly fine when connected to USB port on laptop.&nbsp; When I keep the transceiver
<strong>in the same port on the laptop</strong>, and connect to the docking station, the mouse stops working.</p>
<p>4. No error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Popping out the batteries does 'fix' it.&nbsp; This isn't a solution.&nbsp; I have one ARC at work and one at home.&nbsp; They are both having this issue.&nbsp; I have had three replacement keyboards.&nbsp; All have the same issue.&nbsp; I have upgraded PC's from W7 to W10 and still
 have the same issue.&nbsp; This is a HARDWARE on the ARC keyboard.&nbsp; This issue is not your home computer, not your usb dongle, not your OS.&nbsp; Microsoft need to accept responsibility and either fix this or replace the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you put the batteries after a 'reboot' of the keyboard, listen carefully to the keyboard, you get a set of high pitched tones.&nbsp; I assume this is part of the 'reboot' process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A 'reboot' of the keyboard isn't acceptable.&nbsp; Fix it Microsoft.</p>

</p><p>Good guess, yes, this is a Surface Pro 3. I'm not seeing BSOD, though it always reboots when I'm not using it. That differs from most of the replies in the other thread where people are seeing reboots while they are working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also interesting is that I mostly keep my Surface docked, so I imagine it would be using the Ethernet connection instead of the wireless. Would the wificlass.sys driver still cause BSODs in this case? Would I be able to test this by disabling the wireless
 adapter and seeing if the reboots stop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears from the other thread that people have upgraded the firmware on their routers to fix the issue. Is this the recommended solution to the problem? Is this is only solution/workaround available?</p>

</p><p>Just because a dock might (or might not) be using Ethernet does not mean that the wifi driver isnt also loaded and it was the cause of the crash.&nbsp; Your idea of disabling the wifi adapter is a good one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know relatively nothing about PRO3 but there were just too many co-incidences.&nbsp; There is a wizard here regarding the surface.&nbsp; Her name is Barbara Bowman.&nbsp; Search for her and the wificlass and you should be able to find all the relevant data.</p>

            <p>I have been experiencing this very same thing lately just this past week or so and it happens without warning it seems to collect data and say it will reboot but it sits at blue screen and doesn't restart and then gets extremely HOT with fan running at full
 speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my answers to your original questions with additional devices that are usually attached to SP3:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. 15.68.3073.151, 12/22/2014</p>
<p>2. LinkSys 1900AC</p>
<p>3. No domain joined</p>
<p>4. SP3 Win 8.1 Pro initially installed when I purchased</p>
<p>5. Hyper-V enabled but initially for weeks it was not enabled and still had issue</p>
<p>6. All update-to-date, no docking station</p>
<p>7. Plugged and unplugged from external monitor via HDMI</p>
<p>8. MS Bluetooth Arch Mouse</p>
<p>9. External SSD drive plugged in and unplugged to USB 3.0 port</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting critical as I bought this to be my work laptop/tablet in place of a heavy bulky laptop that really was overkill.</p>

<h2>            How to connect SP4 with laptop to create duel monitor&#63;</h2>
                    Hey, so I've been looking everywhere to figure out how to create duel monitors with my asus laptop and my SP4, but had no luck that could really explain it easily. Can someone tell me what equipment I need to buy so I can create duel monitors and how to
 actually accomplish this? I've tried looking on youtube but still no luck.

            Actually, Microsoft Garage has a really elegant (if "officially unsupported", it's Garage, after all...) way to do (almost) this, and it doesn't even require a video cable or input - just both computers connected to the same network:&nbsp; It's called Mouse
 Without Borders, and it lets you use the keyboard and mouse to control Windows desktops across PCs.&nbsp; You can get it here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35460&nbsp; (Note that programs on each connected computer are still running locally
 on that computer, not the other, but this makes it way easier to work with multiple PCs.)
<p>
</p><p>This is amazing if you work with both a laptop and a desktop, for instance, or want to easily remotely control a PC connected to a projector in a Conference Room, for example.&nbsp; Basically, once you've installed MWB on the PCs, it allows you to tell it the
 physical arrangement of multiple screens, but across *different* PCs - Yes, you can move your mouse cursor straight from one computer to another (even if one or both have multiple monitors), and then type from the keyboard.&nbsp; It just works.&nbsp; (Actually, you
 can use the mouse/keyboard on either PC to control both.&nbsp; IIRC, it supports more than two PCs, but I've never used it that way.&nbsp; It's not a software KVM, because each PC does need at least one monitor physically attached...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better yet, MWB lets copy and paste work seamlessly <strong>across </strong>the PCs, and drag-and-drop , while not perfectly transparent, works well enough - there's a special "MouseWithoutBorders" folder on the desktop where files can be dragged to the
 other PC (You'll have to move them from there in a bit of a two-step, if you want them elsewhere, but this is still way easier than setting up local file sharing for most people.&nbsp; (Why does MS make that so bloody hard to do?&nbsp; Local filesystems are half the
 benefit of a real OS!))</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used this for a few years with my old laptop (with an external monitor), connecting both screens of that desktop to a second PC, a 27" HP All-in-One desktop.&nbsp; MWB connects automatically when you connect to the network, so I never did anything but plug
 in power, HDMI, and Ethernet to the laptop (didn't have a docking station), and I was magically controlling both the HP All-In-One and my laptop from the HP's nicer keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; For what it lets you do, MWB works exceptionally well, and while there
 are occasional bugs, it's as solid as most "real" MS software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice there's also an App version now, to allow Windows Tablets or Phones to control a PC desktop as well - I haven't tried that version, but the original desktop version is truly one of Microsoft's great hidden gems.&nbsp; If you have more than one PC in
 your work area, you'll wonder how you ever got along without it - and also wonder why MS didn't just make this part of Windows years ago.

            <p>Hi Frezie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this issue, we suggest that you start your PC in safe mode from the Windows Startup Settings screen. You can open the Windows Startup Settings in the Windows Recovery Environment. To start in safe mode, follow the
<strong>Get to Windows Startup Settings in the Windows Recovery Environment</strong> section in the following link:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17076/windows-8-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are on the Windows Startup Settings screen, select <strong>Enable Safe Mode with Networking.&nbsp;</strong>Safe mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services to help troubleshoot issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to start your PC in safe mode, use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files. For steps on how to use the System File Checker tool, refer to the following link:

<p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the Bluetooth device fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do you get any error message&nbsp;while updating the drivers? If yes, lets us know the complete error message.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the drivers are corrupted, incompatible or due to hardware problems.
</p>
<p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with devices and hardware. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Click on the <strong>view all </strong>option on the left panel.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Run the <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Update the Drivers</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Most hardware interfaces require driver software to work properly. If you recently upgraded from one version of Windows to another, power outages, viruses, or other computer problems, it's possible that the drivers have become corrupted. Downloading and
 installing the <strong>latest driver </strong>can resolve these types of problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer below article to know how to <strong>Update drivers</strong>:</p>
</span>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/how-to-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>How to update drivers
</span></span></span></span></strong></a></p>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 keeps freezing constantly</h2>
                    Okay I have a Lenovo A310 all-in-one that is more than capable to run Win 8. &nbsp;I'm going from Win 7 premium to Win 8 pro and have full freezes when not even doing anything. &nbsp;I've clean installed at least 5 times. &nbsp;The past two installs, the system would
 freeze when loading Win 8 apps. &nbsp;So sometimes, it can't even get through the install process without a freeze.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've done safe boot and can't seem to narrow down the problem. Turned off dynamic tick, turned on Hyper-V, disabled Superfetch. Updated all drivers (Lenovo only has drivers for Win 7) back to Win 7 for my machine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The most recent updates yesterday 11/13 I had to reset the computer 3 or 4 times to get them to download and installing them it keeps freezing around 12%. &nbsp;I've checked the BIOS and it's using standard ATA: IDE.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I keep running across several forums where people have the same issue with no resolve. &nbsp;The freezes don't even allow me to pull up task manager. &nbsp;It freezes everything on the screen and monitor lights. &nbsp;The only way past it is to hold the power down for
 5 seconds and I'm afraid doing this so often is going to break my PC. &nbsp;I really want Win 8 on this computer, but may have to get my money back.</div>

<br />
Is the computer freezing even in safe mode?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1</b><br />
I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices except mouse and keyboard and check if the computer freezes.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2</b><br />
I would suggest you to perform clean boot and then try to install.<br />

            <p>Just curious if you ever found a solution or workaround to this? Having the exact same problem (as it seems like a lot of people are).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done a clean install to a completely formatted hard drive (on two different drives to ensure it wasn't bad hardware). I've disabled dynamic ticks. I've booted in clean mode. I've disabled every startup program.&nbsp; Updated drivers and installed as many
 updates as I could (Windows Update doesn't seem to work too well with Windows 8 either...) but no matter what I do, my PC will lock up completely within 2 to 20 minutes, even if I just sit there at the start screen and do nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way I'm even able to use the computer now is running in safe mode (which I'm in as I type this) because it is the only way I can keep running long enough to get anything done.</p>

            <p>Yes it kept doing it.&nbsp; Do you also have a Lenovo Ideacentre?&nbsp; I was told by Lenovo that my PC is 2 years old and therefore they aren't planning on updating any drivers.&nbsp; Basically they have other priorities.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I put Windows 7 back on the PC, sold it and
 bought a Vizio all-in-one and upgraded it to Windows 8 without any problems.&nbsp; I will never go back to Lenovo after this experience.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing many tests, it came down to a sound card driver.&nbsp; Lenovo has acted as if Windows 8 was only a rumor and snuck up on them.&nbsp; They barely have any drivers for several of their products.&nbsp; They lost my business.</p>

            <p>I have had similar issue after upgrading my Lenovo all in one A710. After several months, finally I figured out where the problem was. It is the CPU overheating problem, at least for me, because I already heard the fan was blowing loud before the computer
 freezes. My guess is there might be some setting hidden in win8 that automatically shutdown the PC when the CPU's temperature is getting too high. I was not able to locate the setting in either win8 or BIOS.<br />
</p>
<p>I then opened up the back cover, and removed a few screws to get access to the CPU fans. There were two of them. I had to take out the fans to see all the dusts that completely blocked the heat sinks around CPU. No wonder the fans were blowing hard for nothing.
 It took me about 5 min to&nbsp;clean the heat sinks and another 10 min to put things back. After the cleanup, the freezing problem was completely gone. I had left the computer on for two full days without any problem.</p>
<p>I downloaded a utility to monitor and fan and temperature from now on to monitor the PC, so that I know when it is time to do another cleanup.
</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows, while shutting down, checks for any open programs. If there is any, it sends a request to the program to close and wait till the program closes safely, to prevent any loss of data. But, Windows waits for some specified

<p>I would suggest you to run the hotfix and check if it helps.<br />
