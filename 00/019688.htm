<h2>            Generate Barcodes</h2>
                    I have a customer list (name, address, city, state, zip) in Excel 2016 (Office 365 Home). I want to create barcodes from the address in a new column for use by the post office scanners. Can I do this and how? Any and all information is appreciated since
 this is brand new to me. Thanks in advance for your help.

<br />
Not sure how to interpret that.&nbsp; A complete numerical example showing what you expect would help.&nbsp; Perhaps:<br />
<br />
=ROUND(A1-MIN(A1,94200)*7.65%,2)<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
I reiterate that a complete numerical example demonstrating your expectations would help us help you most effectively.&nbsp; It might also help if you explained the situation.<br />
<br />
I notice that 7.65% is the (US) employer FICA tax rate for 2005 through 2012 [1], and $94,200 is the Social Security wage base limit.<br />
<br />
If that is what you are trying to deduct from total gross income, note that only the 6.2% Social Security tax is limited to the first $94,200.&nbsp; The 1.45% Medicare tax applies to the entire total gross income.&nbsp; Also note that each tax (Social Security and Medicare)
 is rounded separately.<br />
<br />
So you might want the following [2]:<br />
<br />
=A1-ROUND(A1*1.45%,2)-ROUND(MIN(A1,94200)*6.2%,2)<br />
<br />
-----<br />
[1] 7.65% is also the employee FICA tax rate for 2005 through 2012, although it was reduced to 5.65% for 2011 -- 4.2% Social Security and 1.45% Medicare.<br />
<br />
[2] It is always prudent to round dollar-and-cents calculations in order to avoid anomalies that arise with Excel arithmetic.&nbsp; So it would be better to write:<br />
<br />
=ROUND(A1-ROUND(A1*1.45%,2)-ROUND(MIN(A1,94200)*6.2%,2), 2)<br />

            Sure, Just use the External Data ribbon to Import the tables back into the front end.&nbsp;

<h2>            Changing custom slide size in slide master &#40;Powerpoint 2013&#41; - defaulting to wrong value</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I am trying to update my slide master to Powerpoint 2013, and when I change the custom slide size, it won't accept my changes. I want to set:<br />
<br />
Width: 29.7cm<br />
Height: 21cm<br />
<br />
However, when I enter these value, it changes the height back to 20.999cm every time. I have tried changing this in both the slide master and the XML presentation file, and neither is working. You could set this in Powerpoint 2010, so I don't understand why
 you wouldn't be able to in Powerpoint 2013, but it's a big problem for us as all our macros etc are designed around a height of 21cm.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if there is a way around this.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Jessica<br />

            There isn't a way around this that I know. Under the hood PPT works in POINTS not cms and the conversion in 2013 is to 3 decimal places instead of two in 2010. For some weird reason it cannot settle to exactly 21.000 or 29.700.
<br />
<br />
Your macros are unlikely to work on a height of 21 cm though as in code PPT only uses points.<br />

    <title>Antimalware Service Executable and Excessive CPU Usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john ald  say:</h3>
<h2>            Antimalware Service Executable and Excessive CPU Usage</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am having a problem with Antimalware Service Executable which I will refer to as ASE. I initially experienced this problem several weeks ago and began a conversation regarding it on this forum. The problem has now recurred, and I would like to solicit
 further advice. The previous conversation ended up more of a discussion of the relative merits of various AV and antimalware products vs Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY MACHINE is a Surface Book i7 with 16 MB ram and NVidia GPU. It is almost a year old. During this time I had used Defender exclusively until several weeks ago and had never had any problem with it that I am aware of. There are 4 computers in this household,
 all of them running Windows 10 and Defender. Only this Surface Book is having a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE PROBLEM: After running a full scan several weeks ago, ASE continued to command excessive CPU usage in the range of 50% to 60%. After a reboot, ASE would pick right up where it left off. The machine was essentially unusable for any other demanding task
 because of this. To turn off Defender, I resorted to installing AVG Free. This indeed shut down Defender and everything was back to normal. After a few days AVG began acting strangely and I thought I would try Defender again and see what would happen. After
 removing AVG (with the AVG Removal Tool) Defender again took over and worked normally for roughly the past two weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I initiated a full scan which ran normally and detected no malware. A back-up scan using MalwareBytes Free was also clean. After the Defender scan, ASE remained busy and continued to occupy ~50% of CPU. Again, rebooting had no effect. In reviewing
 previous discussions of this issue on this forum I tried the following suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A sfc /scannow scan did not reveal any corrupted system files. I followed the suggestion of placing this file, MsMpEng.exe, in the excluded category in Defender. The CPU overusage ended immediately (after a restart). The computer&nbsp; and Defender functioned
 normally for the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning the computer and Defender were still functioning normally. I then decided to run another Defender full scan as a test. This again ran smoothly with no malware detected, but following the scan ASE once again resumed high CPU usage at ~50%, and
 won't quit no matter what I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to continue to rely on Defender as my primary AV software with MalwareBytes Free as a periodic backup check. I am discouraged, however, at my inability to control this runaway CPU usage which makes the Surface Book essentially unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help and advice you might have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

            <p>Here is a follow-up to the previous email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going back into the Defender settings where MsMpEng.exe had been added as an excluded file. As an experiment, I also just added this as an excluded process. So this file is now listed both as an excluded file and an excluded process. After restarting
 the machine, ASE CPU usage dropped to its usual background level of 0-1%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though the fan is now quiet, I remain unsure as to what is going on and what I might expect were I to run another Defender scan.</p>

            Does the webmail of your ISP has ability to auto-forward email? If yes, set it to forward your emails to Outlook.com and delete them. If it doesn't have such ability try post your answer in Windows Live forum as I mentioned in my previous post.

 It's been that way since Oct 26. Now I have new spyware and virus definitions to install. Think I should?

    <title>Skewed Page Number in Footers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keina matsunaga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skewed Page Number in Footers</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently working on a word doc with tons of bullets, a comments section, and a few tables. I put footers with 3 sections: title on the left side, date on the right side, and page number in the middle. The first few pages had the correct page numbers
 but here's what the pages looked like (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 10, 10.) In total, there are 11 pages. I've retyped the document and changed some bullet formatting and their indents, and it worked; 1) but is there a quick solution? 2) What was the
 main problem? I'm an EA so taking hours to reformat a whole financial document again (very possible) isn't in my best interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice is valuable!!!!!!!!&nbsp;Thanks in advance for your help!!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In <strong>each </strong>section, use <strong>Insert | Header &amp; Footer | Page&nbsp;Number | Format Page Numbers...</strong> to change the number start to "Continue from previous section." You need to do this in each section of the document, not just the ones
 for which footers are displayed: if page numbering is restarted in a "landlocked" section in the middle of a page, it will affect the numbering in the following section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, unless you're changing numbers of columns or page orientation, it may be that you have more section breaks than you actually need. Reducing those (and replacing them with manual page breaks if necessary) will make it easier to handle page numbering.
 It's also possible, looking at the numbering, that in the two sections with pages numbered 3 and 10 the page number has been typed manually instead of using a PAGE field. You can easily insert a PAGE field by pressing
<strong>Alt+Shift+P</strong>.</p>

<h2>            My Microsoft Rewards disappeared</h2>
                    <p>I noticed my point counter in the top right corner started glitching several days ago, which is when I took this screenshot:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>A few days later, I have lost my Gold status and all but 170 of my points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried the Microsoft Support bot, and when that was unable to help me I asked to speak to a person. &nbsp;I chose "Bing Rewards" when prompted to choose my product, and it says to visit the Bing Rewards support site for help. &nbsp;When I select "go there now"
 I am taken to the Bing Rewards FAQ page. &nbsp;I then chose "Contact Bing Rewards support", which took me back to the page to speak to the Microsoft Support bot.<br />

    <title>turn off compact mode view - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yu b  say:</h3>
<h2>            turn off compact mode view</h2>
                    I want to expand the preview pane without forcing the columns in the center (i don't know what that pane is called; it's the pane with columns showing subject, from , date received, etc) from switching to the compact view mode ( I thin kthat is the proper
 term; when those columns reduce to two: date and arrange by).<br />
<br />
I tried specifying the widths of each column in &lt;view settings&gt; but that would reduce the column widths without&nbsp; expanding the preview pane.I also tried manually dragging the widths but when i drag the preview pane after adjusting all the columns to take up
 the rest of the space, outlook still switches to compact view mode.<br />
<br />
Can switching to compact view mode be turned off?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

            <p>Hello, RonGM.<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your concern here in community regarding issues you have installing apps.<br />
<br />
A few things we can suggest for this time.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Try downloading and installing other applications.&nbsp; We would be interested to know if this is isolated to the native apps you have mentioned or if this is preventing the install of all applications.</li><li>Try installing these apps via multiple networks.&nbsp; We would suggest you try over more than one WiFi network and via your cellular data plan.</li><li>Go to settings &gt;&nbsp; keyboard &gt; download a keyboard language that is not on your phone.&nbsp; This should prompt you to restart your phone and may push through some other updates the phone is missing.&nbsp; If this does not improve your experience, consider changing
 the language settings on your phone and rebooting.&nbsp; See if the issue with installing these apps continues.</li><li>Soft reset the phone by going to settings &gt; storage sense &gt; phone &gt; temporary files &gt; delete &gt; Internet Explorer settings &gt; delete history.&nbsp; Once you are done with that, press and hold the down volume button plus the power button until the phone vibrates
 and reboots.&nbsp; </li><li>If the issue continues the next thing to do is to do a factory reset of the phone.&nbsp; We would suggest you back up your media and turn on phone backups before doing this.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Please let us know if there's anything that we can help you with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Ian Sal<br />

<p>Hi RaviM54,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query. Based on the initial information you’ve provided, there is a possibility that you’ve enabled some USB settings on your phone that causes you to not able
 to download stuff to your phone. So we can assist you accordingly, we’d like to know the phone model and version of Windows you’re using.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, when you say “I cannot download stuff from/to the phone.”, are you trying to download stuff from the PC to your phone? What kind of stuff are you trying to download? Is it a
 pictures, videos, or music?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re using Windows 10 Mobile, you can visit

</strong>as a reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mscandiga,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I do a test in our environment and can’t reproduce such issues. The users with the Contribute Permissions should be able to create a folder in a document set. The document set’s permission inherits the library permission in a site
 by default if you don’t set the unique permission on the document set. First I’d like you to confirm whether you grant a group the Contribute permission on the document set or grant individual user the permissions. If you grant a group the permission, I’d
 like you to upload full screenshots showing the permissions of the group and one user in the group on the library level and the document set level. If you grant individual user the permissions, , I’d like you to upload full screenshots showing the permissions
 of one affected user on the library level and the document set level. </p>
<p>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, from your description, it seems that the users with the Contribute permissions can’t create the folder by clicking on New&gt;Folder in the document set in modern SharePoint and by clicking on File&gt;Folder in the document set
 in classic SharePoint. If yes, I’d like to confirm whether the issue only happens in the specific document set in the specific library. If you let them create a folder in another document set in another library in another site, what’s the result?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Moreover, I suggest you remove the permissions on the affected user in the document set and re-grant them the permissions to check the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Cliff</p>

    <title>Custom keyboard shortcuts randomly disappear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> callistarakhmatov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom keyboard shortcuts randomly disappear</h2>
                    I'm running OSX version 10.8.3 and I recently installed Office 2011 for Mac. Whenever I assign custom keyboard shortcuts (specifically Command+Shift+V for paste special, which I've been using for years), it invariably reverts back to the default shortcut
 without warning. Earlier today, I was working along and nothing out of the ordinary happened, and all of a sudden my custom keyboard shortcut was gone. I had used it just minutes before.<br />
<br />
Just now when I closed the program, it prompted me to save the changes Word had made to the Normal.dotm template and I said "Don't Save." When I reopened, there was a custom keyboard shortcut of "Command+Control+V" for "Paste Special" instead of "Command+Shift+V"
 which was now assigned to PasteFormat. When I closed it minutes before, there was nothing assigned to Paste special on the menu, and the Paste and Match Formatting had a different shortcut.<br />
<br />
How do I make my custom keyboard shortcuts stick? When I try to save them in Normal.dotm, I get an error that I cannot save with the same name as an open document. So I choose "Normal2.dotm" and then delete the Normal.dotm and rename "Normal2.dotm" to Normal.dotm.
 When I open Word again, my shortcuts are the standard, default shortcuts. My custom shortcuts are gone.<br />
<br />
When I close Word without saving, I am not prompted to save or that the Normal.dotm template has been changed even though the keyboard settings indicates to save the changes in Normal.dotm. And so, when I close, nothing is saved.<br />
<br />
It's very frustrating. Please help! If this is a bug (and it seems like it to me, because it was very easy to assign shortcuts in Office 2008), then how do I submit it and alert the developers?<br />
<br />
PS I edited this question to reflect this new information, and it somehow reverted back to the original question. I'm not sure if this will stick either but I'm going to save it on my computer in case I need to post it as a comment.<br />

            I too have experienced the occasional shortcut reassignment, Madeline. Sometimes the shortcut reverts to the original command. Others, it just stops working.
<div><br />
<div>I have no idea when or why it happens, but it does and I'm on Snow Leopard, so it would not seem OS-related.
<div><br />
<div>Just make a copy of Normal.dotm and leave it next to the original, in case it ever becomes corrupt or you need to reinstate it.</div>

<p><span><font color="#000000">I've checked and investigated your domain name. I've enabled your password reset option for your users in Windows Live Admin Center.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">To assist you with your concern about creating aliases, t<span>he limit is 5 aliases per account. An account can create 5 per year, regardless if the alias is deleted so you need to wait for a year if you reached the limit.</span></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you've reached this limit and decided to delete one, you need to wait for 30 days before alias be removed in our system. One alias deleted is equal to 30 days deletion process. If you've deleted 2 aliases, you'll wait for 60

<br />
Please be informed that even if you've already deleted your alias, as long as it's not yet removed in our system, aliases that you've made are still available in your account. Hence, creating a new alias is not possible as long as the deletion process is ongoing.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Server 2016 OneDrive Client Crashing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just set up a new Windows 2016 Server Standard server (version 1607 build 14393.2430)&nbsp;and installed&nbsp;the OneDrive client (version 2018 Build 18.131.0707.0007) to sync with a OneDrive for Business&nbsp;account that currently has ~300GB of data. I noticed the
 OneDrive client is continually crashing with the following error:</p>

<p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have this working now. What I did was unlink OneDrive as you suggested then instead of syncing all folders, I only selected one small folder. The sync was successful. I then added several additional folders and they synced as expected. Finally
 I added all remain folders and the sync was once again successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for my next question...Is there a way to see the OneDrive icon overlays in Explorer in Windows Server 2016? I was able to see them in Windows Server 2008 R2 but I am unable to see them in Windows Server 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jeff</p>

<p>Hi Anusha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps Rena provided will help us identify if the workflow can be ran successfully without the user's permission level.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does, it means that the user has some permission issues that we will then continue troubleshooting. Alternatively, you can also try giving another user
<strong>Full Control </strong>permission and see the user also gets the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, we can narrow down that this issue is only happening to the specific user. To start, please try using a browser's private mode and login using the problematic user and tick the
<strong>Keep Me Signed In</strong> box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, try manually starting the workflow. If the error shows up, capture a screenshot and provide it to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, please try removing the user from the <strong>Site Owner'</strong>s group and instead directly give him
<strong>Full Control </strong>permission and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

    <title>How To Start Over with One Note 2016 From Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richlocus  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Start Over with One Note 2016 From Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Well. &nbsp;I did it. &nbsp;Shot myself in the &nbsp;foot. &nbsp;In the process of trying to delete a One Note (Office 2016 version) notebook on One-Drive and move things around, now my Quick Notes doesn't work, and other issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I tell One Note to completely start over like a new install? &nbsp;I can't &nbsp;just uninstall it and reinstall because in Office 365, it's all or nothing. &nbsp;I want it to behave like a brand new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I &nbsp;don't have access to the quick notes feature and the small tutorial that &nbsp;comes with One &nbsp;Note is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since your OneNote is installed as part of the Office 365 suite, there's no way to uninstall and reinstall it alone, without taking the rest of the Office app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can, however try repairing your Quick Notes and other Office apps that is not working properly. Feel free to check out
