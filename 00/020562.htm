            Dear Gloria,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />I am sorry but you need IOS 11 in order to download and run app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/microsoft-outlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If you need to set up Microsoft account I do advise you to try Set up email using the iOS Mail app <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-email-using-the-ios-mail-app-7e5b180f-bc8f-45cc-8da1-5cefc1e633d1?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up...</a> This should work.

            Hi, Would that mean getting a newer version of iphone?&nbsp; Considering that my iphone 5 ios limit is only 10.3.3 and I cannot update it to ios 11.

            Dear Gloria,
<br />
<br />If you only want the Outlook app and IOS, then I am afraid that this is the only solution as system requirements needs at least IOS 11 at the moment, and some time ago it was IOS 10.
<br />
<br />But you can set up account in native app. I would try that first.

            I'm afraid I will have to get a new phone since that the outlook mail website doesn't give some choices that the app would give me, for example this morning my boss showed me using his phone some features that he is able to see on the outlook app which
 I was not able to see on my phone because I can only sign in to the outlook website not the app :(&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you very much LordAlukard.&nbsp;

<h2>            border art won&#39;t print completely on publisher-windows 10</h2>
                    The text box border art of Publisher show but only the top and bottom of the border art show on print preview and only prints the top and bottom of the border art. &nbsp;I never had this problem or any of the problems I now have with the current Publisher program...in
 addition to the "new and improved" Windows 10. &nbsp;Does anyone have a solution to this bug??

            I have similar problem, except it is not printing or showing the border in the print window on the right side and bottom of border. I tried sending to onenote and it did not fix the issue. I have adjusted all margins and my printer settings. it is happening
 to ALL my publisher files. I have been using the same format for 10 years for brochures and now I can't print ANY of them! I have changed the size of the border to fit in any margin, I have tried everything I can think of. Please help! This problem is disrupting
 my business!

            <p>I have the same problem. Check if you have an NVidia graphics card. Also, you should check that the problem occurs with all Border Art. With my issue, I have been using the same border art for over a decade for different certificates and have found that
 the worst problems seem to be with Woodwork and Deco border art, showing either as solid lines (Woodwork) or just completely missing lines (Deco).</p>
<p>I have found that the lines will print if they are either thin (dpi) enough or short (2/3 of a page) enough.</p>
<p>These documents seem to print properly from Surface Pro3 i7 but not from ANY computer I have that uses NVidia GeeForce graphics cards, even with the drivers disabled to allow the Intel Basic drivers to control things.</p>
<p>Everything was working fine in June/July, but when I went back to print certificated from templates that I had used for years, nothing with an NVidia card would print properly even though it would show borders correctly. The print preview page in Publisher
 2016 on Windows 10 will show correctly for Fax, but Print, Print to PDF, Export to PDF, Print to OneNote all preview (then print) the fault.
</p>
<p>It seems to be something to do with merging the image that makes up the long line of the border art.</p>
<p>I'm desperate to not have to redesign every template I have that uses one of these defective borders.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Office Admin Account - Right revoked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Office 365 business account with only one active Office email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont have admin access on this account, as I want to change some security settings but I only have the basic access under the settings menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even change my personal information as it says it has been blocked by my employer/organisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do already have an Office 365 account with my current employer, but I've created my own private business one. I logged in and installed O365 on my work laptop with and it said something about corporate policies, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it even possible for my admin rights to be inherited by my current employees MDM system? Therefore enforcing corporate policies on my own private account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked them (seemed like a silly question to the help desk) but they said they don't offer assistanse to private accounts (fair enough, but not helpful).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get Global Admin rights back for this single O365 account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers for reading.</p>

<p>When you say that you have a Office 365 from your employer do you mean you have the Office components (Word/Excel MS Outlook) on your laptop?</p>
<p>If that is the case you cannot install a second Office 365 version on the laptop. You can add a personal email account to MS Outlook, provided your employer has not locked down access to outlook settings and it sounds like they have.</p>
<p>So what exactly do you mean by "created my own private business one"</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two accounts:</p>
<p>1) Current employer - O365 and the whole works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Just registered my own business, purchase 0365 Business and currently hane one email registered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using my current employer provided laptop, that has security policies and some MDM corporate policies on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my own business O365 account, I cannot access the admin section. I wanted to add 2FA, but it says I don't have permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I try to access the Admn community with this login, it says on the top of the website that the account is not an admin account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if we just focus on the SaaS 0365 access through the Web browser, I still cannot use this single account that I own to access the admin settings for the registered domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I want to change my personal information, it won't let me as it says I need to contact my HR or IT department, in an on-screen message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem here is that, this is the only O365 account on the domain that should have admin privileges (I believe), or else the admin privileges are literally with no one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just confused as to why this single account on this newly purchased domain and O365 package is being to contact the admin to change simple profile details, even when the account should be the admin account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this describes it more. :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Wntd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the detailed explanation. Based on your description, this should not happen, as your Office 365 Business is a completely separate tenant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as you mentioned that you are using your employer's laptop, when you open the Office 365 Portal, you might be automatically signed in using your current employer's account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest trying to use your browser's private mode to open <a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://portal.office.com</a> and enter your Office 365 Business credentials to see if you can see the Admin button on your home page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will also collect your account info to check whether you are the Global Admin of the tenant as well. You can access your private message
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/">
here</a> to provide your tenant information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

<p>In Nokia Anna you do not add individual applications to a screen, you add a shortcut widget by tap and holding a free space on a screen, then selecting
<em>Shortcuts</em>. When the shortcut widget is on the screen you tap a free shortcut, select &nbsp;<em>settings</em>, tap the desired shortcut, select
<em>application</em> and then <em>Camera</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In Nokia Belle you tap and hold the screen you wish to place the shortcut, select
<em>Add shortcut</em> and then <em>Camera.</em></p>

<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-email-contacts-and-calendar-from-an-Outlook-pst-file-431a8e9a-f99f-4d5f-ae48-ded54b3440ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-email-contacts-and-calendar-from-an-Outlook-pst-file-431a8e9a-f99f-4d5f-ae48-ded54b3440ac</a><br />
<br />
Also you can import all the PST files as an admin account using the Office 365 import service as the article below:<br />

<p>
</p><p>when you have a number of pst files and will import to different O365 mailboxes, this tool is very useful</p>

            Thank you for that. Can i ask what is stopping our end users just reattaching the pst files that are stored on their home drives or local drives to outlook in the conventional manner within the Outlook client?

            <p>I think end user will still have the ability to re-attach or import their local stored pst files to their O365 account</p>
<p>
</p><p>PST capture or importing pst via tools will not have any impact on the above situation</p>

<h3> abifallows  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 535 takes pictures but turns them into grey unviewable boxes.</h2>
                    <p>I've only recently been able to get online (long story: three months without internet) to ask about this. My lumia 353 (Lumia Denim) running W8.whatever, any time I take a picture with the camera, the lumia app opens, I can play with the cameras setting
 and nail the perfect shot, but unless I can get the pictures uploaded straight away (difficult when out, no internet access) it replaces everything with grey boxes. I can edit to my hearts content and save the picture afterwards and for a few minutes - sometimes,
 a couple of hours. I've checked for updates, I've uninstalled/reinstalled progs and downloaded other progs to see if it's just one app or many where the problem lies, but it's looking to be the camera itself at fault.
</p>
<p>I've tried to do a soft reset - nothing. I've tried to reset the camera - won't even let me do it, the button is there, but doesn't function.
</p>
<p>There are no other updates available and I'm now out of ideas. Everything else about the phone works brilliantly, it's just the camera letting it down.
</p>
<p>Resorting to using old android phone for the purpose of taking pictures for the time being.

            Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/2bda07a7-6225-4bbe-a557-c4b2c55c150c" title="AbiFallows">
AbiFallows</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. Are you still experiencing the same behavior? Is the phone system app up to date? Have you tried checking if there's a software update available for your Lumia 535? When you say soft reset, are you referring
 to <strong>holding down the power button </strong>+ <strong>volume down button</strong>&nbsp;at the same time until the phone restarts? We look forward to your reply.

            <p>Yes. Tried that, taking the battery out and uninstalling and reinstalling the camera to no avail. It's now just a little over 14 months old, so I'm not happy. The only other thing I haven't done is a full factory reset.
</p>
<p>I've noticed that if I take a picture and upload it somewhere straight away, it will post it. After that, it's gone. All I get is 'Can't get picture. You can try again later.'</p>
<p>The very same thing is also happening to videos too. </p>

            <p>It's not the memory card. I put a brand new 32Gb microSD card in it and formatted it when I got the phone. I've moved all what's left of pictures/video off ages ago.&nbsp;

            <p>It's with a sad heart that, after killing a 32Gb microSD card and being given a second chance, this morning 15th January, my phone quit being alive.
</p>
<p>I've tried all I could to revive it, but it's gone the way of a Monty Python sketch involving a parrot.
</p>
<p>The last thing it did was update one app - one that had been lingering on the notifications for ages that wouldn't update.
</p>
<p>It is no more. </p>
<p>It restarted itself to death. I cannot charge it, I cannot get a flicker of life out of it. I've had the battery out for several hours - nothing.</p>
<p>I haven't even been able to get my contacts list off it. </p>
<p>My stand-by phone has been activated and it's doing a sterling job of things, but it's NOT the same... I feel I have to go and find a suitable windows phone to replace it - of the same kind. The ease, the simplicity of tasks, multiple alarm clocks (is 14
 too many?), my shopping lists, crazy quotes that my mother comes out with... </p>
<p>I feel glad I had it hooked all the way to dropbox - to automatically save all the random crap I've thrown at it.
</p>
<p>Is there a really slim chance of waking it up? or has it gone the way of a comedy parrot?

<p>hi andras1,</p>
<p>i have done some test on my side, and found the task created with the due date today doesn’t show up either. however, it will show up if i type the smart folders name “due today” in the ‘search this folder’ box in the upper right corner:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b91ea8d7-6573-4c6b-ba95-5fa3ea0065de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db91ea8d7-6573-4c6b-ba95-5fa3ea0065de" /></a></p>
<p>so please try it and check if it works for you as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

            <p>Yes the preview comes with the same security software as Windows 8 and 8.1, in the form of Defender.&nbsp; You may remember that Defender used to be just for spyware (Windows Vista and 7), but starting with Windows 8, it has full security/antivirus scanning also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can install your own if you have one that works.&nbsp; If Defender ever detects another program, it disables itself because it's bad news to have two security programs competing on the system.</p>

<h2>            Facebook Chat - cannot be heard or hear</h2>
                    My Facebook worked just fine until a week ago.&nbsp; Now when I video call anyone I can see them and they can see me BUT I cannot hear them and they cannot hear me.&nbsp; Since this has happened with 2 different people, I assume that my computer is the problem.
 Can you help me fix this?

<h2>            Microsoft Publisher and Lotus Notes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am preparing an announcement for my work using publisher. When I want to add it and send it by Lotus Notes it is impossible.</p>
<p>It contains an image on the left and text on the right, and the format changes when adding it to Lotus Notes. I don't want to send everything like an image because then people have problems when opening it with the smartphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help me with that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p />

            <p>The only way to send a Publisher page as the HTML formatted message body of an email is to use the same version of Outlook as your default email client, and even then your results will not be consistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>IMHO the&nbsp;<strong><em>only</em></strong> way to get consistent results is to convert your Pub file to a PDF and attach it to your message.&nbsp; If you write a simple but effective introduction in the body of your email message and your message is of interest
 and wanted by the recipient they will open the PDF. If it is spam, then it won't matter whether it is in the message body or a PDF...it will be deleted.
</span>I don't use Lotus Notes and don't know if you can attach a PDF or not.</p>
<p>
</p><div>If you must send HTML formatted, 'device friendly' messages then consider using specialty software such as:<a href="http://www.constantcontact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 68, 220, 1)">www.constantcontact.com</span></a>&nbsp;or

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This error code implies that some/one of your sync operations have/has failed with the end point. ("Partial Sync")</p>
<p>Most of the times this has been (lately) encountered with ovi.com sync. You will also have the same error in case you sync contacts with Outlook and disconnect your device in a middle of the session (e.g. sync between OLK and Ovi Suite is successful but
 sync between Ovi Suite and device fails).</p>
<p>Could you please perform syncs content by content so that we are able to narrow down which end point keeps failing?</p>

<p>I am having the same error when sync contacts between E72 and Outlook 2007. I tried the device deletion and rebooting and did not work. I installed all available updates for Ovi Suite and the device. The only way I could sync was installing the old PC Suite.
 Ovi Suite must have a bug on syncing of more than 1000 contacts.</p>

<p>A little confused why you keep needing to delete access point from "Internet" destinations rather than ensuring access point of choice is Priority 1. Presumably you have already discovered that a "<em><strong>longpress</strong></em>" on any access point
 reveals a further menu allowing you to change priority if so desired?</p>

            I had tried by keeping the highest priority of Wifi connection but I found OVI store still uses 3G connection thus i deleted the 3G access point from "internet" just to force OVI Store to use Wifi connection but it didn't connect

            Same here, using N8, it seems the transport protocol or security protocol of the Nokia (microsoft) has been changed. Ovi suite had the same problem, with new dll this works again ... but I did not find a similar solution for the app on the phone,<br />
All works until you need to sign-in for downloading an app, then it comes with the exact same error: Unable to complete the operation due to connection error. Please try again later.<br />
<br />
again something Micro$oft likes to cancel to get people buy a new phone.... guess what I bough a lumia and tried to use it but it has crapier software than symbian (I can do less than on symbian) I brought it back to the store and bough a Huawei ... in 5 minutes
 the whole phone was setup incl all my old ringtones (from a nokia sent by bluetooth).... its time to bury Nokia (I mean of course Micro$oft)<br />
<br />
Don't expect this error to be fixed... the store is now half closed, all on Sale?? hence not all apps can be downloaded with Ovi-suite.

<h2>            Hyperlinks in Word for MAC</h2>
                    I am trying to create a hyperlink from one Word (for MAC) document to another. I have looked at several screenshots of the process; however, my screen does not look the same. I have bookmarked Document A (hyperlinks to), but when I try to create a link
 from Document B, all the links got to page 1 of Document A. I do not get a list of the bookmarks. Can you help?

            Thanks for the extra information. While the program interface doesn't include buttons to add bookmarks, they're easy to create manually. After creating a hyperlink, but before closing the dialog, add
<strong>#yourbookmarkname</strong> (with yourbookmarkname being the actual bookmark name) to the end of the hyperlink. Then the hyperlink will jump directly to the bookmark.<br />

                    <span>I have a worksheet with&nbsp;two conditional format rules applied to a range of cells containing numbers.&nbsp; The rules are based on a formula in another cell (A1) that returns a 1 or 0, depending
 on a user’s selection in a data validation list.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the value of A1 is 1, percent formatting is applied to the range.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the value is 0, whole number formatting is applied.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The conditional formatting applies correctly when I click “Apply” and “OK” to exit the CF dialogue window.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It also works correctly the first time a user causes the value in the cell A1 to change from 0 to 1 or vice versa.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, the <u>second</u> time the value in the cell A1 changes, the conditional formatting is not applied.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It seems to get “stuck” on whatever the second format is set to.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Weirdly, if I click on a blank cell and select “Clear All” on the Home menu, the formats correct themselves.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Is this a bug?</span>

    <title>Cannot make a table to a password protected database. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david selevan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot make a table to a password protected database.</h2>
                    In Access 97 and Access 2002, I regularly use the Make Table query, and direct the output to a back end database.<br />
For some reason, I am getting error messages if, and only if, the back end database has a password.<br />
I've tried this in Access 97 and Access 2002. In Access 97, I use the Make Table query and specify the back end database. It then prompts me for the password and it accepts it. When I run the query, it says, "No database specified in connection string or IN
 caluse." In Access 2002, it accepts my password at the prompt, but says, "Not a valid password" when I exexcute the query. My password is only 8 digits long. Has anyone else received this error? Is it associated with a Windows update? It seems like my collegues
 are also getting this error. I am just using the Query&gt;Make Table option, and not using SQL. Thank you!!

<p><br />
&nbsp;Make tables should really only be happening inside the FRONTEND database.&nbsp; Why do you regularly use make tables to create a table in the backend?&nbsp; I really don't understand what your set up is like and why you would be doing something like that.&nbsp; It is RARE
 that you should be needing to add tables to a backend database as a properly designed database doesn't normally have tables created except on rare occasion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what is it you are doing and why?&nbsp; We might be able to steer you to a good path if we know.</p>

            Sure, I can give you more information.<br />
I have a front end database with mainly forms, queries and reports that about 50 users use. I have been using this database for managing kidney patients here (an HMO) for about 12 years. I have linked tables to about 5 other Access databases. It is necessary
 for me to keep the tables in a variety of databases for a number of reasons. One is, the size of the tables would make my front end database too big. Secondly, due to the number of users, I do not want to have to compact/repair more than once a month. Lastly,
 I am updating the database with clinical information that I am receiving from other systems, and are updated once a month, so the back end tables are changing monthly.<br />
<br />
So I have about 25 main tables that are linked to my database, and since I am working with confidential information, all of the back end databases need to be password protected. Every month I run a macro, which takes about a day to run, and has many queries.
 Some of these queries join my tables and need to create new tables to be stored in one of my password protected databases. I just got a new computer, so it is possible some kind of Windows update is causing the error.<br />
<br />
Does this work on your computer? It took me about 2 minutes to test it on my desktop, I just created one password protected database, and another database, and tried to run a make table query that sent the table to the password protected database. I get the
 error every time, regardless of the name of the database, location of the database, or version of Access I use. I am using all the built in features of MS Access, no custom SQL or anything like that. The only thing I entered were the table name, location and
 name of database, and the password when prompted. Thank you.<br />
