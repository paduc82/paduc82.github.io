<h2>            Mobile Outlook Contact Synchronization Issues&#59; Plus other wants</h2>
                    1) I have a contact on my mobile phone like such: "John E. Doe".&nbsp; The name field on the phone is, "John E. Doe" and the file as field is "Doe, John E".&nbsp; However, after I synced my phone, the contact on MyPhone reads: First Name: &lt;blank&gt;; Middle Name: "John";
 Last Name: "E. Doe".<br />
2) Not all contact fields are synced to the myphone web site.&nbsp; One such field is the Office Location field.<br />
3) Sync myphone calendar with live calender&nbsp;(and / or office online calendar).<br />

<p>I finally managed to overcome error 1935 below by deactivating .3.5 net framework in W7 Windows Faetures and then reactivating it</p>

<span>Failed Office 2007 install via download: Error 1935 etc etc 0x800736fd</span>
<p>So Office 2007 is now installed but when launching any offcie programme it starts up Windows Installer each time and tries to reconfigure the program in order to load it and the error message 'error 25004 config.xml not specifed a valid config .xml must
 be authored' appears.</p>
<p>If I close the message the program then loads but it is an annoying message I could do without</p>
<p>Any suggestions please</p>

<p>I have solved this for my problem (hope it might work for others) by downlaoding the Windows Uninstaller Clean Up Tool - which had failed to download and install correctly before when I had tried it - see below</p>
<p>This identifies and then removes <strong>any</strong> installation/set up information for programs that were installed by using Windows Installer but may well be hidden from normal sight</p>
<p>It ID'd that somewhere, but vv well hidden, was the set up/remaining info for the trial Office Professional 2007 (which I had downloaded and then removed 18 months before!) as opposed to Office Pro PLus 2007 which I had just installed. Obviously there was
 some setup/configuration conflict somewhere when I opened Pro PLus as Pro opened to, but no reference anywhere that anything relating to the old program remained.</p>
<p>Whilst it says dont use it for Office 2007 products just highlighting Pro 2007 and removing that (Office Pro PLus 2007 was listed immediately below) worked as I assume it just removed what was present/duplicated in Pro Plus anyway</p>

<h2>            Installing Jar Files on Nokia E71-1 Firmware 500.21.009</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I used to have the Gobible KJV 2.2.6 on my Nokia E71-1 when it was on firmware 300.XX.XXX and then I upgraded the firmware to 500.21.009. While it is possible to install .sis and .sisx files if they are signed, I failed to install any .jar files and
 one of my favorites is the Bible. I tried seeking an answer at the go bible website but none of the suggestions have worked. When i run the zipped jar file, it takes me through the steps as i select continue, and the installation runs and just as its about
 to complete the screen flashes an "unable to install" message. Any solutions on getting Java to install on my phone because I noticed that the above is true for all java files.</p>

Unable to install Jar Files on E71<br />
Category: Uncategorized / Tags: no tag / Add Comment<br />
You can definitely install jar files to the Nokia E71. However, if – you are like me – you keep on installing and uninstalling jar applications just to test them out, sooner or later you might encounter an error that won’t allow you to install jar apps anymore.
 Basically, what happens is, when you try installing a jar app, you will be able to select where to install, etc… then the installation bar would begin. However, when that bar reaches about 90%, your installation hangs, up then a warning sign will say “Unable
 to Install”, then the installation terminates.<br />
Don’t panic like I did. You don’t have to reformat your phone or throw it to the wall. You can still install sis or sisx applications despitethe jar installation error.<br />
All you need to do to fix this is to grab a copy of an application called Xplore.. and after installing said application, run it and choose tools&gt;configuration from its menu. From there, you have to check the boxes that says “Show Hidden Files” and “Show system
 files/folders”, then click the “Back” soft key. This will bring you to your directories.<br />
The thing that we need to do is to trace if any of the current installations on your phone has gone wrong. To do this, we need to see the registry on both your Phone Drive or your Memory Drive. This can be access by going to Drive:\System\Install\Registry.
 By going there, you will be able to see files that have a .reg ending. You need to go through each one of these types of file and see if there is something wrong with them.<br />
The easiest way to do this is to select the .reg file, then click Menu&gt;File&gt;Hex Viewer. Once opened, you can see some binary inputson the middle. This would tell you that you have successfully viewed the insides of the .reg file. Focus your attention to the
 right side of the file/screen. You have to be able to see the name of the application within it (therefore, you have to be aware what applications you currently have installed on your device). If you cannot understand anything on the right side, try scrolling
 down. If still you cannot understand anything (if unreadable characters are present), then delete this particular .reg file.<br />
Sometimes, when you try opening a .reg file for viewing, and it does not open on the Hex Viewer, this would also tell you that that is an error .reg file. So just delete it also.<br />
Once you are done viewing all your .reg file, close XPlore and try installing a jar app. You should now be able to do so.<br />
Please note that changing/deleting anything on your Registry might cause more damage to your phone or other applications. The Method I have narrated here worked for me, but it may not work foryou. So please be careful and do not blame me if the result is not
 what you expected.

<h2>            Reactivate Office after factory reset of laptop due to system crash</h2>
                    
<p>I had to factory reset my laptop due to virus infection. Upon completing the factory reset, I tried to reinstall Office 2007 from the original CD I purchased. Installation completed but it wouldn't let me activate the Office. It was telling me that maximum
 nmber of activation is exceeded. I am only trying to reinstall to the same PC I originally installed.</p>

            You will have to do a phone activation and explain the situation to the service rep. For some reason the activation process does not recognize that it is the same PC. Shouldn't be a problem on phone.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using my Palm Treo with WM6 i am able to select the HTLM message format when first setting up the exchange details, however when it first syncs it defaults back to Plain text and greys itself out so I am unable to change it. This means that I am unable to
 receive emails in HTML format. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas as to what might be causing this? and how I go about fixing it so I can receive HTML email?</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you for keeping us posted with the results. Though there are a few troubleshooting that we can perform, just to add further clarification, we would like to know the following to isolate it further or if in case refer you to
 the correct channel:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you able to login with your email profile set on <strong>IMAP</strong> with its webmail?</li><li>Have you tried running your computer on safe mode, then open your <strong>Outlook</strong>?</li><li>Is the issue also happening when you access your emails via webmail with your
<strong>Exchange</strong> email?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we advise that you create a new email profile with the same email details for your
<strong>IMAP </strong>email to have it isolated by doing these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your keyboard, press the <strong>Windows + R&nbsp;</strong>to open the <strong>
Run</strong> box.</li><li>On the run command box, key in <strong>outlook /profiles</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Soon as it opens the <strong>Choose Profile</strong> box, click on
<strong>Ne<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">w</span>...</strong> and name it as "<strong>Test</strong>".</li><li>On the <strong>Add New Account</strong> setup, manually configure and enter the details of your email.</li><li>Check if the <strong>Test</strong> account would be able to open your emails.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This is to ensure that the current profile you have is not corrupted by performing this.</p>

            I think the issue here is the OS X does allow one to put / as a character in a file name when it really shouldn't.<br />
And as stated, this is a bug when porting Office over since Windows doesn't allow / or \ in filenames, since they generally denote folders in a filepath.<br />

            Mac OS X does not permit slash characters in file names. &nbsp;The character is reserved for the folder separator.

<h2>            Digitally Signing a protected Word document.</h2>
                    <p>I have created a document with fillable forms. I need to retrict the editing to only these forms and not the rest of the document text. I also have a signature line that needs to be digitally signed by the one filling out the form. However, when I start

<h2>            Outlook behavior after 14.1.3 - delete, mark as unread not working anymore</h2>
                    Just installed the 14.1.3 update to Office 2011 for Mac this morning. Now I found some strange behavior in Outlook during the day:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I want to delete a mail by clicking the delete button or hitting the del key, the next element in the folder list is selected, but the mail is not delete before. I need to click back on the email and then delete it a second time to get rid of it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Mark as unread in preview after x seconds does not work any more. Even opening the mail doesn't mark it as read on the first time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone else encountering the same issues?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tom</div>

            I'm seeing your problem and several others:
<div>- Inbox in conversation mode doesn't always show the most recent mail. Toggling off conversation mode shows them.</div>
<div>(They did show on my iPhone prior to the Outlook client.)</div>
<div>- Drag and Drop from Inbox to Local folders lags or&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;appears to leave the email in the Inbox</div>
<div>- Delete email in Inbox lags or&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;appears to leave the email in the Inbox. Hitting Delete again asks if I want to&nbsp;permanently&nbsp;delete the email.</div>
<div>- Similar lag issues with creating and deleting calendar items</div>
<div><br />
<div>In general seeing a lot of lag time issues between actions and updating the UI. It seems like subsequent actions trigger the&nbsp;update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>None of this was being experienced prior to the update this morning.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Last time I ever install an Office update, the day it is released.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Was this update tested?</div>

            I am having the exact same problems.&nbsp; Biggest issue is that messages that are read don't get marked as read in the mailbox (still showing several messages [#] as unread) and some emails don't show up at all.<br />

Very frustrating after this update.<br />

            Well, it seems to work today after starting the machine this morning. MS should have included a restart into the patch installation.

            I also experience a major problem with the Outlook 14.1.3 update. After the update, the synchronization with the Mac Addressbook shows serious flaws. My Outlook contains 1745 contacts. My Mac Address Book suddenly only 42, which syncs with my iPhone via
 MobileMe and now also has only 42 contacts.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>This is the third time in a few months that Microsoft Outlook causes major problems, the two previous times with major data loss (addresses, e-mails, etc.). I am getting very impatient with Microsoft how they dare to bring out this very unstable Outlook
 for Mac. I have quickly made a fresh backup from my Outlook contacts.<br />
<br />
<div>Does anyone know how I can make Outlook resync with the Address Book and overwrite everything in there?</div>

            <p><span>I just ran the 14.1.3 update on all my Macs. We are running an Exchange 2010 server.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem I am having is now every time the users launch Outlook they are prompted to "Verify Certificate"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>"A secure connection cannot be established with the server exchange.xxx.local. Do you want to continue"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(where xxx is my local domain)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You click continue and now outlook forcing a change to the Microsoft Exchange server field to the local exchange box. EVERY TIME. This is fine inside the office but as soon as the users leave they cant get mail.</span></p>
<p><span>The server should be https://exchange.xxxx.com/exchange (our public OWA address where xxxx is our company)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I go into the preferences and change it back but every time Outlook is relaunched it reverts back to the local domain.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This only started happening since I applied the 14.1.3 update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I checked the SSL certificate in Exchange and it is fine. Nothing has changed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any suggestions??</span></p>

            I had the erroneous unread behavior happening for me as well. What DID finally fix it for me was an doing an Office database profile rebuild!<br />
<br />
1. In Mac Finder go to:<br />
Applications &gt; Microsoft Office 2011 &gt; Office &gt; Microsoft Database Utility<br />
<br />
2. In the <a href="http://www.northshore-it.com/_other/130403/Outlook_for_Mac-NorthShoreIT_fix-Wont_unbold_read_messages.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Database Utility window</a>, select Main Identity (I only had one) and click the Rebuild button.<br />
<br />
It took me about 5 min to complete and I had 1.8M K of email (including subfolders) via Exchange. Once it was complete, the issue was gone and didn't return. Outlook 2011 Version is 14.3.2, btw.

<h2>            I can&#39;t start my Samsung Windows Mobile 6&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I have a Windows Mobile 6, Samsung 2442 model phone. Just last night the battery died on me after having not been able to charge it for a few days. When I got home and began to charge it, I tried to turn it on but it got stuck on the opening screen and simply
 won't load now.<br />
<br />
I suspect the problem is with the battery, however I am not sure. I took the phone into the store today and they were no help at all. They had no idea what the problem was and told me that if they were to fix it I would lose all my data.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas what this problem might be and how I can fix it? Any similar experiences. Furthermore, if the phone itself is broken is there any possible way I can retrieve my address book??

            A hard reset will solve your issue. However, as the support folks told you, you will lose all your data and there is no way to retrieve it without first powering the device. I can only suggest, that you leave the device aside, plugged into A\C and try
 again later. Keep on trying. However, if does not boot up, you will have no choice but to hard reset.

<p>Thank you for the speedy response. I have plugged my phone in and am waiting for the green light to appear showing that it is fully charged to see if that might solve the problem, resetting the device and starting.
 If not, is there any possible way to get my contact list back? For example, since all of my incoming text messages go through a server, is it possible for the cell phone provider to have information such as the addresses of the people who sent me messages
 in the last month or so?? Maybe I'm reaching for straws here, but I really don't want to lose all of my contacts!</p>

<p>Kevin, you are correct ... you are reaching for straws (unfortunately).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, with the AC power attached, turn on the device and try a soft reset now ... it has been charging long enough and hopefully it will start correctly.</p>

Suggest to remove the battery for one minute, and try soft reset again...<br />
If still doesn't work, then hard reset as advised above....<br />

                    <p>I have recently changed over to a MacBook Pro, and have successfully been accessing my emails through Office 365. &nbsp;However, for the last two weeks, whenever I open the program, it seems to just be frozen. &nbsp;It still receives new emails, however it is not
 updating any of the existing emails that I have since marked as read or deleted (via another computer). &nbsp;It is also bringing up a reminder window with overdue events, which I cannot dismiss. &nbsp;I can't open / delete / mark as read or make any changes to any
 emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled Microsoft 365 and reinstalled it, but this hasn't made any difference. &nbsp;I can still access and make changes to my emails on my iMac, iPhone, iPad and old Windows laptop. &nbsp;I have been receiving the same spam email from somebody which goes
 to the junk folder, and although I have blocked the sender it still keeps appearing. &nbsp;I have deleted it on the other devices, but currently there are 745 items in the junk folder on this computer, so I'm not sure if that is causing a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody please help?</p>

<p>Hi Carley,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many factors can cause Outlook for Mac freezing issue. Followings are my suggestions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check your mailbox size, item count and folder count, for folder count, it’s a good practice to maintain less than 100 folders each in calendar, contacts, tasks, and notes. For Item count, less than 5000 items each in calendar, contacts, tasks, and
 notes folders is highly recommended. For mailbox size, keep your mailbox size under 9 GB to ensure better performance and prevent any potential stability issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please change the Outlook profile to see if the issue is related to corrupted profile: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-profiles-or-identities-in-Outlook-for-Mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-profiles-or-identities-in-Outlook-for-Mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c</a>.
 (Please note: back up your outlook data before managing profile)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform a clean startup (safe mode) to determine whether background programs are interfering with Office for Mac:

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists after above steps performed, there is a dedicated team to troubleshoot Outlook for Mac client issue, please go to the in-app support:<strong> Help</strong> menu &gt;<strong> Contact Support.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Baron</p>

<p>A number of folks seem eager to assist but I don't see how they possibly can - As yet you haven't stated what the problem(s) is/are. It seems a bit premature to start ripping out your installation, though, when it isn't even clear what you're hoping to accomplish
 :-) The boxes you mention have nothing to do with the <strong>AutoCorrect</strong> feature. They are parts of the
<strong>Spelling &amp; Grammar</strong> settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the reference to "Options in the File dropdown" pertains to the Windows version of Word &amp; roughly is the equivalent of
<strong>Word&gt; Preferences</strong> in the Mac version. That's why you couldn't find it :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version you cited [I assume you meant 16.9.1] no longer is current. As Jim Gordon suggested, it would be a good idea to update to 16.10 which is the most recent build. If that doesn't resolve whatever is the issue please provide a complete, detailed
 description of the problem along with specific examples.</p>

<p>I'm a big believer in going forward rather than backwards in updates. I suggest installing 16.10 or later before you waste time uninstalling and reinstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection before checking for updates. Install Mac OS X updates followed by Office updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Install Mac OS X updates first:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get Mac OS updates, go to the App store on your dock, and then click the Updates button to reveal available updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Then Install Office Updates</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get the update:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open any Office application</span></li><li><span>Go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates</span></li><li><span>Let AutoUpdate check for and install updates</span></li><li><span>Restart your Mac</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any add-ins such as WebEx, Mendelay, EndNote, Zotero, TypeIt4me, etc it is essential that you install the latest updates for your add-ins.</span></p>

<p><span>To correct the issue, please create a new user role with all the features selected especially the option<strong> My Marketplace Apps</strong>, then follow the steps below to assign the new role to
 the affected users:</span></p>
<p><span>In <strong>Exchange admin center</strong>, go to
<strong>recipients – mailboxes </strong>and double click the affected users. Under<strong> mailbox features – Role assignment policy</strong>, select the new user role you created and click
<strong>save</strong> at last.</span></p>
<p><span>Please wait for some time and then check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are still having the issue, please confirm the following information:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Please send us a screenshot for “Some of the users in my organization does not have the add-ins icon enabled.”.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are the affected users newly created?</span></p>

            <p>Hi, Robert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the affected users are new users. Read: there are old users that are affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already did create a new user role and enabled all the options. Assigned those to 2 of the affected users. The add-in icon is still greyed out (not clickable). And yes, I allowed sufficient amount of time for the changes to take effect, around 30 minutes
 or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have resolved this, though. I did a workaround by opening the mailbox in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My question now is this, how can this issue be resolved by those users who are assigned a license that does not allow their mailboxes to be opened in Outlook?</span></p>
<p>

            Hey Ross,
<div><br />
<div>It's been a while since I've seen this question, but I believe you need to add your second alias as a delegate. Once you've done that, you should be able to send email as that alias. The steps below walk you through adding a delegate in Outlook for Mac:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Tools</span>&nbsp;menu, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Accounts</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the Exchange account that you will use to access the delegated items, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced</span>, and then click the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Delegates</span>&nbsp;tab..</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">People I am a delegate for</span>, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Add</span>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmac2.microsoft.com%2fhelp%2fGetOpenContent.aspx%3fassetid%3d3b5d5126-b854-4c9a-9b72-428fd4cc2f1e%26amp%3blocale%3den-us%26amp%3bproduct%3doffice%26amp%3bversion%3d14" />.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Type the name of the alias, and then click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Find</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the name, and then click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span>.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>I'm having exactly the same issue. Have been having it since downloading the Skype "app" from the store, as opposed to the Skype Download from the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My version is 12.1815.209.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I send a message, which says "sending" for a good couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Once it has sent, the person on the other side (using the same version as me) doesn't receive a notification.</p>
<p>Same thing happens for them, they get stuck on "sending" and once its sent I don't get a notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is madness! I've returned to using email as it is much faster and more reliable, but that defeats the whole object of having Skype installed!<br />
<br />
And it looks very silly when you're immediately replying to someone but they don't receive it for a couple of hours!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I noticed this problem starting about 5 days ago.&nbsp; Inbound messages (to me) seem to arrive without delay but I am not certain about this.&nbsp; Outbound messages sometimes show as Sent immediately, other times they can range from taking 15-20 seconds to not sending
 for 3-5 minutes or not at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In each case I have confirmed the recipient is online and active.&nbsp; In fact I can receive messages from them sent after I hit Send and my outbound to them is still not shown as Sent.&nbsp; I also separately confirm they haven't received them so it is not just
 a bug with the status message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do notice that sending a second message to the same recipient seems to force the Send operation and can make it send even after it sat in the Sending... state for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ALSO TRIED THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS AND IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also being experienced by other users in my office and believe it started around the same time with exactly the same symptoms.</p>

    <title>How can I create a hyper link to a file that ignores when the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russell jones jr  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I create a hyper link to a file that ignores when the directory structure is moved to a new drive letter or home directory</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying for hours to create a hyperlink that is immune to having my directory tree and linked files moved.&nbsp; I am pretty sure I need to use relative paths and have searched online, but the answers really don't address this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a directory structure like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First Directory </p>
<p>&nbsp;| Primary Document</p>
<p>+- Organization</p>
<p>&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Doc A</p>
<p>&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Doc B</p>
<p>&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doc C</p>
<p>+- Operation</p>
<p>&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (more docs)</p>
<p>+- Taxes</p>
<p>&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (more docs)</p>
<p>+- Financial</p>
<p>&nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(more docs)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along with other overview information, the "Primary Document" has links to all of the documents in the subsequent subdirectories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am authoring&nbsp;"Primary Document" on my local drive.&nbsp; The path to it is "C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\Documents\First Directory\Primary Document.docx".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file path in&nbsp;a hyper link would look something like this "File:///c:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\Documents\First Directory\Organization\Doc A.Docx"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be distributing this document to other team members on a&nbsp;USB stick.&nbsp;"First Directory" will be&nbsp;off the root directory of the USB stick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I&nbsp;copy the directory structure to the USB stick the links no longer work.&nbsp; Depending on what I am trying, I get Word thinking that I have specified an URL so it doesn't prepend the
File:///, or file not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the "Update Links on Save" unchecked.&nbsp; I have tried changing Hyperlink base to things like ".\" without the quotes.&nbsp; Word seems to ignore this.&nbsp; I have left it blank. This results in adding
File:///e:%5d to the file name in the Hyperlink. I also tried a lot of other things hoping I could luck into the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read many documents that I have found online and none of the suggestions/advice has worked or helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at my wits end, which might not be very far ;-), and would appreciate and help.</p>

            <p>To see how to implement relative hyperlink&nbsp;paths in Word, check out the field code solution I've posted at:<br />
<a href="http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/154379-Word-Fields-and-Relative-Paths-to-External-Files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/154379-Word-Fields-and-Relative-Paths-to-External-Files</a></p>
<p>Note that, with child folders to work with, you'll need to retain those parts of the folder paths that branch off from the folder from which you're hyperlinking. Also, changing the field code as described in the link doesn't change the display text. So,
 if you have the paths displayed there, you'll probably want to at most only retain the child parts of them - or use a descriptive display text that's independent of the path.</p>

            <p>Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.&nbsp; This appears to be exactly what I am looking for. But...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my document the Hyperlinks have don't have the {FILENAME /p}.&nbsp; Instead they have
file:///. I replaced the /// with / / and the links worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saved the file, copied it to the USB stick and then opened the USB stick version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The modified lines were replaces with {HYPERLINK}. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I saved the original version, closed it and then reopened it and it had the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like Word "fixes" the "errors" for me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>(it is interesting that the text associated with the Hyperlink isn't shown when I alt-F9 but remains correct)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>I wouldn't expect your HYPERLINK field to have the &nbsp;{FILENAME /p} in it at the outset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process described in the linked post is all about how to use the &nbsp;{FILENAME /p} field, instead of the static part of the path below the folder from which the hyperlink is running, to provide the relative path. Simply omitting that part of the path is
 not a reliable way of obtaining a relative path.</p>
