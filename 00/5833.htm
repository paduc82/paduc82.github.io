            <p>Hello Johann Strauss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I understand your phone has difficulities providing internet connectivity to some of your apps.</p>
<p>In the situation you're describing I would first test if the issue occures only during Mobile Data connection or maybe when connected through WiFi as well.</p>
<p>If the situation is the same on both types of connection, I would recommend resintalling the apps in question, hold your finger on the app in apps list, select remove, install again from the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the reinstallation of the app does not change the situation, next step I would recommend to take is&nbsp;a devices Hard Reset, make sure though that you will process full devies backup beforehand, below you will find information about the two processes.</p>

    <title>Nokia 5800 Gap in casing, possible solution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruvann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 5800 Gap in casing, possible solution</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My previous post concerning a suggestion on a possible solution was deleted, so now I will just ask...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT exactly will VOID the warrantee?</p>
<p>What can a person do about the gap in the casing of the 5800XM?</p>
<p>Do people just have to keep sending back and reject all pthe phones with these faults until a person is lucky enough to one day get a flawless model?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggested a possible solution seeing that none is given by Nokia for their lack of build quality on this phone.</p>
<p>So anyone with any ideas, please help</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

                </div>

<p>Or maybe I should give it to a buddy of mine who is a qualified repair technician and he can try my idea on a solution to seal the gap...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or will that void the warrantee?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is still... What exactly will void the warrantee ?</p>

<p>The warranty terms and FAQs give information about the warranty:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/repair-and-recycle/european-limited-warranty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/repair-and-recycle/european-limited-warranty</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your suggestion would have voided the warranty because you are modifying the product.&nbsp; A care point would have clearly seen the results of your suggestion and declared the warranty void.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
If you need any further clarification of the warranty terms contact nokia care by phone or email.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately all that people can do if they are unhappy with the gap in the casing is to return the phone to the retailer.&nbsp; If that is not an option seek help from a nokia care point or complain to nokia using the "contact us" link. Nothing can be done
 to help here.</p>

<p>hey thanks for the help...</p>
<p>but it be the same as sticking sellotape around the side of the phone? hehe except it wouldn't look as bad...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's outside the phone.</p>
<p>It's like making a kind of 'molded' cover for your phone.</p>
<p>If i could get my hands on a dummy 5800 then i can get someone i know to mold me a silicone or latex kind of cover.</p>
<p>That wouldn't void the warrantee would it?</p>
<p>And that basically my solution...</p>
<p>It's a phone cover.</p>
<p>Some like them already exist, they call them "cellphone condoms". The only problem is they make them a little bit too big, then they are kinda loose around the phone.</p>
<p>I just want one that fit's tightly over the phone</p>

<p>It wouldn't be the same as sellotape isn't permanent and can be removed without trace.&nbsp; Your method is permanent and does leave a trace so it does void the warranty.&nbsp; Your method may also cause damage to the plastic depending on the exact type of product
 used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most 5800xm's have a gap there, some are larger than others. Some people are bothered by it, others are not.&nbsp; Even on a 5800xm with a large gap i've yet to see dust under the screen. How you deal with the gap is your choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said above if you want help with the gap try the retailer/care point/nokia care.</p>

<p>The limited warranty states</p>
<p>Quoted:</p>
<p>"This Limited Warranty is not enforceable if the Product has been exposed to moisture, to dampness or to extreme thermal or environmental conditions or to rapid changes in such conditions, to corrosion, to oxidation, to spillage of food or liquid or to influence
 from chemical products."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due that gap in the phone, the phone is more vulnerable to dust and also moisture from humid weather, isn't it?
<i>😞</i></p>
<p>And I'm going to the sea next week 
<i>😲</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all I'm saying is, even if it is something non permanent and I have to replace it every month or something, I'll do it.</p>
<p>As long as it can offer protection, I can't complain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again,&nbsp; I'll just mention the fact that cellphone covers are not permanent, and molding silicone to a dummy 5800 is also not permanent to my phone.</p>
<p>I'm not altering or tampering with the phone.</p>

<p>If your solution is non-permanent and doesn't require the phone to be modified in any way then it is ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you believe that the gap leaves the phone vulnerable to moisture then take the issue up with nokia using the "contact us" link near the top of the page.&nbsp; They will not respond to you here.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot dissassemble the phone to see exactly where the gap leads to, or what the cause is...</p>
<p>I know for a fact it's warping because the chances of thousands of phones being warped right out of the sales package is very very slim, nevermind the fact that the gap is entirely random.</p>
<p>Some people in the same country don't have the gap while others do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did already email Nokia but i posted here to find out if anybody had any luck so far.</p>
<p>All I could find was people sending the phones back and getting the same quality phone back again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone had any luck finding out what the reason is for this gap?</p>
<p>Cause it's kinda weird that many people have the gap and many don't.</p>
<p>It could be a very small problem being caused by a sinlge tiny screw.</p>

            while the gap in the casing doesn't cause any functional issues , if you are unhappy with the gap take the phone to any Authorised Nokia repair centre who will be happy to rectify the issue under warranty :smileyhappy:

<p>Same problem with mine. I have exhange the thing once and the shop didn't knew anything about this. The new 5800 has a smaller gap but still a gap. You'll see the light from the display on the side of the phone in the corner were the camera is.</p>
<p>Feels really bad - after all it's a highend product at about 400Euro...!</p>
<p>Next problem will probably be that sweat from my hand gets into the thing and the warranty will of course not cover this...</p>

            I took my Nokia 5800 into the Vodafone store to have the lock code problem sorted out only to have it returned to say it has water damage. I always really look after any handset i have ever used so i am lead to believe that this gap does cause problems
 including water damage. I am returning it next week to exchange for a HTC magic

    <title>inserting a row that extend the formula into a table in a protected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcb_224  say:</h3>
<h2>            inserting a row that extend the formula into a table in a protected worksheet</h2>
                    <p>I have a workbook with multiple worksheets. On the first worksheet I was able to successfully allow for a user to add a row to a protected sheet that copies the formula from the preceeding row into the new row (without having to unprotect the worksheet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is when I try to do the same steps to the other worksheets a row is inserted but it does not copy the formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it work for the first worksheet I:</p>
<p>1. formatted the required cells as a table</p>
<p>2. ensured that the "extend data range formats and formulas" in the advanced options was selected</p>
<p>3. the protection settings for the cells that include the formulas are locked and hidden</p>
<p>4.when I protect the sheet I select the following option (select unlocked cells, insert rows, sort, use autofilter)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the sheet is protected to insert a row I select an unlocked cell, go to the Insert option (in the Home ribbon) and select &nbsp;"Insert Sheet Rows".</p>
<p>The result is a new row with all the same attributes (drop down lists and formula) as the preceeding row is added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the life of me I cannot replicate this on the other worksheets (where the only difference is the options in the dropdown lists and associated terms within the formulas).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2007 Macro&#58; Interacting with other Applications</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am working on Excel 2007.&nbsp; I would like&nbsp;my VBA code to link to another Non-Microsoft Office application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: &nbsp;What are the&nbsp; best available options for performing these tasks?&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;what other&nbsp;applications are&nbsp;Excel 2007&nbsp;allowed to link to?&nbsp; I want to compare my worksheet data (Sheet 1)&nbsp;to a Table with data.&nbsp; If my worksheet data is similar than I want
 the Table data&nbsp;to populate on&nbsp;my Worksheet (Sheet 1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><strong>Excel&nbsp;: Sheet1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SL&nbsp;field&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Sec Level field</span></strong></p>
<p>Senior Loan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moody Senior Secured&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Need to replace Senior with Moody Senior Secured in the Excel Sheet 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you. I did not see my application in the list of references. Then do I assume that my Application does not have an API, or please advise if I can create an API?&nbsp; In other words, what are my options?&nbsp; You are also speaking to a novice Excel Macro 2007
 user, by the way. So you may have to spell some things out in detail.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
You can't create an API for an application, only the developer of that application can do that. So you have no chance to interact with that application.</p>
<p>Theoretical you can use the WinAPI FindWindowEx/SendMessage to "communicate" with an application, but this is really hard to do and far away from your skill if you are a novice.</p>
<p>For a very simple example how this can be done look here: <a href="http://www.standards.com/Office/SetVBAProjectPassword.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            What is &#34;Work and School account&#34; and User ID&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I checked my accounts. To complete that for MS, I visited: microsoft.com , pressed Sign In, entered my e-mail and saw two accounts "Work and School" and "Personal". The "Work and School" is some surprise for me. So, I tried to sign in, but forgot password.
 I tried to restore password, but the form didn't accept my e-mail as User ID and gave a message "<span>The
<em>user ID</em> you entered <em>does not exist</em>."</span></p>
<p><span>Please, tell me where are using "Work and school account". Is it only for Office 365? What if I used Office 365 never before? How can I check that? I have registered my account a several year ago and some things are new for me.</span></p>
<p><span>In support I got a reccomendation to contact by </span>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Contact-Office-365-for-business-support-Admin-Help-32A17CA7-6FA0-4870-8A8D-E25BA4CCFD4B?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US . But I'm not admin of Office 365.</p>

<p>Hi Pc!omg!,<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing the information in PM. For "account name" I mean your user ID like user@contoso.com.<br />
<br />
For "It looks like a user is used with more than one account" notification,&nbsp;<br />
it means <span>your Office 365 work or school account and Microsoft account have the same account alias.</span><br />
Here are two articles to help you resolve this:</p>

<p>Hi Randall,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to my knowledge, the email sender should depend on the Floe template you are using. You can try to change the email sender and test it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have further questions about Microsoft Flow, I would suggest post your questions in
<a href="https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Flow-Community/ct-p/FlowCommunity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Flow community</a>. It is the specific channel that handles Microsoft Flow related questions and queries.

 I know that the VisioLR.cab file is in that folder because I went to the CD when it was not in install mode and looked in that folder and it was there. So what's up with this? If I didn't know any better I'd say Microsoft is just trying to ____ me off seeing
 as they have done such a great job of that with every product of theirs I have ever used - and, no I can't choose not to use it, because this if for my job and that's what I'm forced to use.

            Nope. I finally figured out how to do what I wanted to do in Visio 2003, but for what I'm working on, it would be far easier if I could do it in 2007.

            You need a program or website which offers streaming radio stations. A good startpoint for this is

<h2>            Field Validation&#58; Only allow numbers, dashes and upper case letters</h2>
                    <p>In Access 2010, I have the following field-level validation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not Like "* *" And (Like "*[A-Z]*" Or Like "*[0-9]*" Or Like "*-*")</p>
<p>
</p><p>This prevents the user (or data import I suppose) from entering spaces or anything that's not a letter, number, dash (or any combination of letters, numbers and dashes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's what I want, but I also want prevent the user from entering any LOWER case letters. All letters must be upper case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I modify the validation to prevent lower case letters?</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I tried appending another table that had lower case letters in the field, they were changed to upper case, plus any values that had "illegal" characters (anything other than letters, numbers and hyphens) were flagged as not passing the validation criteria.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a distribution list from the admin console in O365. After a while the list became visible in the webmail app from O365 , but still it is not available in Outlook, or Skype for business(I have read on a thread that you can manage contact groups
 in Skype for business via a distribution list). I have tried restart, waited for couple of hours, still nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two question:</p>
<p>1. What can I do in order to use the distribution list I created in Outlook desktop app?</p>
<p>2. Is it possible to add a distribution list in Skype for business?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p><span>Hi Radu,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Generally, the distribution list won’t be shown in outlook client or OWA, since it’s just like a name list not a really group (have no storage) which is different from O365 group. Thus, you just can view O365 groups in Outlook.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For your question:</span></p>
<p><span>1. To use a distribution list, as I mentioned, it’s a list with some members. When you want to send emails to all members in the list, you just need to type the name of distribution list in the
<strong>To</strong> field and click <strong>Check Names</strong> button.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ba5527b-4c50-4277-a963-d509158acd47?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ba5527b-4c50-4277-a963-d509158acd47?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Yes, you can add a distribution list as contacts group to your Skype for Business. You just need to search the distribution list address and right click to add to contacts. Then it will be shown under Skype for Business including all members.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2817838a-9c29-426f-b44c-ae87463ba604?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2817838a-9c29-426f-b44c-ae87463ba604?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Iry,<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, I did not reply earlier as I still try to understand what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you replied I have created a O365 group so at the moment I have 2 groups in O365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One is a distribution list which is available in OWA, Outlook and in Skype for Business. (it just became available in Outlook during today)<br />
</p>
<p>The second is a O365 group, which is available only in OWA. (After I created it, it was available in Outlook - but without the expand option, now when I did re-check, it is not available any more in Outlook).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I can use my distribution list in Outlook(to send emails to a group of users) and also in Skype (in order to have a managed contacts group). This means problems are solved, but I still do not understand how they were solved. :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Radu</p>

<h2>            What happend to the remove-migrationbatch -force parameter&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We have several migration batches which have the state of stopping. However, this state remains for hours and hours and we like it to force stopping it. A while ago I could use the cmdlet:</p>
<p><em>stop-migrationbatch &lt;name&gt; -<strong>force</strong></em></p>
<p>According the documentation this force option still should be available. However whatever I try i get this error message:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'force'.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">+ CategoryInfo : InvalidArgument: (:) [Remove-MigrationUser], ParameterBindingException</span><br />

<p>Hi MarcelDroop,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I understand your concerns about the article. I have confirmed the information from our related team. The parameter of ‘force’ cannot be used for Exchange online. Since the article hasn’t been updated, sorry for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>About your issue, to avoid confusing other community members, one thread has one question or issue. I suggest you post a new thread with following detailed information in our forum. Then, we can focus on it to provide corresponding troubleshooting steps.
 Moreover, doing that will help other users experiencing the same issue seek out the thread more quickly.&nbsp;Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>1. Which migration did you do?<br />
2. When you mentioned that the old batch failed, did you get any error message?<br />
3. Have you tried re-running the batch?<br />
4. If possible, can you provide more detailed information about your current situation?</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My e-mail account has just automatically migrated from Hotmail to Outlook Online and now all my new unread messages are not highlighted so I can't tell the difference between read and unread e-mails, which is very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My research shows that on the Outlook programme you can choose "View" and change this but I can't find a similar solution for Outlook on-line.</p>

<p>
</p><p>However, that's the problem. New messages used to have all the features you stated and now after the migration to Outlook, a new, Unread, message looks exactly the same as a Read one. They present themselves in exactly the same was so you can differentiate
 between them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further thoughts appreciated. It's as if they have been read before I have read them!</p>

    <title>OneNote LTI for Blackbaud - Issues&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kim ashcraft &#40;ashcraft_k&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote LTI for Blackbaud - Issues&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of OneNote and Classroom Notebook.&nbsp; <em>However</em>, I have been trying to get the OneNote Classroom Notebook LTI for the Blackbaud LMS going for all of my teachers at our school.&nbsp; I finally have gotten it to the point that I am able to use
 the connections tab and I've got it syncing assignments and grades to the Blackbaud Assignment Center and Grade Book.&nbsp; I can't say that it exactly syncs them religiously - sometimes they show up on the OneNote side but not on the Blackbaud side - but at least
 it is working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two problems I'd like help with.&nbsp; I don't think they are related, but I guess it's possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When I click the "Connections" tab to connect with my LMS, I am asked to sign in with a tenant URL and username and password.&nbsp; Initially this didn't work at all - I wasn't able to sign in because over the summer (2018) we converted to SSO with Blackbaud/Azure
 AD.&nbsp; Because Blackbaud now uses our Microsoft password to authenticate and it's an automatic pass-through, any 3rd party partner product asking for a password for sign-in will not work.&nbsp; I developed a workaround by creating another user in the Blackbaud system
 and NOT giving it the SSO credentials, and then employing that alias user and adding it as a teacher in the target class for which I'm trying to connect the Notebook.&nbsp; It works, but it sure is a messy way to do it.&nbsp; I don't know if this is a Blackbaud issue
 or a Microsoft issue, but I sure hope someone comes up with a solution for this.&nbsp; Any clarity would be appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. A student is supposed to be able to follow a LTI link that is created within Blackbaud to access and sign in to the created Notebook for a particular course.&nbsp; In Blackbaud, this LTI is done through pulling a "Learning Tool" into the class' website.&nbsp; After
 a teacher selects "OneNote" for the Learning Tool, it creates a link for the student.&nbsp; I'm the one who enabled the OneNote LTI, so I know that I've set it up correctly from that side.&nbsp; I've tested this dozens of times with different classes, teachers and students
 and the link consistently says that the teacher has not connected a Notebook for the class yet.&nbsp; And yet, I
<em>have </em>created it because I'm already syncing assignments and grades to it.&nbsp; From my understanding, the teacher should not have to add the student names to the Notebook in the set-up phase- this is what the LTI is supposed to do automatically - or at
 least allow the students to access the Notebook through the LTI in Blackbaud without having to open their OneDrive or NoteBook once it has been created.&nbsp; Additionally, all of our students have student Microsoft accounts that are enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I played around with the School Data Sync, and implemented it for a test class (and in this situation, it did automatically create the Notebooks because it created them through the Teams Education function.)&nbsp; I decided it was too much trouble to manage the
 student rostering for all the teachers.&nbsp; All we need is Classroom Notebook to go along with our Blackbaud LMS.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like I'm knowledgeable enough about the process, but it's just not working how it is supposed to be working.&nbsp; I've been trying to get the LTI working for over a year - way before we went to the SSO.&nbsp; I'd love to get all of my teachers using Notebook,
 but it's going to be difficult if I can't get the LTI link working.&nbsp; Is there any help that anyone can offer?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Kim&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Kim,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since SSO is configured with Blackbaud ID and Blackbaud is a third party LMS system, I’ll suggest you contact
<a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/support/support.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Blackbaud support</a> to make sure SSO is configured properly. Your second issue “LTI link is not working” should also be related to configuration.

            I had similar issues, about&nbsp; 4 weeks ago, using a full exchange mail account &amp; 2x IMAP accounts, the problem was caused by the Kaspersky anti spam add-in. I exchanged extensive logs/info with kaspersky support, including new Profiles, completely removing
 Kaspersky, then re-installing, the problem became intermittent, as of this time the add-in is enabled in Kaspersky control Panel and all appears OK<br />

    <title>Launching UserForm error - File not found - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jm_618  say:</h3>
<h2>            Launching UserForm error - File not found</h2>
                    <p>I currently have Excel 2010.&nbsp; I created a spreadsheet with macros containing some formatting functionality ie page size, orientation, page breaks, etc.&nbsp; I also created a userform for the user to choose a specific formatting option based on the data that
 has been pulled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, I save the xlsm file on my desktop as MyTestFile.xlsm and made changes to it as I was tweaking the code.&nbsp; Once I knew the file was good, I went to rename the file to ProductionFile.xlsm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the macro that open the userform in ProductionFile.xlsm, I get the following message: MyTestFile.xlsm&nbsp;could not be found.&nbsp; Check the spelling of the name, and verify that the location is correct.&nbsp; If you are trying to open the file from your most
 recently used files, make sure that the file has not been renamed, moved, or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any insight on how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all.</p>
