<p>Hi Derek,</p>
<p>Could you check the following points?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Have you tried in different browsers? Have you tried clearing the cache of the browser?<br />
2.&nbsp;Are the files under your OneDrive for Business? Does the same issue happen to other libraries on your Team Site?<br />
3.&nbsp;Can you create new documents with the Office web apps?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            How do I DISPLAY the Contacts &#40;This Computer Only&#41;&#63;  It has disappeared from Contacts page but still visible in the Address Book list</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 Contacts folders:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts Outlook</p>
<p>Contacts iCloud</p>
<p>Contacts (this computer only)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, all 3 of them appeared in the Outlook contacts window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, only the first 2 appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I add a new contact, it goes by default into the (this computer only) file. &nbsp;I can't find any help about how to make this folder re-appear. &nbsp;All the help is about the properties on the other folders. &nbsp;It seems like (this computer only) SHOULD always
 be there and visible but isn't on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how to MAKE the (this computer only) folder appear in my list of folders (to be clear - the list of folders when typing ctrl-3 in outlook 2013)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey!! Well yes, I can!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is sitting as a subfolder under the Trash folder (along with a Calendar folder)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is, I can't see how to undelete it. &nbsp;I have tried to drag the entire folder OUT of the trash and back into it's correct place. &nbsp;Sometimes a RIGHT CLICK might reveal an undelete option (but no)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see it is still USING the Contacts folder while sitting in trash since if I add a new contact, it puts it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how I might undelete it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(note - I guess the option is to create a NEW Contacts folder and just MOVE them into it all but want to check there isn't a better, less problematic way - if I do that, I have to then fully kill the old folder and make sure NEW contacts go into the new
 one I created)</p>

            <p>Hi Michael, </p>
<p>Adding to an old post, just in case you were able to figure out what to do. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have these damn This Computer Only folder. (left over from 100 different problems I had switching from Exchange to IMAP and nearly losing everything.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, today I think I have the same problem you did.&nbsp; Contacts in the "contacts" folder, and nothing in the "Contacts (this computer only)" folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specific problems. </p>
<p>1) when inside an email and I click To... it's pointing to the empty "Contacts (this computer only)" folder and I can't find any place to change that.&nbsp; I should be able to type in "Robert..." and have it do a search. &nbsp;If I could change it to my other Contacts
 folder, I would be a happy camper. </p>
<p>2) when the To.. button opens up the name search screen, I'm always pointing to the stupid (this computer only) folder.&nbsp; I have to manually select the good Contacts folder to find a name.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;when I click on the People icon at the bottom of the screen, I see both folders there, and even though the good Contacts is at the top, it opens the other&nbsp;empty "Contacts (this computer only)"&nbsp;folder and I have to manually select the good folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please write back if you have a fix for any of this.&nbsp; You can use my personal email if you like John at ViridianTech.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            'Page' is a vague concept in Word, which is not a page layout application. The text is flowed to the margins and graphics, headers and footers etc are in different 'layers' of the document and as such cannot be processed together with the underlying pages.<br />
<br />
If the document is simply text and you format the first paragraph on each 'page' with the Heading 1 style, then switch to Outline view and collapse the vie to show only heading one. You can drag the formatted paragraphs around to the required order and the
 text that accompanies them on the 'pages' will move with them. When you are happy with the new order, switch back to print layout view and reformat the paragraphs back to their original styles.<br />

    <title>Can no longer access hotmail emails from Outlook.com using Thunderbird - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gazthewiz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can no longer access hotmail emails from Outlook.com using Thunderbird</h2>
                    <p>There are other posts about similar issues, and I have tried all the suggestions, but nothing completely solves the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Thunderbird on my Apple iMac desktop computer for several years without any problems. It is configured using the correct official POP settings from within the Outlook.com "POP &amp; IMAP" Options. I use POP because I want to retain copies of
 emails in Thunderbird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week, I started getting error messages saying my user name or password was incorrect, and I could no longer receive emails addressed to my hotmail account. I could, however, send emails from Thunderbird using my hotmail account. I could also use the
 Outlook.com webmail interface without any problems, but I absolutely despise that webmail interface, and wish to use Thunderbird exclusively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other community posts talk about 2-step verification. I have checked and I do NOT have 2-step verification turned on (nor has it ever been turned on). Furthermore, there is no option shown in the security settings, to add a code to an app or device
 (this confirms that 2-step verification is OFF).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other posts talk about using an email alias (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) as a work-around. I tried this, and it does allow Thunderbird to retrieve my incoming hotmail emails, BUT it prevents me from SENDING hotmail emails from Thunderbird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's hotmail account was initially unaffected, but today it is behaving the same way. She also uses Thunderbird, but on a Windows 10 laptop. I refuse to believe that this issue is anything to do with either of our computers, as they are totally different
 machines, running totally different operating systems, and different versions of Thunderbird. They started "playing-up" several days apart, not simultaneously. We both keep our computers up-to-date, and neither of us had made any changes to Thunderbird prior
 to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plenty of other hotmail users are complaining of the same issue affecting other third-party email clients, not just Thunderbird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is clearly an issue with the rollout of the new Outlook.com, which is interfering with the ability of properly-configured third-party email clients to access hotmail via Outlook.com using POP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely hope that Microsoft recognises that this issue is of their making, and that they are working on resolving it as quickly as possible.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS... I have just tried turning on 2-step verification, and then turning it off again. Nothing has changed......</p>

            <p>Hi, navelia89</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have previously tried that, and it does allow me to receive hotmail emails, but it does not allow me to SEND hotmail emails from Thunderbird (as I explained in my post).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So while it does represent a partial workaround, for me it isn't a satisfactory solution....<br />

            <p>Thanks, navelia89</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every possible trick I can think of, and did make a small amount of progress (I hadn't edited the outgoing server settings in Thunderbird to show *** Email address is removed for privacy *** instead of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</p>

</p><p>I have now managed to send an email from my alias account, but there is no way I can send a message from my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting a timeout error when I do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I can believe that it is working for you, including being able to send emails - but only from the alias address (ie *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you actually tried sending a message from your *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account using the workaround?? I would be very interested to know if that works for you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I'm able to send emails from my original hotmail address in Thunderbird with this workaround. So, when I send a message the recipient can see that is from ***@ hotmail.com. What I did was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Setting up the alias: ***@ outlook.com (as explained by aaFn)</p>
<p>2. In Thunderbird - Account Settings - Identity - Mail address: ***@ hotmail.com</p>
<p>3. Then, also in Thunderbird: Account Settings - Server config - Username: ***@ outlook.com (my alias, under IMAP settings). Actually, this is the only place where I put the alias on Thunderbird.</p>
<p>

            Thanks, navelia89
<p>
</p><p>I have followed what you did, except I am using POP and you are using IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now getting my hotmail email messages, BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still could not send a message from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a timeout error....</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong>Sending of the message failed.</strong><br />
<strong>The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) smtp-mail.outlook.com timed out. Try again.</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was checking my aliases, I noticed that I had the following aliases listed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (primary alias)</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (where ### is different from *** - this is an alias that I already had added previously)</p>
<p>and a third one that is just ***, without the @hotmail.com or @outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried entering the *** as the Outgoing server | User Name - it worked! I can now send emails from Thunderbird using my hotmail email.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So for the benefit of all others with this issue.....</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1&gt; Set up an alias *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (if you don't already have one). Note that if *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is not already in use, you can use that, to make it almost the same as your hotmail address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2&gt; Microsoft apparently sets up another alias when you go into your account, which is just the *** part of your hotmail address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3&gt; In Thunderbird Account Settings | Default Identity | Email address enter your hotmail address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 4&gt; In Thunderbird Account Settings | Server Settings (for hotmail account) enter User Name *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (or *** Email address is removed for privacy *** if you made it similar to the hotmail address)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 5&gt; In Thunderbird Account Settings | Outgoing server (SMTP)&nbsp; change the User Name for Server smtp-mail.outlook.com to *** to match the alias mentioned in Step 2</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Voila! Thunderbird now behaves exactly the same as it used to for your hotmail emails (receiving and sending)!
</strong></p>

<h2>            extremely poor customer service, no one to lodge a complaint</h2>
                    <p>I have experienced extremely poor customer care over the phone. My call was not technical but account related as I wanted to combine two accounts - one I registered with office, the other with windows. The rep was very rude, disinterested and &nbsp;unhelpful.
 When I asked to speak to supervisor they just put the phone down and was left for an hour before I had to hang up to go into work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nowhere to make a complaint on your website. Looking at other similar posts on this forum, moderators only give very general contact information (the contact us page), which leads you to page where there is no specific information about who to contact
 about my particular issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is probably the worst customer care I have ever received. To top it off Microsoft provides no direct line to speak to someone regarding poor customer care. Even in this forum there is no topic concerning customer care, only specific products.</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite new to all this and looking for some guidance. I'm in the UK and I speak to someone in the USA quite often and we're looking to get the phone charges down. I'm not able to call them, they can only call me. Can they call me from their landline to
 a skype number? How does this work? Do I need a subscription to cover these calls? Many thanks from a total newbie. Any advice would be gratefully received.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best and most recommended way would be Skype to Skype call, both you and the other user could install Skype on their phone or PC and you will need internet connection to make free call.</p>
<p>However, you have option to purchase Skype number where you could give them your number and when they call the number, it connect to your Skype:</p>

            Hi VivHg 
<br />
<br />If you get a Skype number, that will allow them or anyone else to call you from a landline or non-Skype enabled phone - that call will be charged to them the same as any other landline to landline call
<br />
<br />For you to call them on a landline, you would need Skype credit to call that landline
<br />
<br />If both of you have Skype, you can call each other, either an Audio or Video call and that would be free, Skype to Skype calls are free . . .

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for much for your help. They can only call from a landline. So if I go ahead and subscribe and get a local telephone number to them am I right in thinking when they call it they get charged at local rates but the phone call will be diverted to Skype
 on my phone?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;TeWil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several factors as to why you were unable to properly use your Bluetooth headphones on Skype. However, to isolate your issue, check first if it can be use with Skype. If so:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you're using the latest version of skype.</p>
<p>2. Turn on your Bluetooth device to make it discoverable.</p>
<p>3. Pair your Bluetooth device with your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If these steps wont work, try the below steps:</p>
<p>1. Quit Skype.</p>
<p>2. Press windows key + R&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Type %appdata%/Microsoft</p>
<p>4. Rename your Skype for desktop folder to Skype for desktop_old</p>
<p>5. Check if your audio settings if your Bluetooth device is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the said troubleshooting steps still did not work, try this:</p>
<p>1. Quit skype</p>
<p>2. Press windows key + R</p>
<p>3. Type devmgmt.msc&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Click on Bluetooth.</p>
<p>5. And update the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and I look forward to your reply!</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Your code works if it is a DOS based file with 0D0A (CR-LF) as EOL but will fail on Unix/Linux based files that have only LF as EOL. Have saying that, I want also to state that there is nothing wrong with work-arounds as long as one is aware of the limitations
 but imho it is always better to correct it at the source if possible.</p>

    <title>Cannot change the ActivePrinter in Powerpoint 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot change the ActivePrinter in Powerpoint 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I need to allow my students to make prints from the slideshow by clicking a button which runs a print macro. Printing works fine, however the default printer for my computer lab is set as an Adobe PDF maker for some reason (perhaps to keep students from
 printing at will). In order to print another printer must first be selected in the print dialogue box (the printer is on a network).</p>
<p>Is there a way to change the active printer in Powerpoint? The Application.ActivePrinter is apparently read only, and I can't seem to find any other controls.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions or advice.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Application.ActivePrinter is read-only but you should use ActivePresentation.PrintOptions.ActivePrinter instead.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>ActivePresentation.PrintOptions.ActivePrinter ="Printer Name"</p>
<p>ActivePresentation.PrintOut</p>

<h2>            W10 14267 - Unable to get Builds - Error 0x800700005</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 W10s, one on Enterprise and 1 on Pro.&nbsp; The Enterprise just went to 14271.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pro started showing a error that it was unable to get any more builds on the Build prior to 14267.&nbsp; I ran the Command - sfc /scannow and a problem was found and it kicked in and got 14267.&nbsp; A few days ago, the Pro again started firing the nag to go to
 the FIX and the Fix just fires the nag that Something has gone wrong and then Error 0x800700005.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the full scope on this Pro 14267 including sfc /scannow, update troubleshooting and more.&nbsp; I even created an ISO for 14267 and this re-install did not fix the error.&nbsp; It is just stuck at 14267 and refusing to move 14271.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a fix for this one?</p>

<h2>            Unable to install Microsoft Security Essentials in Vista Home Premium</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried several times to install MSE on my Dell laptop.&nbsp; I have Vista Home Premium, Service Pack 2, 32-bit operating system.&nbsp; I'm getting hung up on "Status: Installing Security Essentials" step.&nbsp; It goes on seemingly forever without completing the installation.&nbsp;
 I'm not getting an error message, but the installation doesn't finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press the "cancel" button at the bottom of the installation window, that seemingly goes on forever to, without ever cancelling.&nbsp; I end up having to restart the computer to get out of the installation/cancellation process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions on the Windows help page, up through rebooting through the Selective Startup mode.&nbsp; Still no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 6 brought me to this forum....HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a little more info that may or may not help out with a solution...</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left">I uninstalled Charter Security Suite before I tried to install MSE.&nbsp; I was previously using Charter Security Suite as my security program, but was told that it's junk.&nbsp; I'm not sure if there would be any remnants of antivirus/antispyware
 stuff still on my computer.&nbsp; I don't see any obvious antivirus/spyware stuff on the Uninstall tool.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve got one computer which would not accept a reinstall of MSE and I’m not keen at jumping thru hoops to install any antimalware program – there are plenty of alternatives.&nbsp; So it’s now running Avast Free plus Malwarebytes Free for occasional on-demand
 scans as needed.&nbsp; Some users report the new version of Avast seems to slow down their computer performance a bit but in my case it’s not enough to warrant using a different program. &nbsp;Sometimes it's a trial and error situation to determine which program is
 best suited for you and your computer - I've got two Vista computers and they tend to be a bit sluggish anyway so you might need to experiment a bit to determine what program runs best. While a reformat/reinstall (or restore to factory settings if that''s
 an option) would eliminate your issue I don't think it's worth it just to install an antimalware program...but that's an option if you want to do that (be sure you remove whatever trial version was preinstalled by the computer vendor).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And - the links provided in my first post provide some good reading ref antimalware programs. There's several good free alternatives plus "for fee" programs out there.</span></p>

<h2>            Unwanted ads in outlook</h2>
                    I clicked the thread&nbsp;for permanently deleting ads from outlook and I still receive them. Is there more information that I should know about this service? What do I do to get rid of them? I don't buy products because of ads, I research them more and buy
 based on that research. Therefore, these ads don't work for me and I really would like them to disappear.

<h2>            Maps Not working in UAE &#40;Dubai&#41; - Lumia 830</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using the Nokia Lumia 830 for past 1 year. Though the phone is no less than awesome, but the thing which bothers me is that Here Maps, Here Drive+, Sygeic Navigation apps not working properly / or not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The maps get my location very easily, show me the route map as well, but as soon as i start the navigation, the pointer just doesn't move.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested other navigation apps as well (which were present on the App Store like GPS Navigation, Gmaps etc.) but no success at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Here Maps, Drive in India, and there the maps worked smoothly. Also, I have tried the offline maps, but there is always the problem of getting the location right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can anybody advise or troubleshoot this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>AUTOMATE FIFO METHOD IN DATA TABLE - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            AUTOMATE FIFO METHOD IN DATA TABLE</h2>
                    <p><strong>Problem set:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Link:&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/x/s!ApFrAm6d_S2wgynKXBvNRSJozGdA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's consider there are some cow farms.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>The company feeds them from several suppliers and all the costs are inserted in a table like the one in the link.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since they don't eat all the feed, there is the need to find how much they ate and compute the FIFO price for each Feed type. All of this happens in the same table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The objective is to compute a formula so that I can find the FIFO price for each feed type and for each Farm, all in the same table, consdering there are more costs on that table and that at the end of each month the total feed consumption is computed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I do this using a formula?</p>
<p><br />
Thank you!<br />

    <title>N900 - refuses to switch on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n900blazer  say:</h3>
<h2>            N900 - refuses to switch on</h2>
                    I had been using my N900 for 2 weeks without any issues. I never updated the software. Last night I was trying to take a picture and opened the camera lens cover. Accidentally I pressed the power button instead of the camera capture key while trying to
 take the picture. The display went off. I also found the phone felt warmer than usual. I took the battery out, put it in and tried again. No success. This time the phone did seem to be getting hot. I took the battery out and tried several hours later. No effect
 - the phone wasn't feeling warm either. I tried both the USB and wall charger - the LED was glowing green, but the phone wouldn't turn on. Now even with the charger connected, the LED doesn't glow. Being a Sunday, I can't contact Nokia Care till tomorrow.
 Breaks my heart to think the hardware could get messed up so easily. We've had several Nokias in the family but not a high end one like N900. I've tried everything suggested in other forurms (including Maemo). I tried to update so

<p>You didn't upgrade the software?!?! gaah! so many people still haven't updated, it's crazy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That actually sounds a bit more like a hardware failure than anything else..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than using the power button, what happens if you plug the phone into a computer? does it power up (does it display the nokia logo)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the phone power up (even if it does not boot) if you plug it into a computer with the battery removed?</p>

<p>Thanks! No, I didn't update the software thinking I would do it leisurely. And it was working great till a couple of days ago. I used it very often for Skype calls and browsing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did try connecting the phone to the PC without the battery. The status LED glows green. No logo appears, no sound or anything. The same thing happens even when I try with the battery in the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in love with the phone. But this power off thing scares me now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So do you think the phone is dead or is it just the battery?</p>

<p>I'd like to believe it's a one off. I can only be sure if someone tries the same on their phone - switch on the camera (open camera cover) and press the power button instead of the capture key.&nbsp; Please do it at your own risk :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really love this phone. But I'm going back to India in a few days. The US warranty won't help there. Knowing it is a Nokia I was betting against something going wrong. Since it has, I want to send it back to the seller and buy one (when it is released)
 in India.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW can someone confirm if this phone really will not charge if the battery is flat? This is a serious bug if it is true.</p>

<p>unfortunately, you're not the first person I've spoken to who suffered a problem related to the power button. Perhaps it is a design flaw.. If you could find someone with an X6, 5800 or 5230 handset and try swapping batteries, that might be interesting..</p>

<p>So you're telling me the firmware update could have saved me? Why doesn't Nokia sell the phone with the updated firmware?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm still willing to get a replacement phone before I leave the US, if the firmware update will protect me against these issues in future. (I have no clue if Nokia will launch this model in India at all.)</p>

<p>I'd like to see what happens when you use a different, charged battery on your phone before I said for certain that it is dead.. but it sounds more like a hardware failure.. and those tend not to occur as a result of firmware bugs or pressing the wrong button..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be you have a duff device..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've heard of loose magnets on the keyboard so it couldn't tell it was fully open.. power buttons that failed so the device would turn on then turn off again.. back cover sensors that couldn't tell the back cover was present (which means the microsd slot
 won't work) dead LCDs that have a single bright line and not much else.. GPS not working.. *MICROUSB PORTS FALLING OUT OF THE PHONE*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the N900 doesn't have the greatest build quality and things can and do go wrong.. new firmware might not help your device, but if you can charge your battery and then it seems to work again, it might stop it doing this.. if it is a software fault.. which
 is might not be</p>

<p>I had a similar problem.&nbsp; I turned the phone off and it&nbsp;was completely dead, not even my indicator light was working.&nbsp; The power button did not work to turn the phone back on, despite the battery having plenty of charge.&nbsp; In about two weeks of ownership,
 this had never happened before.&nbsp;The phone&nbsp; would&nbsp;not turn back on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what I did (and it worked):&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Unplug all&nbsp;USB cords from the phone.&nbsp;</li><li>Remove the back cover from the phone.&nbsp;</li><li>Take out the battery.&nbsp;</li><li>WAIT FOR AT LEAST 30 SECONDS.&nbsp;</li><li>Replace battery and try the power button again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>It worked for me, but I still cannot account for why the power button failed to operate.&nbsp; Let's all just keep our fingers crossed.</p>

<p>Hi Ivan,</p>
<p>You can refer to the article below to bulk create external contacts in Office 365:<br />
Bulk-create external contacts in Exchange Online</p>
<p>After that, users will be able to see the contacts in 
Outlook Web App &gt; <strong>People</strong> &gt; <strong>Directory</strong> &gt; <strong>
All</strong> <strong>Contacts</strong>. In Outlook, the contacts can be viewed in
<strong>Address Book</strong> &gt;<strong> All Address Lists </strong>&gt; <strong>All Contacts</strong>.</p>
<p>Regarding “I want to be able to download contacts to theirs computers.”, I'd like to confirm more details about this requirement. Can you share with me an example for our better understanding?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry Huang</p>

<p>Hi Ivan,</p>
<p>About the make the csv file with the correct format, we can compare the csv with the sample file and csv file generated from Outlook, then cope related column from the csv file generated in Outlook to the sample csv file. Such as the column “email address”
 in csv file generated in Outlook to the column “ExternalEmailAddress” in sample csv file.</p>
<p>About “outlook freezes when adding shared folders”, please help us collect the information below:<br />
1. Do you refer to share the 1400 contacts with others? <br />
2. How did you share the contacts, in Outlook client or OWA (Outlook Web App)?<br />
3. Is there any error message when adding shared folders? if yes, please send us a screenshot of it.</p>
<p>To upload a picture, please click Use rich formatting under the reply box and then click the Insert/Edit Media icon.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>i have done some tests about the command “import-csv .\externalcontacts.csv|%{new-mailcontact -name $_.name -displayname $_.name -externalemailaddress $_.externalemailaddress -firstname $_.firstname -lastname $_.lastname}” and found that when the
<strong>name</strong> attribute in the externalcontacts.csv file is missed, i will get the same error message as you provided. so please confirm that the
<strong>name</strong> is attribute is not empty as the screenshot shows below.</p>

<p>also, please provide the externalcontacts.csv file you saved in a workspace for our analysis(<strong>note: to protect your privacy, leave the sample contacts information and clean your own contacts information of the file</strong>). i have sent you a private

</p><p>I would expect that an support would&nbsp;be amenable to changing the&nbsp;email address associated with Office 365.&nbsp; I have not come across any poster that has managed to change the email address associated with a one time payment version of Office, and the poster
 refers to 'Office 2016', which I understood it to be a 'one time payment' version of Office 2016.&nbsp; However, posters do not always understand the difference so it could be that the poster has Office 365.</p>

            <p>What is going on is that some spammer purchased a list of addresses that included yours and that the spammer is using your address as the sender address for the junk.&nbsp; This in no way proves that your account is being used to send the messages.&nbsp; Most people
 at one time or another have their addresses spoofed.&nbsp; It's a fact of Internet life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original message was sent through UPC Communications Ireland Limited in Dublin, then PrivateSystems Networks CA in LA, then 1&amp;1 Internet AG in Berlin.&nbsp; Because the message was sent to a non-existent address (the address lists spammers sell each other
 are full of incorrect addresses), 1&amp;1 Internet tried to send the non-delivery report back to what it believes to be the sender address, which the message designates as you, even though you didn't send it.</p>

            <p>Spammers change the sending address frequently so my opinion is that the non-delivery reports shouldn't last too long.&nbsp; You could make a rule to handle them, but be careful of detecting real ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it puts your address in danger because I don't think anyone who actually receives the messages will place your address in their black list.</p>

    <title>Collapsing&#47; Uncollapsing Subtotals - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Collapsing&#47; Uncollapsing Subtotals</h2>
                    <p>I sorted data on a worksheet page in my workbook and did a Subtotal of categories.&nbsp; I collapsed the fields so only the totals show.</p>
<p>Then I went to a second page in my workbook and attempted reference the total for that specific category.&nbsp; When I pointed to the Subtotal worksheet page it was un-collapsed making it difficult to find the totals.</p>
<p>How do I get it to remain collapsed or uncollapsed when I depart from that worksheet page?</p>

<p>Hi Arthur,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting the query in our form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please descript your question more detail and put some data or provide some screenshot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I confirm that did you create a Pivot table on second page? How do you collapsed the fields in the first page? How do you subtotal of categories?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Clark</p>

<p>No, I am not making a pivot table. I am sorting numbers by State and subtotaling them to obtain the figure per State.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a snapshot of the report sheet.&nbsp; The numbers are linked to the next sheet where the figures are collected and aggregated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here you can see the completed sheet with the information mostly collapsed.&nbsp; I have left one short section open so you can see what a subtotal looks like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With all these rows open it is difficult to find the actual totals to link to the prior page.&nbsp; So the normal procedure is to collapse them so they would look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now it is easy to enter the "=" sign on page one and point to the Total cell on page two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I go to page one and enter the "=" sign and then go to the second page to point to the cell with the subtotal related to that State, the second page automatically opens up to look like the prior picture with all lines open.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With several thousand lines this makes it difficult to find the actual subtotal cell I am looking for.&nbsp; I moved into this office with this new computer yesterday and have never experienced this before.&nbsp; I presume this is something in the settings for Excel
 but I do not know where to find it.&nbsp; I hope this isn't another "improvement" from Microsoft where they make a good product worse.</p>

 is the total sheet where the information ends up.&nbsp; Each cell references the total found on the next sheet</a></p>

 you can see here if all the items were uncollapsed there would be thousands of lines on the page.&nbsp; After sorting them by State I use the Subtotal function to obtain the total by State.&nbsp; In this visual you can see the total for Alaska followed by the individual,
 uncollapsed, lines for the British Virgin Islands.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d68395d-c2f0-4d5e-85d1-20a25cf049bc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d68395d-c2f0-4d5e-85d1-20a25cf049bc?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;
 Here you can see what the totals look like when collapsed.&nbsp; We have level 1, 2 &amp; 3.&nbsp; When I select level 2 the page looks like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should be able to go to the cell on page one and enter the formula ="Sheet2"H27 and obtain the information for that State.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I enter the "=" operator in the cell on Sheet1 and open Sheet2 everything uncollapses.&nbsp; I now have several thousand lines to search for the Subtotal for each State.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has not happened to me in the past.&nbsp; Is there something in the settings that uncollapses all the lines and what can I do to keep those lines collapsed.</p>

<p>Hi Arthur,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based&nbsp;on my test on Windows 10 version 1803&nbsp; OS build 17134.228, Excel version&nbsp;1902 (build 11328.20146 Monthly channel)&nbsp;I can't reproduce&nbsp;the issue. Due to the issue is happened collapses part,&nbsp;my steps only based on the collapse:
</p>
<p>1. I hide some cell in worksheet2.</p>
<p>2. I&nbsp;type a = in worksheet A1 is equal Sheet2! B1.</p>
<p>3. Check on worksheet 2 the collapses still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6326dcfe-438f-4b9a-93f9-835437499853?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6326dcfe-438f-4b9a-93f9-835437499853?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>To confirm whether my steps are the same as yours, please tell me if there’s any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you try to create a new simple worksheet to see the outcome?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please provide the version of your Excel.&nbsp; You can open Excel &gt; click
<p>

<p>Yesterday I brought my laptop to work and compared the settings page by page.&nbsp; Some of the settings available on my laptop are not available on my work computer although we both have Office365 and we are both operating on the latest version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Data settings there is a line reading, "Disable undo for large PivotTable refresh operations to reduce refresh time."&nbsp; On my work computer this was unchecked.&nbsp; When I checked this box,
<em>even though I am not working on a PivotTable</em>, the functionality improved.</p>
