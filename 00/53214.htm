            Using "method 1", the XP SP2 compatibility mode, allowed me to install the existing XP driver available from HP (3511_enu_w2k_xp_release).&nbsp;&nbsp; Without&nbsp;that&nbsp;mode tweak, during a previous installation attempt, the driver installation program hung when&nbsp;it began
 looking for the printer.&nbsp; Although the installation progam now completes and registers the printer in the device panel, the printer itself does not print, (and there was not such a problem prior to the Win 7 upgrade).&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, after 2 failed print attempts,
 I got a blue screen crash with an auto reboot.<br />
<br />
I am thinking the best work-around might be to network my win 7 computer to&nbsp;a 11 year old&nbsp;computer with xp and then drive the printer from the xp computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I currently have a ethernet router, so can easily attach&nbsp;the&nbsp;additional computer, however have not
 had a need to network additional computers so don't know the procedure.&nbsp; Do you have a FAQ page that describes how I&nbsp;would do that, - print to another computer's printer on the same network?<br />
<br />
PS. I just tried reinstalling the HP driver and it is hanging like it did originally.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not entirely sure what happened during the last installation that allowed it to go forward, but then subsequently crash Windows 7 upon a couple of uses.

            I had the same problem. Then I ran across an artical that said to try the drivers for the 'HP Photosmart-D7200 Series Printer'. Lo and behold my HP Photosmart 1115 came to life. It worked first time.<br />

    <title>Lost 2 step authentication to account&#40;not this one&#41;, waited - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riggsjohnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost 2 step authentication to account&#40;not this one&#41;, waited the 30 days to be able to reset it but nothing seems to have happened</h2>
                    
<p>As It says in the title, I had a Microsoft account but lost my phone containing the two-step authentication. This prompted me to have to recover the account as shown to me on the prompts on my xbox and wait 30 days however there seems to be nothing changed
 after 35 days and I have gotten nothing from Microsoft support on the matter, they did not ask for a replacement email and I'm just dead in the water here. I set up this account to play free games during the time I can't use my real one, but now I'm extremely&nbsp;
<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> and I am not waiting another month. Due to Microsoft support being absolute garbage and having no actual human to talk to and only prompts that direct you to websites I have come in here hopes that someone from Microsoft
 can help me. It just frustrates me how a company like this can not give two <strong>
[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> about support and rely on their community to help because they are too busy elsewhere I guess. I never actually seen a company this but have a nonexistent support line and I have tried to hard to get an actual person to help
 me, but I just think now it's impossible and nobody will help me even if its a problem on Microsoft's end. My only hope now is for someone from support will see this or I got another 30 days of not being able to play on my account with all the games that I
 paid for. I know this is a fan message board, but I don't see another option so I will yell into the darkness and hopefully someone will hear me or I will just wait another month and hope to god that history doesn't repeat itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for my rant,</p>
<p>Cheers&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the reply, it's not updating my contacts its that I do not have the password for my account (it was on remember me for my xbox so I never really typed it in) and I lost my phone containing my two factor authentication. I can't sign in so I can't
 update anything and whenever I talk to a support staff member they recommend something and when it doesn't work I respond to the email and someone different responds to me something different that I have tried because the email just gets sent to someone random
 and they are just zero help. I wish I could actually talk to someone at Microsoft but that seems too hard for them.

<h2>            Can I assign apps to the Microsoft Surface Keyboard app keys&#63;</h2>
                    I have the Microsoft Surface Keyboard, and above the number keypad are buttons for various apps and features. Specifically, there's one that opens the calculator app. Is there a way to make that key open a different application? I want to use a different
 calculator app I got from the MS Store rather than the default one that comes with Windows 10. Thanks in advance for your help.

            No, this doesn't address my question. Your instructions are for assigning a shortcut key (i.e. Ctrl-Alt-E) to launch a program. I asked how to make the calculator key on the Microsoft Surface Keyboard open a program other than the default calc.exe app.
 Do you have any ideas how I might do that? Thanks again for your assistance.

            Hi supermuppet,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
Does the recovery disk work on another computer?&nbsp; It displaying X:\$windows.#bt\windows\system32 doesn't point it to being at the repair computer stage.<br />
<br />
Do you have another recovery disk that you could use?&nbsp; It may be the disk itself is not working properly.&nbsp; If you have a friend that has a copy of Vista,&nbsp; you may consider booting to the Recovery options on their DVD to confirm whether the disk is bad or if
 the issue is involving the DVD rom itself.&nbsp; Most likely it is the disk.<br />
<br />
If you need further suggestions, please post more information about exactly what is taking place and if you ever see a Graphical User Interface options when you boot to this DVD.<br />
<br />
Please provide as much information as possible. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

    <title>Zoom feature - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newfie guy123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zoom feature</h2>
                    <p>The joys of trying to figure out this 8.1 continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for some reason I have my laptop with 8.1 plugged into a wall mounted monitor.&nbsp; When I bought the laptop and plugged in the HDMI cable it worked perfectly.&nbsp; Yesterday I managed to click on something and suddenly the screen blipped a bit and it zoomed
 in.&nbsp; It has cut off the bottom too bar or I can only see half of it, I can only see half the windows on the bottom left, can only see half the time on teh bottom right and I can not see the top full screen or shrink screen at all or the X and same on the sides.&nbsp;
 At the homepage all the icons I have going down the left side are half cut off and I have wasted a good 2-3 hours clicking on everything i can and even playing wiht the monitor control and called the TV manufacturer but they said it has to be some kind of
 setting in 8.1 that is triggered.&nbsp; I plug another laptop into the&nbsp;HDMI cable and power it up and it looks perfect so it is some kind of mode this hideous 8.1 is gone into and I can not get it to zoom back out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?&nbsp; This is very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Try pressing the Windows key and the - button until the screen zooms out. Win+- and Win+= are the shortcut keys for zooming out and in with Magnifier respectively.

            Yea, nope, I tried that.&nbsp; I used the magnifier but for whatever reason it is already at 100% and it will not let you go below 100%.&nbsp; It will let me hit windows + key and out it goes but hitting windows - and it only goes back to 100%.&nbsp; I have no idea how
 it did this but at 100% which is as low as it goes the top of the screen is cut off, the bottom is cut off, I can not X out of any programs as the red X box on the top right is pretty much off the screen all together and all I can see is the time and not the
 date at all and I can not tell if it is AM or PM.&nbsp; It is not the TV screen ie I am in wide mode or something as I am in normal mode on the screen.&nbsp; I think it has something to do with the function keys when you connect to the monitor or something but I don't
 know why.&nbsp; It is really irritating but nothing puts the screen back to normal.&nbsp; Any other suggestions from anyone out there?&nbsp; I don't know why this has to be so hard to do.

            <p>Well managed to put a bandaid on it, if you shrink outlook and explorer etc and drag them in, I can see the X and the rest of the programs so now when I open it it opens in a minimized screen the size of the monitor but if I look down at the laptop I can
 see the background screen around it all but on the monitor it is just full screen.&nbsp; If anyone has any ideas I would love to hear them.</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>Have you made any recent changes to the installed RAM?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Could your problem be overheating?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>With a desktop you need to remove the left hand side panel and remove any dust bunnies clogging fans. Also check that all fans are working. To be safe switch the computer
 off and pull out the power lead before removing the side panel. You can then switch the computer back on and check that the fans are working.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Next switch the computer off again and allow some time for it to cool down. It is best to use a wrist band, which you clip on the computer case to earth you before
 touching anything inside the casing. You can buy one from a computer accessory shop. Static electricity can damage a motherboard if you do not take precautions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You then use a small brush to remove the dust bunnies around the fan on the processor. I have used an electric razor cleaning brush. I use an Air Duster to clean the
 power supply fan. An Air Duster is also useful for cleaning keyboards. When you use an Air Duster do it when the computer is cold.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi DawnGag,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are several reasons why your Movie Maker crashes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Outdated Movie Maker</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Ensure that you have the latest the version of your Windows Essentials by visiting this
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>link</span></a><span>. (build: 15.4.3555.0308 on Vista) - (build: 16.4.3505.912 on Windows 7 &amp; 8)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Bad codec</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may try fixing bad codecs if there are any by running </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft FixIt tool</span></a><span> for codec.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Supported file type</strong></span></p>
<p><span>You may be using unsupported file types on your project that can be causing the issue. For more information, you can refer to this article (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What kind
 of files can I use in Movie Maker?</a>)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Outdated video driver.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can use DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag) to determine if your video driver is updated. Try following the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click on <strong>Start</strong> button and type <strong>dxdiag</strong> in the Search programs and files box and press
<strong>Enter</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on the <strong>Display</strong> tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.</span></p>
<p><span>3. If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Example websites of video card driver manufacturer:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://downloadcenter.intel.com/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists after trying the initial troubleshooting steps above, kindly answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the version of Movie Maker? (Press <strong>ALT + F</strong>, then click
<strong>About Movie Maker</strong>.) </li><li>What are the type of files you are using?</li></ul>
<p>Furthermore, kindly provide us log files of your Movie Maker. This will help us investigate the issue deeper. For the instructions, kindly refer to my message on the private message area. You need to sign in to Microsoft Community to see the Private Messages

<p><br />
Thank you for providing the event log file. Our support specialist wants you to try using compatibilty mode versions lower than Windows 7, like Windows Vista or Windows XP. In case it does not work, kindly run Windows Update and&nbsp;install all the&nbsp;latest Microsoft
 Updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, in case the above suggestion fails, kindly provide us an answer to the following. This will help us on our investigation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the issue persists using other admin user accounts? Please have the initiative to create another admin user account and reproduce the issue.</li><li>What file types are being used in making the movie?</li><li>On what exact point/step do you get the error? Is it while launching Movie Maker? While editing or while saving a movie?</li></ul>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello DawnGag,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the email that you're referring was from Microsoft stating that there has been an update on your issue, you can check the replies within this thread. As the previous moderators stated, please try to change the compatibility mode of Movie Maker. This is
 for us to verify if this is just an issue within the compatibility of the program in Windows 8. To do this, please follow the steps provided below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Windows button</strong> on your keyboard </li><li>Type <strong>Movie Maker </strong>then right click the program and choose <strong>
Open file location</strong> </li><li>Right click Movie Maker and choose <strong>Properties</strong> </li><li>Choose <strong>Compatibility</strong> and within <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>, check R<strong>un this program in compatibility mode for:</strong> then choose either
<strong>Windows 7 </strong>/ <strong>Windows Vista</strong> / <strong>Windows XP</strong>
</li><li>Click <strong>Apply </strong>then <strong>Ok</strong></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To update your Windows, <font><font color="#444444">kindly go to the&nbsp;link below:</font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#444444"><strong><a href="http://fe1.update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/vistadefault.aspx?ln=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update</a></strong></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case the issue persists, please provide us more information by answering the questions provided by moderator Richard Jordan_H last January 22, 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t get Brother MFC 210C scanning feature to work with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    It worked once out of the 100 times I have tried it. &nbsp;It gives error readings. &nbsp;It works with other Windows but not 8.1. &nbsp;Deleted and installed new drivers, didn't work. &nbsp;The scanning device should auto-work with this Windows, but it does not. Any suggestions?
 Thanks!

 happened and it still wont show. I noticed my mothers laptop also couldn't detect the hotspots but our mobile devices could. Is there anything i can do?

<p>Make sure your router is set to broadcast the network name:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Connect your PC to your router using an Ethernet cable.</p>

<p>Open your web browser and type the IP address for your wireless router. (For example, 192.168.1.1 or 172.16.0.0check the documentation for your router to find the default IP address.)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sign in with your user name and password, then make sure an option labeled <strong>

<h2>            Two Skype Accounts</h2>
                    I recently made a Skype account but soon after I realized I already had an account under that email. However, Skype still allowed me to create the email, so now I am stuck with two accounts under the same email. I took steps to merge the two accounts but
 when I log in with my email, it opens a different account than if I log in with my old username.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I had created a Windows service to start and stop a Tomcat server. Whenever the Tomcat server runs with Multi threaded objects and if i try to stop the Tomcat using the Windows service I'm getting the following error , "Error 1053: The service did not respond
 to the start or<br />
&nbsp;control request in a timely fashion".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot change the "WaitToKillServiceTimeout" value as my services will be running in the client machine. Is there anyother way I can&nbsp;make windows services to wait till my Application server excutes all the threads and shuts down.<br />
</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

                    <p>Hello, I only recently have started using Hyper-v and I am very confused by the error i am receiving. I have tried to look for help everywhere and it seems nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to import the&nbsp;IE10.Win7.HyperV virtual machine but when i try select this folder it just goes straight over to select virtual machine with the box saying "no virtual machine files found"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i try with the actual file&nbsp;C:\Users\HORSO14\Downloads\IE10.Win7.HyperV\Virtual Machines it comes up with the error code "The file&nbsp;C:\Users\HORSO14\Downloads\IE10.Win7.HyperV\Virtual Machines could not be found, you might not have access to it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its any consolation there is no snapshots folder inside the&nbsp;IE10.Win7.HyperV folder, it only includes the Virtual Machine and Virtual hard disk folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would greatly appreciate any walkthroughs on this topic</p>

            Creating VMs can be any version of Windows and even Linux for that matter.
<br />But a VM is like running windows on top of windows so yes you will need a license for every version you are running.

<h2>            Windows 7 stuck on &#34;Please Wait..&#34; screen</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my Acer Aspire laptop from Vista to Windows 7 Home Premium with no problems and it worked fine for about five days.&nbsp; However, after restarting my computer after several automatic updates failed to install, the computer appeared to start
 normally , but became stuck on the Windows 7 Home Premium page with the "Please wait..." and revolving circle.&nbsp; I left that running overnight, but it remained the next morning.&nbsp; I then tried all the F8 options.&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Repair Your Computer" option as a regular
 user indicated there was no problem, but when I tried starting the system it ended up in the "Please wait.." spiral. (I also tried to use the Administrator option, but it indicated the password, which I had successfully used earlier, was incorrect; not sure
 if this is related to the problem.)&nbsp; All the other F8 options brought me right back to the "Please wait..." screen. &nbsp;&nbsp; I then tried to boot from a repair disk, but this again resulted in

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>If you have this problem please do the following (even if you have the hotfix installed, which I have not found to work well or consistently):</p>
A: If you get the "Please Wait" screen and DO NOT have another Windows PC/Server:
<ol>
<li>Power off the PC hard (hold the button, pull the cord, etc.) </li><li>When you power on the PC it should present you with a Safe Mode screen, Select "Safe Mode with Networking"</li><li>Log into the PC </li><li>Go to the Admin Tools "Services" section </li><li>Locate the following services and disable them: Windows Error Reporting, Network Location Service, Network List service</li><li>Power down the PC gracefully (Start, Shutdown, etc.) </li><li>Restart the PC, wait a minute or two (no more) </li><li>You should be presented with a login screen. </li></ol>
<p>B: If you have another Windows PC/Server (network connected)</p>
<ol>
<li>PC must be on a DHCP connected LAN (needs to be network connected)&nbsp; </li><li>Find the PC IP address/name </li><li>Go to the other PC, open the Admin Tools "Services" section </li><li>Select "Connect to another computer" when right-clicking the "Services" icon in the left column</li><li>Locate and disable the following services: Windows Error Reporting, Network Location Service, Network List service</li><li>Power down the PC gracefully (Start, Shutdown, etc.) if you can, power switch if no other choice.</li><li>Restart the PC, wait a minute or two (no more) </li><li>You should be presented with a login screen. </li></ol>

<p>Hi Anil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the Touchpad scroll fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the drivers are incompatible with Windows 10 or due to hardware problems.</p>
<p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Install the drivers in Compatibility mode.</p>
</strong></span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Try installing the drivers in <strong>Compatibility mode </strong>since installed drivers might not be compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>A <strong>compatibility mode </strong>is a software mechanism in which a software either emulates an older version of software in order to allow incompatible software or files to remain compatible with the computer's newer hardware or software. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Go to your <strong>manufacturers website </strong>and download the Drivers setup file for your computer.
<br />
<strong>2. </strong>Press <strong>Windows Key + R </strong>on your desktop screen to go to run box.
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong>and hit Enter or <strong>right click
</strong>on <strong>Start</strong> and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>. <br />
<strong>4. </strong>Under Driver, expand, then right click and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.
<br />
<strong>5. </strong>If you are prompted to Confirm then <strong>Confirm</strong>.
<br />
<strong>6. </strong>Go to the location where you had saved your downloaded setup files of the drivers and right click, then select
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Properties</strong>. <br />
<strong>7. </strong>Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> Tab. <br />
<strong>8. </strong>Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode
</strong>and select the operating system (<strong>Windows </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8/8.1 or Windows 7</strong>) accordingly from the drop down list. <br />
<strong>9. </strong>Let the driver to install and then check the functionality.</p>
</span><strong><span>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: <span>Run the Power troubleshooter</span></p>
</span></strong>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with your system's power settings. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Click on the <strong>view all </strong>option on the left panel.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Run the <strong>Power </strong>troubleshooter and follow on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p>I have just upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click the "Start" button I can see "Control Panel" in the list of "Most Used", &nbsp;but if I click "All Apps" I can't see "Control Panel" in the list.&nbsp; Why?</p>

<h2>            Is the &#34;trojan worm&#34; virus real or just hackers phissing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is the "trojan worm" virus real or just hackers phissing? I get this flash post with a voice over warning that my computer is infected and gives an alleged Windows/Microsft phone number. An "Intellius" site check just says that it is a toll free number.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I think that the public should start to hunt these hackers down, and treat them like rabid dogs in the wild.</p>

<p>Two points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There is no such thing as a "trojan worm virus." Trojans, worms, and viruses are three different kinds of malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You are clearly infected. But the flash post with a voiceover warning is a symptom of the infection itself. It is not telling you about some other infection; it *is*the infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not call the alleged Windows/Microsft phone number. It is not a Microsoft number. Instead, download and run the free MalwareBytes AntiMalware&nbsp; at https://www.malwarebytes.com/ and see if that gets rid of it for you.</p>
