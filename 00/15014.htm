<h2>            In excel, Ctrl C only copies text and not the formatting, how do i include formatting&#63;</h2>
                    Ctrl C used to copy all formatting, formulas, and text from a cell so that i can paste it into a new cell.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I dont know what i did, but now when i copy something to the clipboard from excel, it only copies the text.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>the 'Format painter' button is not working and when i right click to 'paste special' it gives me only 1 option (paste text only)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>when i open the 'paste special...' window the only options i have is Unicode Text and Text. I always pick Unicode text, but when the cell was copied, only text was copied.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>how do i change that?</div>

<p>Hi Bernd, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to access it online but it hasn't been syncing properly so it hasn't backed up the more recent stuff. I was wondering if there was anywhere on the computer it would be stored as I file I can access without OneNote?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I can't even complete the first step to uninstall it, when I right click on the icon all it says is "Unpin from Start". It's well and truley messed up!</p>

            <p>The simplest way is to use the built-in shortcut Alt+F11. If you don't like to memorize shortcuts and want a button, you can either display the Developer tab of the ribbon or add a button to the Quick Access Toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, the Developer tab of the ribbon is hidden; you have to enable it by going to the Options dialog, clicking Customize Ribbon, and checking the box next to Developer in the right-hand list. That ribbon has a Visual Basic button at the left end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add a button to the Quick Access Toolbar, go to the Options dialog, click Quick Access Toolbar, set the top left dropdown to All Commands, select Visual Basic Editor in the list, and click the Add button. The up- and down-arrow buttons on the far right
 of the dialog let you move the command up and down the list on the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For completeness, you can also get to the editor by clicking View &gt; Macros, selecting the name of an existing macro or typing the name for a new one, and clicking the Edit button or the Create button, whichever becomes available.</p>

    <title>How do I sync Windows Mobile files from a Trimble surveyor-grade GPS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I sync Windows Mobile files from a Trimble surveyor-grade GPS device to a Macintosh computer&#63;</h2>

                    <span>On Thursday, the 27th of September, I was exposed to some industrial technology that seemed very unusual to me, and I wanted to ask some
 questions about it.<br />
<br />
Thursday evening, I attended a recreational trails workshop held by my state's association. The workshop's purpose was to familiarize local-level trails organizations with GPS technology that would be used to accurately map and catalog GPS/GIS (with other database
 fields for landownership, on-the-ground conditions, location of bridges and problem areas, etc.) to be compiled in a state-level database. The GPS technology being demonstrated were Trimble GeoXT GeoExplorer 2005 series receivers that have a rather large (almost
 iPhone-sized) LCD screens that display Trimble's TerraSync 3.0 (Skyview) running on Windows Mobile. The presenters providing the demonstration are GIS professional staffers working for a regional (multi-county) planning and development consortium. The GIS
 professional I talked to said each one of these Trimble units is supposedly accurate to within a couple feet (he called it "surveyor-grade GPS").<br />
<br />
The units are rather bulky, and the Windows Mobile software seemed a little behind the times. Not like a current Windows smartphone. The GIS professionals hooked a Trimble device up to a Windows laptop and projected the screen onto a wall for the demonstration.
 You are supposed to be able to use an included patch cable (proprietary-to-USB) to transfer GPS data routes (taken by running a receiver on a trail) from the unit to a computer so it can be e-mailed back to the GIS pros in the regional planning office. The
 software used to make the device-to-computer transfer was called Windows Mobile Device Center. (The GIS pros also mentioned "Windows Download Management Center" and Google Active Sync.) These GIS pros said the state organization paid somewhere around $4,000
 apiece for these devices. Each device comes with an AC charging cradle and the aforementioned patch cable for device-to-computer file transfer. When a route is recorded, the device stores the data in eight different files with the same nomenclature.<br />
<br />
<br />
1: I am working on a MacBook Pro. If I wind up using one of the state organization's Trimble devices to conduct a trail-mapping study, will there be software available for me to transfer the data files from the device's on-board Windows Mobile storage to my
 computer's hard drive? If so, where would I find this software? MY HARDWARE: MacBook Pro 2.33 GHz; MY SOFTWARE: MacOS X 10.6.8</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>WINDOWS MOBILE VERSION THE TRIMBLE RUNS: Version 5</span></div>
<div><span>WINDOWS VERSION RUNNING ON PC LAPTOP FOR THURSDAY'S DEMO: &nbsp;Windows 7<br />
<br />
2: Isn't there some kind of Windows Mobile interface for MacOS X to allow data transfer to a modern Macintosh?<br />
<br />
3: Doesn't Microsoft provide software for connecting Windows-based smartphones to MacOS X? Wouldn't that be applicable here?<br />
<br />
(The objective is to use the Trimble device to record the trail route data and points of interest, then take the device back to our office, connect it to the MacBook Pro, transfer the data off the device, and e-mail it to the regional office.)<br />
<br />
4: Can this be done???<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</span> </div>

            <p>Microsoft never created any Windows Mobile sync software for Mac OS, but a few third-party developers stepped up and filled the void.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two I remembers off the top of my head are "Missing Sync" and "Sync Mate".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, if the only use of these devices is GPS data collection, you might not need any sync software at all. Unlike today's crippled mobile devices, Windows Mobile was a very PC-like OS, with a fully exposed file system. If you know the names
 of these eight files and where to find them, you can use the device's built-in File Explorer to beam them to your Mac via Bluetooth, upload them via the browser to a Dropbox, or even browse a network share on your work&nbsp;LAN via WiFi and copy the files across
 the network. You could also copy the files to device's SD card, and then pop out the card and plug it into the computer to copy them off, or&nbsp;add an email account&nbsp;to the device's email&nbsp;client&nbsp;and email the files to yourself from the device. If the eventual
 use of this data is to email it to the "GIS Pros" you could actually do it right from the device with&nbsp;no&nbsp;intermediate sync.&nbsp;(Obviously the device will need internet connectivity via WiFi for&nbsp;some of these suggestions.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device is almost as flexible as a computer with regard to moving files around.&nbsp; Having said that, it's running a *really* old version of the OS, first released in early 2005 so as&nbsp;powerful as it is, it's quite unpolished compared to today's devices!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW, to clarify some of your comments, Windows Mobile Device Center is the sync software for Windows Vista, 7 and 8 PCs,&nbsp;Microsoft (not Google) ActiveSync is the sync software for Windows XP, and I believe&nbsp;Windows Download Management Center was a tool for
 corporations to deploy&nbsp;bunches of identically configured devices to workers (all with the same apps, etc.)&nbsp;but I've never personally used that one. The small companies I worked with just configured devices from our Exchange servers.</p>

            Thanks for the very interesting in-depth insights on tech possibilities.
<div><br />
<div>To my knowledge, these Trimble devices (supposedly 2005 vintage) do not offer any WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity. They do, however, offer an SD card slot. I suppose I would have to learn how to manipulate the Windows Mobile interface to make certain the
 necessary files are placed on the SD card to make this work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there any place on the 'net where I can take tutorials to learn how to use Windows Mobile 2005 so I can gain some competence in how to handle this device?</div>

            <p>I'm not sure how many different Trimble devixes there are of that vintage, but if it's this one:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geoplane.com/trimble/geoxt2005.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geoplane.com/trimble/geoxt2005.html</a>&nbsp;, the Geo XT 2005, it has both WiFi and Bluetooth. If it doesn't, you should be able to use the SD card as a transfer mechanism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The owners' manual for any Windows Mobile 5 device can probably give you whatever you need to know about using the device. If the manual for the Trimble itself isn't online, search for the Dell Axim X50, or&nbsp;HTC Wizard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even without a manual, the interface is very Windows PC-like.&nbsp; Windows Mobile was Microsoft's attempt to bring the desktop Windows UI to handheld PDAs and phones.&nbsp; Realistically, you'll just need the File Explorer app built-in to the device to&nbsp;find the necessary
 files from wherever the GPS software stores them (probably the "My Documents" folder or a subfolder under it, since that's the only folder hierarchy that syncs with a PC&nbsp;when using the&nbsp;Windows Mobile Device Center&nbsp;software the GIS pros mentioned) and copy
 and paste them to the storage card, which could then be read by your Mac using an appropriate reader.</p>

                    When adding members to an Exchange/Outlook distribution group in the Exchange console (or Office 365 admin console), one can see users, site mailboxes and other distribution lists. How do you add in an Office 365 group email address?

            Hi newboss<br />
<br />
It is just the "voice navigation" feature that will cease to function, you can still find your position on map, plan journeys but you won't get real time instructions unless you purchase a new license.

<p>What post is that? I don't remember seeing your post at all (and I think lately, I've read most every post in this forum).&nbsp; When did you post it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The moderators in this forum are pretty careful about deleting posts.&nbsp; The only posts I ever delete are clear duplicates.&nbsp; Sometimes I'll combine posts that are made by the same person into one thread if the posts are clearly related and if it appears the
 original poster was attempting to append new information to an original post.&nbsp; I'll also delete posts that are clearly spam, but those posts don't happen very often here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you get some kind of message that your post was deleted?</p>

<p>
</p><p>On the web version of Skype, you can copy and paste the messages, but the format will not be the same as how you copied it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thanks. I tried it with a brand Skype installation in an old, updated 64-bit W7 HPE SP1 machine. When I tried to export from my existing cloud's chat histories, it showed this error:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62ddcfd7-ee59-4574-a889-2a5bd2d250da?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62ddcfd7-ee59-4574-a889-2a5bd2d250da?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Huh? It needs a previous installation for this to work? Why not from the cloud?</p>

<p>Can you try if you can be able to export your chat history to a .csv file using the classic version of Skype. Here's the downloader link:

</em>After installing it, click <strong>tools </strong>then <strong>options</strong>. On the options window, click
<strong>IM &amp; SMS </strong>and click <strong>show advanced options </strong>then click
<strong>Export Chat History</strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks. That worked. Even showing ALL history, copying, and pasting get the nice formatting (better than CSV IMO). However, I found out MS is ending its classic v7 in Nov. according to https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/09/27/2019258/microsoft-will-end-support-for-skype-classic-in-november.

<h2>            Upgraded to Office 2013 and all existing macro&#39;s does not work anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the subject says. I have upgraded my Office 2010 to Office 2013. And since the Upgrade the macro's that are working when I was using Office 2010 doesn't work anymore.<br />
<br />
I have an excel file with lots of ActiveX buttons and none of them are working right now. I've check the properties of the button. but it's not being recognized as a button. Instead, it's being recognized as part of the Sheet it belongs to.<br />
<br />
FYI, this is happening on my Work Computer. So it's highly unlikely that any "Upgrade" solutions is possible at the moment.</p>

    <title>Office 365 bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pscadmin4207  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 bug</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
we are a school with 700 users, students and staff. We have had Office 2011 on some computer and now with Office 365 we deployed them to all our 120 Mac machines. We are running all the machines on 10.10.5 and the Open Directory is serving all the shares and
 Network homes.</p>
<p>I have tested the programs on local accounts and made a mistake of not testing on Network Accounts. So, our problem is that when a Network user logs in onto a computer, and opens any Office 365 app, it ask for username and password. When entered, the next
 box say "<strong>No credentials&nbsp; The system requires that you sign on to a valid account."</strong></p>
<p>I have pinpointed the only difference between what Local account does and what Network account does, that could be the reason. When opening any Office 365 app under Local account, the system creates two items in the Keychain. The items are:</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Office Identities Cache 2 </strong><br />
<strong>Microsoft Office Identities Settings 2</strong></p>
<p>These two items appear in the Keychain as application password and the application that requires access to these items is Office365ServiceV2</p>

<p>For some reason when we do the same thing on a Network Account, those two items in the Keychain
<strong>DO NOT</strong> get created and therefore we get the error.</p>

<p>I understand that Office365ServiceV2 is and application that calls on Microsoft server to authenticate, but this deamon is not starting or getting activated when under Network account login.</p>
<p>I can send screenshots if you need any, but i believe that this is a bug, unless you have already found a solution to it!
</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Adnan</p>

<p>hi sky,</p>
<p>i have tried the steps above, but because this is still initializing stage, those folders have not been created yet, to cause any problem.</p>
<p>i have also reset the keychain, but again, nothing happened, as the files in the keychain were never created for microsoft office identities.</p>
<p>here are some screenshots, from my test user with network homes and keychain redirected to the local drive and the keychain folder being an alias (symlinked to the original folder)</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4646f7f1-b174-4de5-bdff-55292c019b40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4646f7f1-b174-4de5-bdff-55292c019b40" /></a><br />
keychain is redirected to the local drive and appears as symlink in the users library. this is to stop keychain from crashing</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6e48a4bb-232a-4851-be0a-49497ff80cd9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6e48a4bb-232a-4851-be0a-49497ff80cd9" /></a><br />
i have entered username and password, and by now two items in the keychain shoudl show up, but nothing. i have checked the permissions on login.keychain file and all is set correctly, i even tried chmod 777 on keychain, but noting :)</p>

<h2>            Multiple Optional Textboxes</h2>
                    <p>In case of a procedure using PARAMARRAY, could there be a technique used to insert multiple Textboxes on a form, only upon entering data, i.e. if one textbox is started being filled up a new similar textbox would appear below the same?</p>
<p>In simple words, like a dialoge box being shown, when a formula =SUM( is inserted and function wizard is started with Ctrl+A, two empty argument textboxes&nbsp;are shown and the same increase in number everytime one of the empty boxes is filled up.</p>
<p>A sample would be obliged.</p>
<p>Thanx in advance.</p>

            <p>Yes, we can do this, but to add the textboxes is just the first step, to store all the values from the textboxes into the correct locations is much more complicated.

            Hmm.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; I had brute-force removed IE8 from a Win7 test system some while back, using DISM.&nbsp; (I think that's how I did it).&nbsp; I don't remember exactly what the steps were, and don't often use that tool so it would be fresh in my mind.&nbsp; I could try to
 rediscover those steps if you really want to risk a try at it.<br />
<br />
But I'll tell you this.&nbsp; I have regretted doing that ever since.&nbsp; I sometimes want it for testing purposes.&nbsp; Like just the other day.&nbsp; I ended up performing a complete new Win7 install just for a simple Win7+IE8 test
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-windows_7/windows-7-ultimate-internet-explorer-problem/cfc59709-fbb0-4205-9032-44619f00d445">
here</a> on MS-Answers.<br />
<br />
I'm curious though, if you don't mind my asking.&nbsp; You said Edge has proven itself.&nbsp; You're telling us your personal experience, yes?&nbsp; I ask, because the June 1

<p>Thanks. Looking more for an update to a legit uninstall by Microsoft the last requests for this all date to a year ago.
</p>
<p>While I appreciate the advice, I disagree. When I say Edge has proven itself I mean in terms of its beta testing phases when originally released.</p>
<p>This was the so called excuse that IE was left in place until testing was "done"
</p>
<p>I work in the GOV sector and while IE is still king, it's out of habit for 20 yrs vs using something new like Edge.
</p>
<p>In professional and personal usage I have found Edge is more than sufficient and allows the majority of sites which were originally not working without IE.
</p>
<p>Again this has been many many years that they have blocked the uninstall and should be an OPTION to remove not mandatory to keep.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the security is poor and that is why they have not pushed harder, but there should be a point it is available as uninstall /reinstall this would perhaps push people to use Edge more. IE has been hanging round like an annoying fly for too long. How
 long will IE11 be around when allegedly its the last.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why are Recent Activity Maps not right &#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I review my&nbsp;recent activity on Outlook it shows my&nbsp;IP address and a map.&nbsp; I live on the west coast.&nbsp; The IP address is correct and is on the west coast.&nbsp; Yet Outlook's map shows me on the east coast.&nbsp; It's been like this since last week.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other
 words why does the IP address not correspond to Outlook's map of my real location?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried different browsers and different accounts.&nbsp; It's the same map all the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I recently changed my password because my streaming service was hacked.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The “Recent activity” page shows info about the activity in your Microsoft account, within the last 30 days. This includes any time that you signed in to your account, whether you used a web browser, your phone, an email app, a third-party app, or another
 method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can click any activity to expand it and see additional details, including:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The IP address of the PC or device on which the activity occurred</li><li>What type of device and operating system was used</li><li>What Internet browser or type of app, if any, was used</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Some Internet providers—especially for mobile phone services—might route your activity through a different location. This can make it look like you’ve signed in from somewhere you’re not. If you’re not sure, you can always click an activity you don’t recognize
 to let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong>What should I do if I see unusual account activity? </strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<div>
<p>You’ll probably recognize most of the account activities listed on your <strong>
Recent activity</strong> page. Even if an activity sounds suspicious at first, you can expand it to see more details and decide whether you remember it. For example, if you accidentally made a typo in your password, you’ll see
<strong>Incorrect password entered</strong> in the list. Or, if you signed in to your account from a mobile phone, you might find that your service provider routed the signal through a cell tower in another city.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if an activity looks unfamiliar, or if you see an unusual pattern (like multiple sign-in attempts or changes that you’re sure you didn’t make), let us know. We’ll help you make your account more secure to minimize any threats.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>If you click “This was me”: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If we notice unusual activity on your account, we’ll give you the option to tell us you were responsible for an activity, and we’ll keep track of that info going forward. For example, if you sign in from a new location that happens to be the hotel you’re
 staying at on a business trip, we’ll add that location to the list of places we expect you might sign in from in the future.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>If you click “This wasn’t me”: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you tell us that you don’t recognize an activity, it’s possible that a hacker or a malicious user has gotten access to your account. To help protect your account, we’ll walk you through several steps, including changing your password and reviewing and
 updating your security info.</p>

    <title>Move Favorites bar in line with Menu bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephus flavius  say:</h3>
<h2>            Move Favorites bar in line with Menu bar</h2>
                    <p>IE 10 on Windows 7:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to move the Favorites bar to the same horizontal space of the Menu bar (in order to save vertical screen space).&nbsp; I was able to move the Adobe and Norton bars to that very space (right-justified) and there's plenty of room between those and the
 Menu bar (left-justified), but the Favorites bar stubbornly resists my attempts to drag it.&nbsp; The Lock toolbars option is not checked...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would greatly appreciate your suggestions.</p>

                    I have a W8.1 mobile and an Android Marshmallow phone which happily sync between themselves. However, neither will sync with the W10 laptop. Microsoft don't seem to have any ideas except the server settings are wrong, but the sync worked fine a few days

<p>Thanks for the quick response, but the situation seems not to have resolved.
 Microsoft seem to think it may be an issue with my server settings but to date has not provided a solution so I am currently using Google calendar &amp; contacts until I can work out why it is unable to update with remote devices.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to prevent Live Mail from loading InboxLight&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since last week when I login to my Live Email account from work the full user interface does not load. Instead what I get appears to be the text only Light version which never seems to fully load (spinning donut), has slow performance and is difficult to
 read because there are missing images. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This happens when using BOTH IE 8 and Chrome 8. Note this is a work system I am unable to install different browser versions. Windows 7. Live mail was working fine two weeks ago. I am not aware of any changes to the local system. When I login on my phone
 or from my home PC it still loads normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any ideas why this stopped working or how to force the normal web app to load?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>How can I make Word 2007 look and work like Word 2003&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I make Word 2007 look and work like Word 2003&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The interface of Word 2007 is nigh on unusable. Fully half of the commands that I used to have at my fingertips in Word 2003 are spread out over more than half a dozen different tabs. Tasks I used to accomplish in two keystrokes now require seven to 10.
 And more than half of the commands I used to use -- like create a new paragraph style&nbsp;-- don't seem to exist at all, or require such a convoluted path to find that they're, well, un-findable.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can "revert" the GUI of Word 07 to the GUI of Word 03?</p>

<p>Hi Red State Refugee,</p>
<p>Don't give up on Word 2007! A lot of us have been where you are now and, yes, it does take a bit of getting used to but we have grown to love it! Honestly.&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>This is not a direct answer to&nbsp;your question but I hope it will help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a great "where is it now?" resource that was put out by Microsoft. Have a look at this thread:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Word 2003 &gt; Word 2007: Where to find that command!</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wordcreate/thread/bb96a4ca-3eda-4442-8d24-17b155bcb94f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wordcreate/thread/bb96a4ca-3eda-4442-8d24-17b155bcb94f</span></a></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
There are a couple of other interesting links in the above thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
** For a really quick fix I would recommend the OfficeLabs link suggested by Pam Caswell. It's a quick little download and you can use your own terminology to find what you are looking for. How cool is that? The only "down" side with this method though is that
 you don't get to learn where the command is but it really helps when you're in a hurry.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
All the best,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Not built-in. However, there are several aftermarket add-ins that can do it. Here are a couple:</p>

<p>The 2nd one is free. I haven't used either, so I can't attest to how well they work.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can put your most-needed tools onto the Quick Access Toolbar. Here's the approach I use:</p>

<p><span>Isn't version 1707 (build 8326.2096) I got more recent than build 8326.2058?</span></p>

</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>It's working now. LaTeX is now visible.</p>
<p>For future readers having the same problem, it took about a day for the update to actually do something :)</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I would  recommend at least keeping backups. Conversion, in some cases, results in startling formatting changes. 
<br />
<br />This will require a macro. See <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/document_batch_processes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/document_batch_processes.htm</a>
