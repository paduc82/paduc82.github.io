<h2>            Unable to send email via Outlook Android App</h2>
                    <p>My company uses gmail as their backend for email.&nbsp; I've successfully added my companies account to the Outlook Android app on my phone and I can receive emails, see various 'labels' or sub-folders, view the calendar, etc.&nbsp; However, when I try to send email
 I get an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">An Error Occured</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Your message failed to send, because your mail server's send quota has been exceeded.&nbsp; It has been returned to your draft folder.&nbsp; Please contact your mail admin or try re-sending from a different mail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can send email from other personal gmail accounts that I have added in Outlook.&nbsp; And the saved draft does not show up when I log in to my work email on my computer.&nbsp; I can also send emails from my computer with no trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting the app cache.&nbsp; I've tried rebooting my phone.&nbsp; I've tried to respond to various emails.&nbsp; I've also deleted the account and added it back again.&nbsp; All of which failed to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone is using Android 8.1.0 and the Outlook app is up to date with version 2.2.216</p>

    <title>Enable Meeting DownLevel Text in Outlook for Windows 10 Mobile - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Enable Meeting DownLevel Text in Outlook for Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi community!<br />
</p>
<p>I had found that post about enabling the meeting downlevel text in MS Outlook:<br />
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/13b0d08b-88db-45a2-a23a-414182e451f1/outlook-calendar-time-stamp-issue?forum=outlook#fd558bf4-1d63-45e1-8603-aaf34d81b301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enable in registry</a></p>
<p>This is working so far: i.e. GMail users can accept meeting invitations sent by my Outlook now.<br />
<br />
But I really need that with my Windows 10 Mobile phone, too!<br />
How can I enable meeting downlevel text in Outlook there?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance for any useful hint!<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Gerald</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>How have you configured your Hotmail account? Did you configure it on the default Android mail client or Outlook.com app?</span></li><li><span>Have you tried signing into your Hotmail account from a built in Android browser?</span></li></ol>
<p>If you are using the default mail client, then I suggest you to try downloading the

    <title>What causes wmiprvse.exe &#40;network service&#41; to run for about - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerrytolan  say:</h3>
<h2>            What causes wmiprvse.exe &#40;network service&#41; to run for about five minutes beginning around ten minutes after each windows restart&#63;</h2>
                    Using XP Pro SP3 recently clean rebuilt from scratch with all automatic updates installed.&nbsp; Very few apps installed, but current apps include IE8 and Firefox and Office 2000 and Microsoft security essentials (MSE).&nbsp; I am frequently experiencing a stop
 error BSOD (error 100000d1) at the end of the wmiprvse execution which seems to trigger some sort of update to MSE, which triggers the error.&nbsp; Seems to occur only when there is a pending update to MSE definitions, so currently I manually update MSE each time
 the error occurs, solving the problem until a new delta comes in for the definitions.&nbsp; Automatic Updates is ON and Virus Protection is ON.&nbsp; Any clues would be helpful.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your BSOD Stop error is caused by a faulty driver or hardware issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do note that XP will no longer be support in less than 12 months -- no more security patches.</p>
<p>Office 2000 is already unsupported for several years&nbsp;and is probably full of security leaks.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd not spend any time on trying to resolve the issue. </p>

            <p>Yes PA Bear, this is the same system, although I have clean rebuilt it several times since then starting from format c:\ and my authentic Win XP Pro SP 1a CD.&nbsp; I have refined my clean build procedures over time, but this is the first rebuild I've attempted
 after the XP support end date of April 8, 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am curently at SP3 with all automatic updates applied.&nbsp; I have only my four basic drivers installed, including 3Com Ethernet Controller, SoundMax 4 Multimedia Controller, and GeForce (nVidia) VGA Controller, and Dell SE198WFP monitor driver.&nbsp; None of these
 are recognized&nbsp;by SP2 or SP3 service packs on the PCI bus, so installation is not optional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am convinced that the error is related to definition updating of Microsoft Security Essential.&nbsp; Indeed, I have found a way to manually trigger the d1 stop error, which then cascades into multiple BSODs and restarts over the next few hours until the system
 clears.&nbsp; I can manually trigger the cascade of errors by opening the MSE user interface before wmiprvse runs (I have ten minutes to this, consistently) while an update is pending (downloaded by wuauclnt) and pressing the update button manually.&nbsp; After the
 installation, the MSE update lauches the MpCmdRun process which causes the first error.&nbsp; Note that this is the same MpCmdRun process that wmiprvse lauches automatically ten minutes after a windows restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cascade of BSOD stop errors include d1, 8e, 7f, e7, 1a, 4e, and even the 0A fault while starting the Windows Subsystem statup system process {Fatal immediately}.&nbsp; I realize that every time someone sees a d1 stop error, they immediately say driver or
 memory.&nbsp; My memory has been tested exhaustively using boot-time testing overnight run from floppy.&nbsp; And after two hours of restarts and BSODs, my system always returns to usable and stable eventually.&nbsp; However, since MSE only offers one update per day, I have
 to do this on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I am running a dual-boot system.&nbsp; My backup system is at SP2,&nbsp;three of the four same drivers, and no applications other than those installed by Windows XP automatically.&nbsp; The fourth driver for my Dell Monitor is not compatible with SP2, so I use the system's
 built-in Plug and Play monitor instead.&nbsp; That backup system is experiencing no issues at all, so I am sure I am not chasing a hardware issue.&nbsp; The problem is a software compatibility issue between MSE and and other software in the SP3 system.&nbsp; I normally configure
 McAfee Internet Security after I am finished rebuilding a system, but I use MSE as my default protection while building the system.</p>

I disagree with your interpretation and opinion on all points, but you are entitled to your opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have <strong>no disrespect</strong> for XP users. In fact, I recognize that there are many, many people who simply cannot afford to upgrade or get a new PC and this worries me.</p>
<p>Windows XP *was* the best operating system. It is longest lived because there were some mis-steps in the development and release of Vista, which greatly improved the security of Windows, made some major architectural changes, but fell short due to pretty
 intense system requirements. Windows 7 improved on Vista and is a vast improvement over XP. Windows 8 has even better Security, but it is so different from XP through Windows 7 in many ways that many people are hesitant to change.</p>

            Agreed Stephen.&nbsp; Windows Me and Windows Vista met similar fates for valid reasons.&nbsp; In my case the issue is not financial.&nbsp; I currently use 3 machines daily, with 5 operating systems on them, and 4 different virus/malware solutions.&nbsp; Its not my intent
 to support one over another.&nbsp; As PA Bear correctly noted from previous discussion, my old XP system doesn't hardware qualify to run the newer operating systems.&nbsp; I configure each system I use for the tasks that I have assigned to them, which are very different
 in use and capability.&nbsp; Soon I will add a fourth notepad system, but I am currently undecided between Windows 8 versus Android.<br />
<br />
Back to the problem:&nbsp; The compatibility issue is real.&nbsp; Since I saw no way of stopping wmiprvse from interacting with MSE, and leading to a cacade of BSODs, I decided to unload MSE.&nbsp; Without security essentials loaded, wmiprvse runs normally, and quietly dismisses
 itself without error.&nbsp; My system stability is now restored, and I can address the remaining issues in my build, including IE8, WMP11, and other Windows Security updates.<br />
<br />
Use of MSE during the build process was a convenience. It is indeed the most efficient and least intrusive of the available virus/malware solutions.&nbsp; However, I cannot deal with a cascade of BSODs triggered on a ten minute interval while trying to build and
 configure a system.<br />
<br />
Which returns us to the original question. Why was wmiprvse running, and why did its interaction with MSE lead to BSODs.&nbsp; Answer unknown, but for now I will continue without MSE.&nbsp; My best guess is that other configuration problems exist, and MSE realtime protection
 was blocking windows from performing its normal error recovery which my now stable system shows XP was capable of doing.&nbsp; It also explains why my XP2 system is stable with the same drivers, since that backup system is not running MSE.<br />

            Thanks for the input, RickCP<br />
<br />
I am 100% with you on looking for an existing viral/malware infection.&nbsp; So far I have tried three independent methods of performing a standalone scan, and all three methods got blocked.<br />
<br />
1) Installed McAfee Security Scanner available as an optional install from Adobe Flashplayer's Updater.&nbsp; When I ran the scan, the program succeeded on the quickscan phase, but then crashed during the Web Threats scan phase.<br />
<br />
2) Attempted to download Microsoft's Security Scanner from download.microsoft.com using IE8 and IE8 crashed when I attempted to go to the Security main page.<br />
<br />
3) Fought through one failed attempt to download McAfee Stinger (aka GetSusp) using Firefox, the second attempt succeeded to download, but when I attempt to run the scanner it crashes within seconds for no obvious reason (I get the Windows popup telling me
 it dies.)<br />
<br />
I have MalwareBytes on CD, and that will be my next attempt.<br />
<br />
Wish me luck.&nbsp; -- Jerry<br />

<p>After you select Access oleDB - then before you browse to the file, click on advanced, and make sure it using ACE as opposed to JET.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It changes automatic, but that assumes that ACE is installed. If you don't see ace in this dropdown, then it likely not installed correctly. Also, try installing the x32 bit version of the ACE provider - not the x64 bit version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I would grab the x32 bit version from here:</p>

<h2>            Deleted rule still showing error message</h2>
                    Hi folks,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a very annoying issue with my outlook. I used to have a rule to move a message to a folder, basic stuff. however I needed to delete some rules to make room for another ones, so I deleted this rule. Now even though this rule doesn't exist anymore
 I still get an error message stating that:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Error: Cannot move to the "Folder"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a fix for this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already tried to create and delete the rule again, already deleted the root folder.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<h3> dranwyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to upgrade Windows 10 after build 10130</h2>
                    <p>I have tried updating through Windows update (and when available, through ISO) to the latest Windows 10 Build since after 10130. &nbsp;All of them, from 10159 to 10162 to 10166 and now finally 10240 have failed. &nbsp;10130 itself installed like a dream.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running with everything disabled (clean boot), and all USB devices unplugged except keyboard and mouse (and in a moment of desperation tried removing them as well). &nbsp;I have tried removing my network adapter, starting with the NIC unplugged.
 &nbsp;I am able to download every build, I am able to start the installation, but it fails at 78-84% (percentage varies by build, but is consistent in build) *after reboot*, of the "copying files" phase, while in WinRE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error log has shown the same details with every build, which I will supply here. &nbsp;The only things that change are the time stamps. &nbsp;When installing from ISO (as opposed to Windows Update), it will give some information after the failure: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>0xC1900101 - 0x20004<br />
The installation failed in SAFE_OS phase with an error during INSTALL_RECOVERY_ENVIRONMENT operation</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The thing most suspicious to me is the last line: &nbsp;the fatal error and access violation.</p>

<p>
</p><p>A clean install will result in an UNactivated installation as the activation servers have been taken offline until 7/29. Currently, customers need to install OVER a previously activated build.

            <p>Thank you. &nbsp;Furthermore, I am actively attempting to assist with the "upgrade" scenario in my testing. &nbsp;Doing a fresh install would defeat that. &nbsp;The only reason I am operating in a "clean" mode (nothing launching at startup) right now is to assist with
 troubleshooting so that an answer that is useful for others may be derived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot optimize my drive, as it is an SSD; optimization is unavailable. &nbsp;The drive has no bad sectors or any logical problems found by chkdsk. &nbsp;Memory check results are clean as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A previously downloaded ISO has not been useful in any event.</p>

<div>Your log showed "CallPidGenX: PidGenX function failed on this product key. "</div>

            <p>Thanks, Barb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about to try a clean installation; I cannot go back to my before-Windows 10 upgrade version, as part of my numerous troubleshooting steps involved running cleanup on the system drive. &nbsp;I have one last thing to try, then I'm going to give up and nuke/pave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am uncertain how a fresh installation from 10 is going to work. &nbsp;I'm probably going to have to reinstall 8.1 in order to have a licensed copy of Windows 10. &nbsp;Or no?</p>

            <p>I have found the solution for my issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Detaching my other SATA drives addressed this error for me.&nbsp; In my system I had an optical drive attached to a secondary SATA&nbsp;controller.&nbsp; Oddly, this didn't cause an issue until AFTER I was already using Windows10 TP.&nbsp; I am uncertain if it was the secondary
 controller (as described in the article) or any other drive, but this did address it for me, after trying MANY other fixes.

<p>hi there ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can realise that u are desperate in it, one thing u can try turn OFF the
<u>Warning tones</u> in the profile whichever is set up when using the camera if still&nbsp;it Sounds..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then Ur phone is made&nbsp;purposely&nbsp;to give a sound when a Pic is taken Nothing u can do about it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also a victim of it :smileywink:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>most camera phones now have no option to disable the camera shutter as it law in most countries,there is an invasion of privacy matter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can try this but doubt it will work now</p>
<p>tools: profile: general: Warning tones: 'off'</p>

            On this page, I saw very much prob with Nokia mobile. What does Nokia think about their products ? Completed QC CHECK ? None of customer wants to bring his/ her mobile to care center, even after that the phone works well. Nobody wants to use a repared
 mobile.

            Hi Jon,
<br />Try to clear your cache on the browser. Chrome open Press and hold the CMD and SHIFT on Keybord and press Delete this will bring up the settings for deleting your browser cache. A new browser tab with a popup window opens. In the drop-down menu at the top, you can select which time range. If you want to delete all the cache data select "the beginning of time".
<br />Enable the checkbox "Cached images and files".
<br />Click on the button "Clear Browsing data" and reload the website. then close out of everything and restart your computer. 
<br />Log back onto your email and try to send again. 
<br />This may also help.

<h2>            A clustered column chart shows the word &#91;VALUE&#93; instead of actual data</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp; An associate in Bulgaria created a PPT stacked column chart containing 5 sections.&nbsp; Used "Select Data" to populate the chart.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the slide is looked at in the US the top, middle and bottom portions of the chart contain the data from the Excel data sheet.&nbsp; The other two divisions contain the word [VALUE].&nbsp; My associate in Bulgaria says, when they look at the&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;which they
 created, all 5 chart sections contain data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using PPT Office 2010, an associate here in the US using PPT Office 2013 also sees the error.&nbsp; I am not sure which version of Office my associate in Bulgaria is using.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification. I was able to find a few similar reports. It appears to be a compatibility problem when a chart created in a later version is then viewed in an earlier version:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ie/en-US/272436db-6bd3-4cee-8af1-2fbece0ded49/powerpoint-chart-created-in-office2013-is-showing-the-word-value-in-versions-of-2010-powerpoint?forum=officeitpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Powerpoint
 chart created in office2013 is showing the word "VALUE" in versions of 2010 powerpoint... compatibility issue?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this one, John Wilson identifies the probable cause in the last reply:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_powerpoint-mso_other-mso_2013_release/powerpoint-2013-charts-have-information-replaced/715b4e34-fd0f-4374-bd74-451863cb1d2f">Powerpoint 2013 charts have
 information replaced by #value when opening in Powerpoint 2010 or 2007. </a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You could work around this by saving the file as a PDF, or by saving in an earlier version of PowerPoint and fixing the display prior to distribution.</p>

<h3> joshuacaleb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I have contacts &#64; Outlook.com with no contact information&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the "People" section, I have contacts, that might just have a photo, and a name, but I don't recognize the name, or the photo. There is no e-mail address, and it says they are my contact on messenger, and Outlook, or one or the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't recognize them, or I might, but I am not sure. I think that some of them are people that I deleted from my contact lists on messenger or from various former mail programs such as "windows live mail." However, some of them I never remembered
 chatting with, and I am not sure if I ever e-mailed them or not, at least with this specific account. Maybe somebody included them in a mass message to me. But there is no contact information at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why? They are in my "People" contact list on Outlook.com, but it says nothing about them except a name or a picture, sometimes neither. It might say "unnamed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to see if I can get rid of some contacts if they are unnecessary, but not if they are my friends. However, I would like to be sure they are not my friends first. But I can't tell, because it is not listing their contact information.</p>

                    <p>We recently went through a conversion from Office 2003 to Office 2010.&nbsp; We have several "template" documents that we set a read-only password on (in 2010, File...Save As...Tools...General Options...Password to modify).&nbsp; When we open one of these documents,
 it prompts for the password and works correctly if you enter the password.&nbsp; However, if you click "Read-only", the file properly opens as read-only but users cannot "Save As" to create their own version of the file and modify it.&nbsp; This used to work in Office
 2003, and File...Info screen seems to give the impression that you can save a new copy, but when I click on File...the Save As menu is greyed out and when I go into File...Info, clicking the large "Save As" button just goes back to the presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried multiple documents, different PCs and also non-domain PCs (in case it was security related in some way) and they all act the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions or if there is an "Office 2010 method" for creating read-only templates, I would appreciate help with that procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>&gt;&gt; We would consider changing rights or using read-only flags, but these become more difficult to administer.&nbsp; Most end users know how to use document passwords, very few understand permissions or read-only flags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They wouldn't need to. If you open a read-only presentation (ie, one of your template files), PowerPoint will tell the user that it's read only and prompt them to save a copy under a new name.</p>

            <p>Hmm.&nbsp; I'd say if it used to let you open a read only document then save an editable copy, it was a bug that's now been corrected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By templates, do you actually mean regular presentations that users are to open, save and then modify (as opposed to the more usual, specific meaning&nbsp;of templates in PPT)?</p>
<p>What about setting them as read-only in Windows rather than using read-only password protection in PPT?</p>
<p>Or if users are opening these from a network changing permissions on the directory where the files reside should permit opening but not saving/overwriting the originals.</p>

<h2>            N82 USB connectivity</h2>
                    Hi<br />
I just upgraded into N82 from a N72.<br />
I really found 82 a masterpiece. but just a little to worry.<br />
<br />
When i try to connect N82 to the PC via the cable thselection menu appears as normal to select the mode. So when i select 'Data transfer' moden it says that 'The memory card is used by another application. It closed all the application opened but still i couldn't
 connect the phone to the PC.<br />
<br />
Please help.

            hi,<br />
<br />
why dont you use the application "Switch" in the N82, look for it inside the Utility folder and just follow the instructions on the phone, i find it quite the best way to Switch from an old nokia phone to a new nokia s60 phone...

<br />
This is a bit confusing but it's actually correct. Your memory card IS being used by your USB connection i.e. your PC - So you can no longer access it with your phone.

            hi, I have the exact same problem with my N82 and I was wondering if you've found a way to fix it yet. If you have could you please tell me how you did it? I'd be very grateful cos right now i can't transfer any of my music into it.

    <title>Outlook Contact Pictures Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l wilsmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Contact Pictures Missing</h2>
                    I am using Outlook 2016 in Microsoft 365 on a Dell. I do not use Outlook.com.&nbsp; I discovered today that some, but not all, of my Outlook contact pictures are missing. The new format, which started tonight, of incoming emails having the sender's initials
 in a circle if no picture is available, drew my attention to the missing pictures.&nbsp; I don't know if the loss of pictures coincided with the incoming email format change, but that change drew my attention to the picture loss. I haven't made any changes to my
 computer. Is there any way to retrieve the pictures?&nbsp; Would be great if MS would warn us of these changes and make them optional.

    <title>Unable to turn tablet back on in 10074 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to turn tablet back on in 10074</h2>
                    I run 10074 on Dell venue pro 11 and am experiencing crashing all the time when I press and hold the power button, because there is no other way to bring the tablet back to life. Also if I manage to come back to life,&nbsp;oftentimes the&nbsp;wi-fi is not working&nbsp;
 there&nbsp;is&nbsp;no internet even though the tablet says that I am connected to the internet.&nbsp; Apparently, if I leave a radio station running and then turn the screen off, I can go back fine with pressing the power button. It seems that audio running prevents the
 problem to occur.

            It looks like the culprit of this 'turning back on' problem is the buggy battery saver.&nbsp; Once I turn it off, I no longer experience the problem.

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have been using my skype account for many years to connect with colleagues and friends. I have also pre-paid skype for this so my credit card should be on file, as well as my age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was on a call trying to find something and did not pay attention to my input. Must have input the wrong year and hit send. Now I am locked out of my account because I 'need to ask my parents for permission' and cannot prove my age because location
<strong>is fixed on USA</strong> - I live in the UK. No way to get in touch with help either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to unlock my account asap&nbsp;</p>
<p>
