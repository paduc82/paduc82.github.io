<h2>            No sound after Anna Update</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am from India. My phone is N8-00.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated Symbian Anna update (25MB) OTA. However, I did not update 1/2 and 2/2.</p>
<p>I came to know that the PC update is much larger (about 300MB) and so I decided to REINSTALL the update using PVI Suite.</p>
<p>The update was downloaded and installed fine (about 250+MB). I restarted the phone as well. However a strange thing happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not hear any sound on incoming / outgoing calls. No sound when I was playing songs. Checked on Bluetooth, Loudspeaker, and Handset. Same story.</p>
<p>I thought this could be due to bluetooth device. I am using Jawbone Era. So I turned the bluetooth device off. However, the problem continued for the calls active / songs being played.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strange thing though. If the BT Headset is already off, the calls are placed and I can hear audio fine on incoming / outgoing calls as well as hear music. However, as soon as switch the Bluetooth on, there is no audio on BT, LS, or HS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this happens, I also see that my GPRS connection shows failed / unavailable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I restarted the phone a few times. Did not help.</p>
<p>I removed the BT pairing and then re-discovered and re-paired. No go.</p>
<p>I reset the phone by press+hold Power button for 8 sec and waiting for 3 vibrations. No go.</p>
<p>I removed the Packet Data Connection (Access Point) and reconfigured. No go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally after I restarted the phone once more after all these steps, the sound was working again and the internet connection was back.</p>
<p>I am currently downloading the Symbian Anna Updates 1/2 and 2/2, since for some reason they are still shown as available even after updating the 250MB+ version!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already have the Sleeping Screen installed, which is perhaps the reason why there is no error&nbsp;/ failure yet while I am downloadin these...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any clue why this happened? I do not have any guarantee if things will continue to work fine, and will post here if they do (or don't).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate comments / suggestions...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BR,</p>
<p>- Soaham</p>

<p>I am from India too <font color="#888888"><em>(dont know if this has got anything to do with the country, though)</em></font> and am facing the same problem on my new
<strong><font color="#800000">Nokia E6</font></strong>, which runs on Symbian Anna.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I somehow happened to find a <font color="#800000"><strong>temporary solution</strong></font> -</p>
<ul>
<li>disconnected the Bluetooth headset</li><li>removed the pairing from the phone</li><li>switched off the phone</li><li>removed the battery and waited for a min</li><li>restarted the phone and re-paired the Bluetooth headset</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and <font color="#800000"><strong>BINGO</strong></font> ! It was working !!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BUT - this is not a permanent solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>After sometime, the sound again went off in the device.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any fix for this ? <strong><font color="#800000">Is this a Symbian Anna issue that everyone's facing ?</font></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            There is nothing in there about flagged emails! If there were, why would so many people be confused? Have you even looked at it? Or is that just your knee jerk answer to everything? I would bet on the latter.&nbsp;

<p>On top of page to the far right there is an 'ALL' option button. Click on it and the drop down menu contains the word Flagged, clicking on flagged brings up all your 'flagged' emails.&nbsp;</p>

You, Sir, are frickin' awesome! Finally, after all this time, someone with a real answer. Thank you. It's a shame since your original post, till now (mine suddenly switched without warning to outlook preview ) there hasn't been a change to make this more user
 intuitive. Either way, thanks for the answer - finally can find my flagged emails.&nbsp;

<p>Victoria42b on 2nd Jan 2016 put it like this 'On top of page to the far right there is an 'ALL' option button. Click on it and the drop down menu contains the word Flagged, clicking on flagged brings up all your 'flagged' emails.'</p>
<p>Make sure you can see the date column on the right of your screen. &nbsp;The text 'ALL' is at the top of the date column (below 'Undo' menu item). &nbsp;If you can't see the arrow, click on the text 'ALL' adn a list drops-down.</p>
<p>Hope you find it.</p>

    <title>2010 TOC show both begin and end page numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nalani  say:</h3>
<h2>            2010 TOC show both begin and end page numbers</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible in an automated TOC (Word 2010) to show both the beginning and ending page number of an entry?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notes to Bla Bla Bla .................................. 6 - 24</p>
<p>I know I can do something like this with bookmarks, just wondering if it could be done in a TOC.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            No. The best you could do automated would be to put a separate TC field or heading at the end of Notes to Bla Bla Bla and have that show up as a separate entry in the table of contents. You could then manually edit the TOC to get the result you want.<br />

    <title>Where is deleted items section in MyPhone&#63; Need to restore - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where is deleted items section in MyPhone&#63; Need to restore contacts</h2>
                    I deleted all the contacts on my HTC HD2 because I was having some issues and had them synced with MyPhone, so I wanted to redownload them from the service.<br />
<br />
However, when I just synced with MyPhone, it instead ended up deleting all the contacts from the MyPhone server...completely opposite of what I had wanted.<br />
<br />
I read some older questions on this forum and saw there is a "deleted items" option to recover deleted data but I cannot find it.
<br />
<br />
What can I do?<br />
<br />

<p>Go into web portal (<a href="http://myphone.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://myphone.microsoft.com</span></a>) then select the Archive option on the left side bar.<br />
<br />
There you can check your contatcs that were deleted before. You can chose what contacts&nbsp;you want to restore again. After that those contacts will be retored to your phone again on the next My Phone synchronization.<br />
<br />
Let me know if this help.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

            Hi AnythingBlue, 
<br />
<br />Let’s try a couple things to make sure it’s not on the store end. 
<br />
<br />App troubleshooter - <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/Appsdiagnostic10.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F2...</a> - download and run and see if it finds anything wrong with the store. 
<br />
<br />Next, let’s clear the cache - Hit the windows key + r, then type “wrreset.exe” and hit enter.  This will clear the windows store cache. Let’s check the store again. 
<br />
<br />Do you have other videos you’ve downloaded, are they kicking off the same error, or is it just BlackPool? 
<br />
<br />Is there any chance you could send a screenshot to me? 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows Key + PrntSc and a photo will save within a screenshot folder in your Pictures folder. Send it over and we’ll try to figure this one out!
<br />- C

<p>Hi, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>The troubleshooter found a possible issue and fixed it, but the issue persists. I tried other videos on my pc and they worked, this is the first time I bought a video from the store though.</p>
<p>I don't have the app in english and don't know how to change that so I'm not sure if the screenshot will be helpful.</p>
<p>Is there any other app I could watch it in? I don't have an xbox, just an android tablet.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Installed the above about 2 years ago, no problems mostly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instant search has always worked but now says "search results incomplete because items are still being indexed".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under search tools, the number of items being indexed appears to be stuck at around 95,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried deselecting Outlook in change locations and then doing a rebuild but results in the same - indexing appearing to get stuck and no instant search.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Missing sub folders in Outlook after import - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lussolux  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing sub folders in Outlook after import</h2>
                    <p>Today I stopped using my GoDaddy email due to continuous problems and opened up a gmail through google biz. Before updating my outlook to the new gmail logins I backed up my outlook and specifically clicked the box to export the subfolders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then updated my outlook account (email address stayed the same) with the new log in, password &amp; incoming/outgoing servers for gmail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once that was set up in outlook and working I used the import tool and imported my backup pst file.....while everything that was in my previous standard Inbox came over, none of my subfolders did. I tried searching for specific emails that were in these
 subfolders and they did not come up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next step I did was to open and view the pst file in outlook, when I do that the subfolders are there, some even show there are unread emails however when you click on any of the folders they state "we did not find anything to show here". &nbsp;The good news
 is that when I do a search now with this data file open I can find the emails that were in the sub folders so I know they are there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this has any baring but when I exported the original pst file it was through a POP account with GoDaddy...no my Gmail account is an IMAP account. Both accounts are using the same email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to get access to the subfolders and the email in them...any suggestions?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to resolve this issue we need more information. Let us know the following:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
What do you mean by ‘I then updated my outlook account (email address stayed the same) with the new log in, password &amp; incoming/outgoing servers for gmail’, please clarify. Did you use the new Gmail account password for the account that already existed in Outlook
 2013? </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
When you say ‘The next step I did was to open and view the PST file in outlook, when I do that the subfolders are there’, do you mean you opened the PST file in a new Profile or in the same Profile?&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>In case you opened your PST file in the same Profile and were not able to find the emails in the sub-folders, try opening the PST file in a new Outlook Profile. To create a new
 Outlook Profile let us follow these steps: </span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After creating the new Outlook Profile, try opening the PST file and check if you are able to see all emails in all the folders. If yes, then you may
 configure your email account/s in the new Profile and move any other data that you have on the old Profile to the new Profile.

<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>What do you mean by ‘I then updated my outlook account (email address stayed the same) with the new log in, password &amp; incoming/outgoing servers for gmail’, please clarify. Did you use the new Gmail account password for the account that already
 existed in Outlook 2013?&nbsp;<strong>My original email account was for example *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and it was hosted by go daddy as that is who holds are web domain. That email was set up in outlook as a pop account. When I switched to gmail biz I used the same outlook
 profile and just changed the password and codes to the gmail account, which is now an IMAP account. Same email address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** just new passwords, email hosts and new email types. (pop to imap)</strong></p>

<p>When you say ‘The next step I did was to open and view the PST file in outlook, when I do that the subfolders are there’, do you mean you opened the PST file in a new Profile or in the same Profile?<strong> In the same profile I viewed the same

            <p>Something doesn't sound right :-) There seems to be some confusion of the 2 methods I mentioned. The contextual menu that appears when right-clicking an
<em>object</em> should not contain the <strong>New Comment</strong> or <strong>Borders &amp; Shading</strong> commands. Those commands don't pertain to pictures, shapes, etc. I only recall seeing them when right-clicking in a text area &amp; there typically are more
 than just the 7 commands you mentioned. Let's start at the beginning...</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create Alt Text you first need to bring up the <strong>Format Picture Task Pane</strong> which displays on the right side of the document window. The pane can be produced in either of 4 ways;</p>
<ol>
<li>Double-click the object, <em>or</em></li><li>Right-click the object &amp; select the <strong>Format</strong> [<strong>Picture</strong> or
<strong>Shape</strong> or <strong>SmartArt</strong>, etc.] command in the contextual menu,
<em>or</em></li><li>Select the object then go to <strong>Format</strong> in the main menu to select
<strong>Picture</strong> or <strong>Shape</strong> or <strong>SmartArt</strong>, etc., or</li><li>Select the object then use the <strong>Shift+Command+1</strong> keyboard shortcut</li></ol>
<p>Using either of those 4 methods will cause the Task Pane to appear. You can then click the Layout &amp; Properties button as illustrated in this screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/327fb4ea-a0e9-425d-94e9-5795982a1bca" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still cannot produce the Task Pane my bet is that the document is saved in the old .<em>doc</em> file format which does not support Alt Text. Does
<strong>[Compatibility Mode]</strong> appear following the file name in the Title Bar? If so, use
<strong>Save As</strong> to create a new copy of the document in the .<em>docx</em> file type. You then should be able to assign Alt Text.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Firstly, I suggest you to update the <strong>BIOS firmware</strong>. You may contact Computer Manufacturer for assistance to update the BIOS.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any
 problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Once the BIOS is updated try installing the latest Chipset drivers and then install Windows 10 Build 10130 using ISO and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

            <p>firstly, I think I should thank you for your reply. but I'd appreciate it if you would've read the log first before replying.<br />
secondly, it had nothing to do with bios, it most likely had something to do with the left over drivers after updating.</p>
<p>I reinstalled windows from scratch and installed only the updated drivers and mostly it works except Bluetooth, Miracast and some minor glitches that I already reported.</p>

<p>
</p><p>probably the issue was that there was a driver that fails to load during the Hybrid boot sequences causing the system to restart then start with a cold boot which takes a&nbsp;remarkably longer time.<br />

I was just hoping to find a more comprehensive answer than the one above, it was really a text book non related answer, an answer of someone who didn't bother reading.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is happening because under Control Panel &gt; Regioal Settings, your system is set to mm/dd/yyyy.&nbsp; Change that to dd/mm/yyyy, restart your system, open any Excel file and now you will be able to enter a date in dd/mm/yyyy format.</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a Share Calendar in Outlook (Exchange server) with a bunch of people in my organization.</p>
<p>I have 365, most of the people have Outlook 2013, we have 2 Mac Outlook 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall it works really well and everyone is able to display and see the shared calendar. Everyone has full Edit rights.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However in some of the events / invitations, some cannot display them properly. In particular I have in there tables (created directly in the body of the invite) that display as lines or raw text for some of my users (one of them on Outlook 2013, the other
 one I am not sure). It looks good for most people, just&nbsp;2 have that issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone have that issue before and have any idea how to solve it? Is there a display or reading setting somewhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you much for the help,</p>
<p>Antoine</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all run Windows 10 (except the 2 Mac, btw installing shared calendars on MAC was a pain!) on different laptops, some Surface Pro 3, some Surface Book, some HP.</p>

</p><p>We tried that on the 2 computers that fail to make it work but it did not do it.</p>
<p>Could it be a problem of their machines displaying "HTML" formatted calendar items?</p>

                    I wanted to create a pivot table that showed the top 10 areas by the sum of amount, however, Excel for Mac 2011 only displays the first 10 items in the list. Has anyone else seen this?

            <p>I don't believe the answer given is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Top X function will collect and display the Top X records for the values in the column specified in the Top X dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it does not sort them in order of the chosen value column which may add some confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To correctly display a sorted, Top X list, do one of the following (clear any filters to start):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sort the relevant value column; this will give a correctly sorted data set. Now apply the Top X filter to the sorted column.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where things can go awry because its possible to apply the Top X filter to a different column from that used in the previous sort. This will result in an Top X list taken from the "wrong" column sorted by the "right" column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Apply the Top X filter by specifying the target column in the Top X dialog. Now apply a sort to the column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2 is probably the safest option in a multi-column table since it forces the correct value column to be selected in the first step.</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>The confusion is compounded by the fact that there is no visibility of the exact nature of the current select/order by on the limited dataset.</p>

<h2>            Convert Form Module Code to Class Module for Reuse</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to 'upgrade' a bit of code I need to use in all my forms.</p>
<p>I started with a simple bit of code to modify to current form</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel As Integer)<br />
On Error GoTo Error_Handler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each ctl In Me.Controls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ....</p>
<p>Then I wanted to rewrite it so I could have one routine and simply pass it the form name, and as such replace 10-15 lines of code in each form by one call to this function.</p>
<p>Sub UpdateForm(sFormName As String)<br />
On Error GoTo Error_Handler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim sFrm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set sFrm = Forms(sFormName)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each ctl In sFrm.Controls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ....</p>
<p>It does work for the main form but then generates errors when I apply it against subforms, and subsubforms....&nbsp; Can it be generalized so I can use it everywhere.</p>
<p>I call it simply by entering</p>
<p>Call UpdateForm(Me.Name)</p>
<p>Is it the way I call the function that is the issue or do I need to mod the procedure itself?</p>
<p>Thank you for the help,</p>

<p>You can even go this one better, requiring no code at all in the calling form; the trick is to code it as a public Function (rather than a Sub), and call it by just putting a reference to the function in the appropriate Event Property:</p>

<h2>            How can I unsuperscript the registration mark in Office 2010&#63;</h2>
                    When you insert the symbol it is already superscripted but you can then superscript it again. I need it the normal size, such as copywrite mark or circle c. Please help!

            <p>Perhaps change the way that you insert the symbol.</p>
<p>If I click within a text box &gt; Insert &gt; Symbol &gt; More symbols and find and select the registration symbol, insert and close, the registration symbol is full&nbsp;font size and&nbsp;not superscripted. You can then select the symbol, text box tools format tab, look
 within the font grouping for the option to superscript or subscript.</p>

            <p>Since Access databases can contain potentially dangerous VBA code, Microsoft Outlook treats them as executable code and blocks them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compress the database into a Zip file (right click in Explorer and choose Send To... Compressed (Zipped) File) and mail the Zip. It will not only let you send the file, it will be much smaller and upload faster as well.</p>

            Sometime you'll find that even zipped Access files are blocked.&nbsp; I had this problem not long ago sending files to the US military, who are understandably a little sensitive about what they receive!&nbsp; What I had to do was change the file extension to $$$,
 then my contact changed it back to the correct extension on receipt.

            Are you referring to text animation? Try selecting the text and then pressing Ctrl+SpaceBar; this removes any font formatting which is not part of the current paragraph style.

            Hi, Figuring Glint. <br />

Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the reply. The problem I'm having is that I can't remove or move any of the apps from the internal storage as each does not have the option, things like phone, outlook, settings etc.</p>
