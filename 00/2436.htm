<p><span>Hello
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Skype Community forum</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Since Skype stores your contacts centrally on our servers, so that you can access them anywhere as long as you sign in with the same account, it might be a connection/sync issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can you tell me if this keeps on happening on the same contacts consistently?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A</span><span>lso, can you try to uninstall and re install your Skype and if possible, try to access
 your Skype using a different device and see if the same thing happens there. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you and let me know what happens.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>OneDrive should stop clogging up Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> surface tester  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive should stop clogging up Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 is designed to be installed on low storage devices (i.e. 16 or 32 GB of disk space), then the OneDrive app that comes with the OS is a big nuisance for those who have a lot of files stored there. For this app was set up by default to automatically
 save all files for offline use thus using up all of the limited storage space. This becomes a problem as updating the OS often requires extra storage space but the cloud storage system, which could not be avoided, would use it up, preventing the update from
 being installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus Microsoft should turn this option off by default, particularly when there is not a lot of storage on the device. If we want to access our files offline we can turn it on ourselves. Nobody wants to link a cheap $99 tablet to the cloud only to find they
 have no more space left on the device to keep it up to date. So why would this company want us to enjoy the convenience of having our files anywhere, anytime without considering that it would limit the users' abilities to update?</p>
<p>

            <p>Maybe its easier for the masses to have&nbsp;OneDrive up and&nbsp;running as most people wont even know what it is or what it does.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stick it in their face by default and it will be used and learned</p>
<p>
</p><p>The comparatively few that do&nbsp;have the minimal&nbsp;storage&nbsp;as in the $99 windows tablets will learn how to set&nbsp;the files to&nbsp;online only and should have know when they bought the small gigabyte hand held thing that&nbsp;from the beginning&nbsp;they were limited in drive

            I don't mine that&nbsp;oneDrive being setup automatically...but I do have an issue with it being login all the time and no ability to log out or change it to another OneDrive account. I can do this with Dropbox but not with OneDrive...thus I store a majority
 of my documents, pics, videos, on Dropbox as this login/log out feature is not available on OneDrive...more lost revenue for Microsoft.

<h3> crestonave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conflicting information as to status of MSE on my computer&#63;</h2>
                    I have a green icon with a check mark in it, which when I open it tells me that my computer is protected. I also have a red shield with an X in it, which when I open it (OPEN SECURITY CENTER) tells me that my Malware Protection is turned off - and tells
 me under Virus Protection to turn on MSE and tells me under Spyware and Other Protection that Windows Defender is turned off.
<br />
<br />
This shows up this way after I shut down and restart the machine - I'm using 64 bit Vista Home Premium - and in the past when I've turned on those two items I've had major problems with my browsers - Mozilla, Firefox and IE won't work properly.<br />
<br />
Please help. Thanks.

<h2>            can&#39;t see data in datasheet view</h2>
                    I have a database originally created with Access97.&nbsp; When I moved to Windows 7, Access stopped working.&nbsp; I upgraded to Access2010 and it loaded the database and worked just fine.&nbsp; Today I went to datasheet view and attempted to delete a record.&nbsp; No luck
 with the technique that I used.&nbsp; So I added nonsense into the initial field and saved everything and printed out a report.&nbsp; I closed Access.&nbsp; I later reopened Access and went to datasheet view to update some of the data and it showed no data.&nbsp; The switchboard
 still works.&nbsp; The reports still print.&nbsp; I can edit/add items to the database using the switchboard form.&nbsp; But I can't get the datasheet view to show any data.&nbsp; What did I do wrong and how do I correct the problem?<br />
Sometimes using the switchboard is just too cumbersome.&nbsp; Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            <p>Well. that is odd, but it does indicate that there are records returned in the table/query's datasheet.&nbsp; If you are looking at a query's datasheet, try compacting the (FE?) database.&nbsp; If it's a table's datasheet, I have no explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You never said so, but if you're using a form in datasheet view, I would suspect the form is corrupted and suggest you try importing everything into a new blank database.</p>

<h2>            Newby can&#39;t get 10074 started</h2>
                    <p>I'm making my first attempt to install Windows 10. &nbsp;I downloaded an ISO with build 10074 and put it on a USB stick. &nbsp;A reboot picked up the install stick immediately. &nbsp;It seemed to install properly (I have a new empty SSD for it) &nbsp;The install created 4 partitions,
 and under Windows 8.1 explorer it displays what appears to be a normal Windows layout. &nbsp;However it will not boot to anything. &nbsp;It goes straight to a black screen with nothing but the cursor blinking in the upper left hand corner. &nbsp;I reinstalled it just in
 case, but the result was the same. &nbsp;The install goes through from start to end relatively quickly without any rebooting except at the end. &nbsp;Is this the expected process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone point me to something that you have all already learned?</p>
<p>

    <title>Excel 365 different instances - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 365 different instances</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just got an update to the Office 365 and there is this little thing that has been annoying me like you have no idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually when im working with excel I always have at least two different instances, one for the big files that can crash any time, and another one that in case the big file crash it doesnt make my other files im working on crash too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the update to 365, I could see my two different excell icons on my task bar, and if I cliked one of those icones it displayed the multiple files in that instance. But now with 365 i just cant separate my excel files in those two instances, or if they
 are actually on a different instance, the task bar has them mixed making really hard to know which files are in in the same instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know ig there is a way to have the same option as the last version where I could have my 2 instances separated in the task bar and the most important... to know what excel files are in each instance.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>PD. Im working no Windows 7 Enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Gvain,</p>
<p>It's not quite clear what you are trying to achieve. At first you say you want to reduce the resource to 2h/day but in the last part you say you want to keep the days the same as 8h for the resource. Are you saying you want to keep the task duration fixed
 but reduce the resource's hours? In that case, you need to use a fixed duration type task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How exactly did you assign the resource to the task in the first place (e.g. Assign Resources, Task Information/resources tab, etc.)? You say you tried to change the start [and] stop time for the resource. How exactly did you do that? Also I don't understand
 how reducing a resource's assignment level could "compress" the schedule. If anything, it should extend the duration (i.e. expand the schedule).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to better understand what you did and what you are trying to do before we can offer much assistance.</p>

<p>fixed duration task type!! ok let me look into that maybe that is it!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new to ms project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used defaults and put tasks in auto type.&nbsp; I linked them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the duration yes to stay same.....auto calculated one after other....but reduce the daily hours of the resource.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw a youtube video where you can setup contraints and let project auto calculate all, maybe that is the long term solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to give the resource enough time to do the work.</p>

<p>Gavin,</p>
<p>Based on your further explanation a fixed duration type task is exactly what you want. Project calculates the schedule based on the work equation:</p>
<p>Duration = Work/Units</p>
<p>In your case you want to fix the duration so the equation becomes</p>
<p>Work = Duration x units</p>
<p>So if the duration is 10 days with one resource assigned full time (100%), then the work will be 10 days (80h). If the resource is reduced to 1/4 time (25%), the work will reduce to&nbsp; 2.5 days (20h) and by default, Project will linearly spread those 20h over
 the full 10 day period. You can manually re-distribute those hours via the Task or Resource Usage views.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forget the youtube video, you do not want to use constraints. Constraints basically stall Project's ability to calculate a dynamic schedule by throwing "roadblocks" into the logical flow of tasks. There are instances where constraints are necessary, but
 your scenario is not one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>John</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender Won&#39;t Work</h2>
                    I believe I have contracted an adware file on my computer that has disabled my Windows virus scanner. I need to know how to turn it on. Every time I hit restart it says an error has occurred.

<p>Let me explain why this is happening....certain embedded files that are part of legitimate programs and specialized fix tools (like
<strong>AdwCleaner</strong>), may at times be detected by some anti-virus and anti-malware scanners as
<em>suspicious</em>, a <em>Risk Tool</em>, <em><a href="http://www.techopedia.com/definition/60/hacking-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Hacking Tool</span></a></em>,
<em><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.org/threat-analysis/2014/10/encountering-the-wild-pup-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Potentially Unwanted Program</span></a></em>, a
<em>possible threat</em> or even <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Malware</span></a></em><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">(virus/trojan)</span></em><strong>when that is not the case</strong>.
 This occurs for a variety of reasons to include the tool's compiler, the files it uses, whether files are
<a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/compfile.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 or password protected in order to conceal itself so they do not allow access for scanning often trigger alerts by security software as well.<br />
<br />
When flagged by an anti-virus or security scanner, it's because the program includes features, behavior or files that appear suspicious or which can potentially be used for malicious purposes. Compressed and packed files in particular are often flagged as suspicious
 by security software because they have difficulty reading what is inside them. These detections do not necessarily mean the file is malicious or a bad program. It means it has the potential for being misused by others or that it was simply detected as suspicious
 or a threat due to the security program's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_analysis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>possible new variants of malware</em>. Heuristics uses non-specific detection methods to find new or unknown malware which allows the anti-virus to detect and stop if before doing any harm to your system. The disadvantage to using heuristics is that it
 is not as reliable as signature-based detection (blacklisting) and can potentially increase the chances that a non-malicious program is flagged as suspicious or infected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anti-virus scanners <strong>cannot distinguish</strong> between "good" and "malicious" use of such programs, therefore they may
<strong>incorrectly</strong> <strong>alert</strong> you of malware, <strong>block the file's download</strong>, automatically
<strong>remove the file</strong> or <strong>keep the program from running</strong> properly. In these cases the detection is a "<a href="http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/what-false-positive-antivirus-detection.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">false
 positive</span></a>" and can be ignored. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the well known specialized tools we use against malware are <strong>written by experts/Security Colleagues</strong> at various security forums like Bleeping Computer, TechSupport, GeeksToGo, Emsisoft and other similar sites so
<strong>they can be trusted</strong>. Unfortunately, many of these tools are falsely detected by various anti-virus programs from time to time for the reasons noted above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either <strong>have your anti-virus ignore the detection or temporarily disable</strong> it until you download and run the tool.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really depends on what type reset you will be doing. As far as our research goes regarding your post, the only reset that can restore the computer to the version it came with is by doing the
<strong>Restore factory settings. </strong>For your reference, kindly visit the link provided here:

<h2>            Give wife a license&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an office 365 home premium account with 5 licenses. I'm using two ( PC + laptop), I want to give the wife two for her PC and laptop, but I'm not seeing a way to give her one that is not shared with my info. &nbsp;My goal is to give her two of mine, but
 her have her own login in and skydrive space.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is this possible? Does she need to create her own live account and then use an installer from my account?</p>

            As Veritas says, you can't "give her one of your licenses", you actually only have 1 license, that allows (has right to) install on up to 5 computers "in your home".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So, yes, you wife does qualify to use these allowed installations.&nbsp; Your ID will continue to be the "administrator", but YOU will be able to use your account to install Office 365 HPA on her machines.<br />
<br />
The third and fourth links below talk about how to do what you want.&nbsp; The rest are more general info about getting the most out of your 365 license:<br />

</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>The key thing to remember is that the 2013 license is associated with 1,
</span>presumabley<span> yours, email address.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may use the license to install on up to 5 devices at the same time, including both PC‚Äôs and Macs. The Macs still get Office 2011 for Mac, until it is eventually upgraded.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you install Office 365 on a computer using your email address, you may share the installation with other Windows user ids created on that computer.</span></p>
<p><span>That first email address is considered the ‚Äúadministrator‚Äù of the license. It can ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù the license from a given computer if you want to transfer the allowed installation to another computer.

<p><em><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">In the case of Office 365 Home Premium and Small Business Premium, if you stop paying for those SKUs after a year, you'll have a grace period to figure out what to do with your stored information. In the case of Home Premium,
 users will be able to download their saved SkyDrive- and/or locally-saved data, open it with Office Web Apps and read/print it for some set period of time. (Microsoft isn't currently specifying how long that will be.) In the case of Small Business Premium,
 you'll have some kind of currently-unspecified grace period, as well, when you can access, read and print data stored in SharePoint Online.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">For users with an Office 365 Home Premium subscription, as the expiration date of that subscription approaches, users will receive notifications inside the Office applications and via e-mail to remind/nag users about the approaching
 expiration date.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">Once the subscription expires, the Office apps will enter a "read-only reduced functionality mode." This means users will be able to view or print documents, but won't be able to create any new documents or edit existing documents.</span></p>

            The release date for the 650 was February 2016 you might have trouble getting one in a store but you can get brand new ones online try Ebay you pay much less anyway and if you pay via PayPal you get an excellent guarantee that it will be as described on
 the advertised post

    <title>Twitter app, from the Windows App Store - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Twitter app, from the Windows App Store</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but here goes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Twitter app, from the App Store, and it's fine... except that there doesn't appear to be an option to quote a tweet. I can re-tweet, but not quote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never tried this app on Windows 8/8.1, so it may well be that it has never been a feature, but I just wanted to know if anyone else has noticed this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a problem for me, as I can always quote tweets on my mobile, but as this is a tech preview, and we're meant to be feeding back to Microsoft, I thought this was worth asking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John.</p>
<p />

            Twitter's Twitter app does not allow for quoting. It can only do retweets. The feedback for this would have to be sent to Twitter, not Microsoft.

            <p>It works on the Android app, although I rarely quote, so it doesn't really affect me.

<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to see if it was an issue with the new platform, which I now know is not the case.

    <title>Mail merge and line numbering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guylydig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail merge and line numbering</h2>
                    <p>I set up&nbsp;a mail merge with fields for student names. The document is a two-column "bubble sheet" numbered 1 - 25 using the Numbering button from the Paragraph section of the Home ribbon. Completing the merge results in a bubble sheet for each student each
 numbered correctly 1 - 25.&nbsp;It prints correctly. After it is saved,&nbsp;it looks fine and prints correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I close it and reopen it, the numbers automatically continue, so the second student's bubble sheet is numbered 26 -&nbsp;50 and the third 51 - 75, and so on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Line Numbering section of the&nbsp;Page Setup section of the Page Layout ribbon I know you can set line numbering to begin anew on each page but that does not work for me because I want to format the numbers (put a period after each one).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a simple way to do this. What am I missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
