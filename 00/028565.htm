<h2>            Error&#58; The message can&#39;t be sent right now. Please try again later.</h2>
                    <p>I have now joined the list of people with this error when sending through a connected account. &nbsp;All my emails are sitting in draft and not sending.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I've tried various browsers (IE, Chrome, Edge)</li><li>I've deleted the connected account and re-added it</li><li>If I try to send via my @outlook.com address it works but not through my other address.</li><li>It appears I am on the "new" Outlook as the top left shows "Outlook Mail" instead of "Outlook.com"</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a solution to this other than sending as my @outlook.com address because that is not a viable option for me. &nbsp;This problem has only started this week.</p>

            <p>The NEW outlook.com interface went live for me yesterday morning.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am having the same problem. &nbsp;For 3 years, I have never had a problem with OUTLOOK.COM, until the new interface went live for me a couple days ago. &nbsp;I have tried accessing the Outlook Web App (outlook.com) from multiple computers (macs and pcs) and multiple
 browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send a new email using the NEW web interface of OUTLOOK.COM with my gmail.com (my connected account) address as the send address.. &nbsp;That works fine. &nbsp;However, when I try to reply or to forward an email that I have received, the email will not send
 from my connected (gmail.com) account. &nbsp;I am given the following error message: &nbsp;"The message can't be sent right now. Please try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two mobile phones (a blackberry and iphone) connected to my outlook.com account, and there is no problem whatsoever with any functionality there, replies and forwards work just fine. &nbsp;It is only on OUTLOOK.COM on the web interface when I have issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is obviously a known issue with the new interface. &nbsp;Do you have any confirmation that a fix is in the works? &nbsp;Or, do you have any information if there is a way to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see on many message boards, all the Microsoft moderators and support engineers ask the same questions and apologize for any inconvenience the user may be having. &nbsp;With all due respect, we understand that you have to abide by your script and go through
 the motions, but EVERYONE with connected accounts is experiencing the same problem with the NEW Outlook.Com interface. &nbsp;Common sense dictates there is a major problem with the NEW Outlook.Com interface relating to the reply of and forwarding of emails. &nbsp;Rather
 then question the user and his or her settings, realize and accept that there is a problem with the NEW interface and let us know if there is a fix in the works and when to expect resolve or a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I urge the moderator and support engineers here to do a simple google search for "'The message can't be sent right now. Please try again later.' + outlook.com". &nbsp;List only the results in the last week and you can see how much of a problem it is.</p>

            <p>Same problem, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting my connected accounts (two of them), reestablishing the connection, connection is established and emails from those two accounts are available in my Outlook.com account. So all is good.... UNTIL I try to reply or forward an email from
 a connected account. Keep in mind, the email address that I am replying with is my connected account email addy. I get the same "This message can't be sent right now. Try later." These unsent emails all end up in my draft folder.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>And yet, I can compose a new email, using one of my connected account email addys and it sends with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried different browsers, and two different computers, and the same issues occur. From my android phone, the Outlook app is working fine, including being able to reply and forward emails from connected accounts.<br />

</p><p>For me its working as it is supposed to work. I think you've not connected your Gmail Account to Outlook.com in the appropriate way. Check out this:

            <p>HOT********HOT********ISSUE HAS AND IS RESOLVED!!!!!!<br />
PRIMARILY for those that get the message due to&nbsp;unusual activity temp block is on your account. WE ALL HAVE CHANGE A OUR PASSWORD several times, here's the problem,&nbsp;see&nbsp;if you been formatting on&nbsp;some&nbsp;level&nbsp;close to this:</p>
<p>original password....*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (in which has been ok). Microsoft with out warning puts a temp block on because they suspect unusual activity......ok i buy into it and when i change the password to janedoendaughter @msn.com, &nbsp;appears to be ok until
 i try to email and NOTHING has improved the same error BS/.\</p>
<p>to cut to the solution.....</p>
<p>Although &nbsp;the passwords are different, they are very close in a similar format, Microsoft will catch this with NO&nbsp;EXPLANATION&nbsp; and continue to keep you blocked because it did not through an automation detection process will not except&nbsp;your-new&nbsp;password.</p>
<p>Once i compose a letter to Bill gates i was scheduled an immediate&nbsp;appointment&nbsp;with an "upper&nbsp;class-man to gain access remote. 2 minutes after 4 weeks of tier 1 tier 2 doing the same exact &nbsp;dance with me. This tech asked me&nbsp;about&nbsp;t my password, after saying
 "no its been similar. Bingo he stated.</p>
<p>So from jondoe....i went to nipples4me. BINGO!&nbsp;resolved!</p>
<p>All in&nbsp;the&nbsp;format of the password.......i said to the savoir , with as many complaints with a similar issue why&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;this problem receive AIR TIME in abundance!!</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***....all welcome.</p>

<p>

<p>Some mails have been categorized into Blue and Red categories&nbsp;and some mails are not categorized.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How do I search for empty categories</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tested the following search criteria which <strong>do not work </strong>
:</p>
<p>
</p><p>category : []</p>
<p>category : ()</p>
<p>category : empty</p>
<p>category : is empty</p>
<p>category : ""</p>
<p>category : ''</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Outlook desktop is not an option. </p>
<p>Only OWA is used.</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Netdev2000,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Outlook Web App, if we type category: with some characters, the results will show the emails with the category “characters” or the results with the words “category (characters)”. So it is not
 feasible to search the results without a category. Here is the article for your reference:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Search-Mail-and-People-in-Outlook-on-the-web-for-business-88108edf-028e-4306-b87e-7400bbb40aa7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Search-Mail-and-People-in-Outlook-on-the-web-for-business-88108edf-028e-4306-b87e-7400bbb40aa7</a></span></p>
<p><span>I understand it would be nice if we have this feature in OWA.
</span><span>Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:</span></p>

            AMDx64 is just the name for the 64 bit system. It is historical and comes from the fact that AMD was the first to provide a 64 bit 86 based processor.

    <title>how to hide zero value in a cluster stacked chart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laura l.salazar  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to hide zero value in a cluster stacked chart</h2>
                    <p>I have a column staggered cluster chart with 5 data series and three different color vales. i want to display the data series but when i do this, values of zero also display at the bottom of the data bars. i want to be able to hide the data series if the
 value is zero. is there a way to do this? i tried using the format tab using "General;;; ". this works to hide the value of zero but it also changes the other chart values to show 2 decimal points and i don't want the two decimal points to show.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i appreciate any assistance with this.</p>

            <p>If it's just a number format you need, use the custom number format #,##0;-#,##0;</p>
<p>Make sure there is a ; at the end of this custom format as that denotes the zero format section, if there's no format setting in that section then the zeroes will disappear.</p>

<h2>            openoffice.org Writer has taken over my Word.doc files</h2>
                    <p>I am running Microsoft Office Word 2003 (11.8411) SP3. I installed Apache OpenOffice 4.1.0, and now I find that whenever I try to open one of my Word.doc files it automatically comes up in OpenOffice. In fact, all my Word.doc files have a new OpenOffice
 icon in front of them. I am not aware that i set OpenOffice as a default word processor, but it seems to have taken over. I would like to keep it on my computer, but would also like to use Word 2003.</p>
<p>

<h3> charplum  say:</h3>
<h2>            service pack 2 for office 2010 did not install</h2>
                    <p>Overnight service pack 2 for office 2010 did not install on my machine that runs XP.&nbsp; It did install on my machine that runs windows 9.</p>
<p>Since I had observed that I had new updates on the newer machine I checked the older machine manually.&nbsp; It identified that the service pack needed installation.&nbsp; I tried to install.&nbsp; It downloads the required files but the installation does not start.</p>
<p>I checked the update history and then observed that it tried to install last night.&nbsp; I checked the red symbol and it identified an error code 0x800B0100.</p>
<p>I investigated further and I was directed to something that was supposed to fix this error.&nbsp; I had the choice of fix it for me or do it manually.</p>
<p>On my first try I opted for the fix it for me.&nbsp; It failed again.</p>
<p>I then tried the manual fix that had 4 commands.&nbsp; I ran each of the commands as prescribed and it still failed to install.&nbsp; It downloads the files but it does not install.</p>
<p>It may be important but I did not reboot following each of these procedures.</p>
<p>When I did the manual steps I may have been in the wrong directory because following the entry of each of the 4 commands I did not see anything in the command window.</p>

            <p>You can go into the Security &amp; Compliance center and under Reports, then "View Reports" you will find some Site Admin Activities. It might not be what you are looking for, but its all they have right now. There are more audit features coming</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>You might can try the "Modified Site Permissions" to see if the permissions were changed on the site itself.</p>

<p>Well I've got one, I don't know if it is a bug or not or they just disabled that particular feature but when a message ( be it an sms or an email) comes my 5800's screen doesn't light up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any one has found any other bugs ??&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and one more thing if anyone has the same prob....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I connect via a wifi and use the default Browser (That's what I use), when I open the browser for the first time it always gives me an error message "Java probe error", but after I open it the second time it works. I have tried every thing, Hard reset,
 Reinstalling the Firmware and all and nothing seems to help..&nbsp;</p>

<p>second that about rotation, looks messy sometimes, like bits of the previous screen image linger during the rotation.</p>

<p>not sure if these are to do with new FW, but my alarm went garbled sound, which froze the phone completely so i had to get up &amp; remove the battery.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree with perlik. I'm having the same problem as perlik. When there is an incoming call I answered, I was unable to hear the caller's voice. And after they called again, it's back to normal. Were this is some kind of software glitch or is it the bugs
 of the new firmware? Any idea?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advice is, better stay with the current firmware v21. I hope Nokia can fixed this problem a.s.a.p.</p>

            <p>Hi Praween,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem might be caused due to driver compatibility </p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically there are no drivers available for Windows 10 Technical Preview, as this is a test version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer website and download the drivers for Windows 8/8.1 and then install the drivers using compatibility and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about installing programs using compatibility refer to the below link:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also will the WM VPN client work with an ISA VPN?</p>

            Windows Mobile Supports PPTP and L2TP/IPSec vpn, if you need IPSec vpn you will need to use a program like
<a href="http://www.bluefiresecurity.com/products/vpn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
bluefire security</a> .&nbsp; I've had success connecting to various PPTP servers except a few Watchguards.&nbsp; Also the Windows Mobile vpn client supports connecting to&nbsp;ISA with either PPTP or L2TP/IPSec.&nbsp; If you ahve ISA setup for straight IPSec you will need a 3rd
 party client like Bluefire.

    <title>Bug&#58; Sync direction &#38; resolving conflicts - extremely - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> croceamors  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug&#58; Sync direction &#38; resolving conflicts - extremely important</h2>
                    I had a complete nightmare syncing this night and I fond one very important solution every Sync needs.<br />
<br />
<strong>My problem<br />
</strong>I was trying to sync two phones using MyPhone and both phones are synced to Microsoft Outlook 2007 using Microsoft Vista Sync Center. A few days ago I mentioned that one phone doesn't Sync.&nbsp;<a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/MyPhone/thread/952c2f66-68fe-41ef-9b24-908329ec851c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/MyPhone/thread/952c2f66-68fe-41ef-9b24-908329ec851c</a><br />
After I completely solved this problem I've got lots of duplicates on MyPhone. I guess it's because one of the phone didn't sync for some time. These duplicates came to the second phone and from the second phone to Microsoft Outlook. After that I've got several
 sync conflicts on&nbsp;Microsoft Vista Sync Center and MyPhone. I tried several ways to solve them.&nbsp;I could describe them but it would take a lot of writing because I was&nbsp;resolving my conflicts&nbsp;for several hours.<br />
<br />
The main problem is that MyPhone nor&nbsp;Microsoft Vista Sync Center don't offer a Sync Direction and resolving conflicts as we saw on ActiveSync&nbsp;that we&nbsp;used on Windows XP. Having an option just to overwrite damaged source of data&nbsp;(the one that produced duplicates
 and conflicts)&nbsp;is very very important. <br />
<br />
<strong>Solution<br />
</strong>Both MyPhone and&nbsp;Microsoft Vista Sync Center should have an option to determine the sync direction.
<br />
<br />
MyPhone:<br />
- Phone overwrites MyPhone<br />
- MyPhone overwrites the phone<br />
- Sync both devices<br />
<br />
Microsoft Vista Sync Center<br />
- Phone overwrites PC<br />
-&nbsp;PC overwrites the phone<br />
- Sync both devices<br />
<br />
And there should be an additional feature which would show us a list of all of the conflicts that would happen and we sould have an option to solve each conflict separately specifying which item overrides.
<br />
<br />
I know at least&nbsp;Microsoft Vista Sync Center has a section View Sync Conflicts but I didn't see any conflict there. All I was seeing was an undetermined error under the View Sync Partnerships.<br />
<br />
I know that Microsoft tried to make everything automatic to make life easier&nbsp;for people who are not computer experts. I completelly understand this position because I have to help to some of our clients on a daily basis and I know you get all sorts of computer
 users. <strong>But&nbsp;conflicts will happen&nbsp;and currently we don't have a tool to resolve them.</strong>

            If you have duplicates on your phone, use DupedeDupe to remove them. It is a free tool that you can download from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.modaco.com/content/pocket-pc-software/267793/dupededupe-remove-duplicate-contacts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.modaco.com/content/pocket-pc-software/267793/dupededupe-remove-duplicate-contacts/</a>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>MyPhone has the ability to delete duplicates. But I've never used it for the simple reason that I've never had duplicates. But i assume it should let you delete duplicates for contacts and calendar.</div>

            Hi thank you.<br />
My experience is that&nbsp;MyPhone has the ability to delete duplicates but it doesn't find them all ;) So I have to delete them manually. Especially the contacts are the problem where it didn't find any.<br />
<br />
But&nbsp;when I solved the problem on my phone (backup) the phone was rewritten by the MyPhone at the first sync. This is why I suggested a feature that Phone would rewrite the MyPhone. It's not easy when you have between 300 and 400 contacts and you&nbsp;get duplicates,
 which means you suddenly&nbsp;have 582 contacts and you have to delete the rest&nbsp;;)

<p>This process should be exactly the same as the replication process for 2 databases in a network environment.<br />
<br />
When you make an update on the Web Portal then sync, this change updates the phone.</p>

<p>That should be the correct behaviour, and that's what I'm seeing. </p>

            All you have to do is plug in the charger and leave it. The phone will stop charging when the battery is full.<br />
<br />
It cannot be overcharged and does not need leaving overnight.<br />
<br />
It should take between 1-3 hours.<br />
<br />
For the first week or two of use try to let the battery run really low before charging it again. This helps it perform at it's best but won't make too much of a difference.

            <p>Actually I've been blaming Verizon&nbsp;because I just started having this problem and Verizon has updated a page of theirs so I assumed it was a Verizon problem. However I just discovered from reading an old Microsoft message on this Microsoft forum
 that the problem is solved by unchecking Use Microsoft compatibility lists. The only reason I can think this just started happening is because&nbsp;last weekend I got the new Windows 10 Anniversary Update as&nbsp;I never made any changes in the Compatibility View Settings.</p>

<h2>            How does 920 expose photos&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>After two weeks I'm still somewhat befuddled by this phone's auto exposure mechanisms. &nbsp;Does anyone know what type of metering the camera performs?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to master it but it's kind of hard to figure out. &nbsp;Today I tried to take a shot that look exposed on the live view then it went dark every shot. &nbsp;I tried changing the focal point to a dark region thinking that would cause it to use a longer exposure
 but got the same results. &nbsp;I finally had to completley recomose the frame to only the shadow regions and then it overexosed to way more than what was natural lighting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like the exposure is totally random. &nbsp;But I think it's doing a full frame average.</p>

            yeah currently the automatic settings of white level and exposure value not seem to be working well according to external conditions so hopefully future software update would resolve it until then you can play with manual settings to get best out of very
 capable lumia 920 camera.

<p>Thanks, I do just that but I find it cumbersome to make changes in the settings screen. &nbsp;This is a Windows Phone 8 thing and not Nokia but I wish camera settings could be toggled without having to go to the settings menu. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A quick slide out and release setting, like how the keyboard works would be amazing!</p>

            <p>Hi DavidBeever,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please ensure that the credit card is added to the primary Windows Live account (Microsoft Account)&nbsp;on your phone. The primary Windows Live ID on your phone is used for downloading apps and for billing purposes. To check what the primary Live ID is go to
 Settings &gt; Emails + accounts, it is the first 'Windows Live' account listed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using this account, sign in to <a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://commerce.microsoft.com</a> and select 'Payment options' and then click 'add payment option' in the lower corner of the page. Then please add your credit card information and try purchasing your app again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Sheena M.</p>

    <title>receiving this error message&#58; &#34;Could not load some objects - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baba ghanoush  say:</h3>
<h2>            receiving this error message&#58; &#34;Could not load some objects because they are not available on this machine.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>The following pertains to Excel 2010 (Office 2010 SP 1 is installed and Windows is fully up to date). Running Windows 7, 32bit.</p>
<p>When opening Excel, the following error from Microsoft Forms appears: "Could not load some objects because they are not available on this machine." Originally i thought this error was caused exclusively by two third party add-ons (Dfss Master and SPC XL
 by SigmaZone). However the same issue occurs when i enable the Solver add-on or the Euro Currency Tools add-on, both of course are native to Excel. If i disable all those add-ons i mentioned, Excel starts up without any errors, however i need these add-ins
 to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a list of things i've tried so far to resolve this:</p>
<p>-Office repair</p>
<p>-Uninstall Office and did a fresh install (Office 2010 is the only version installed). I also reinstalled Office 2010 SP1.</p>
<p>-Went through add/rem features of Office 2010,&nbsp;on the drop down arrow which is before the Microsoft Office and clicked on Run all from my computer, then rebooted.</p>
<p>-Cleared the MS Office cache files at&nbsp;C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Forms" and "C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Forms"</p>
<p>-Renamed the Excel toolbar file in case its corrupted</p>
<p>-Cleared the XLStart folders:<br />
C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART<br />
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\XLStart</p>
<p>-Pressed Alt + F11 to go into the Visual Basic Editor. Went to Tools &gt; References and made sure none of the available references listed said "missing"<br />
-Went through all the settings in Excel's Trust Center and opened up all the security settings so nothing was disabled or blocked</p>
<p>-made sure&nbsp;Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable is installed.</p>


<p>If anyone has any other ideas please let me know. I really appreciate anyone who can share any insight on this!</p>

            I believe you are not quite clear on some of the terms you are asking about. Not surprising, MS didn't bother defining them.<br />
<br />
"Office 365" is a marketing name for many bundles of programs.&nbsp; It identifies the versions of Office that use "Click to Run" as their base instalaltion technique.<br />
<br />
Programs in Office 365 default to saving to Skydrive, but they can be directed to save by default to the local HD. Office 365
<br />
<br />
Most of the Office 365 bundles include components that are installed on your computer inside of the "Click To Run" virtual computer. These installations require periodic, monthly, to the internet to verify your rental subscription status.&nbsp; One of the "features"
 of the CTR/365 installation is that you do not have to worry about applying "Windows Updates". MS "automagically" does that for you, in the background without any notice to you.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of Office 365 bundles that depend exclusively on the "Office Web Apps" without the local computer component at all.&nbsp; The Web Apps are "crippleware" versions of the full applications.
<br />

Here is some more detailed information about Click to run<br />

<p>Being able to install and use Office on up to 5 PCs at the same time is one benefit of your organization having an Office 365 subscription with
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg702619.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Office 365 ProPlus</span></a>. For example, a user could have Office installed on the following computers:</p>
<ul>
<li>a desktop computer in her office</li><li>a laptop that she uses when traveling</li><li>a home computer</li></ul>
<p>Even though Office is installed on three different computers, only one Office 365 license is used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do you manage to keep track of all these installations?&nbsp; What happens if the user already has Office installed on 5 computers, but needs to install Office on another computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog post will cover both the user experience of managing Office 365 ProPlus installations and what aspects the Office 365 administrator can control. Why are we focusing on the user experience in a blog for IT Pros?&nbsp; As you will see, the Office 365
 user, not the administrator, actually plays the central role in managing Office 365 ProPlus installations. But administrators will need to be prepared to answer questions from users about such things as activation and deactivation, because these will be new
 and unfamiliar concepts for most users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we go through the user experience in this blog post, we will provide some administrator-specific information. And the blog post finishes up with additional information for the administrator to consider for managing Office 365 ProPlus installations.</p>

 the end of this video it says after the admin sets up the Office 365 access, other user accounts on the computer can access the skydrive space. I (Rohn007) have not tested this myself.</p>
<p>The end of this video says you all share access to the 20GB of additional skydrive space. That implies they probably have access to the Skype time too.</p>

<p><span>The "base" applications are the same. Office 365 is the next attempt of MS to MAKE MORE MONEY! Or at least to create a steady flow of "rental" income rather than the bursts of new version "purchase" income (of course if
 you read the terms of the license we are not actually "purchasing" our local copies of Office, we are just licensing it and MS can revoke that license any time they feel like it).</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, depending on the Office 365 package you get, the monthly rent will sooner or later end up costing more than a purchase.&nbsp; But, if you look at the packages you'll see that they include more features than the "base" local
 install includes. Things like "free" (well part of the 365 bundle) Skydrive storage. But also things like SharePoint functionality without having to set up your own server installation. server,
<b>Office-on-Demand</b>: This option provides a single Office application on demand to users when they need it.&nbsp; The Office application is streamed to the PC but is not permanently installed. Office 365 Home Premium allows you to "install" on up to
 5 home computers. And a bunch of other "stuff".&nbsp; Another advantage of the Office 365 bundle is that you won't have to buy "Office 16", it will appear "automatically" as part of your "rental" deal.</span></p>

<p><span>So the question becomes, how safe do you feel running your business in the "cloud", and storing your personal, confidential, proprietary data files in MS "cloud" storage. The paranoid "security freaks" out there will ask
 uncomfortable questions like:</span></p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span>Do you trust MS not to "peek"?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span>Do you trust your or foreign governments to not "subpoena" your data (maybe without even bothering to tell you a la "patriot act" and it's various lovely cousins)</p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span>Do you trust MS not to "leak", or be hacked? MANY other big companies have, what makes MS invulnerable?</p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span>Are you positive that the connection between your computer and the "cloud" is unhackable?</p>
<p>and other similar "nasty" questions that MS doesn't want you to think about.&nbsp;</p>

<i><span>How might Microsoft increase the cost of Office 365?</span></i></p>
<p>by <a href="http://office-watch.com/zd.aspx?9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Office Watch
</span></a></p>
<p>The often quoted price for an Office 2013/365 subscription is only for the first year, so how might Microsoft increase the price?</p>
<p>There’s all sorts of opportunities for Microsoft to raise revenue from Office subscribers once they’ve put themselves on the annual fee track rather than one time payments for Office software. Microsoft has all sorts of marketing
 models that they keep to themselves and management haven’t decided on what exact pricing strategy they’ll use. Outsiders can only examine the past and gaze into the future.</p>
<p>Office 365 Home Premium is currently sold at around US$100 per year but should really be labelled as ‘$100 for the first year’ because there’s no price guarantee. ‘Home Premium’ has all the major and minor Office apps including
 Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Access and Publisher (not all available for the Mac).</p>
<p>It’s possible that Microsoft will just increase the price but they’re usually more subtle. Part of the promotion of Office is to have some low ‘headline’ price that Microsoft can push to the media. It’s a trick that’s worked
 in the past.</p>
<p>Use of the word ‘Premium’ might be a clue to future Office 365 price increases. The price of ‘Home Premium’ edition could rise while a new ‘Home Basic’ option is introduced with less programs but at around the current $100 ‘headline’
 price. </p>
<p>Existing subscribers would be automatically renewed at the new higher ‘Premium’ price unless they explicitly choose another subscription option before the renewal date. Automatic renewals at a higher price is just one benefit
 to Microsoft software subscriptions.</p>
<p>Microsoft hopes that people will use applications like Access and Publisher more than they are now and therefore want to pay for a subscription that includes them. However, Redmond won’t mind if people pay a higher price for
 a subscription they don’t entirely use. Customers might not understand what they are paying for or they just let the automatic renewal happen each year on terms that suit Microsoft.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is a low cost Office subscription that doesn’t include Outlook. Microsoft knows that Outlook is a key program for many people and in the past we’ve seen a price jump between a basic bundle of Office (Word,
 Excel, Powerpoint and Onenote) and a bundle that includes Outlook as well. Outlook is harder to migrate from compared to say, Word, so Microsoft can charge more for it.</p>
<p>That’s not the end of the possible price increase scenarios. Microsoft can offer extras to make comparisons between old and new pricing more difficult as well as try to keep customers using Microsoft services. The current Home
 Premium bundle includes some Skype calling minutes and Skydrive storage. Those benefits can be retained or changed for a revised Premium edition.
</p>
<p>There’s scope for Office 365 program subscriptions to be more closely bundled with some of the cloud services like Exchange Server (email, calendar, contacts, tasks) which not only raises revenue but also more tightly entwines
 a customer into Microsoft services.</p>
<p>That’s another part of the subscription strategy – entanglement. Offering a subscription and online service as part of Office software means each customer becomes more dependent on Microsoft. Moving away from Microsoft Office
 becomes that much harder.</p>
