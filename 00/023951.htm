<h2>            Microsoft Launcher glance calendar does not display linked MS Exchange calender events</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally (reluctantly, okay bitterly) made the switch from Windows Mobile to Android this week, using Microsoft Launcher, and have encountered a problem with the glance screen calendar. I have a problem with glance calendar not showing events from my work
 calendar. Here are the specifics:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The launcher glance calendar is linked to both my personal Outlook and work (MS Exchange) calendars, with both calendars toggled to active</li><li>Events from my personal Outlook calendar successfully display on the glance calendar, but those from my work Exchange calendar do not</li><li>New events that are created from with the glance calendar do successfully POST to BOTH calendars, but again only the one posted to my personal Outlook calendar then display</li><li>IT at work cannot find any problem and suggested I post to MS, especially since the problem appears to be entirely internal to MS services</li><li>Google Pixel 3a running Android 9.0</li><li>Rebooting the phone has not solved the issue</li><li>Wiping the MS Launcher data and trying again has not solved the issue</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas for help?</p>
<p>

<p>Exactly the same Situation here. It was working fine, but after a Launcher update it stopped showing my work calender (O365). My private calender is just working fine (Outlook.com)</p>
<p>

<p>Same here.&nbsp; We'll actually, I've managed to get only one work account and calendar to sync with Launcher.&nbsp; At any time I could be working with 3 or 4, but can only sync one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I applaud MS' efforts to make Android a second home for orphaned WinMo users like us, it unfortunately still feels like we're unwanted guests forced to stay at a halfway house made for robots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>WinMo, before services were deprecated, enabled me 100%.&nbsp; With Launcher, I feel like it's just a nuisance to try to get it to function like the UWP apps in WinMo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I really hope Surface Duo ends up having Win10x.&nbsp; I realize this isn't a post about the future of Microsoft and mobile, but problem cases like this show just how hard it is to make MS usability we've come to appreciate and expect, native in a world

<p>
</p><p>YES. I'm right there with you on the Duo. Switching from W10 Mobile to Android felt (and continues to feel) like going from a Ferrari to a dump truck. I put a lot of hope in the rumored Andromeda to come out as a pocket computer with telephony and maybe
 the ability to run Android apps on the side, but then seeing the unveil as an Android device through and through pretty much killed my enthusiasm for it. Well, we'll see what direction this all takes over the next year. It seems like it should be possible
 to run 10X on it, at least... (Hey, if hackers can even get full Windows 10 to run on the old mobile devices...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the loss of Windows Mobile to Android I guess I finally understand how the Betamax people felt.</p>

            Same problem. Still doesn't work. But here is temporary solution: we can use calendar widget in the timeline (that thing appearing or left swype). Replace the stock calendar with the widget and.. so, it's pretty nice)

    <title>How can I delete the page numbers on a publisher catalog merge I have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carol balbiani  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I delete the page numbers on a publisher catalog merge I have already saved</h2>
                    I have a&nbsp; 2013 Publisher document created through catalog merge. Not the template, but the finished product ready for print. I put in page numbers and do not want them there anymore. You cannot manipulate page numbers in Publisher like you can in Word
 so the cover of the document is handled as page 1 and the actual content starts on page 2. Even if I add blank pages at the beginning of the document it still starts the count at page&nbsp;2 for the content. The document is in booklet form. This is rather strange
 for page numbering because I have not seen a document start the cover page as the first page. Maybe I can get around this if I can create different sections in catalog merge and start new numbering for each section, but I haven't been able to find anything
 that does that either. What I am creating is a booklet with an embedded&nbsp;roster (roster-directory can only be done in Publisher under catalog merge) and I would like to number the roster pages starting with page 1. Agai

            <p>I don't have Pub 2013 on this machine but believe that it is the same as in Pub 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you already have page numbers inserted into the publication with Page 1 not showing, go to View &gt; Page Navigation if you do not already have the Page Navigation pane visible on the left side of the page. Select the second page in that pane &gt; right click
 &gt; insert section &gt; before left page assuming that you are looking at a two page spread. Now right click the second page again &gt; Page number &gt; format page number &gt; start this section with 1. You may also have to right click yet again and check to show page
 number on the first page. Now your numbering will start with 'page one' on the second page of your booklet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the future before you insert page numbers always go to the page nav pane, and insert a section before the page you want to show as the first page. Then insert the page number by again right clicking the page where you want the numbers to start.</p>

<h2>            Can I buy Office 2010 second hand&#63;</h2>
                    As above. A friend has switched to Mac and does not need his Windows version of Office 2010 Home &amp; Business. He has the full package (COA, product key, DVD and receipt from Comet). Can I buy it from him and install it on my PC? Are there any potential
 pitfalls such as "activated too many times". AFAIK he has installed it just the once on his machine, although I'll have to check that. Is there a limit on the number of activations? Surely not as people may have to reinstall their system multiple times?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you!&nbsp;</div>

            <p>It is the latter, to ensure that the person selling the product does not continue to use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike for example&nbsp;de-authorizing a computer with iTunes on it before uninstalling iTunes, therefore&nbsp;notifying Apple's servers that said computer is no longer allowed to access the iTunes store with a certain account, Microsoft's product activation logic
 does not use a "deactivation" methodology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the logic used is that of supercession, in that the newest activations will (in a manner of speaking) overwrite, bump off, or supercede previous activations. That's where telephonic activation comes in, if necessary, a special step that denotes
 that the activation servers are being put on notice that "old" activations of a given product key are no longer current.</p>

            <p>Traditional retail packaged discs are retail (aka "FPP" full packaged product, as noted on the CoA) licenses.&nbsp; These can be moved from computer to computer as necessary (para 19 of the retail software&nbsp;licensing terms [SLT]).&nbsp; These can also be transfered
 from owner to owner, as you and your friend would like to do (para&nbsp;20 of the SLT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-software-license-terms-for-microsoft-office-2010-HA101817777.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-software-license-terms-for-microsoft-office-2010-HA101817777.aspx</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SLTs allow you to have the product concurrently activated on your "main" computer and your "portable" computer (para 2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the license has been activated before, your friend should uninstall it from his computer before he sells it to you.&nbsp; When you install and go to activate, there is a slight chance that you may run into the "activated too many times" error message.&nbsp;
 If so, rerun activation and this time choose the option to do a telephonic activation, and follow the prompts.</p>

<h2>            Error Code&#58; 0xc0000605</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows Insider preview&nbsp;on my&nbsp;formerly Windows 8 HP Pavilion 11 x360&nbsp;and had no major problems until a message popped up letting me know the build I was currently on was going to expire. I didn't think much of it until I realized for some reason
 I couldn't update it to another build or go back&nbsp;to an older&nbsp;build. Now that its expired whenever you try to start the computer a blue&nbsp;screen that reads:</p>
<p>Recovery</p>
<p>Your PC/Device needs to be repaired</p>
<p>A component of the operating system has expired</p>
<p>File:\WINDOWS\system32\winload.efi</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000605</p>
<p>You'll need to use recovery tools. If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your PC administrator or PC/Device manufacturer.</p>
<p>Press Enter to try again </p>
<p>Press F8 for Startup Settings</p>
<p>Press Esc for UEFI Firmware Settings </p>
<p>opens instead of the normal startup screen. I have tried booting from a USB but it doesn't work for some reason. Would be great if someone could explain to me what to do simply, because beyond a basic understanding of them I am not very well versed with
 computers. </p>

            <p>serial key to windows on a new pc does not exist in the physical world. it is a digital key. loosing it means you have lost the right to use the product. i lost my key by making a clean install with a tech preview of win10 , thinking id only loose my own
 created info, and not the key and rights to my operating system. this loop happens to me also.</p>

<h2>            Reinstallation fails&#58; &#34;Couldn&#39;t Install&#34;, unable to download a required file</h2>
                    <p>I tried to do an online repair of my Office 365 University installation, and it failed partway through with a message that it was unable to download a required file. Now Office has disappeared completely from my computer, and I'm unable to reinstall it.
 When I try to run the click to install setup file (Setup.X86.en-US_O365HomePremRetail_BLAHBLAHBLAH.exe), I get an error dialog box:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Couldn't Install</p>
<p>We're sorry, we can't continue because we weren't able to download a required file. Please make sure you're connected to the internet or connect to a different network, then try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, instead of this message, it's one that says that Office can't be installed because of a pre-release or Beta version (but I have never used such a version on this computer).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the FixIt to remove the Office installation (KB 2739501), plus the manual instructions from that page. There are no Office programs that I can see installed on the machine, but I'm still unable to install Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a Surface Pro with WIndows 8 64-bit.</p>

            KD, are you trying to open the 'new' Facebook app created by Facebook? The previous version was made by Microsoft. The new one crashes every time for me. I think it is because system requirements for the app call for 2 GB of RAM. My phone, a Lumia 650,
 only has 1 GB of RAM. I think that is why the new app keeps crashing. Check to see how much RAM your 630 has. I am currently using the mobile Facebook website in Edge and it seems to work well. Good luck!

            Hi Dana
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />
<br />I'm Maggie, an Independent Advisor from the user community. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />If you can access Outlook.com that is good news, it means all is good with your account and  what needs fixing is your Outlook installation.
<br />
<br />I would recommend to:
<br />- repair Outlook : <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />- if this does not work, repair your Outlook profile : <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-your-outlook-email-connection-by-repairing-your-profile-4d5febf6-7623-486b-9a9f-d5cfc4264af3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-yo...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)! 
<br />Maggie

<p>I've fixed this on my computer.&nbsp;<br />
Control Panel&gt;Mail&gt;Profiles&gt;Delete Profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background: on 7/11 Outlook stopped working with the exact errors above. I didn't find any reason why. I installed Windows 2 weeks prior. After extensive troubleshooting. Things I did included: Programs/Features-Repair; Account management in Office 365 and
 MS profile. I looked at ClickToRun.exe and all of the MS exes that load, skype, onenote, EdgeCP.exe... Nothing glaring found in the Registry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ProcMon samples showed files not found, occasionally locked files:&nbsp;</p>
<p>CreateFileMapping<span> </span>C:\Windows\System32\secur32.dll<span>
</span>FILE LOCKED WITH ONLY READERS<br />

<div>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, a median+ look into the cause wasn't successful. The solution was found in</p>
<p>Deleting the Profile through the Control Panel/Mail.</p>

<p>Your "Email Profile" has been corrupted.&nbsp; I just finished working with Office support last month to track down and fix the problem, while at the same time getting educated about what was broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Email Profiles" are now managed under Windows 10 (not sure about 8 or 7) because Windows also wants to use them.&nbsp; An email profile is the collection of email account settings you've created.&nbsp; Most people only have a single email profile which contains any
 multiple of email accounts settings they have. There is usually no need for most people to have any secondary email profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You get to the email profiles by:&nbsp;<span>Control Panel&gt;Mail&gt;Profiles. Getting to "Control Panel" is becoming increasingly tricky with each new Win10 version as Microsoft tries to replace Control Panel's more "administration" style user interfaces with more
 the more "user friendly" "settings" being offered by Win10.&nbsp; I usually get to "Control Panel" these days by typing "Control Panel" into Cortana (aka the search option on the toolbar).</span></p>
<p><br />
If you don't have a backup profile you can easily restore (most people don't), you'll have to try the various "repair" options people refer to. They appear to work for some people and not for a lot of people. If they don't work, you'll have to delete your profile
 and start creating a new one with all your email account information.&nbsp; Often the Control Panel settings will still be able to show you the corrupted profile's settings, so make sure to write down all those settings before deleting the old profile and creating
 a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have Outlook back to running and appearing to be correct, go back to Control Panel and have it make copies of your working profile.&nbsp; So typically your "in use" profile will be named "Outlook". I then copy that to profiles named (for example) "Outlook
 20190714A" and "Outlook 20190714B".&nbsp; The "20190714" being the date I made the copy.&nbsp; If you later make changes to your email accounts (adding one, etc), you should go back to Control Panel and make new copies of your profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note there is also a drop-down selection box which says which profile the system (and Outlook ) should default to.&nbsp; Be sure to pay attention to that.&nbsp; Make sure it remains set to your primarily profile (probably "Outlook") and it doesn't change to one of
 the backups you make.&nbsp; When you do things like delete profiles, etc, Control Panel may change that setting trying to be "helpful".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the future if the problem happens again, all you have to do is delete your in-use profile (probably "Outlook") then copy one of your latest backups to your normal in-use profile name. Try to stay with using the same "in-use" profile name since some things
 like the naming of local files containing copies of your emails can be influenced by what the profile name is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh... and it's best to have Outlook (and any other email accessing apps) closed when you're doing this stuff.</p>

            Thanks! It definitely is the quickest work around, though it would be nice to determine WHY this is happening!<br />
<br />
The profile has been corrupted 4 times in the last month and a half! Thank goodness all of the info is available on outlook.com as well and nothing has been lost!

<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've found is my profile is being corrupted when I do a Windows Update.&nbsp; However since not everyone is screaming about this, clearly there is something "unusual" about my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent an Outlook Feedback telling Microsoft that's what's happening.&nbsp; I suggest you pay attention and see if perhaps the corruption occurs in correlation with something -- like a Windows and/or Office update being applied.&nbsp; If you can find a correlation,
 then you can use Outlook Feedback to send Microsoft the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being a developer myself, I can attest to how much more useful it is if a person provides more information than just "it's broken".&nbsp; The deal is that the overwhelming majority of people are not having the problem, so what the developers need is hints about
 anything that might be making your system different than other people's systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I told Microsoft in the Feedback is, at about the same time this started happening, I had changed my Microsoft account password via the Microsoft web site rather than using Windows.&nbsp; The result was Windows was finding out "the hard way" that
 my password had changed and was asking me for the new password.&nbsp; Also various components associated with Windows were having to ask me for the new password.&nbsp; Likewise Outlook needed to ask me for the new passwords for my email accounts only after discovering
 the old passwords weren't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's reasonable to guess perhaps in all of this there is something the Microsoft developers didn't anticipate happening and "may" be causing the corruption. The main point being, I can see where what I did might be "different" from other users and might
 be enough of a hint to the Microsoft developers for them to realize what might be going wrong on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if they get similar reports from other users saying their profiles are being corrupted as a result of Windows and/of Office updates, that tells them to look more closely at how updates are interacting with the profiles.</p>

            We are having the same issue with the majority of our computers that have Outlook 2016 installed on a Windows 10 Operating System. We tried removing the old Profile and creating a new one but it eventually gets corrupted again. The only solution that sticks
 is we uninstall Office 2016 and install 2019. Then, when we create a new profile, the error doesn't happen anymore. We have many machines with multiple configurations and it only happens to computers with Outlook 2016 on Windows 10. Nothing else. And it all
 started happening approximately July 9th (with at least 5-7 users reporting the issue and at least another 10+ users experiencing that issue after that).

                    <p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need your expertise regarding the below formulas, I tried changing the ISNUMBER(SEARCH into MATCH but no luck for correct result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Formula in Cell B1, B2 and B3 </p>
<p>=IF($B1="","",SUMPRODUCT(SUBTOTAL(3,OFFSET($A$10,ROW($A$10:$A$70000)-ROW($A$10),))*((ISNUMBER(SEARCH($B1,$A$10:$A$70000))*($J$10:$J$70000&gt;=$O$2)*($J$10:$J$70000&lt;=$O$3)))))</p>
<br />
<p>Is there any way that cell $B1, $B2 and $B3 should search ONLY for exact match and not partial match correspond to information provided in Cell B1, B2 and B3 see below? i.e information in column $A$10:$A$70000 as follows:<br />
</p>
<p>BUS-CB10B1-ANA-SDW-PL-00026</p>
<p>BUS-CB10B1-ANA-SDW-DWG-PL-00026</p>
<p>BUS-CB10B1-ANA-DWG-PL-00026</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cell B1 = SDW (should count 1 instead of 2)</p>
<p>Cell B2 = SDW-D (should count 1 instead of 2)</p>
<p>Cell B3 = ANA-DWG (should count 1 instead of 2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the above formula in Cell B1, B2, and B3 I'm getting a total count of 2 instead of 1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information will be very much appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Hello guys, OK I will start from the beginning I've had the named account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) as you can see its from the year 2004 until now 2014, that's almost 10 years, I have tried tirelessly to recover it using the online recovery options
 from Microsoft, this include the secret security question to alternate email (my alternate email i don't have access to anymore since i rarely used it so i don't know the password to as well), I also used the online form using all the recent information I
 remembered, but the automated system just sends me an email to my current email address that the details I entered were incorrect.</p>
<p>Now this account is linked to my Facebook account to which I lost my password and I can't reset it because I would need access to my email (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***), further more IF they need proof of identity such as my passport to confirm my name
 and date of birth or whatever I would be happy to provide those documents or any other documents they need so long as I get back access to my email which I desperately need.</p>

<h2>            Laptop wakes immediately after sleep after failed attempt to hibernate from sleep.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop (Dell XPS 15 9550) with Windows 10 64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My power plan is configured to hibernate in 60 minutes after sleep (both on battery and plugged in).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the following issue:</p>
<p>- while plugged in, I close the lid and the laptop goes to sleep</p>
<p>- I remove all devices and unplug it</p>
<p>- after 60 minutes the computer tries to hibernate from sleep</p>
<p>- after hibernating the computer instantly wakes up</p>
<p>- after waking up the laptop will no longer be able to sleep. It wakes up instantly every time after I put it to sleep (by pressing a button or closing the lid), and it keeps happening, even after rebooting the laptop</p>
<p>- after a force shutdown, the sleep is again possible</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no waking up devices nor scheduled tasks (although there's a system time synchronization with the hardware clock that runs when the laptop wakes up to hibernate - Wake Source: S4 Doze to Hibernate), and the wake on lan is also disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened twice, two days in a row. After the issue starts, the wake source is always unknown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any idea why it happens and what should I try to fix it. I already updated my BIOS firmware and have the latest Windows 10 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also posted a similar topic in Dell support section, and will update here if I get any answer from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your answer. However, I'm at a dead end right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The step 1 does not help my case, because the problem starts after a failed attempt to hibernate from sleep, and safe mode does not have the option to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The step 2 was a great idea. However, I've tried many combinations with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>It <em>seems</em>&nbsp;that the first time the system tries to hibernate from sleep it succeeds always, despite any services or application running. However, after resuming and going through the process again (sleep and then hibernation), the bug occurs
 and the system starts to misbehave, waking instantly after all sleeps and shutdowns.</del> (edit: not accurate)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This could be an issue with the corrupt power plan settings. This issue might also occur due to outdated display driver or some other devices are responsible to keep it awake.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the below mentioned methods and see if it works for you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to run <strong>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If issue persists I would suggest you to
<strong><span>Reset and restore the power plans to default.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>

            <p>Hello, and once again thank you for answering me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Method 1 I didn't have an&nbsp;<strong><span>Improve power usage</span></strong>
<span>option</span><span>, only&nbsp;<strong>Power</strong>. I ran it, and it showed no problems.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For Method 2 I ran&nbsp;</span><strong><span>powercfg restoredefaultschemes</span></strong><span>, and the only thing I changed was the hibernate time to 1 minute (so that I could test it, but the problem still happens with 60 minutes, which was my original
 value). I had no luck with that either, as the bug still persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, I've learned some details about the issue while testing your suggestions. I think I've pinpointed the cause of the bug.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some notes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>the&nbsp;<strong>expected behavior</strong>&nbsp;is: put laptop to&nbsp;sleep by pressing the power button &gt; wait 1 minute &gt; the laptop wakes to hibernate &gt; the laptop hibernates &gt; the laptop stays in hibernation until I boot it up again</li><li>the <strong>bug</strong> is: put laptop to sleep by pressing the power button&nbsp;&gt; wait 1 minute &gt; the laptop wakes to hibernate &gt; the laptop hibernates &gt; the laptop instantly wakes up afterwards</li><li>when the bug happens, the laptop is in a state where it&nbsp;<strong>wakes up instantly after every sleep, hibernate, and shutdown</strong> (even after restarting it)</li><li>to "fix" this state I have to prevent windows from booting up when the computer wakes. I usually shutdown the laptop, wait for it to wake automatically and hit the power button again, making it shutdown for real.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Steps to trigger the <strong>bug</strong> (default 'balanced' power plan with 1 minute to hibernate from sleep):</span></p>
<ol>
<li>the laptop is plugged to the charger, with only a usb mouse connected</li><li>put laptop to&nbsp;sleep by pressing the power button</li><li><strong>while asleep, unplug the power changer <em>and</em>&nbsp;disconnect the mouse</strong></li><li>at the scheduled time (after 1 minute) the laptop wakes up to hibernate, and a sound is played (due to the mouse being disconnected)</li><li>the laptop starts to hibernate</li><li>the laptop instantly wakes up and is now in the faulty wake up state</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I think step 3 is the real issue. I also did other tests that did <em>not</em> trigger the bug on
<strong>step 3</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>not unplugging the laptop from the charger, nor disconnecting the mouse  the bug does not occur</li><li>unplug the laptop from charger, but keep mouse connected  the bug does not occur</li><li>keep the laptop plugged to the charger, but disconnect the mouse&nbsp; the bug does not occur and a sound is not played in step 4.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm not sure on how you can help me, but I would love to see this fixed somehow. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

            <p>As of September 28, 2016, I also have the same issue, and do not see any updates from Microsoft. &nbsp;In the meantime, I just disabled the "hibernate" feature. &nbsp;I don't need a new upgrade like Anniversary Edition, but desperately need a seamlessly working OS.
 &nbsp;I hope MS proactively resolves this critical issue. &nbsp;</p>

            It might be an issue with XPS's&nbsp;BIOS (apparently other models also had the same problem). I also posted in Dell's support forum, but no one from Dell has replied.

            Ctrl,Alt, Delete at the same time takes you to Task Manager, when it opens click on Services in the upper list, when it opens click on Description and it gives you an alphabetical list starting with "A" click again the list starts with "X" look down about
 half way on the screen and you will find Windows Update, Read the Status,&nbsp; right click and it brings up a menu, click on Start or Restart.&nbsp; Go to the top and get out.&nbsp; If you started in Update it should take you back there.

            <p>This upgrade to 14257 here on my laptop behaved a&nbsp;little different from the norm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took time once the download finished before it moved install.esd from SoftwareDistribution&nbsp;into the Sources folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went and started cooking some spaghetti after waiting too long,&nbsp;&nbsp; then it showed up.&nbsp; So, quite a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I used the start button &amp; selected restart and install... and it rebooted into windows normally.</p>
<p>Tried the power user start button, right click&nbsp;Restart and Install... again it rebooted into windows so I went to the settings page for windows updates and pushed the Restart now button thats&nbsp;below the scheduled task showing there .. and then it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dism error that it cant repair&nbsp;on one file same as last version and it says it cant find the needed files</p>

<p>Re-installed PC Suite and latest NSU but they were of no help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, I'm happy to report that updating in WindowsXP was a success, even though the installation encountered a problem and supposedly failed.</p>
<p>The phone works and says it has the latest update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Vista-users who are having problems, please try to find a PC with XP on it and be patient while the update is in progress, despite the errors. Worked for me!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Raghu,<br />
<br />
After we adding a user to a group, he can upload, sync, open, delete or create new files in the group. It's not feasible to change the permission for the users in the group. To learn more, see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-documents-or-folders-in-Office-365-1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share documents or folders in Office 365</a>. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
About "add authorized users", do you mean you want to add users to the group or you want to manage who can access the group files? If you want to manage the access, you can refer to the<strong> Controlling the sharing of files</strong> section in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-group-files-749bc73b-90c9-4760-9b6f-9aa1cf01b403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<strong>Note</strong>: You should be the team site administrator.<br />
<br />
If anything is misunderstood, please post back with more details about "add authorized users" at your convenience.<br />

</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you are having difficulties with emails being tagged as unsafe. Let me assist you.</p>

<p>Gmail is already a trusted domain so that is the reason why you are receiving the error message. However, you may still need to add the specific email address you have mentioned to your Safe Senders List, instead of the domain. &nbsp;Instructions are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to Add to Safe Senders List</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Log on to Outlook.com using your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>2. Click on the <strong>Gear icon</strong> located at the upper right part of the inbox page and choose
<strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Under <em>Pre</em><em>venting junk mail</em>, click on <strong>Safe and blocked
</strong><strong>senders</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Click on <strong>Safe senders</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Type in the email address on the text box.</p>
<p>6. Click on <strong>Add to list</strong>.</p>

            <p>Hi mmmjv,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear the issue still persists. I suggest you add the sender to your contacts then check if the next email from them would still have the warning. If it still does, you may need to contact the domain admin of the sender to add their&nbsp;<strong>SPF
 record</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;in their domain registrar which is the reason why their emails would fail fraud detection tests.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let us know if you have any questions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks,</span></p>

            I sent a message to chessworld.net five days ago and have not received a reply. The real question is why should I have to contact them at all. This should be a very simple fix and I shouldn't have to get involved with any SPF, whatever the **** that is, or domain register, which I also have no idea what that is and I shouldn't have to know. Nor should I have to add them to my contact lists. Something as simple as this should have a simple solution. 



How do I turn off fraud protection?

    <title>Changing the default folder view in File Open dialog to be - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> albert m gostick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing the default folder view in File Open dialog to be &#34;Details&#34; instead of &#34;WebView&#34;.</h2>
                    
<p>Customer of mine is now having their staff store documents on a web server.&nbsp; When they navigate to the folder structure from within Word/Excel, the default view is "WebView".&nbsp; Problem is, WebView is not ordered (folders appear to be random - probably the
 order they were created) and the users cannot start typing the folder name as they have been used to (each "main folder" often contains 100's to the low thousands of folders which are named according the the client lastname + firstname + fileno.&nbsp; In their
 old application, from within Word, they could start typing the lastname and they would get close enough to then pick it.</p>
<p>Is there a way (e.g. registry setting or something) to change which view is the default view under File Open when navigating to a web space?&nbsp; Note that they can change the view from WebView to Details but as soon as they go there the next time, it is back
 to WebView.&nbsp; They do this hundreds of times a day so they will not want to keep changing it.</p>
<p>Note that if I navigate to the main folder via Windows Explorer, the folders show up correctly sorted and users can type to find the folder.&nbsp; This shortcut was automatically created after the first time I navigated to the main folder from within Word by
 typing in the full url.&nbsp; A shortcut was automatically created under "My Network Places" that users can navigate to.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Albert Gostick</p>

<p>To specify the global settings that apply to all folders, follow these steps to restore the default windows folder settings:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click Start, click Control Panel, and then double-click Folder Options.</span></li><li><span>On the View tab, click 'Reset All Folders'</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on Apply and then OK.</span></li></ol>
<p>Note This procedure resets all the folder settings to the settings that were in effect when Windows was installed.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>That works for folders when viewed through Explorer but not from within Word or Excel - I am talking about the view that you see when you are in Word and you click File, Open and then I navigate to an internal web site (not IIS) and the view says it is a
 "WebView".&nbsp; The folders are unordered.&nbsp; I have to switch (every time) to "Details" view to have them ordered.</p>
<p>I connected to this document server (http based) by Opening Word, choosing File, Open and then typing&nbsp;the http path into File Name field (e.g.<a href="http://mcnux/nuxeo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mcnux/nuxeo</a>) (this is the name of the server (mcnux) and the service on
 that server (Nuxeo)).&nbsp; It then asked me to authenticate to that server and once I had done so, it creates a link&nbsp;under "My Network Places" that can then be browsed to from within Word and Excel from that point onward.&nbsp; The only problem is that the default
 display of the folders from that site are not ordered in any way - impossible to find something with 500 folders in it.&nbsp; So I need a way of telling Word to always sort the results or to always&nbsp;display the "Details" view of the folders as that is sorted.</p>

            Why won't someone from Microsoft answer this?!?! Is this a new feature in 2007??? 5 people have clicked they'd like a response and still no answer. The one and only answer applied to internet explorer, not when opening files in Excel or Work.

<p>Since you said you don't know your versions of Office and Windows, it's hard to suggest something.</p>
<p>If you have Windows 7, it comes with a program called the Snipping Tool that you can use to copy any part of the screen to the clipboard.</p>
<p>If you have Office 2010, there's a similar tool in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint: on the Insert tab of the ribbon, click the Screenshot button and then click Screen Clipping at the bottom of the dropdown.</p>
<p>If you don't have either Windows 7 or Office 2010, you can use your favorite search engine to search the Internet for screen clipping software to download. The best start might be to ask your friend at work to explain exactly what you were shown before.</p>

            The pictures that are assigned to contacts in Outlook on your computer will never sync to your phone.&nbsp; Instead you'll need to sync your contacts pictures separately via the Zune software or you could upload them to SkyDrive and download them to your phone
 from SkyDrive (this is what I did).&nbsp; Once the pictures are on your phone, you'll need to manually edit each contact to add the picture to the contact.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Once you've reassigned the pictures to your contacts on the phone, when you sync the phone to your Windows Live account, the pictures will be synced to Windows Live with the contact.&nbsp; You won't see the picture on the Windows Live website, but the pictures are
 there and if you ever get another windows phone or have to perform a factory reset of your windows phone, the pictures will be synced to the new phone or a newly formatted phone.<br />
