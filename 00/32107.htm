<h2>            Windows 10 drivers for HP m7599d</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>My HP m7599d (desktop PC) was upgraded from Win 8 Pro to Win 10 recently.</p>

<p>work.</p>
<p>Found the following drivers were not installed on PC and left stranded not working</p>
<p>(1) Display driver ASUS GT730-4DGS was not installed.</p>
<p>(2) VIA 1394 compliant controller driver not installed</p>
<p>(3) Intel PRO 100/ VE driver not available</p>
<p>(4) HP 802.1.1 bg wireless driver from Qualcomm Atheros not available.</p>
<p>(5) PCI bridge insufficient resource with ! mark</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any kind person there can help me. Hopefully HP and Microsoft will be in </p>

            <p>Dear Mr Deepak, Since then have not heard from you.</p>
<p>I do need the urgent help as my PC is being upgraded by Microsoft and left </p>
<p>stranded not working. No drivers for VIA 1394, no network drivers were also </p>
<p>not available. Then why upgrade my PC and left it not working, when all your </p>
<p>performance test shows that it is able to be upgraded to Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pls&nbsp;see &nbsp;screen shot of PC device manager for details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My best regards and sincere appreciation.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would like to know how to manually add programs to the left side of the start menu in Windows 10. Unfortunately, my preliminary search for answers has led to nothing but ignored posts, unsatisfactory replies and the conclusion that placing the programs
 you actually <em>want </em>in the start menu is impossible. I really hope I'm just missing something, because the lack of this feature greatly disrupts workflow and overall smoothness in using the OS.
</p>
<p>Now, incredible as it may sound, judging from responses, it seems that people manage to somehow
<em>still </em>completely miss the point, and as such I will give some pointers as to what your answer should NOT be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DO NOT: tell me to use the 'Pin to Start' option. This creates a TILE on the RIGHT side of the start menu, which has absolutely nothing to do with my question. Tiles are obnoxious and an incredibly inefficient use of space.</p>
<p>DO NOT: tell me to turn on the 'Show most/recently used apps' option and run the relevant programs a lot. Considering this to be an actual solution would be laughable.</p>
<p>DO NOT: rebuff my question by telling me to leave feedback regarding this issue using the Windows feedback app. Many people have already done this, so me doing it would simply be a droplet in an ocean. And obviously, the ocean has changed nothing as of yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An answer that contains any of the points mentioned above is unsatisfactory. If this feature actually
<em>is </em>not available, I can't imagine it being hard to release an update that adds this simple, basic feat of customization. As such, my follow-up question is not
<em>if</em>, but <em>when </em>an update will come out that addresses this issue. A simple drag and drop function, and a 'pin to start menu' entry in the right click context menu of shortcuts and executable files has been available since Windows XP, and I would
 find it simply mind boggling that the notion to leave it out in this version was accepted. Anyway, when implementing the latter feature, there should obviously be a 'Pin as Tile' option as well, for those who would like their shortcuts in the tile part of
 the start menu. Many thanks in advance to anyone who is able to help me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. There are programs that take advantage of jump lists. Allow these programs to use this feature when addressing the issue, as it is very useful.
</p>

            You are correct in your assumption: you cannot pin items to the left side.&nbsp; It only shows "recent" (at the top) and destination folders (white icons) at the bottom.

            I don't, sorry.&nbsp; Since they're publically traded company, they keep most announcements and forward statements&nbsp;private until they're ready to preview them.&nbsp; I personally doubt they'd modify the menu, but I don't have any inside information.&nbsp; I know you're
 not too fond of it, but really upvoting it in the feedback app and pooling together with anyone else wanting it, is probably the best thing you can do to influence it.&nbsp; Although doing a search in there, it doesn't look like there's many votes on the idea,
 and honestly that's part of why I doubt they'd engineer the change.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer crashes when right clicking, copying&#47;pasting, dragging&#47;dropping - especially to an external USB drive</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) crashes and you see something like this:</span>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/115b8208-2e4b-46d2-b967-ed3536db16a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/115b8208-2e4b-46d2-b967-ed3536db16a8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, read this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you have an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer Extensions make up the list/menu of things you see when you right click something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An afflicted Explorer Shell extension can cause Explorer to crash - sometimes when right clicking things and especially when using copy/paste drag/drop and often to/from an external USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several recent incidents involving Acer systems and MyWinLocker from EgisTec (which is already known to include some troublesome Explorer shell extensions) which may have come preinstalled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if your system is not from Acer it may have MyWinLocker installed and since there have been many reports of it contributing to Explorer crashes it seems a good place to start looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in your Installed Programs and find MyWinLocker or anything from EgisTec and you don't know what it is or why it is there consider just uninstalling it, rebooting and then see how things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have determined that MyWinLocker or any other EgisTec programs are involved follow the general purpose instructions below so you will be able to see all the Explorer shell extensions and figure out which one is afflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using The following program suggestion if you see any extensions from EgisTec, PSD Security Software, eDataSecurity, DragDropProtect (they will be some of the pink extensions) start with those first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of those things are present, continue to isolate the afflicted extension:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when Windows feels
 threatened by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause. &nbsp;It does not make sense to make a DEP exception for Windows Explorer.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebaa8f7a-0188-49cc-be37-18f15007ebfb" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  chrisriley2, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 8.1. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 8.1 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>I know this is going to sound weird but if you have a Wi-Fi card plugged into your mother board, it can cause the problem of&nbsp; black screen at 75% lockup. When powered back up the computer continues to the 81% or 82% point then the screen freezes at that
 point.&nbsp; When manually powered down the computer attempts to recover update, fails, and then reverts to the previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several threads that address this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/win-10-1709-update-freezes-at-82-complete/3fd40e52-7171-41d5-bab8-de4a5837c3e7</p>

<p>
</p><p>and more...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it amounts to is an Anatel wi-Fi card causes major problems with the Win10 updates since 1607. The easiest workaround is to physically remove the Anatel Wi-Fi card from the computer and then allow the update to run. A lot of people have solved their
 update issues this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if this will help you. I'm just another very frustrated Win10 customer with a Gateway computer. I am currently on Win10 1803 (originally a Win 7). Removing the Anatel Wi-Fi card allowed me to update to this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read through those threads to see if it might apply to your circumstance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I did a quick search for Remove Wi-Fi card on YouTube and see that there are quite a few tutorials for both laptop and desktop computers. It is a fairly universal procedure and as computer things go one of the simplest.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Most people reported that they just leave the card out and use an Ethernet cable to use
</span>internet<span>. People that do not have that option bought a new Wi-Fi card (around $30.00 U.S.) and have had no issues since. The problem Wi-Fi card appears to be manufactured by Anatel. Users have reported that
 device </span>manger<span> does not always report the Anatel name. Mine reported I was using a Realtek Wi-Fi but when I removed it I saw that it was manufactured by Anatel.</span></p>
<p>Some people have reported they use a USB Wi-Fi hookup and it has worked fine also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes. Best of Luck.</p>

<h2>            HTPC Lost HDMI Audio&#47;Video Connection When Sound Processor in Standby Mode</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 Ultimate on a home theater PC (HTPC) using an HDMI connection for video and sound output to an Integra sound/video processor (which in turn is connected to amplifiers and speakers).&nbsp; If I put the Integra into "standby mode" (but
 not totally powered off), and then later resume the Integra to regular operation, my HTPC will not output any sound (even operating system sounds do not work) and no videos can be played back, until I reboot the HTPC.&nbsp; When I checked into the audio problem,
 the Microsoft FixIt program thought no audio cables were connected, while clicking on "Test" in Control Panel&gt;Sounds yielded an error that another application was using the audio device (even though the none of the "Exclusive Mode" boxes in properties is checked).&nbsp;
 For the video problem, I recieve an error message that the files needed to display vidoe are not installed or are not working correctly.&nbsp; Restarting Media Center does not fix the problem, I must reboot

            <p>Hello Zetamann,</p>
<p>Have we looked into any BIOS updates for this machine?</p>

<p>Quite often, updating the BIOS will take care of a lot of these issues that occur with sleep.</p>

<h2>            Windows Server 2003 R2 vs 2008 R2 vs 2012 as a file server</h2>
                    <p>
I am using Windows Server 2003 R2. We have about 100 PCs which are connected to this server and by using network connection. We are planning to upgrade it to other newer version. So I was looking for comparison between Windows Server 2003 R2, 2008 R2 and 2012.</p>
<p>
All of the articles talk about new features like Hyper-V, Hyper v Replica, Active Directory, IIS etc. But I am not using any of these. I am mainly using it as a file server. So, I need to know the features comparison related to it.</p>
<p>
How are the 3 server versions different?</p>
<p>
I heard that&nbsp;data deduplication is main feture of windows server 2012.Does it only reduce the file size when it is in disk? Or does it get benefit to network traffic when it copied thorough network to other path? Does this data is supported to windows XP which
 are in network</p>

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />Seeing the SMART error, your disk might be damaged.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<span>Black Screens can be very difficult to resolve since there are no error messages or systematic files to help determine anything to help.

<br />
<br />
You have a Black Screen and not a real BSOD which is a BlueScreen. Though it can be even harder to correct.<br />
<br />
Try this :<br />
<br />
Boot in to Safe Mode - Device Manager - Display Adapter - Right Click on <br />
it and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Reboot the computer and hopefully the BlackScreen will be history.<br />

<br />
If that works check with your System/Motherboard Maker and/or your video<br />
device maker's support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in<br />
their forums about any knows issues. And you really should do this first.<br />

                    Hello! Smart gesture doesn't switch on after returning form sleep mode tho I installed latest version on my ASUS X501A win 64bit. So what can I do, that Smart gesture doesn't fail after returning fro sleep mode?! And second problem is - if by some sort
 of magic it will turn on then that will be after couple of minutes.

<p>Hi, Hector </p>
<p>I am glad you replied BUT,</p>
<p>How can I reinstall and update driver as I am unable to login in computer and keyboard, touchpad even usb mouse not working.</p>
<p>And no sign of ease of button on locks creep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially when usb mouse was working and ease of access button was also available.</p>
<p>I tried to updated keyboard driver and it said it was already updated!</p>
<p>Then I uninstalled the keyboard driver and reboot the computer. I did this couple of times with usb mouse when ease of access button was showing on lockscreen &nbsp; and then &nbsp;finally usb mouse &nbsp;also stopped &nbsp;working and no ease of access button.</p>
<p>And I made some changes in bios too but it dint work so finally I restore default mode and left it.</p>
<p>I also tried to updated bios through bios as I already downloaded updated bios and extracted file before usb mouse stopped working.</p>

                    Just got Windows 10. When I turn on my computer all my hotmail emails show up on the screen! I don't want my emails on my screen! These are private. What kind of idiot software allows your private emails to be read by everyone the computer? How do I make
 this stop?

<p>Salve a tutti, volevo comprarmi una televisione per xbox 360 che ho acquistato da poco. Cosa mi consigliate??</p>
<p>Mi direste a quanti p(p = 720p o altro) prendere?? HD Full o HD Ready? Ditemi il più possibile di informazioni grazie.</p>
<p>Questa TV la acquisterò all' euronics o (forse) al mediaworld. Mi dite cosa devo dire (le caratteristiche principali) al venditore (dipendente) dell' euronics??</p>
<p>Invece per gli hz?? 100hz supportano la 60pal (60hz) perchè ad esempio lego star wars III non lo supporta, ditemi un po voi. Grazie 10000 in anticipo, siate numerosi :D</p>

<p>1 Full HD assolutamente</p>
<p>2 Più è grande, meglio è</p>
<p>3 Più attacchi ha (hdmi, vga, scart, ecc ecc) meglio è.</p>

<p>Le differenze tra marche e modelli sono per me piuttosto risibili e non ci farei gran caso.</p>

<p>La caratterisca IMPORTANTISSIMA e PRINCIPALE ma aimè la meno conosciuta è l'INPUT LAG</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>L'input lag è il tempo impiegato nel visualizzare un' immagine videoludica in movimento su schermo, fra quando si da un comando con il controller e quando lo stesso viene riprodotto a video.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>L'input lag si misura in Millisecondi, piu' il valore sarà alto e piu' si sentirà il ritardo (fino ad arrivare a livelli di ingiocabilità), viceversa piu' il valore sarà basso e piu' si avrà il controllo TOTALE sul gioco stesso.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Una buon valore di input lag è intorno ai 10ms valori più alti rendono il gioco sempre più ingiocabile specialmente in quei giochi dove la reattività è tutto ad esempio i picchiaduro oppure gli FPS</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Da come puoi capire questo valore è il fattore principale per la scelta di una buona televisione ma prutroppo NON è indicato dai costruttori (da non confondere con il TEMPO di RISPOSTA che è solo una componente dell'input lag)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Per ovviare a questo problema tutte le televisioni sono dotate di una "MODALITA' GIOCO" una funzione che disattiva molti processi di miglioramento di immagine per poter abassare l'input lag ma allo stesso tempo la qualità dell'immagini quindi ti ritrovi
 ad avere un televisore che lavora al 50% e con una qualità d'immagine pari ad un modello più economico</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Posso consigliarti di dare un'occhiata su internet, ci sono parecchi siti tipo questo:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dday.it/redazione/220/DDay-The-Best-Gaming-TV-Test.html#pagina-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dday.it/.../DDay-The-Best-Gaming-TV-Test.html</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>dove calcolano l'input lag dei modelli più venduti così da poter decidere quale sia il più consono</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Ti CONSIGLIO vivamente di NON SOTTOVALUTARE questo fattore io stesso l'ho provato</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A casa ho 2 televisori un 42" lcd di qualche anno e un 50 led con meno di un anno nuovo nuovo, il primo cioè il più vecchio ha un input lag di 8ms e si gioca benissimo il secondo cioè il più nuovo ha un input lag di 20ms e ti assicuro che è davvero impossibile
 giocarci specialemente online l'unica è utilizzare la "modalità gioco" che me lo abbassa intorno ai 10ms ma col risultato di avere una qualità d'immagine come quello vecchio.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Fai dunque MOLTA ATTENZIONE all' input lag e buona scelta</p>

<p>Se il problema è l'input lag basta comprarsi una tv al plasma invece di LCD.</p>
<p>Il problema quasi non esiste con quel tipo di tecnologia.</p>

<p>Si il plasma presenta un input lag basso perchè è una tecnologia vecchia e quindi non ha tutte quelle elaborazioni di immagine che ormai la maggior parte delle tv hanno ed è quindi anche il più econimico</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>ma allo stesso tempo è quello che patisce le console, tende a rovinarsi con le immagini ferme ad esempio il logo dell'arma selezionata oppure la barra di salute ma anche il logo che ti avvisa di un amico che si è appena collegato</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>ma è tutto relativo, anche qui parlo per esperienza, fatalità ho 2 amici col plasma da un 4 anni circa, ad uno non gli è successo niente e all'altro invece ha dovuto rigenerare lo schermo (per l'appunto gli era rimasta la "macchia" del logo d'avviso di amici
 online)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Francamente è un rischio che io non correrei la via più giusta è quella di consultare internet e trovare un buon led o lcd con un input lag basso (già 10ms vanno bene)</p>

<p>ok grazie mille, e invece per gli hz, come faccio, prendo quella a 100hz 200hz, (50hz lo escluderei), cmq grazie Alfredo83 per la risposta del lag, non ero molto informato su questa.</p>
<p>le televisioni sono anche a 60hz, ma tanti mi consigliano 100hz, chi ha ragione secondo voi, io sugli hz non so bene, ma ora ho una tv a tubo cadotico (o se si scrive cosi) --- CHE TRISTEZZA --- e per questo chiedevo a voi della tv e tutto</p>

<p>Si ma infatti, non è detto che il plasma si rovini ma solo che può esserci il rischio</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Altra cosa è la vita media di un plasma più corta rispetto ad altre tecnologie, consumi di corrente più elevati e altro fattore è il riscaldamento dello schermo che tende a diventare un piccolo termosifone e in estate può esser fastidiso</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>comunque queste sono solo "chiacchere da bar" ognuno è livbero di comprare il modello e la tecnologia che più gli piace</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>per non andare OT ripeto ad Arctic e a chiunque volgia un televisore nuovo il mio consiglio, "controllare l'input lag"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>una volta accertato l'input lag minimo consigliato va bene qualunque tipologia di TV</p>

<p>Generalmente tutte le TV vanno lavorano a 100hz mentre a 200hz quelle con tecnologia 3D, a dirti il vero non è una scelta molto importante da fare nel senso che la xbox gira appunto a 60hz quindi non ti cambia assolutamente niente a livello di giocabilità
 o qualità dell'immagine</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Ti ripeto ora come ora qualunque televisore di ultima generazione ha le caratteristiche necessarie per esser collegata all'xbox quindi vai sul sicuro tranne per 'linput lag appunto che non capisco per quale ragione i costruttori non lo inseriscano nelle
 caratteristiche</p>

<p>pollici più graznde è meglio è</p>

<p>La differenza tra il FULL e il READY è questa (te la spiego con termini terra terra):</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>partiamo col dire che un'immagine si dice HD quando è formata da c.a 2.000.000 pixel</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>in sostanza uno schermo FULL è uno schermo con 2.000.000 pixel</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>uno schermo READY è uno schermo che non ha 2.000.000 pixel ma giocando con la frequenza riesce a farti percepire i 2.000.000 pixel in poche parole "emula" uno schermo full-hd</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A questo punto è più che ovvio dire che è meglio un FULL-HD non tanto per la qualità di immagine ma perchè il READY con questo processo di "emulazione" può portare l'input lag (si ritorna sempre qui) a liveli ingiocabili</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Per quanto riguarda i pollici, "più grande è meglio è" non è sempre detto... ovvio che un televisore ci piace grande ma devi avere anche lo spazio per potertelo godere, ad es. il mio 50" lo guardo da c.a 3m se mi avvicino non riesco a tener d'occhio tutto
 lo schermo con il risulatato che riesco a guardarlo solo a "pezzi"</p>

<h2>            BSOD - DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Error</h2>
                    My computer has been intermittently crashing with the&nbsp;<b>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</b> error for the past 2 weeks. &nbsp;This usually happens after I open a folder with a large number of files or if I have 2-3 applications running at the same time. I've
 formatted the PC and installed a fresh copy of Windows 7 and received the error after an hour.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm currently running Windows 7 Ultimate (64bit) on an i7, with 8GB's of RAM, a 560Ti GPU and two 1TB HD's. As far as I know none of my components exhibit any symptoms of being faulty (I could be wrong).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The<b> Error report</b> that I receive is:</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the DISM commands (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) and check if the error in Windows updates can be fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Type <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the <strong>Search</strong> Charms bar and then right click on
<strong>Command prompt</strong> and click on <strong>Run as administrator.</strong></p>
<p>2. Type the following commands and press enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong></li><li><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Restart the computer and then check if you are able to uninstall the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. If you have any concerns, please let us know.</p>

            I am having the same problem. I performed the steps Kevin suggested, but after the restart it still failed with code&nbsp;0x8004005 (after running the uninstall through DISM). Furthermore, I ran the DISM health restore a second time after the restart, and &nbsp;once
 again it said that the component store corruption was repaired. Should it say that every time, and are there more steps I can take to uninstall this update? &nbsp;

<p>I am having this same problem. My laptop's battery went out during 8.1 update and got back to 8.0</p>
<p>Now I can't install 8.1 (error 0x80040155) but can't uninstall KB2849636 (error 0x80004005) either to restart the whole process...</p>

            <p>To build off of Onyx's post, how is your sound bar currently set up?&nbsp;We recommend having the audio output go out via HDMI, and then connect the sound bar to the TV's optical audio port. Check the suggestion under 'Audio receiver with optical or soundbar' on our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/live-tv/connect-console-to-home-theater#e2c7f82a81194feab7a2f5bcff82437a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One to Home Theatre support page</a>. </p><p><br /></p><p>Let us know if that helps!</p>

<h2>            Missing codec 0xC00D1B83</h2>
                    I was trying to convert some WAV files to WMA so I downloaded Windows Media Encoder 9. Any time I try to convert a file I get this error:<br />
<br />
<strong>"The following error occurred&nbsp;whiile setting up the source: 'Source 1':<br />

<br />
By searching for this error code, the only answer I could find was on the microsoft page. BUT, it was about encoding video files (not audio)&nbsp;and it says the problem occurrs when you install some ULead AFTER you install WME. The solution, of course, is to uninstall
 the ULead software. First, I have no ULead software on my computer, and second,&nbsp;WME gave me this error right off the bat, I havn't installed anything else.<br />
Why does MS have to give me so much grief? Why can't WMP just do this sort of thing?

====================================<br />
There is a way to do this with Windows Media Player but<br />
it would cost you a CD. Create a music CD with the .wav<br />
files and then rip the CD with .wma as the target format.<br />
<br />
Anyway...I don't have a fix for Windows Media Encoder but<br />
maybe the following freeware would be worth a try:<br />

<h2>            Transferir DLC do Xbox 360 para o Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Olá,</p>
<p>Estava pensando em comprar um Xbox One junto com o jogo <strong>Titanfall,</strong> mas ae, lembrei que já tinha ele aqui no meu 360, e que tinha compra a Season Pass dele no 360. Gostaria de saber se tem como transferir a conta do Titanfall do 360 para
 o One, ou se tem como transferir a Season Pass do 360 para o One.</p>

<p>Obrigado.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

            Hi, R98rayan
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC
<br />The System File Checker tool built into Windows can scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a file has been modified, it will automatically replace that file with the correct version. Here’s how to use it.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow 
<br />

<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<p>Someone would need to file a complaint against your account for cheating, and the Xbox Live Policy and Enforcement Team will reset your gamerscore. &nbsp; They will also prevent your from unlocking any achievement that your got throught unauthorized means.</p>

<p>Was this achievement earned through a bug, or did you willingly try to receive such through illegidimate means?</p>
<p>Many times when people modify their achievements they feel regret and guilt after. Even though it is unlikely that they will remove one achievement (To my understanding, this has never been done.). They can investigate. If they find that you willingly altered
 your gamerscore. It will be reset and your account will be labeled as "Cheater".
</p>
<p>If this was earned through a bug that the developer failed to fix, i doubt they will act.</p>
<p>The only way to be sure is to contact the enforcement team. You can do so by going to
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../41.aspx</a> and sending a "Pm" to an enforcement team member. You can tell who they are by their gamertag having "XBLPET____" and by having a "X" rank on the left, under their gamertag.</p>
<p>In either situation i suggest you contact them to be sure since there is no possible way to delete your achievements.</p>
