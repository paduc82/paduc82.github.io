<p>Hi Vladimir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why your getting the error message: <strong>Class not registered</strong> is due to corrupted system files on your computer. We recommend that you run the System File Checker. System File Check
<span>is&nbsp;a utility available in Windows 10 that checks for system file corruption. If the issue isn't resolved by performing the SFC, kindly use DISM. DISM is used to troubleshoot errors that SFC can't resolve.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>See this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026529/windows-using-system-file-checker-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Using System File Checker in Windows 10</a> and follow the on-screen instructions. In the event that SFC wasn't able to resolve the issue, click on
<strong>More info on System File Checker</strong> and go to DISM on the thread for the steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the result.</p>

    <title>No rear sound from 5.1 speakers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No rear sound from 5.1 speakers</h2>
                    Dear Microsoft,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm setting up my speakers. It is a set of 4 speakers, two front and two rear, and a subwoofer. The speakers are a bit old, so I can't easily get the drivers. But that should not be a problem.</div>
<div>I already configured it as a 5.1 surround set. And when I press 'Test', I get sound from all speakers.</div>
<div>However, when I play music from apps like Spotify or YouTube, or from any other app, I only get sound from the two front speakers.</div>
<div>I have two plugs, a green and a black one. And when I press 'simulate canal', the only thing that happens is that the two front speakers are weaker.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope you can help me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kind regards,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Mathijs</div>
                </div>

            <p>Few audio sources actually have any rear speaker signal, the main one that does is surround sound Video. This means that natively any standard playback will not produce rear signal such as MP3 etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using the "Fill Speaker" option you are instructing the sound card to produce a rear signal when there isn't one. In most cases it is just the front signal with the frequency envelope shifted slightly to reduce the bass and at a lower level so the balance
 is biased forwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of a middle speaker has always been a problem even with just stereo speakers. You would often find the dialogue in film playback very low because the audio mix in the recording loads the actors primarily to the centre speaker. Quite often in games
 if the protagonist was talking in whispers if your character looked at them you could not hear anything,&nbsp;if you turned the view so they were left or right screen they would be much clearer.</p>

            Dear Basith,
<div><br />
<div>I got it working now! Your methods did not help, but I played with the options of the speakers.</div>
<div>There was one option, 'Fill speakers' I think. I use a Dutch Windows 8, so that's why I don't know the exact option. But it worked, I've got sound from all speakers.</div>

<p>Hey guys, as the title suggests, I'm having drops from party chat and live(on occasion). I've followed all the steps from the forum post below to no avail.&nbsp;</p>

Basically, my problem description is as follows:<br />
<br />
-Consistent drops from party chat. Joins and rejoins within seconds. Voice drops and a couple of seconds later I'll lag out of the party and join back again within seconds.<br />
-The same goes with private chat, except it doesn't seem to drop out only voice cuts for seconds at a time.&nbsp;<br />
-Only happens when I'm not playing multiplayer. Its fine when playing multiplayer and in the dashboard.&nbsp;<br />
-A couple of times when loading up a game it disconnects from live straight away and doesn't reconnect only after manually pressing 'connect to xbox live' does it.&nbsp;<br />
-Does not happen with any other device on the router.</p>
<p>- Wired Connection</p>
<p>-Ports 53,80,88,1863 and 3074 all TCP/UDP are forwarded to a static ip set to my xbox.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there. Sorry to hear that you're having connectivity problems.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>First things first, can you try restarting your modem and console? This usually fixes most connectivity problems.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If this doesn't help, you should try to update your modem's firmware. The current version I can see is 1.06h.</p>

<p>-Nat is clearly open[/quote]</p>
<p>If you can rule out NAT issues <strong>on your friends side</strong>, too, can you try the following:<br />
<br />
On your PC, open up a command prompt (on a Windows PC press Windowskey + R, then type "cmd" in the small window and press OK. On a Mac or Linux PC open a Terminal window).<br />
<br />
In the window type the following command:</p>
<p>ping www.google.com -t</p>
<p>(if you have Linux or Mac, omit the "-t" option).<br />
<br />
Now whenever you get dropped from the party, do the values in the command window significantly change? Or does it say something completely different?<br />
<br />
Can your chat partner do the same? What is his/her result?</p>

<p>Hey PalZer0, thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Resetting my modem many times hasn't resulted in a fix for this situation. As an instinct it was one of the first things I did.</p>
<p>Also I updated the firmware a couple of months ago to 1.06h so I doubt thats the problem.</p>

<p>Sorry about such a late reply ArminatorX, it's been a crazy week at uni. </p>
<p>Anyways, back to business. I've tried the ping test with two of my friends both as party leader and not with the following results.
</p>
<p>Note: All three members are performing the ping test at the same time. </p>
<p>1 time - ping to google was 30ms - 38ms, once I lagged out it went to 40ms. This seems normal and sometimes spikes higher than this even whilst not lagging out. I was not host of the party.</p>
<p>1 time - when my buddy was hosting the party, I lagged out his ping went from 20-25 to 60ms and 91ms respectively.</p>
<p>This is a one time occurrence out of the 30+ times I lagged out while performing the ping test.
</p>
<p>One other person was also in the party performing the ping test. He was not host. He did not experience any fluctuations or anything when I lagged out.
</p>
<p>After about about a half hour of me constantly lagging out, my ping time never changed and with the exception of one or two times out of about 30 neither did my friends.</p>
<p>Are there any other suggestions because I'm really out of ideas?</p>

<p>Hey there MrX,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you've been having issues with your chats lagging out.<br />
<br />
Just making sure I understand correctly:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you experience this lag only in party or group chats? </li><li>Do you have lag in games or apps while playing online? </li></ul>
<p><br />
From what you're describing, there is one thing I would suggest trying:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Would you be able to try disabling UPnP and then restarting your router? </li></ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>It's possible that having both the manual port forwarding set and UPnP is causing a port conflict.
</li></ol>
</ol>
<p><br />
<br />
Please let us know how that goes and we'll work from there.<br />
<br />

Thank you for your reply, Mister Fizzle. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yes, I only experience this lag only in party chat. Private chat works fine. <br />
No lag in game what so ever. Only because it happens exclusively during single player portions of games. If playing multiplayer it will not occur.
<br />
<br />
I have tried disabling UPnP and restarting with no avail. <br />
<br />
Any more ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi MrX,<br />
<br />
Man this is a stubborn one. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I do have a suggestion for you</span>.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Change password from WPA2 to WPA on Wireless</strong> </li><li><strong>Remove SSID once connected.</strong> </li><li><strong>Change band to G + B, removed N.&nbsp;</strong> </li></ol>
<p><br />
Let us know how that works, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

 and that one never ever has any problems connecting to live....my 360s is about 10-15 feet from my router but running a cable to it would be very hard because i have no where to hide the wire and it would be in the way....ive tried unplugging all my wireless
 things at home aswell which is only the other xbox laptop and land line but it makes no difference....even tried using a wireless adapter on the back of the 360s and that doesnt work.....sometimes it just connects to live and works for about 5 mins then disconnects
 so i have to reconnect then its ok again for 5 mins and disconnects again....ive sent&nbsp;the console away to&nbsp;have it checked and there is nothing wrong with it...it is&nbsp;compatable with my netgear router because i have checked with netgear...port 3074 is opening
 when it should because when you play on the elite and go to router settings its open....so once again if any one can help please do....cheers</strong></p>

<h2>            Slow internet for no apparent reason&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I have a Sony model SVF1521A1EW laptop and when I first got it, the internet seemed to work fine. I've had it for around just under a month or so and about a week ago the internet became very slow and would not play videos without stopping. I haven't been
 able to get through a full video and the internet is much slower than it used to be. I've checked to see if it was a fault with the broadband router, but the internet works fine with other devices around the house. I'm really not sure what I can do to get
 it back to the way it used to be?<br />

                    so I have a Windows Surface Pro 3 and every time I use my front-facing webcam it is completely zoomed in, like it only captures my eyes and my nose when I'm sitting at a normal distance. I have to stand about 5' away to have it look normal. I can't seem
 to find any settings to adjust this, and this is a problem in every app that uses the webcam (skype, facebook video calls, even the camera app). Does anyone know of any fixes?&nbsp;

                    For some strange reason the wifi on my computer wouldnt turn on and then a few weeks later the mousepad stopped working so, i decided to reset the computer and its literally been resetting for about 15 hours now! Idk if its suppose to be resetting for
 this long or if there is just something deeply wrong with my computer. It already finished up to 100% but now its just sitting there with a blank screen with the loading circle and that was 10 hours ago.

<p>It looks like you have access to another computer.</p>
<p>Go to the Media Creation Tool and burn a bootable DVD and use it to reboot your computer.&nbsp; This will give you a clean install and there will not be any of your old programs or data left.&nbsp; Hope you made a backup.</p>

and click on <strong>Update driver Software</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;

<p>If doesn't help, I suggest you to install the driver in a compatibility mode and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Download the latest driver from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.&nbsp;<br />
b. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the setup file and click on ‚Äò<strong>properties</strong>‚Äô.&nbsp;<br />
c. Click on the ‚Äò<strong>compatibility</strong>‚Äô tab and check the box ‚Äò<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for‚Äô
</strong>and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.

<h2>            Mouse pointer jumping all over the place</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: pointer <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had a Toshiba laptop a couple of years ago. It had w7. I have a new Toshiba laptop with 8.1. I heard not to many people like it. I love It's much better than 7.Anyway with my old laptop I had a problem with the pointer. It would be all over the place jumping
 here and there. Very hard to control some times. Very infuriating when trying to play games. I came here and asked if anyone knew what the problem is. I don't think I received an answer but noticed that other people had the same problem. I have the same problem
 on my new laptop. I can't figure out if it's the machine or software</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This issue might occur due to corrupt or incompatible touchpad driver installed on the laptop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What is the Model of the Toshiba laptop?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First of all, I would suggest you to disable tapping for the touchpad and check if that fixes the issue as this has been a fix for many other Toshiba users. Refer to the
<a href="http://forums.toshiba.com/t5/Computer-Troubleshooting/How-do-I-stop-my-mouse-cursor-from-moving-on-its-own/ta-p/277129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>to do so. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If not, I would suggest you to check for update and see if you receive optional updates related to the touchpad. Installing latest updates offered from Windows Update brings stability to the performance as well as hardware device connected on the computer.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Refer to the link to do so:</p>
<p>Refer to the section ‚Äú<b>Do I need to check for updates?</b>‚Äù</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-update-faq</a></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a></p>
<p>For further troubleshooting, follow the methods:</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Refer to the link and run the hardware and device troubleshooter:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Refer to the section ‚Äú<b>Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b>‚Äù </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly</a>&nbsp;
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>Check if that fixes the issue. If not, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if the same issue happens when you boot the computer in safe mode. Follow the steps:</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>Refer to the link to boot the computer in safe mode:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If the touchpad cursor does function normally, proceed to step 2.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>Perhaps, there could be some other non-Microsoft application that is causing this issue.</p>
<p>Refer to the link to place the computer in clean boot state:</p>
<p>Refer to the section ‚Äú<b>Windows 8</b>‚Äù</p>
<p>You can refer to the section ‚Äú<b>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</b>‚Äù to check for the application or program that is causing this issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Please refer to the section: <b>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</b>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For further reference, refer to the Toshiba website to download and install the latest touchpad driver for Windows 8.1. Make sure that you uninstall the current version and then install the latest version of touchpad driver. You can also refer to the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-nz/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to know how to update driver on Windows 8.1.</p>

            HI Pinaki. I have the satilitte c855d. I know its a cheap laptop but Toshiba makes good products for the money, I get the windows and Toshiba updates all the time and I am running in safe mode. I believe it may be the hardware because it doesn't do it
 all the time. The third method mentioned is a little confusing. All my hardware the computer tells me is functioning normaly

            Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
Thank you for an update.<br />
<br />
Do you have that issue in safe mode?<br />
<br />
If not, it could either be the drivers or some other application that is causing the issue. That's why, step 2 (clean boot) helps us to find out if there is any third party application or service that is the reason for the issue.
<br />
<br />
If the issue is still there, you can refer to the link to download the latest available touchpad driver and then install them in Windows compatibility mode as the driver might not be for Windows 8.1. Follow the steps:
<br />
<p><b>Note</b>: Make sure that you have the setup file for latest version of the touchpad on the computer before following the steps.</p>
<p>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press <b>Windows and X</b> key together and select <b>

<p>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Right Click on the setup file and select <b>Properties</b>.</p>
<p>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Go to <b>compatibility</b> tab and choose the version of ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù from the drop down menu under ‚ÄúRun this program in compatibility mode for‚Äù section. (You can choose Windows 8 or that version of Windows for which the driver is
 available at the manufacturer website)</p>
<p>h) Click on <b>Apply</b> and then on <b>OK</b>. Double Click on the setup file of the driver and follow the onscreen instructions to install the driver.</p>
<p><br />

            I have had the same problem on my Lenovo PC running Windows 10 with a touch screen.&nbsp; I have reseached and tried everything I could find on the forums.&nbsp; I even disable the mouse and tried two other ones, including a new one.&nbsp; I finally read on the Lenovo
 forum that others havig the same problem, solved the mouse jumping by disablling their the touch screen.&nbsp; I did this and now my mouse is behaving correcly.

<h2>            Win 10-Watch Dog</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 10 Home on Dell Inspiron 15R Touchscreen. &nbsp;Win 10 upgrade worked fine until Anniversary Upgrade. &nbsp;Have had trouble booting ever since--boots to black screen with the rotating circle. &nbsp;After much work (including using Bootrec.exe and various
 switches, including /fixmbr, I was able to get the machine to boot into Windows. &nbsp;Additional problems in booting resolved by removing Logitech wireless mouse dongle from the USB port, then reinserting it after boot process complete. Now, this week, when the
 computer was waking up, it went to black screen and printed out the following:</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there other&nbsp; devices that are connected via USB cables on your computer? Did you also remove them? Is the computer still stuck on the black screen right now?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong><br />
Reboot the computer and press and hold the "<strong>F2</strong>" key immediately as the computer starts the
<strong>bootup </strong>process. After you press the "<strong>F2</strong>" key, the computer will display the motherboard
<strong>BIOS</strong> (Basic Input/Output System) configuration pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong><br />
Reboot the computer and start tapping the <strong>"F8</strong>" key when the <strong>
Dell splash screen</strong> appears and before the <strong>Windows logo</strong> appears. A menu will appear that displays
<strong>fail safe boot options and recovery options for Windows.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br />
Reboot the computer and immediately press and hold the <strong>"F12</strong>" key. The computer will display the "<strong>Boot Options</strong>" menu from which you can configure the media that will be used to boot the computer.</p>
<p>

Download Windows 10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>I do not have any other USB devices attached, so that's not the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several more reboots and running through several repair sessions and chkdsk, I was finally able to get into Windows out of the black screen. I made the change to the SATA driver, as suggested in prior post (although iastor.sys was not the driver, I
 changed to the Standard SATA AHCI Controller anyway). &nbsp;I have not had any problem since. &nbsp;So I did not get a chance to try your solution. I will file it for future reference, though! &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>My goodness, I will need a new game for the summer, the kids are out in full force. Last night, every room I went into had some annoying children who of course, find the dumbest things funny. Team killing, flashbanging teammates out of the spawn, screaming
 into microphones (muted of course)...am I the only one who thinks that parents who have children who behave this way are using video games a surrogate parents? Oh, i need a new game soon!</p>

<p>For sure. Never been a big NCAA fan, but I buy every madden, so I will def get the new one. We now have 3D GRASS!!! YAAAY! LOL. Seriously, I cant wait to see how they beefed up the presentation. I read that they will have the "screen wipe" like actual broadcasts
 do, which should be cool to see. </p>

<p>In case you didn't know, there will be a new tackling, receiving, and zone coverage deals. You actually have to be in&nbsp;position to make a tackle or catch. And zone coverage finally passes receivers off&nbsp;automatically in coverage. No more easy gaps to pick

<p>Yea, i guess we read the same thing in GI this month. Got me extra hyped about it. I wonder now that Plaxico Burress is out of jail, will he be in it this year? lol. Yea, I used to kill people by luring defenders into other defenders zones and hot routing
 recievers into the HUGE gaps left, so now I may have to actually work harder on pass plays. all for it.

<p>LOL, yea...I dont know what the hell Im gonna do if there is no season this year. Perish the thought. My belief is, with 9 billion more to lose this year, they are gonna work something out instead of letting that go. But as far as the game goes, at least
 I wont have to deal with someones lil bast@rds running rampant lol</p>

    <title>Gears of War 3 Season Pass and DLC Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> freshsqueezed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gears of War 3 Season Pass and DLC Issues</h2>
                    I have purchased two GoW 3 season passes. One on my sons xbox under his profile and one on my xbox under my profile. It shows that I have downloaded the content on his console under his profile, but it's not available in the game. No characters or maps
 or weapon skins. I have contacted customer support. They refered me to the forums. I originally downloaded my season pass on my xbox and it's working fine before the release date. My sons pass after the release date. My son sometimes recovers his gamer profile
 on my xbox to play with me and then recovers it on his xbox when he wants to play on his console. I don't know if this has caused a problem. Tech. support helped me delete and recover his profile from his console and clear system cashe and re-downloaded his
 pass and weapon skins. It still did not work. They contacted me a second time and advised me to move his profile to a portable memory stick, which I did. Still not working. I have paid for content I can't use. This is not good...

<p>Ok..Ok.... I figured it out.... I had downloaded the pulse weapon skin on my console under my gamertag. My son recovered his gamertag on my console so we could play the game together. He used my purchased pulse weapon skin under his gamertag while we were
 playing. When we were done he went upstaires to his console and recovered his gamertag. He noticed that when he played the game on his console the pulse weapon skin was still on his guns and he was able to play while using that skin, but if he went to change
 the weapon skin to a different one while in the game he noticed that it was not showing as being purchased under his gamertag so if he changed it he would not be able to use it again. I went to the main dashboard and went into settings, memory, game and then
 into the gears of war 3 saved files. I saw that the pulse weapon skin was showing there in the saved files. I deleted it because I knew I purchased it on my console and under my gamertag and not his. His season pass and green weapon skin that he had purchased
 under his gamertag on his console was also in the saved files, so I knew that was ok. I then stared the game up again and BAAAAAM!!!!!! His content was there and its working fine now. I saw another post on the net where one guy had the Griffen DLC on his memory
 card and was having the same issue with he season pass that I was. He noticed that when he removed the memory card from his console his season pass worked. What I think is happening is if you have purchased DLC under &nbsp;your gamertag and on your console if someone
 else uses the content under there gamertag it may be blocking access to DLC in the future if that file is somehow linked to the non-purchaser. &nbsp;So my suggestion would be to make sure all DLC is saved on the proper gamertag that purchased that content. &nbsp;Also
 check all other gamertags that are on your console or any other console and delete any saved files for DLC that they have not purchased. Hopefully that will work.</p>

<p>I have this problem: </p>
<p>I got a second Xbox a while ago and moved all the stuff from my old box via MS data transfer cable. Then I re-installed and re-downloaded the games we play together to the old box. I use cloud saves on all the accounts and things seemed to work nicely.
</p>
<p>But now my sons started playing Gears of war 3, both solo and in co-op. So pretty soon they wanted to have the DLCs and all that stuff so I ended up getting the Season passes for them. I've had one from day 1.
</p>
<p>For some reason everything works on the old box, all DLC content is there and they can play whatever they want, BUT the new box refuses to co-operate and only gives them access to the DLCs if I host a splitscreen game.</p>
<p>I have tried all the tricks I have found but nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>Any ideas how to make this setup work?</p>

<p>Frank,</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure your problem is this: When content is purchased on a particular box by a user, it is DRM linked to both that box and that user. &nbsp;In order to be available, it must either be on the same box it was bought on, or the user who purchased it must
 be logged in. &nbsp;Since you bought it on your old box, it doesn't matter that it was transferred over; the DRM rights were not transferred. &nbsp;So you must be logged in to access it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a way, and may still be, to transfer the box DRM rights of all your content over to your new box. &nbsp;Then you have to redownload it to get the new DRM box key. &nbsp;I can't tell you off the top of my head, but dig around in the help, and contact support
 if you can't find it. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Attn&#58;  Greg Carmack       Best Settings for Windows 10    updates</h2>
                    <p>Greg, (if this comes your way) earlier on when i got this new computer, i was asking about the Sound quality and its changing to lower bass sound when i updated the sound driver and i just couldn't get used to it, and since i was able to download a driver
 of Realtek to now get the Sound Controller manager and though, a little dissatisfied (still) i was reading today where i lost the Enhancements tab under sound and probably would be helpful to re-do or get it back and brought me to the windows updates, and
 there are available updates and i believe i set the setting to specific 8 a.m. Would i just go in and re do the time to "now" or download the availability of updates? Also, there was mention of, depending upon the version of the windows 10 updates, is where
 or when this enhancements sound feature was either changed or omitted even if by mistake and so if you have any input as to that, not that that may be useful if in fact from the version i have now:</p>

            Hi Keith.  I'm here.
<br />
<br />I would manually upgrade to the latest version 1903 by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.   This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Version has problems I will work with you to try to resolve them. If the problems are intractable, you have ten days to roll it back in Recovery settings.  
<br />
<br />Be sure to expedite all Updates after the Upgrade as it may find new drivers including Realtek, Also make absolutely sure you have the latest Realtek driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.
<br />
<br />Most problems are resolved by doing this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> . So read it over and see if its something you want to learn to do. 
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
