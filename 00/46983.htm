<h2>            Side-by-Side Configuration Error on Vista Home Premium</h2>
                    I recently installed an update to Z-Systems' Z-maestro music composition program.&nbsp; After the installation, I began receiving a "Side-by-side configuration error" when opening both Z-maestro and OpenOffice.&nbsp; The error messages are as follows:<br />
For Z-Maestro:<br />
"The following error has occured: Could not load file or assembly 'Z-FFT, Version=1.2.3622.36438, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=9931ef6b109da206' or one of its dependencies.&nbsp; The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect.
 Please see the application event log for more detail.<br />
(Exception from HRESULT: 0x800736B1) Do you want to attempt to continue using Z-Maestro?"<br />
Then there are YES and NO buttons, but the application doesn't launch no matter which is clicked.<br />
<br />
For OpenOffice:<br />
"C:\Program Files\OpenOffice.org 3\program\soffice.exe<br />
The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect.&nbsp; Please see the application event log for more detail."<br />
<br />
I have reinstalled C++ or whatever, I have run chkdsk, I have run sfc /scannow.&nbsp; The prompt after scannow says that there were errors, but that they can't be fixed.<br />
<br />
Someone please help!

            Go to the event log and look which VC++ Version is missing. SxS allows you to have several versions of a DLL installed, so that every application has the DLL version it was tested and compiled. So, don't install other VC++ Runtimes, if you see more entries
 under add/remove programs listed.<br />

    <title>How do I recover data files after Windows 7 re-install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> knorske_053  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I recover data files after Windows 7 re-install</h2>
                    <p>I had a problem often cited in these posts -- a HD problem detected.&nbsp; I have a Dell Inspiron 560 pre-loaded with Windows 7 Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually, I had Dell send me disk with Windows on it so I could re-load Windows.&nbsp; I had done the system back-up (which included a mirror image).&nbsp; After swapping out my old HD, I restored from the back-up.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I ended up with the "unofficial
 Windows" errors and could do NO downloading, and so on.&nbsp; The only recourse was having Dell send the Windows 7 disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to re-load Windows 7 on my new HD, and, of course, I no longer had any of my programs available (until after re-loading all of them).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was the hassle of re-loading all the programs' software, but there remains a larger problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not access or load or retrieve any of the data files which I presumably backed up.&nbsp; When I did my initial recovery, the one resulting in the "unofficial Windows" system, my data files were present.&nbsp; The NEW Windows, though, does not "see" them--beyond
 listing such things as "backup," and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have suggestions about how to recover my data files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hard to tell, mainly because the words you use do not tell us much about your system.</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly are "unofficial Windows" errors?</li><li>What is the name of the folder where the "mirror image" resides?</li><li>Do you have any regular backups that you used to make to an external medium before your disk developed problems?</li></ul>

            <p>l</p>
<p>The backup files are on my NAS drive. The folders are labeled merely "backup [or restore] (date)." There is, too, the folder/file labeled "mirror image."
</p>
<p>Although the first rules of computing are "backup, backup, backup, backup," I am guilty of NOT routinely backing up files. My "solution" to backup is to use my NAS drive, which has an automatic backup to a second disk, for virtually all data files. The problem
 I have now is trying to retrieve data files such as e-mails, and some others, which I am not savvy enough to have automatically stored on my NAS. Knowing how to do so would be a real benefit to me.</p>
<p>The Windows error message was showing routinely in its own pane. It read something on the order of "This machine is running an unofficial version of Windows." I managed to get some assistance in restoring Windows to its original, valid, official state by
 downloading some probes to my NAS using another computer. I then copied the downloads to my "new" HD (having the "unofficial" Windows). SOME of these downloads would run, most would not.</p>
<p>I will appreciate any assistance. I hesitate to try another "restore," considering I know of no way to strip out the Windows program (located in the backup file) to make sure I don’t end up with conflicting Windows and/or another instance of "unofficial
 Windows" running on my new HD.</p>
<p>Please let me know if I can provide more information to help you help me.</p>
<p>Thank you, and I pray you have a wonderful Thanksgiving celebration.</p>

            <p>This, unfortunately, seems to be a case of "an untested backup is almost as useless as no backup at all". Since I do not know what tool creates folders with a name "backup (date) or (mirror image) I cannot tell you how to retrieve specific user files from
 these folders. Here are the folder names created by the native tools:<br />
</p>
<p>- Backup files are kept in E:\Ahorn\...\*.zip<br />
- Image&nbsp; files are kept in E:\WindowsImageBackup</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can think of a few options to retrieve your missing files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-install the backup software you used. This might solve your problem instantly.</li><li>Make yourself more familiar with the backup software you used in order to find out how to restore individual files or folders.</li><li>Find out the exact name of the backup software, then post it here in an attempt to attract the attention of a respondent who might be familiar with it.</li><li>Give the backup disk to a qualified technician.</li><li>Give me remote access to your machine. I'd be prepared to spend half an our in analysing what is stored on your backup disk, and how to access the data.</li></ul>

            <p>Frederik ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did a touch more research, I believe I may have been not quite so haphazard with my backup situation.&nbsp; I am sure I had an "auto" or "periodic" backup set on my computer.&nbsp; There were times many months back with I had to "reset" to an earlier configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the backup which would not restore my original Windows, I used the system backup as found on Control Page.&nbsp; I did not use any third-party backup program.&nbsp; Having a Microsoft program not restore Windows properly was a surprise.&nbsp; As I mention, I had
 done "restore" in the past with no apparent problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did put these last few backups on a designated external drive.&nbsp; The files are I:Backupset (date) (code) with subfolders Backupfiles (date) (code) and Catalogs.&nbsp; The image backup is I:WindowsImageBackup with subfolder Della (name of my computer) with further
 subfolders/files Backup (date) (cod), Catalog, and SPPMetadataCache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I hesitate to try again with "restore" in fear of reloading the "unofficial" Windows.&nbsp; When I loaded the new version (from the Dell disk), the current OS--unofficial or otherwise--went to a folder WindowsOld.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I did use Control Panel for my backup, and it exists with the re-load of Windows, my only recourse seems to be finding a way to strip out the "unofficial" Windows and try another restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hesitate to allow access to my computer -- had a nasty experience with software vendor doing the same to fix their software on my machine.&nbsp; I had to uninstall and reinstall to get way from their "repair," which put me worse off than I had been before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            You can use the Disk Manager (diskmgmt.msc) do load the .vhd file from your image folder so that the whole partition appears as a VHD (Virtual Hard Disk). From there you can restore any folder you wish.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 freeze BSOD DPC Watchdog Violations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maximilianoaraya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 freeze BSOD DPC Watchdog Violations</h2>
                    <p>Few days ago this BSOD appears and I don't know how to fix it. Maybe it's related to GPU o WLAN drivers, because it happens after I close a game (Black Desert or Tekken 7) or if I'm watching YouTube.</p>
<p>Here's my DMP zip with the msinfo32:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdloTmKIK3fdckah03eiEyfWfU</p>
<p>
</p><p>And my specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home x64</p>
<p>i7 6700-HQ</p>
<p>Nvidia Geforce 950M</p>
<p>8GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping you can help me and guide me to fix it and never deal with it again!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Also, the driver that appears to be causing the crash is the rtwlane.sys, a driver for the Realtek wireless:

<h2>            My Windows 7 64 bit freezes after start-up usually on the first action or program started&#63;</h2>
                    My computer has been freezing up since a couple days ago. I have two users, my mom and me. When I login to a user, click the start button, within seconds the start menu flashes white, desktop flashes white sometimes. It does not do this in Safe Mode. I
 think it's because my mom and I are streaming a lot of videos/heavy loading images on my laptop. I checked to see if the drivers were updated and they were. Used Microsoft Fix It, no problems. Used Roadkill RAM test, no problems. After a while, it will work
 again though, but if I restart the computer, it will keep freezing. It seems to help when I cancel some processes in Task Manager.<br />
<br />
What do I do to fix this issue?<br />
<br />

Sony VAIO, Windows 7 Premium 64 Bit SP1<br />

            1. Not that I know of. My mom has been using a lot of streaming youtube videos. I found out that she was opening a lot of tabs and she's since stopped doing that.<br />
<br />
2. I don't know which one. It was given as a link of a forum when I searched for the answer to my question.
<br />
<br />
METHOD 1 WORKED. <br />
I did a clean boot. After I logged in, the Welcome screen was idle for a good minute. Then it proceeded to boot up nicely and is super fast! The only problem was the Welcome screen before going to my desktop took forever to load.<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume it's a process/service. There's been a vaiosatsurvey.exe process I haven't seen before coming up a lot. Googled it causing problems, didn't show much. This website: http://forums.g4tv.com/showthread.php?t=158396, says that a Vaio Entertainment
 process can slow the computer down if there's too much streaming video, which sounds like my problem but I didn't find that exact process name in my Task Manager/Services profile.<br />
<br />
Why do I need all those services anyways when I start-up? If my laptop runs very well when I disable them, is it bad for me to leave those settings as they are in clean boot mode?<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions? <br />

<h2>            Having difficulty with connecting to online game servers</h2>
                    <p>I've tried everything i could think of involving the router and modem, also completely resetting the Xbox. I have tried to do my own research of finding ways and understanding whats going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest roadblock I've come across is the packet loss situation and done all the things possible to fix it, no successful solutions. Connection to internet and Xbox live are fine, but playing any online game is a disaster and fails. It hasn't always
 been this way, could play online games just fine and for a while now they just wont connect to the server, please help!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Jakeyboy3!</p>
<p>I understand you've experienced an Xbox Live Policy Enforcement Action taken on your account. You will have to go to the
<a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live Policy Enforcement Site</a> to review the active Enforcement Action as well as see if there are any other options available such as a case review. Hope this helps!</p>

 think of.&nbsp; Yahoo Support is Totally useless to me.&nbsp; I tried Windows Support,&nbsp; I have tried Microsoft Support,&nbsp; all with NO Luck at all.&nbsp; The only thing I can guess is that " YAHOO "&nbsp; is a completely Bogus Company.&nbsp; Why will they NOT Allow Anyone to speak to
 them ?&nbsp; There are some Phone Numbers that you can come up with that say they are support for Yahoo, but DO NOT call these numbers.&nbsp; They are Phonies that&nbsp; say they will help you for a certain amount of money.&nbsp; And they are NOT Even from this Country .&nbsp; This
 has been a problem for me&nbsp; , which has gone on for about 5 Months now.&nbsp; I believe that besides losing irreplaceable photos and E-Mails, I possibly have also lost any new , possibly very important E-Mails.&nbsp; IS There Anybody Out There That CAN HELP ME&nbsp; ? ? ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can sure understand the inconvenience caused due to password issue and you are not getting support for the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to click the option reset password and by verifying a few questionnaire, you should be able to reset your password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that also does not work, I would recommend posting your query in <strong><a href="https://forums.yahoo.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Yahoo<em>!</em> Community Forum</a></strong> for the best possible support.</p>

<h2>            How to place a valid ISO file into windows 7 USB&#47;DVD download tool</h2>
                    I've been trying to reformat my computer for weeks now, im not upgrading or changing my OS i just want to start from scratch because i bought this computer from a friend and he deleted some pretty important drivers and such that i've also had no luck getting
 back, im using a HP touchsmart 600 with windows 7 home premium 64-bit. i have my code and an installation disk, but this is where it get's annoying. My disk drive doesnt work so if i wiped my computer it would be stuck so i want to use USB/DVD tool to put
 the iso onto an external hard drive and boot it that way.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/248995/how_to_install_windows_7_without_the_disc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/248995/how_to_install_windows_7_without_the_disc.html</a><br />
<br />
this is the article i have been using since starting this task. after i download the ISO for my OS and try to put it through the USB tool it tells me it's not a valid ISO.. i cant get any further than that, if i try putting the ISO on the external hard drive
 and then go through the program it actually lets me get to last step but when i click the add button is says the device is already in use.. so either way i seem to be stuck with this massive headache.&nbsp;

            <p>You should try using a USB Thumb drive instead of a hard disk.</p>
<p>you will have to use a tool such as the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool</a>)
<br />
This simple tool will help you convert the same image file into to a USB thumb drive. For installation purposes, you should get a thumb drive that’s at least 4 GBs in size to store the installation files. Browse to where the Windows 7 Image is stored, open
 it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the USB device where you want to have the backup stored to for installation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the USB device has been identified, click the Begin copying button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that’s it, the next step now is to boot your&nbsp;Computer from the thumb drive, make sure the thumb drive you will be installing Windows 7 from is plugged into the USB port. This might vary by manufacturer, but the usual one to try is F12, start your Computer
 and press F12 repeatedly until a screen is displayed giving you the option to boot from a USB Memory device, select that and press Enter on your keyboard.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 will boot as it normally does into the setup environment.</p>

<h2>            Photoshop CC 2015 and constant Blue Screen Security_Kernal_Panics</h2>
                    <p>Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the trial version of Photoshop on my Dell XPS 9550 running Windows 10 Home and get nothing but constant blow outs when launching Photoshop.&nbsp; It works about 5% of the time but more times then not it won't even finish loading or when it does
 load I open a file thinking I am safe and bam - CRASH again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is making me think I should go back to a Mac and just forget Windows 10 and return the Dell.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried re-installing video drivers, and was able to get this to work if I only&nbsp;load PS on my&nbsp; primary monitor designated as 1 but even then it's at best
 25% reliable.&nbsp;&nbsp; All other MS Office Apps, Web Apps etc work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to solve this once and for all?</p>

            <p>Hello Yashwanth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I followed your steps in both turning off starting services as well as uninstalling Photoshop and then re-installing but unfortunately nothing solved the KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILER BSOD error.&nbsp; The funny thing was however that LightRoom did not suffer
 from this same fate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as a last effort, I decided to reset the XPS Laptop and reload Windows and then install Adobe Photoshop from the ground up and then put office back on.&nbsp; I am pleased to report that whatever low level corruption that I am having is now over and PS works
 just perfectly.&nbsp; This solution seemed really drastic but did not know where else to go with this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the your assistance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in development stage and some drivers might not yet be compatible with this version. I would also suggest you to try the following suggestions and let us know if they helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Visit the computer manufacturer/ Graphic card manufacturer's website and download the latest available driver for the computer model you are using. Before you install the latest driver, go to device manager and uninstall the current driver as suggested below.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Right-click on the 'Windows' button in the left bottom of your Desktop and click on 'Device manager'.</li><li>In the list of devices locate the Display adapter installed, right-click to select "Properties".</li><li>In the "General' tab, check for the device status and mention any error messages. if any, in your reply.</li><li>Click on the 'Driver' tab and then click on 'Uninstall' to uninstall the current driver.</li><li>Restart the computer to check if the display works with the built-in driver.</li><li>If not, right click on the latest driver you downloaded, click on 'Properties' and then click on the 'Compatibility' tab. Select 'Run the program in compatibility mode for' - Windows 8 and then try installing the driver. Check if the issue persists.</li></ul>

<p>The cause of this issue is your system time zone.</p>
<p>When you set your system date to increase 1 day, this issue won't happen again. So, the best solution is reinstalling Windows. Before reinstalling Windows, you should set your system date to decrease at least 2 days. During reinstalling Windows, don't connect
 to any network. After reinstalling Windows, don't connect to the Internet immediately, change the default time zone to your time zone then connect to the Internet to update your system time. This issue will be solved and your time is still correct.</p>

            &nbsp;I am confused or stumped about this time zone thing. I have set both my system time in BIOS and in windows to correct region and time zone before connecting to the internet for the first time. And I am still getting ShellExperienceHost.exe crashes on
 a frequent basis. And not only with VPN. But in general use of my desktop pc&nbsp; I agree with Frank that reinstalling is a distasteful option. There has to be a verified solid permanent fix to this issue.

    <title>Switching between tablet and laptop mode on Dell XPS 12. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deem hristov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Switching between tablet and laptop mode on Dell XPS 12.</h2>
                    <p>Originally, while with Windows 8, whenever I flipped my Dell XPS 12 (9Q23) to laptop mode, the screen would rotate to normal (for laptop) and auto-rotate would be disabled, and no soft keyboard would pop up. That was nice, what a laptop would do. Now, with
 8.1, it constantly thinks it's a tablet. (The hardware keyboard and trackpad do work, but the screen auto-rotates and soft keyboard appears when I tap on a text field. I clearly do not need a soft keyboard in this mode). I had the same issue with Windows 8.1
 Preview, it disappeared when I reset ('recycled')&nbsp;the PC.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there a fix to this?</p>

<h2>            How can I play MKV files in my Xbox windows media extender&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have windows 7 64-bit and an Xbox 360. On my PC, I can play MKV blu ray movie files even though they are very large (4 gig). &nbsp;However the MKV files format is too big to put on a USB thumb drive unless it is formatted to NTSC which Xbox does not recognize.
 I have tried playing the MKV files through the Windows Media Center on Xbox put it is too slow. I have used a CAT5 cable link from the PC to Xbox - the movie plays on the Xbox Media Center, but it is very jerky, slow, and there is no sound.
</p>
<p>My question is - is there a way to fix this, or are MKV files just too big for the Xbox too handle, even with a cable-link???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks but sadly, no. </p>
<p>This is no good because it converts files to MP4 which are much lower quality. The beauty of the MKV file is that it is a 1080p high-res movie. I tried this out and it just converted the 4gig&nbsp;MKV file into an 128mg&nbsp;MP4 file of much worse quality.</p>
<p>I have not found a converter yet that can change a MKV file into something playable on the Xbox, but still retains ALL the blu-ray goodness of the original MKV file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does such a converter even exist???</p>

            <p>Thanks, I will try this, although it does sound fiddly.</p>
<p>I've discovered converting MKV to an M2TS file will keep all the blu-ray quality, but unfortunately only some files&nbsp;seem to work on the Xbox extender, others either have no sound or no picture.</p>
<p>If only Xbox would just support MKV, then all these problems would be solved!!!</p>

Hi!
<div><br />
<div>I prefer not to convert files.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Uninstall all alternative codespacks from your pc.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download the official DivX Codec from www.divx.com</div>
<div><br />
<div>Put your .mkv files into the "My Videos" folder</div>
<div><br />
<div>Open Media Center on xbox360</div>
<div><br />
<div>You'll see the .mkv movie&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Annoying &#34;Tap to Set up&#34; popup</h2>
                    <p>While trying to set up my bluetooth headset, I accidentally clicked on another available bluetooth device in my office and, despite cancelling and never connecting to it, I now get an incredibly annoying and relentless "Add a device Tap to set up your XXXXXXXXX"
 pop up every 15 seconds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't work like this and can't figure out how to get Windows to forget that device. &nbsp;I might go buy a Macbook this afternoon. -_-</p>

            <p>Problem solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't even know what device it was so that I could turn it off or anything because it was only identified by the Bluetooth identifier number. &nbsp;There are a number of Bluetooth keyboards and mouses in my office so it could have been anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was eventually able to complete pairing to the device, which allowed me to then fully remove the device from my computer so the problem is now gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
