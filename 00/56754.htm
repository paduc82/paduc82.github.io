    <title>Bluetooth GPS Troubleshooting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth GPS Troubleshooting</h2>
                    Why can my bluetooth GPS unit (i.e. Garmin Glo 2.0) pair with my windows 10 tablet but not communicate any location data to it? This is extremely frustrating! This is an option for IOS and Android! Why can't Windows 10 communicate with the bluetooth GPS.
 I specifically set up my field data collection system in order to streamline my entire process and now it appears, that not only my Garmin GlO bluetooth GPS will not work with a Windows 10 OS, but also that there is NO bluetooth GPS that I will be able to
 use in order to implement the mapping and data collection system I spent a great deal of money and time on to get established on my windows 10 OS tablet. Is there any solution to this because I have already wasted more of my time than it was worth trying to
 fix this scouring the internet for a solution. All the other software companies I am working with I have called but they have been unable to help saying "that the issue has to be fixed on Microsoft's end". This should be something t

    <title>Cant PING Vista from 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dionsmom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant PING Vista from 7</h2>
                    
<p><strong>I am trying to share file and printer.</strong></p>
<p>From my Windows Vista desktop, I can see my Windows 7 laptop under Networks but not the other way around. I already went through the troubleshooting steps provided by Microsoft Support to no avail.</p>
<p>File and Printer sharing on both devices are one, including in my third party firewall. Windows firewall on both computers are off and the port for file and printer has enabled access.</p>
<p>Vista can ping 7 but 7 cant ping Vista. They both have the same workgroup name.</p>
<p>Also, I used to be able to share files and printer until after our gateway was replaced. We still have the same ISP though and brand of Gateway but just a different and newer model (the old one was probably 5 years old).</p>
<p>I hope somebody here would be able to help me. I would truly appreciate it.</p>

<p><em><strong>---------------------<br />

<p><em><strong>The following looks like a long story<strong> (it is only 600 words)</strong></strong></em>.<em><strong> I do not know what the user's overall knowledge is, and what exactly was already done. Thus the info goes through the motions
 of configuring and checking most of the common aspects of Windows OS' LAN features.</strong></em></p>
<p>All aspects should be checked, stating that it<strong> "worked before"</strong> , or perseverating on<strong>"I did Not do any thing</strong> ", is not a way to deal with<strong>current Sharing problems.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>----------------------</strong> </em></p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.</p>

<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>

<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you have Permission and Security issues, check the <strong>following</strong> settings.</strong></p>

I'll tell you how I fixed it.<br />
<br />
1. Make sure you've got Windows set up to show hidden folders.<br />
2. Go to C:\Users\&lt;your account&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar<br />
3. Delete whatever icon you are trying to get rid of. In my case, it was iTunes.<br />
4. Reboot (Logging out and back in may be enough)<br />
5. Click on that pinned taskbar icon, as if you were trying to run it.<br />
6. Answer the prompt that pops up.<br />
<br />
Also, all of the Apple products tend to make their own nonstandard shortcuts that WILL break every single time you update. What I recommend is that when Apple software installs shortcuts, delete them. Make your own the usual way by going to the actual program
 directory and making one from the actual executable.<br />

<h3> artgs  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;The default gateway is not available&#34; and intermittent&#47;no connectivity under Windows 8 and 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Intermittent or no connectivity and the error message '<strong>the default gateway is not available</strong>' obviously plague thousands of
<strong>Windows 8 or 8.1 </strong>users, as a Google search will show you. Questions on how to fix this issue have already been posed several times on the MS community forum - for example
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/wifi-limited-access-errorthe-default-gateway-is/d1d72d67-b0bb-405b-b386-52e096c45978">
here</a> and <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-hardware/usb-port-suddenly-not-recognised-on-windows-vista/4c32b197-823f-44c4-9f23-186dfd373ef0">
here</a> - but have not been answered conclusively. Some solutions fix the problem for some users but for many of us no suggested solution seems to work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here, I'd like to share my experience with other users who face the same persistent problem, in the hope that if many people contribute their own experiences, what they've tried, and with what results, eventually Microsoft will work out a real solution,
 rather than suggest workarounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An important note: the connection was intermittent from the start and suddenly disappeared. That is, my laptop was able to connect to the WLAN network but not to internet via one router (router 1), as part of a network, but was unable to connect to the WLAN
 network at all via my own router (router 2), as the main PC. The router's software notified my that
<strong>the network card (although detected) could not connect to the router</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having tried a host of suggested solutions (see list below), I finally downloaded a piece of freeware called
<em>Complete Internet Repair </em>(version 2.0.0.1490) and tried various options one by one. The option '<strong>Restore the default host files</strong>' miraculously not only restored my connection to the internet via both router 1 and router 2, but also maintained
 the connection stable for at least 48 hours, without the error message 'the default gateway ...'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on the third day, the connection on router 2 disappeared again. What had intervened? Microsoft automatic updates, that's what. The night before, the PC installed a batch of automatic updates - both Windows and Office 2007 ones - and when I next
 switched it on, the internet connection had gone. Neither system restore, nor Complete Internet Repair, nor any of the solutions I'd already tried (see below) resolved the issue. However, Complete Internet Repair managed to restore internet access via router
 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my (utterly frustrating and hugely time-consuming) experience, I note the following key factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Some of Microsoft's automatic updates, either for Windows components or for Office (2007) must seriously interfere with the files, settings, or processes that control connectivity (e.g., some crucial setting may be changed, or some crucial process
 may be stopped).</strong></li><li><strong>The damage to the connection is not reversible via either System Restore or resetting the machine to the factory settings.</strong></li><li><strong>Whether the computer is part of a network or the main PC in the network may make a difference to its ability to connect to the network and/or the internet.</strong></li><li><strong>The router model does not seem to affect connectivity.</strong></li><li><strong>Assigning the IP address manually does not solve the issue.</strong></li><li><strong>Third-party software, such as Complete Internet Repair, may resolve some issues effectively but is unlikely to work for all users.</strong></li><li><strong>Connectivity problems to do with the 'default gateway' under Windows 8 and 8.1 are likely to be caused by a variety of factors. This suggests that the Windows 8/8.1 components that determine connectivity are inherently problematic and weakly designed.</strong></li></ol>

            Thanks for this information I've been trying to solve this issue for months, and I know most of the stuff you listed doesn't work. At this point I think I just want to buy a mac book windows does not seem to be too concerned with this issue. I think the
 internet is pretty vital to using your computer, and my computer use to be a tool to get stuff done but now it takes up time from being productive.

            <p>I fully agree that Microsoft are not doing nearly enough for customer care, which is the strong point of their rival, Apple. Nevertheless, this problem can be solved. It is important to realise that it is most likely a symptom of a range of different causes,
 so there's probably no one-fits-all solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, the freeware <em>Complete Internet Repair </em>(version 2.0.0.1490) did, thankfully, resolve the issue and I've had no problems of connectivity at all ever since.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your problems started once you switched to Windows 8, there's one more thing to try: checking your router settings, which may not work with 64-bit editions of Windows. Your IP should be able to guide you through the process, but you can see the steps
 this involves, more or less, in the screenshot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps some of the people who experience the same frustrating issue.</p>

            <p>Thanks for ur reply and assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked on this stated problem for two weeks everyday, tried every fix I could find listed on the web.</p>
<p>I had been trying to solve it with shorts cut or help from any where. I did finally solve it in my Laptop. It is Toshiba L855, less then a year old came with free update to Win 8.0. I did apply the 8.1 upgrade.</p>
<p>The other Computers on my LAN worked great no problem, Winxp and Vista OS.</p>
<p>I decided to restore my Laptop back to the original out of the box default as it left the factory. I completed the restore and begin to download each of Toshiba recommended updates for 8.1</p>
<p>I had made a list of things, stuff which did not appear to be correct as I was searching for a solution, as I am limited in my background in Computer Knowledge.</p>
<p>I had one item which kept&nbsp;rising to the top in my mind. It was on a setting in "Connect Using"&nbsp;Realtek RTL8723AE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC the update prior to this one under Config at the bottom is "Wireless Mode" It reference IEEE802.11b/g (no "N")
 I checked each time I installed any recommended updates. The Config did not change from the Restore listed and "N" along with IEEE802.11b/g/n. Under Wireless Mode. The Laptop stayed connected during the entire process, which to me was a major success. On the
 very last Recommendation on Toshiba List was the above Realtek RTL8723AE after applying this recommendation. The "Wireless Mode" changed from IEEE 802.11&nbsp;b/g/n/ to "Auto".</p>
<p>I have destroyed my notes but if you are having this problem Check "Connect Using" "Configure"</p>
<p>"Wireless Mode".</p>
<p>I have not been dropped one time since the above.</p>
<p>Thanks all for ur Help.</p>

    <title>Why is there no email, chat, or other communication tool for the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is there no email, chat, or other communication tool for the enforcement team&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, not trying to start trouble here. I received a 24 hour ban, the website says that I cannot appeal it, and (according to regular Xbox Live support) there exists no way to actually contact the enforcement team. For my ban case, I had a teammate in a PvP
 match throw the game on purpose with repeated suicides and then teabag teammates after they were killed, so I called him a bad word over a text and then reported him (and not one of the "7 you can't say on TV" swear words, one of the ones you can say on music
 albums without parental advisories). I also reported that player for "Unsporting Behavior" using the Xbox reporting feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I get a 24 hour communication ban. Sure, I can see that, it's 2019 and everything is offensive now. It's only 24 hours, a slap on the wrist, and a ban I'm not likely to get again (again, not trying to start trouble here, I get it, can't smack talk over
 text anymore). </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the message is still in my inbox, they responded to it with a "we weren't going to win anyway so blah blah", and he's online at this very moment playing with his friends on Xbox Live.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like that deserves some sort of feedback and maybe a somewhat terse sentence or two about how it's silly that people can act like a jerk (really, you censor out the swear word abbreviations 10 year olds use?), but actually calling someone a jerk is
 apparently "crossing the line". </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there doesn't seem to be a way to contact these people. I can maybe understand not having a chat (cuz y'know, who wants to talk to an angry gamer who just got suspended for a month?). However, I do not understand why these people can play God with
 accounts (up to and including permanent ban, which destroys game purchases (if they were purchased online and not on disc) AND cloud saves) without having so much as an email address or even a feedback button. I feel like if a part of the Xbox Live team can
 wipe out your purchases and saves (resulting in the loss of hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars and thousands of hours of non-refundable human life), they should have at least an email address or something. Why is there no way to get a hold of these people
 or any way to deliver feedback to them? </p>

<p>If someone harasses you or you deem they are abusing the system just report that person or block him. Retaliating is subject to enforcement acts.&nbsp;

<p>Well yeah, I understand that now, as I indicated in the post and I did, in fact, report the guy (although reporting for unsporting behavior is basically useless anyway lol. Never seen anyone get banned for that, the guy who reported me was playing when I
 checked last, indicating that he did not get banned for his horrible in-game behavior).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That doesn't help with the "why are these people shielded from the public with no direct line of communication or feedback" question, though.

            Unfortunately that's not really something we can answer on the forums and something that has never been made know. I do think they should go back to the days of using the forums at least, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.&nbsp;

<p>You have got to.be kidding</p>
<p>They would be so busy answrring spammers tyou would never get thru</p>
<p>There is a reason why its controled</p>
<p>One xbox and many other servives use controlled communications like forums or chat</p>
<p>What you are asking is unheard of not to mention wasteful</p>

            The enforcement team can be reached through a case review only when suspension conditions permit this (and that is the only time you need to contact them).

<p>1. If you punched me in the face and then I called you a bad name, a cop is arresting you, not me. Don't use real life law enforcement as an example. They have phone numbers, email addresses, and you can go to a building and talk to them directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. According to the Xbox support person I talked to, they used to have a forum and apparently shut it down. He did not say why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. EVERY other web SERVICE (we pay for this, it's a service) has at LEAST a feedback button. Power with no consumer oversight is absurd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If Unsporting Conduct never gets punished, why even put it in the player reporting system? Reputation doesn't matter and nobody cares about it. Doesn't stop those players from ending up in PvP matchmaking with you. Doesn't mean anything, doesn't affect
 their life at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. The only reason I know who reported me is because activity like this is rare from me and all of my other recent communications are to people I know. The enforcement team doesn't tell you why you got banned, which message did it, or any acknowledgement
 of the context, simply that you got banned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing you said made any sense to me, I'm sorry.&nbsp;</p>

            I have already done that. I cannot appeal the thing and there are no other communication links. If they have full control over whether or not they can receive feedback from us, that's not a legitimate or consistent method of communication. That's a lot
 of power, and it makes me uncomfortable that my account could be closed forever because I utter a swear word and I can't plead my case at all.&nbsp;

<p>Yeah my whole problem is that I don't think they should be the ones who make that call. If enforcement is taken, they should be available to chat about it. I don't pay for ghosts to throw me out of my account without so much as a "here's an email to dispute
 this or leave feedback". Not allowing feedback is not a call they should be able to make.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unsporting behavior falls under the reputation system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is different then the code of conduct system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no where in the code of conduct that say if someone (if the game allows it) can not go and just say kill their teammates in a game. As long as they're not saying anything that would be against the code of conduct then there is nothing that they
 did that would be considered a violation of the code of conduct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now xbox does have a reputation system where people that are reported as being bad sports enough among other things (which are not disclosed by MS) they will get into an avoid me status and will only be matched up when the matchmaking happens with other
 people with the avoid me status. until they work their way out of the avoid me status.</p>

    <title>Taskbar Icons changed to what looks like an expanded box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chatrchic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar Icons changed to what looks like an expanded box</h2>
                    <p>I was on my Dell 2-in-1 laptop, Windows 10, and was trying it in tablet mode and I changed some settings here and there. &nbsp;I didn't like the tablet mode so I switched back to desktop mode and now my taskbar icons change after I open an app. &nbsp;I will post it
 here...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64bb004f-8140-48ce-866f-e5b2b0f2a86a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64bb004f-8140-48ce-866f-e5b2b0f2a86a" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>After clicking the icon to open an app, it now goes to an icon in an expanded box with blue line across the bottom (see open apps above: Display icon; Chrome icons). &nbsp;It didn't use to do that. &nbsp;Before this sudden change, an opened app just showed the icon
 only, with a blue line &nbsp;just under the icon...not an expanded box with a title&nbsp;as shown. &nbsp;If I have a few apps open it spreads the taskbox too far. &nbsp;I hope someone can understand what I'm talking about and can tell me how to get this back to normal.</p>

<p>As you probably suspected, my password issue was user error.&nbsp; I used a "copy and paste" method to enter the random computer generated password issued to me.&nbsp; I wasn't aware the cut and paste process will not work.&nbsp; Entering it manually works fine.&nbsp; BTW,

            <p>The terms <span>32-bit (x86)</span>&nbsp;and <span>
64-bit</span> (x64) refer to the way a computer's 
processor (also called a <span>CPU</span>), handles information. The 64-bit version of
<span>Windows</span> handles large amounts of 
random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You might be attempting to install a 64 bit version of Windows 8 over a 32 bit version of Windows 7. You should use the 32 bit disc instead.

            You probably won't be able to find a compatible replacement.&nbsp; You could confirm this by contacting Microsoft support if you haven't done so already.&nbsp; The problem is that keyboards/mice are matched to transceivers such that if there are two of them in close
 proximity, one won't interfere with the other.&nbsp; Even if you were to find a transceiver, it probably wouldn't work with your keyboard.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><strong><span>Right click</span></strong><span><span>on
<strong><span>Volume Shadow Copy service</span></strong> (VSS) and Check if it is started.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp; If it is stopped select <strong><span>Start</span></strong> or Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check whether you are able to backup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> If you have installed any third party security software, then try to
<strong>disable the Security Software temporarily</strong> and check what happens.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 3:</span></span></strong><span><span>You may also try to<strong> delete the task from the location:</strong><br />

<p>
</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">As Windows 8 came pre-installed, you do not need a product key if you are setting the computer back
 to factory defaults.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">The Windows 8 product key on new machines is now embedded within the machine. It is using the Secure

    <title>System Hung for 40 minutes on &#34;Getting Windows ready&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnptd  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Hung for 40 minutes on &#34;Getting Windows ready&#34;</h2>
                    I finished updating my Lenovo Thinkpad W510 with the 2nd Tuesday updates and doing some other updates to it. I clicked on the shutdown, and all of a sudden I get the "Getting Windows ready .. Don't turn off your computer" message. Since I had just completed
 the installation of the Cumulative Update and other updates (Flash, Defender, Office 2007), there should be nothing to update at this point. Also I have Windows Update configured to not to automatically download and install updates. After 40 minutes of "Getting
 ready" (I did not see the end of it so I am not sure if it actually did more update configurations), my system finally shut down. I have no idea what it was trying to do. Any ideas?<br />

            <p>This PC is using Windows Defender. I do have MBAM but it is the free version, not the resident paid version. I have had Windows 10 on this PC since August 2015 and never saw a problem with any update before. It is as if it thought there was another update
 to process but none existed. There was an update to the Windows Update Servicing Stack this week (KB3199209). I had no problem with that although it did not require a reboot. Maybe MS was aware of some issue with Windows Update.</p>

<h3> wujek fester  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lockscreen wallpaper &#40;windows spotlight&#41; on desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hi. At the beginning, im sorry for my English. I will try to explain all that I want to do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has great feature for lock screen. Pictures are automatically changing.&nbsp;It's called Windows Spotlight.&nbsp;I&nbsp;love that feature and my question is: Is there any ability to set that feature&nbsp;for&nbsp;desktop wallpaper? I mean when picture on lock screen&nbsp;will
 change, desktop wallpaper will change and be the same as lock screen. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If U don't understand just ask, I will try to write it again, better.</p>

    <title>Disk Fragmenter leaves 11 percent fragmentation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gwb_t  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Fragmenter leaves 11 percent fragmentation</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading from Windows 8 to 8.1, disk fragmentation of C:\ leaves 11% fragmentation.&nbsp; Consequently, the Windows defragmenter will run three or&nbsp;more times within 24 hours attempting to reduce fragmentation below 10%.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have run Chkdsk, SFC /Scannow, Drive error checking, and cleaned up extraneous files.&nbsp; Even ran defrag from the Administrator's command prompt.&nbsp; Defragmenter still reports 11% fragmentation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am aware of third party defragmentation programs, some with excellent reputations, but my goal is for the Windows 8.1 defragmenter to do its job.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>C:\ has a small recovery partition (0% fragmented), the system partition and 250MB of unallocated space.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

<p>LOL!&nbsp; No need to schedule optimization.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 has an evil genius of its own.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this rate my HDD will wear out and I'll have the opportunity to test ShadowProtect on the replacement.&nbsp; :-)</p>

<p><span>Hello sfmitch,</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you format the drive once and check if you are still prompted to format the drive. If there are bad sectors found on your drive, you will be prompted to format
 the drive. </span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also try to format the drive from the Disk Management.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click on start and type Diskmgmt.msc in the search field after connecting your thumb drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Select your Thumb drive volume, right-click and then click Format.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. To format the volume with the default settings, in the Format dialog box, click OK, and then click OK again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,<br />

<p>Some users have had success by deleting the game, downloading a demo the same size as the game, then download the game again, the reason for the demo is the hard drive may have a corrupt sector which is causing your game to crash, so downloading a demo would
 put the demo in the same place as where your game was. Then when you download your game again, it puts it in a different place on the drive and hopefully fixing your problem.</p>

            <p>This is a real guessing game. Here's my shot:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have a Microsoft Account</li><li>You were invited to add an alternate email address to which security codes and notifications could be sent.</li><li>You created a new account at <a href="https://signup.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">signup.live.com</a> and added its address to your primary Microsoft Account.</li><li>You've since forgotten this alternate email address.</li></ol>
<p>If this is anything like the true situation, start an InPrivate session in Internet Explorer (open IE and press Ctrl-Shift-P). Copy this URL into the address bar:
<strong>https://account.live.com/ManageAssocIds</strong> and sign in with your primary Microsoft Account. This will show you a list of the email addresses associated with that account.</p>

<h2>            Is slim drivers approved by microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    Is slim drivers approved by Microsoft? I purchased it yesterday and I am being told my license number is outdated. What do I do? How do I get help?

            <p>Slim Driver by slimwareutilities.com might be advertised with a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner sign which tells nothing about the quality about the product itself.</p>
<p>You have to discuss your licence number problem with them and/or you can ask here:
