</p><p>Let us isolate the issue by answering the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you referring to Lock screen under Settings?</li><li>When you say it's getting back to default, is that the phone default lock screen?</li></ul>

<p>Just for info - I am running Office 2016 Pro PLus on an Insider at 17133.1 and the same on a herd of Public Build at 17133.1, without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running W10 Enterprise on a public build&nbsp; with Office 2016 Pro + and after an update in fall 2017, Office 2016 would simply not load.&nbsp; If I re-installed Office 2016 and kept updates to about Sept 2017, Office was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After playing around to about 1 month ago, I solved this issue by removing W10 Enterprise and moving to W10 Pro.&nbsp; Was it an Enterprise issue, don't know.&nbsp; Also, when I moved from Enterprise to Pro, I started off with a new and blank SDD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you are having this same issue.&nbsp; When you re-install Office 2016, you are likely installing an outdated edition which may work.&nbsp; However, once it updates to current, the issue may come back.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what your issue is.&nbsp; Perhaps a clean install of W10 will do the trick.</p>

            Hi Gohan,<br />
<br />
<span>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.</span><br />
<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would like to let you know that the main difference between the 32-bit versions of Windows and the 64-bit versions of Windows relate to memory accessibility, memory management, and enhanced security features.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The terms <span><strong>32-bit</strong> and
<strong>64-bit</strong> refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a <strong>
CPU</strong>), handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you're using a 32-bit version of Windows, the amount of usable memory might be less than the total amount of memory installed. PAE enables 32-bit processors to access more than 4 GB of physical memory on capable versions of
 Windows and is a prerequisite for NX.</span></p>

            Your message says Windows XP, the message header says Windows 7 and neither give the Word version. Windows does not include PDF creation functionality.<br />
<br />
You need Word 2007 SP2 or later to have PDF creation included with Word. With those later versions, you SaveAs PDF format. Word cannot open PDF so the document remains on screen as a Word document, but the PDF version is stored where you have asked to save
 it. You will need Adobe Reader or Acrobat to open the PDF.<br />
<br />
If you have an earlier Word version you will need a third party PDF creation tool (PrimoPDF works well and is a free docwnload) and you 'print' the document to the PDF driver.<br />

<p>The older Nokias had this option and it was removed recently from the newer models for the reasons you mentioned. You are not likely to see it included in future firmware updates as everyday more and more countries are adopting this law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are however ways you can disable it. You can find them by googling it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>actually the phone is not really that good as it seems.Firstly, the camera sound cannot be off due to some reason,next the volume of the music player is not that loud as older phones.Also the phone music player is not user friendly.This is how i think about
 the phone,so don't really let this get into your consideration of buying this phone</p>

<p>we have bought two of these phones and are quite impressed with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if the sound is not loud enough on 100% then your going deaf, plus by law they had to limit the db to a certain level,get over it and move on...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the music player is fine, like all things new it takes time to get used to it,again get over it and move on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and as for the camera sound, so what, i like to know that the photo has been taken..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>all in all i give this phone 9 out of 10 so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it could of come with more free games....</p>

    <title>HOTMAIL PROBLEM - SECURITY CERTIFICATE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> onetrex  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOTMAIL PROBLEM - SECURITY CERTIFICATE</h2>
                    <p>Hotmail with Firefox, Windows 7. I am using ESET NOD32 and Malwarebytes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, I got - for the first time ever - a whole bunch of security popups. Now, for some reason, every time I try to log onto Hotmail (and the account has been problem-free for years), when I try to log into Hotmail, I get a message, "Secure Connection
 Failed. An error occurred during a connection to outlook.live.com. SSL peer cannot verify your certificate. Error code: SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_ALERT".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a laptop, running off a modem (one month old and no previous issues). Oddly, my iPad has no trouble getting or sending with Hotmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions, please?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for the inconvenience you're facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is already aware of the issue and is working to fix it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check the service status by taking a look at this page:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you could try to open Outlook.com using another browser, such as Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Safari, ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alby</p>

<p>Outlook/Hotmail with Firefox, Windows 8. I am also using ESET NOD32.</p>
<p>Exactly as described in the original post. It was probably the Saturday 29th May, numerous security pop-ups and&nbsp; I am now unable to log into Hotmail/Outlook and get the Error Code: SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_ALERT.</p>
<p>Tried a number of things but in the light of the response will wait until there is a fix at Microsoft as this is clearly not a problem specific to me.</p>

<p>I logged in this morning and still got the same issue as before when trying to connect to Outlook through Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Managed to overcome it by refreshing Firefox so guess it was a case of renewing the certificate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Firefox, top right of page there is a series of vertical - dashes that is the Menu Button</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on that and in the bottom right is a ? (Opens Help Menu)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select "Troubleshooting Menu" from the list</p>
<p>
</p><p>Top right is a box with title "Give Firefox a Tune Up" and under is box to "Refresh Firefox"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hit that button, follow any instructions and the SSL certificate issue was solved and I can now connect to Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

                    <p>When I bought a Zune Subscription and added a credit card to my Zune&nbsp;account, I was not asked to enter my credit card's 3-digit security code. However,&nbsp;when I try to buy points, I get asked for&nbsp;my credit card's&nbsp;CVV or CVC&nbsp;then it errors out telling me to
 contact my provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked and double-checked all of my profile information across Live ID, Xbox Live and profiles to ensure EVERYTHING matches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This appears to be an internal Zune billing issue.</p>

<p>What is the resolution to this so I can buy points?</p>

<p>I know plenty of people with Windows Phones and Zune who can use their personal credit cards to buy points and have not been asked to enter a security code.</p>

            <p>Hi sassypookie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From where are you to trying to purchase the Microsoft Points? Can you try purchasing them from the Xbox wesbite (<a href="http://www.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com</a>) as they are the same points used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I would suggest contacting Zune support through live chat and they will be able to check your account. You can start&nbsp;a chat from the following help pages:</p>

    <title>Is Windows 10 still vulnerable to WannaCry Ransomware&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianstevenmancera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is Windows 10 still vulnerable to WannaCry Ransomware&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I saw so many YouTuber playing and capturing this Ransomware for educational purposes, but what surprises me is
<strong>they're infecting it on Windows 10 </strong>(not on old OS that's said ONLY vulnerable to WannaCry Ransomware)
<strong>and it did work.</strong> I thought Windows 8 to 10 is supposed to be safe from this exploit bc Microsoft already built a said protection introduced since Windows 8? I'm super concerned about that since my PC runs Windows 10, I thought I was safe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I wanna know how this spread on said "PC's connected on the same network" I can't see any YouTube video showcasing that yet, just a single PC showing how it will be infected, I wanna know how fast it will spread or bury on your unprotected OS? Bc I
 just heard that the Ransomware is already spreading like crazy on our town, even affected government agencies? Could that Ransomware travels on a IP network, and it will just take time to reach me? Also I wanna know how this will be blocked even by Windows
 Defender itself? Or even any other antivirus? Is Windows Defender or Antivirus alone make my PC safe about this?&nbsp;It would be helpful if you can step by step tell me the scenario since I wanna be informed about this?</p>

    <title>Sync contacts from Admin Center to Outlook and to Cellphone device - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sync contacts from Admin Center to Outlook and to Cellphone device</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a number of users and contacts that are created in our Microsoft 365 admin center. We want them to be in the contact list of every user, but even if in the contact page it says that contacts created here we be seen and used by all the members of
 the organization, we can't see them in our contact in Outlook or cellphone. Also, we want all the users created to appear in the contact list of everyone. Since it's not working, we have to send to every members a spreadsheet with the information of each member
 of the organization... Finally, we want to have a contact list with the name of our company, but not to send an email to everyone, just to be easier to find on cellphone (to select one or multiple contact on the list). For example, we could have a list called
 "Organization", "Supplier" and "Customer".</p>
<p>I know we can do this individually, but we would like to create it for every member and manage it from the Admin Center.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>When I choose "All Contacts", it does show our contacts listed in the Admin Center and if I choose "All Users", I can get the other list I was searching for. So this solve my first problem. My remaining question about this is how long does it take to synch?
 I did some update around 6 hours ago and they still don't appear in Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, since we can't access that fonctionnality on mobile device, do you have any suggestion to solve this issue? We have a lot of people that are almost entirely on the road, so they are using only their mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Your question might be better answered by turning it around to read "what Nokia phones is OVI compatible with?" The answer is 0. Ovi is garbage software that should be withdrawn and trashed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drones at Nokia have completely gone to sleep on this and are not responding to posts. Try going back to the main thread of this forum, scan the posts and attempt to find any satisfied OVI users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankly, I am really **bleep** off with Nokia and I am just here to cane them until my contract runs out and I can move to a competent maker without having to pay an arm and leg to walk. Until then I have a mobile that functions only as a telephone. Not
 good enough Nokia!!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you trying to to fine-tune default programs based on the file type or protocol? You can do this based on the file type or protocol. For example, you can have all .jpg image files open using one app, and .bmp image files open using a different app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply&nbsp;for any further queries on this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>There are two defaults for a jpg file:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Edit option pops up in Windows after right-clicking a file type in Windows Explorer. Windows associated one software program that can be used to edit that file type. For image files it is usually Microsoft Paint while text documents are usually opened
 in Notepad. Those applications are set in the Windows Registry where they can be changed so that Edit will open a different application.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is actually pretty easy to change the default edit application in Windows to another one providing you got the location in the Registry to do so. Now, to change the default Edit application open the Windows Registry by pressing [Windows R], typing [regedit]
 and hitting [enter]. Locate the following Registry key:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\SystemFileAssociations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In there you find all the different file types and they association. The order is filetype &gt; shell &gt; edit &gt; command. Not every filetype has that chain but the most common ones do. To edit the default text editor in Windows you need to locate the text subkey
 and follow the path mentioned above until you reach the command key. There should be only one Default entry in there:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>%SystemRoot%\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE %1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To change the program that opens when clicking on the Edit option in the right-click menu simply change the path so that it leads to the application that you want to use, for example</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"c:\program files\notepad++\notepad++.exe" "%1"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the case with editing the file extension, or should i say verbs (open, print, edit, custom, ...)<span>&nbsp;
</span>You should be able to get what you want be doing this.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>(the following changes .txt to be "EDIT"ed with my desired program)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>1.) Open Regedit</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>2.) Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\SystemFileAssociations\.txt</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>3.) on the ".txt" key add new key "shell"</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>4.) on the "shell" key add a new key "edit"</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>5.) on the "edit" key add a new key "command"</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>6.) Select the "command" node you should see the "(default)" string value on the right side, double click or select and press enter.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>7.) Should now be in the "Edit String" dialog box,<span>&nbsp; </span>
and set the value to the program desire with %1.</p>

<p>In Outlook 2013, one of my main workflow approaches for email management was to sort email by categories, perform a search, and then categorize my email.</p>
<p>In Outlook 2016 this is not possible because category colors do not display in search results.</p>

<p>hi anthony,</p>
<p>thanks for the screenshots. when you click the search box, you can select a scope option on the left side of the ribbon. once you decide your scope, you can then
<strong>refine</strong> your search further by selecting an option such as (<strong>categorized</strong>: choose a category to see all the messages that you’ve flagged with a specific category).</p>
<p>for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/find-a-message-with-instant-search-56c08e23-8035-4ce9-99f3-ca444848a99c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
find a message with instant search</a></p>
<p>here is the screenshot for your reference (in this example, i have searched word “microsoft” with choosing “<strong>any category</strong>” under
<strong>categorized</strong> refine option): <br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b57fe69a-4c64-4543-b3db-f3c9659dae99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db57fe69a-4c64-4543-b3db-f3c9659dae99" /></a>&nbsp;<br />
if you still have any problem, then please provide us with a screenshot about the result including outlook 2016 client version for further analysis.</p>

<p>This workaround however does not address the issue of the categories not showing at all when you do a search. I want to be able to search in Outlook and see the items with a particular word in the subject line and also see if they have been categorized or
 not. This way I know if they have been addressed yet.</p>

    <title>Home&#47;Pro Activation Issues &#38; Restore Point Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnqpublique  say:</h3>
<h2>            Home&#47;Pro Activation Issues &#38; Restore Point Issue</h2>
                    <p>Used my Sony Vaio Flip Laptop to try out Windows 10 Insider. Loved it and was on the fast ring for two plus months. I didn't think it a big issue when I went Insider 10 and it upgraded from 8.1 Pro to 10 Home. I figured when the RTM came to market I would
 be able to enter my 8.1 Pro license activation code and all would be honkey dorey. That didn't happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make matters worse, two days ago I wanted to follow a tree of choices in the recently issued RTM Windows 10 on the Vaio and view the restore points. I clicked one to many times and now have reverted back to the Preview/Insider edition 10166.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Now I have two issues:</p>
<p>How do I get back to the RTM Windows 10 not a preview (Build 10166)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get back my Windows Pro version status? I still have the activation code (and Micorsoft Store receipt) for 8.1 Pro Upgrade that I paid $99 for 15 or so months ago? &nbsp;I use bitlocker and Hyper-V a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update on 8/5/2015:</p>
<p>To further the mess I have downloaded the 8.1 onto a thumb drive, obtained the OEM 8.1 activation key from BIOS and tried to reinstall 8.1 with the intent of then upgrading to 8.1 Pro with my key and then leapfrog into Windows 10 Pro. Guess what? The 8.1
 (not the Pro upgrade, just basic 8.1) install stops on either route (keep files/programs or overwrite everything) because it says the drive is bitlocker encrypted!! I cannot decrypt/suspend bitlocker because I only have Windows 10 Home! It is not letting me
 overwrite the main partition because it says it is encrypted. &nbsp;So I can't downgrade and can't upgrade. I am stuck in limbo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This scenario is not getting better. I absolutely refuse to BUY something I already have and paid for. This has turned into a complete sh**show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Fat Fingers</p>
<p />

            <p>if you bitlockered your drive then installed the&nbsp;refresh then yes it wont work properly</p>
<p>unless you're willing to start fresh </p>
<p>before you do backup your files and third party setups</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you created the recovery media when you first got your pc stick it in and boot to it and perform a factory reset</p>
<p>then upgrade to 8.1 pro go to control panel then add features to 8.1 then select I already have a key using your pro key you purchased and let it add the features</p>
<p>
</p><p>once back to pro install windows 10 upgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>second option </p>
<p>boot to bios options to see if your bios is uefi compatible</p>
<p>reboot </p>
<p>insert the windows 8.1 media if you purchased it at a store and boot to it</p>
<p>
</p><p>let it load to the initial welcome screen</p>
<p>press left shift and f-10 at same time</p>
<p>this will open a command prompt</p>
<p>type "diskpart" without the quotes press enter</p>
<p>let it load</p>
<p>then type "list disk" without quotes press enter</p>
<p>usually there is only one disk but if you have more than one it will list all of them</p>
<p>disk 0 would be the main drive </p>
<p>disk&nbsp;1 could be another hard drive or usb disk</p>
<p>
</p><p>type select disk 0 press enter</p>
<p>note: disk 0 is the main drive</p>
<p>itll say disk 0 is now selected</p>
<p>type "clean" without quotes and press enter</p>
<p>this will remove all partitions and boot settings from the drive including bitlocker I believe</p>
<p>for a low level clean type "clean all" this will take a while depending on hdd</p>
<p>
</p><p>no heres the tricky part </p>
<p>
</p><p>if your bios is uefi comptable </p>
<p>type "convert gpt" without quotes and press enter</p>
<p>the gpt along with uefi lets you have more then 4 partitions on one drive within windows</p>
<p>type "exit" without quotes press enter</p>
<p>then close the cmd prompt </p>
<p>reboot to the windows 8.1 install disk and install windows on the freshly clean hdd</p>
<p>then do the upgrade routine to 8.1 pro then install windows 10 upgrade </p>
<p>
</p><p>if your bios isn't uefi compatible </p>
<p>after you type clean in diskpart just reboot to install disk and install windows
</p>
<p>hope this helps ya</p>

<p>if you have a usb flash drive itll prepare one for you</p>
<p>if you want to make an iso it'll download it for you</p>
<p>
</p><p>to get pro back there is an option you can do</p>

<p>open notepad</p>

<p>if successful insert freshly create usb or dvd</p>
<p>let it load then choose either pro or home in the steps it gives you</p>
<p>once installed upgrade to windows 10 release from the top link in this post</p>
<p>you'll retain the insider option of fast or slow track</p>
<p>
</p><p>if this helps I'm glad if not there's better tutorials out there</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>if you no longer have or even had to 10166 iso you'll have to save all your important third party program setups and files</p>
<p>then perform a factory recovery with original pc os then upgrade to win 8.1 pro then upgrade to win 10 release</p>
<p>
</p><p>once upgraded back to 10 pro you'll loose the insider status but can rejoin it in the win 10 updates advanced section</p>

<p>From the Outlook version you mentioned above, it's released in Semi-annual Channel. Based on my checking, the Focused Inbox feature shows well in
convert this channel to Monthly Channel</a> for normal usage. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists in Monthly Channel, Please let the users reopen the Outlook 2016 &gt; click
Show Focused Inbox</span> button is selected. For detailed information, please see:

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Office Pro - How to delete Data Files</h2>
                    I removed some emails accounts from outlook using Mail. However, the Data Files still remain.When I go to Data Files tab within Mail and try to Remove, it says that I have to go back to Email tab and delete account. But the account is not there! So then
 I go to the data file location and delete using Windows Explorer. It deletes the file, yet it re-appears again! How can I get around this? I have already done a repair and reinstall.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I tried 3 ways:</p>
<p>1) Through Mail (Microsoft Outlook 2016) (32 Bit App)</p>
<p>2) Through Outlook 2016</p>
<p>3) Full Online Repair of Microsoft Office Professional 2016</p>
<p>I did not get an error message while trying to delete the data files. All that happened was that it reappeared in the File location.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try your suggestion, but the same effect happened. (My first attempt). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 2: In the Outlook Application itself, the email account was not listed and successfully removed (<strong>File-&gt; Account Settings-&gt; Email Accounts</strong>). However, when I added a new email account (previously deleted)&nbsp; (<strong>File-&gt; Account Settings-&gt;
 Email Accounts-&gt; New</strong>), it created a new duplicate Outlook Data File. No big deal; however, it only worked on Outlook Email Account. Gmail, Icloud, AOL , Yahoo Accounts would not sync any more. It would state an error message referencing that the Outgoing
 Mail Server was not responding (I did not keep a copy of the error message). </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did a full uninstall of the Microsoft Office Professional 2016 and Deleted the Mail Profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I reverted to using Microsoft Office Professional 2013 and it is now working. I think I will wait until the bugs are worked out on 2016 before upgrading again.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform the following methods and check if this helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run Internet Explorer performance troubleshooter. Follow the steps below and check if this helps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the ‘Windows + W’ key on the keyboard.</li><li>Type troubleshooter in the search box and then press enter.</li><li>Click on Programs and then on ‘Internet Explorer Performance’.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> <span>Disable Auto Refresh in Internet Explorer by going to:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Tools &gt;&gt; Internet Options &gt;&gt; Security &gt;&gt; Custom Level &gt;&gt; and Disable All Meta Refresh.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Browser add-ons also cause performance problems. </p>
<p>Browser add-ons are programs, such as multimedia add-ons, search bars, or other programs that usually appear on your browser's toolbar. Many browser add-ons can add to a rich browsing experience, offering multimedia or specialized document viewing. However,
 some add-ons can slow your Internet connection. If you suspect that add-ons are causing slow performance, try starting Internet Explorer in Add-ons disabled mode. Add-ons are disabled only for the session, but if you find your performance improves, you can
 use Manage Add-ons to turn them off permanently. Refer to the link below and check if this helps:</p>
<p>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</p>

            Actually, if you click the "None" option (for numbering in the Modify Style dialog box) and then click OK, you will get rid of the numbering. This works even if "None" is already is selected (and it is, as you have noticed).

    <title>Spam Filtering in a Hybrid Mail enviroment - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas.griffiths  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spam Filtering in a Hybrid Mail enviroment</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently our organisation is setup in a Hybrid Environment with Office 365, &nbsp;Most of our users mailboxes are still On-Prem &nbsp;Exchange 2010 SP2 without spam protection. &nbsp;(Forefront Protection for Exchange 2010 expired)</p>
<p>I have migrated 4 of our 280 users to O365 to test the online Spam filtering</p>
<p>The 4 Test users I have successfully migrated across to O365 are still receiving alot of Spam email in their Inbox.</p>
<p>We are setup with a <strong>Hybrid Mail Flow Inbound Connector: &nbsp;From</strong> = Your organization's email server
<strong>To</strong> = Office 365</p>
<p>I have checked our external DNS records for "<strong>company.com"</strong> and noticed we are missing several recommended DNS entries</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TXT Value</strong> = v:spfl include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all </li><li><strong>MX Record&nbsp;</strong>= company-com.mail.protection.outlook.com </li></ul>
<p>I think this maybe because of the Hybrid enviroment, but am concerned this may have a negative effect on Spam filtering.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>Thomas.</p>

<p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>The SPF record is used for the recipients side, which they can use the record to validate the sender. So it should not be related.</p>
<p>For the MX record part, if it’s pointed to the on-premises, all the messages will be filtered by the on-premises first. Messages to Office 365 will be routed to Exchange Online via the hybrid connector. In this way, EOP won’t take much actions about the
 messages but only the basic features like transport rules will apply to these messages. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to filter all the inbound messages from Internet using EOP, we can point the MX record to Office 365 to take the advantages. In this way, all the messages will be filtered by EOP first, then will be delivered to recipients based on the their
 mailbox data hosting locations.&nbsp;</p>

            Neiher Windows 10 nor Outlook.com ever add anything to the outgoing mail. If you see **SPAM** being added, then it's being done by an external program, like an "internet security" program on your PC or that of the recipient.

            I don't see how this has anything to do with the issue. The OP is talking about *outgoing* mail getting "SPAM" added to the subject, not actual incoming junk mail.

            Thanks Brian you are correct it is outgoing only now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have sent collected log to our antivirus people and am waiting to hear back from them.

            One solution would be to stop scanning mail. You don't need it, particularly for outgoing mail. There;s no way an AV program can stop viruses in outgoing mail because if you were infected and the AV program could detect it, it would have even before you
 sent the mail.
