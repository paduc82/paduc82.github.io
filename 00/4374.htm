<h2>            PlayStation email</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>So i have a playstation account registered to a email i cannot get into.</p>
<p>i know the email and password but when i try login it says:someone else has been using your account.</p>
<p>so then it tells me i can recover it either by texting me a code to a number or using the backup email address.</p>
<p>now the problem is i put a fake phone number and i dont have access to it. The second problem is i dont know the password to the backup email and i dont know the email associated to that email.</p>
<p>so know i am trying to recover it by the form and i have been trying so hard but it keeps denying it and i really want the email back.</p>
<p>the email is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>please is there anything i can do rather than calling microsoft or contacting them.</p>
<p>please i really need the email back to start playing again</p>
<p>or could someone tell microsoft to close *** Email address is removed for privacy *** so i can make it again and recover it like that.</p>
<p>

<br />&gt;&gt; close *** Email address is removed for privacy *** so i can make it again and recover it like that. 
<br />Would take at minimum 5 years before you could "make it again"  Sorry. :( 
<br />
<br />When did you last log into the account? If you don't log in at least once a year, the account is inactive and the only way to recover it is if you have the password - resetting the password wont work.  If you haven't accessed the account in 5 years it will be deleted. 
<br />
<br />If it has been less than 1 year since you last logged in, see

            Unfortunately, using fake information when you register will make it difficult to impossible to recover. Follow all of the steps in the links I posted fail - including the email or char link at the bottom of the article. If they fail, you wont be able to recover. Sorry.

    <title>Constant hardware faults since installing build 10130 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgeogden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constant hardware faults since installing build 10130</h2>
                    <p>Up until build 10130 my machine was working pretty well with only a few random crashes - most were reported and the machine restarted automatically OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since installing&nbsp;build 10130 not a day goes by without a hardware fault - except the days when my machine isn't switch on.</p>
<p>My set up is very basic, a Core 2&nbsp;Due, 8Gb RAM, 3xHDDs, MS keyboard &amp; mouse and only a webcam attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reported this through the&nbsp;feedback app but was wondering if anyone else was having the same issue?</p>
<p>I know a new build is due soon but I'd like&nbsp;to track which component is causing the problem.</p>
<p>I looked at the reports but don't really know what or where to look for clues&nbsp;- any ideas how I can go about this?

                    I spent 1 hour recording my ppt presentation.&nbsp; Played it back and it was fine.&nbsp; Saved the file, and now can't hear it.&nbsp; Very frustating! Will I have to re-record it??

<p>Hi Mrsdonut87,<br />
<br />
We'd suggest you create a new file, record for a short time for testing purpose. After we clarify the issue, we can decide the next step.<br />
<br />
Here is an article for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Record-your-slide-show-in-PowerPoint-2016-or-2011-for-Mac-93e8b4a1-5efb-4f78-903b-62897b8bb14b#ID0EAACAAA=2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Record your slide show in PowerPoint 2016 or 2011 for Mac</a><br />
Notice that the narration is not saved when you save a presentation as a movie (.mov). May I know your file extension?
</p>
<p>If it's still a PPT file, you may also copy it to another machine (Mac or Windows) and check the outcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jim<br />

    <title>Windows 8 Compatibility for Office 2003 vs. Works Suite 2006 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Compatibility for Office 2003 vs. Works Suite 2006</h2>
                    I am going to purchase an older version of Word. I am thinking of either Word 2003 (in Office 2003) or Word 2002 (in Works Suite 2006).
<br />
<br />
I know both will install on this laptop, running Windows 7. But I'd also like to get something that will install on Windows 8 or possibly even 9 (depends when I decided to upgrade this laptop).
<br />
<br />
Now the Windows 8 compatibility page says that the Works Suite 2006 (with Word 2002) will install on Win8; but that Office 2003 won't. Or does it? Evidently individual users are saying that it will (most likely) install. You can see the compatibility pages
 here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft%20Office%202003%20Professional&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;Locale=1033&amp;ModelOrVersion=11&amp;BreadCrumbPath=office%202003&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=win8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft%20Office%202003%20Professional&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;Locale=1033&amp;ModelOrVersion=11&amp;BreadCrumbPath=office%202003&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=win8</a><br />
<br />
and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft%20Works%20Suite%202006&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;Locale=1033&amp;BreadCrumbPath=works%20suite%202006&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=win8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft%20Works%20Suite%202006&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;Locale=1033&amp;BreadCrumbPath=works%20suite%202006&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=win8</a><br />
<br />
Now my question is, why would an older version of Word (2002, as opposed to 2003) install on Windows 8, but not the newer version? Is the installation procedure on Works 2006 so much more advanced, that it will install, but not Office 2003?

            I too asked same question and ended up with no answer.<br />
<br />
It is Microsoft who decides which program is compatible or not, i guess they want people to buy new Office rather than install and use to the old 2003 or 2007.<br />
<br />
Good question but no answer for it. <br />

<h2>            Bug with Copy and Paste in Excel Table</h2>

<p>Just encountered a bug in Excel Table. &nbsp;It's strange that I cannot reproduce the same behavior from scratch, so I put a
<a href="https://wmfexcel.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/bug-on-table.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
animated screenshot </a><a href="https://wmfexcel.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/bug-on-table.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> to demonstrate...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation:</p>
<p>In a big Excel Table, with 20k+ rows and 40+ columns (not really big actually), there are many formulas. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did:</p>
<p>Select the range of cells with formula, Copy and Paste Value</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bug:</p>
<p>The top row of my selection is gone; all the cells below go up by one row. &nbsp;==&gt; My data shift up by one row.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any idea? &nbsp;</p>

 folder (over 100 is my guess) from October 7, 2016 - no idea why. Nothing before that. But there is nothiing in my deleted folder prior to Oct 7, 2016 - maybe all of the things in the deleted folder were permanently deleted automatically because they are 6+
 months old?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the names were often from my contacts before. However, sometimes they are just "unknown" with no name attached. They are often names I recognize, but not always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleted items appear no matter what browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no other email accounts connected to my Outlook.com account. It was originally a Hotmail account dating back to approximately 1993. I do have it accessible on my phone as well (Android) but I rarely use it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No troubleshooting steps at all so far. These are just showing up in my deleted folder without my doing anything. I'm not sure if they are disappearing from my contacts - I haven't double-checked that because I have many many many contacts. Also, the same
 names often show up in the deleted folder, and I don't know why that would be either. They appear over many different dates, so it seems independent of anything I am doing actively with my contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any ideas.&nbsp;</p>

            I was searching for this to, but didn't find a VPN client for N91. I then tried to install some of the other VPN clients for the other N-series phones to see if that would work. One of them say that the SW was not compatible with N91 and refuced to install.
 But the VPN client for N80 installed and I got it working. There is of course no support for this.<br />
<br />
So my advice is that you give the N80 VPN client a try. You can download it from this page
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4149142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4149142</a><br />
<br />
Let me know if that works out for you.<br />

            I have tried installing the N80 VPN client on the N91 but the program doesn't seem to appear anywhere in the menu folders. Installation went through though.
<br />
<br />
I guess if the official VPN client does get released for the N91, the right procedure is to uninstall the old client.
<br />
<br />
simba_uk, let me know if you face the same issue as me. thanks.

<h2>            Got a way to remove inbuit app in asha 311</h2>
                    I have a way to remove the inbuit app.<br />
Just you have to download the same app from Nokia stores which you want to remove.<br />
Now arrange them side by side.<br />
And now delete the app which you downloaded..<br />
When you have deleted the app the RED CROSS sign will come on the inbuit app and now you will be able to remove it..<br />
I have tried it and it worked for me..<br />
Hope it works for you also.<br />
(DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED AFTER DONIG THIS..BUT MY PHONE IS FINE TILL NOW..)

            Well :) this is a pretty old way :D<br />
And I have managed to extract default applications from the ROM of 311. So i don't have any of those pre-installed applications on my phone anymore. No dice, No Gedda, No Nimbuzz, No Angry Birds just nothing.. Even Nokia Browser was removed but is installed
 later on :) :D<br />
<br />
This does not have any side effects :). Just seems the phone is more stable now. Trust me, never hanged even once in the last month :). I have more than 125 MB of internal storage free now :)

I agree the demo games cannot be uninstalled But By this method you can remove gedda headz, dice, memorize, climate, angry birds,ect.<br />
You can find all this app on Nokia stores..<br />

    <title>Outlook 2010 cannot import contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davekoza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 cannot import contacts</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to import a CSV file of contacts exported from my desktop to my laptop. I am following these steps, but get hung on item 6 but there is nothing to select. Contacts is not there, the pane is&nbsp;blank. There is no way to choose a&nbsp;different folder&nbsp;or
 add a new one (like it says in item 6). I have a Contacts tab&nbsp;and there are a few Contacts in it. But I cannot import. Anyone know what's going on?</p>
<ol>
<li>In Outlook, click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Open &amp; Export</strong> &gt; <strong>
Import/Export</strong>. This starts the Import and Export Wizard.</li><li>
<p>Choose <strong>Import from another program or file</strong> and then click <strong>
Next</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fosiprodeusodcspstoa01.blob.core.windows.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f15cdd674-cd7b-492c-8e93-992cfa890f26.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Tip </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are prompted to enter a password and you haven't set a password, click
<strong>Cancel</strong> to move to the next window. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose <strong>Comma Separated Values</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Browse to the .csv file you want to import.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Options</strong>, choose whether to replace duplicates (existing contacts), create duplicate contacts, or not import duplicates.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>Next</strong> and choose the destination folder for your contacts.
<strong>Contacts</strong> should be selected by default, but if it's not, scroll up or down until you find it. You can also choose a different folder, or create a new one.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Make sure the check box next to <strong>Import "MyContacts.csv"</strong> (assuming that's your file name) is selected.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Don't click <strong>Finish</strong> yet, because you'll need to "map" some of the columns in your CSV file to the contact fields in Outlook. Mapping can help the imported contacts turn out just the way you want.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>I have a workbook with one sheet for every week.&nbsp; Within each sheet I need to pull in some information from the prior week.&nbsp; Instead of having to copy and paste every week, I would like to program a formula to just grab the information from the tab to the
 left of the current sheet.</p>
<p>I.E.</p>
<p>Sheet #1 has information in Cells J7 thru J49 that I would like to populate&nbsp;in sheet #2 under cells H7 thru H49.&nbsp; It doesn't matter which week I'm working in - I will always be referencing the same cells in the worksheet to the left of the current one.&nbsp;
 Is there a simple way to do this?</p>

    <title>Outlook.com will only sync GoDaddy Imap domain email once then never - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larry22114  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com will only sync GoDaddy Imap domain email once then never updates beyond the first sync when connecting the GoDaddy account</h2>
                    <p>For the life of me, I'm really frustrated with trying to get Outlook.com to connect to my GoDaddy IMAP domain email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding (and please advise if I have this wrong) is that I go into my outlook.com email account and add a "connected account".&nbsp; I do that, entering in my display name, domain email address, and password and have selected the 2nd radio button (import
 into existing folders), click OK and wait for about 20 minutes while my domain email's Inbox &amp; Sent Items slowly fill the same folders in my outlook.com email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I'm trying to get this to work is when I'm away from home (and my Win10 Home computer running Office 365 Home so therefore Outlook 2016) I need to see my current email on another computer.&nbsp; GoDaddy's webmail is rather lame and doesn't even use
 standard IMAP folder names so mail I write in GoDaddy webmail doesn't populate the same folder that Sent Items record it in when using Outlook 2016.&nbsp; The old Sent, Sent Items, Deleted Items &amp; Trash syndrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could certainly load another one of my 4 remaining installs of Outlook 2016 but I certainly can't leave that on a computer that someone else may step up to while I'm not there.&nbsp; And it appears to me that there's no way to password protect that Outlook
 installation either, which I think is a grave oversight on Microsoft's part.&nbsp; Yeah, I could create a user account on the foreign computer but with other administrative users around am I secure from prying eyes doing that?&nbsp; Even if one can't log into my private
 account on the computer, aren't the .ost files still sitting there under the user account and an admin user could get at them?&nbsp; But I digress...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I connect the domain email account the folders ultimately get populated in my Outlook.com account and that's as far as I get.&nbsp; I can see them in both Outlook 2016 and Outlook.com.&nbsp; Message counts agree with the number of messages from the initial sync.&nbsp;
 I can receive new email in my domain email account's inbox yet they never subsequently sync to the Outlook.com's Inbox.&nbsp; I ONLY get the initial sync and it never syncs after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've moved everything older than 2018 in my domain email account to local storage (an outlook.pst file) on my local machine (I'm using Outlook 2016 as part of Office 365 Home).&nbsp; I did this to create a smaller sync.&nbsp; I also only have email content in just
 my Inbox and Sent Items (all else moved to local storage) again to make the initial sync smaller (and a bit quicker) before I see if syncing will continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been emailing the Outlook.com support team and they won't talk to me directly via chat, or connect with my computer to help visualize my configuration and the problem.&nbsp; And they take roughly 24 hours to respond to each email, so you can imagine how
 slow any help will be from them.&nbsp; I started with them last Wednesday and have received very little information of substance, most of it written in very poor English, yet each reply ends with a promise that they'd really like to help and they're "here" for
 me... what a joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, what else can I describe to help my situation?&nbsp; I'm a heavy email user so my 2018 Inbox has about 7890 items, Sent Items another 700.&nbsp; I can't believe this is "too many items" for Exchange (which is what's hosting the outlook.com account) to handle.&nbsp;
 I started out with quite a bit more and have continually been paring down my inbox and sent items moving them to local storage.&nbsp; Now, as I say, I'm only carrying this year's 2018 items for syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest hard to understand reply from the Outlook.com team advised I had "too many items" yet didn't tell me of any limits.&nbsp; They tried to explain that I need to use the slider in File, Account settings for the Exchange account (this done via Outlook
 2016) to only show 3 months online.&nbsp; Firstly, I find this advice ridiculous because my 3 months of volume might be 100 times the volume of the next person.&nbsp; So, is there a ITEM LIMIT or not, and if so, what is it?&nbsp; I await (probably 24 more hours) for their
 next reply.&nbsp; Does anyone have further knowledge about these sliders for "Mail to Keep Office" in Account Settings and exactly what they do?&nbsp; What happens to an email that is 100 days old when you have it set to 3 months?&nbsp; Does it just go into that grouping
 that you can access at the bottom of your Inbox that says "There are more items in this folder, click here to view more on Microsoft Exchange".&nbsp; Certainly they don't disappear or get discarded in any way?&nbsp; Is that slider only there to filter the view of your
 folders to a shorter period of time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before each new attempt, after having culled my item count yet again thinking it could be limited somehow by item count, I clear the outlook.com Inbox and Sent Items, then, of course purge all of the deleted items.&nbsp; The only thing left before I try yet again
 is about 100 contacts and calendar items but it's not clear to me how to delete those without losing them from my domain account, but I really don't think they're part of this problem.&nbsp; Is it GoDaddy (they tell me no, although they want to sell me Business
 Exchange since they're Microsoft resellers themselves).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this would be appreciated... I've spent countless hours of trial and tribulation and never seem to get past that initial sync and then I'm stuck.&nbsp; Email works fine at that point, from either the domain email or Outlook.com accounts, they just
 never synchronize past the initial time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can your feel my frustration?</p>

<p>when i click address book--tools--options and click custom. i create a personal contact folder named "contact test" and move some of my contacts to the new folder. when i compose a new email and click check names, it will only shows the result in the "contact
 test" and it will not check the names in other contact list. may i know why the issue happens as it shows "check address lists in this order" above the options.

<p>Hi Girac,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do the following to set up Glance screen: </p>
<ul>
<li>From the app list, search and select Settings &gt; Extras &gt; Glance screen.</li><li><span><span>Choose the time the glance screen stays on.</span></span></li><li><span><span>f you've set a background photo as your lock screen, you can set it to appear on your glance screen too. To set a background photo, turn on
</span></span><span><span><strong>Background photo</strong></span></span><span><span>. You can also turn on
</span></span><span><span><strong>Date</strong></span></span> <span><span>, </span>
</span><span><span><strong>Notification icons</strong></span></span><span><span>, and
</span></span><span><span><strong>Detailed app status</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>To change the setting for </span></span><span><span><strong>Night mode</strong></span></span><span><span>, select the color for the text on the glance screen, or choose to hide the glance screen completely for a period of time. Then set the
 time when you want to have night mode on.</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span><strong>Note: </strong></span></span><span><span>Some glance screen settings aren't supported by all Lumia phones.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know how it works.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Calendar and Facebook</h2>
                    <p>I seem to have the opposite situation than others re:Facebook birthdays on my calendar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know how to&nbsp;REMOVE and keep my Facebook friends' birthdays OFF of my calendar. It was pretty easy to do in 7 but I can't find it in 10. The "settings gear" in Calendar is not much or I wasn't looking in the right place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Windwos Media Player will not play MP4 video even though I can play the videos by clicking on them in my Windows Folder</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 and am trying to create a playlist in Windows Media Player to loop two videos.&nbsp; These videos are MP4 videos that I can play by just clicking on them individually in windows folders.&nbsp; However, now that I have moved them to Windows Media
 Player Playlist, they will not play at all.&nbsp; Instead I get a generic error message saying that Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file.&nbsp; What do I need to do to resolve this issue?

<h2>            In ACCESS 2003, Input mask for social security number</h2>
                    I have created a table in Access which asks for a Social Security Number.&nbsp; I used the input mask and had the data saved to include the dashes.&nbsp; I now want to get rid of the dashes.&nbsp; In the Table Design, I eliminated the input mask, but all of the data
 is still giving me the dashes.&nbsp; Any way I can eliminate the dashes, such as an Update Query?

<p>When you select to have the dashes stored, then they are stored. Changing the Input Mask doesn't change the previously stored values. Since this is a one time shot I would just do a Search and Replace on that field replacing the dash with a blank.</p>

            <p>I had this problem on my wife's Dell XPS13 for months. Went to Dell's site and had latest drivers, but the other day when it did it, I opened Device Manager and saw it was disabled. I went to the properties and used the "update driver" option in there, which
 never seemed to find anything new. This time it did, updated, and she hasn't had a problem for 2 days.</p>

<p>1. If you didn't sign&nbsp;in to the account for a year, the account has </p>

                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My business emails are going into Microsofts junk folder. Every other email client such as gmail are going into the inbox folder. Is ther any way of getting on a whitelist for microsoft to change this?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>okay, let's see if I can explain this better: the fact that your emails go to Microsoft's junk folder is due to a spam detection. Email providers detect spam in basically three ways:</p>
<p>1) check spam databases</p>
<p>2) parse the content</p>
<p>3) rely on other users marking that sender as spam</p>
<p>If you're sending emails from the server, and those emails bounce in at least one provider (hotmail, for instance) then it is time to check if the server has been blacklisted.</p>
<p>The fact that gmail doesn't mark the email as spam isn't a good index of anything: one of my shared servers got listed in a spam directory once. I realized this because I replied from one of the server's email addresses to a friend who had previously written
 to me, but that precise email bounced.</p>
<p>If I had listened to gmail, I wouldn't have noticed this: gmail kept displaying the emails from that same server, without any problem, in the inbox folder (not in the spam one) and without any notice (nothing like "this message could be spam").</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Other factors</strong></p>
<p>a) You use HTML in your emails. If you use HTML for pretty emails, keep in mind that HTML is more subject to end up in the spam filter.</p>
<p>b) Your emails aren't opened by the majority of recipients</p>
<p>c) You have "spam" keywords in the text</p>
<p>d) You have too many links in the email, or link to directory with strange names&nbsp;</p>
<p>e) You are sending out promotional content to people who didn't subscribe (that would be spam, in fact)</p>
<p>f) other hypotheses here</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't expect Microsoft to adjust the spam filter... You can adjust your emails and policies (or check if the server is fine) to cope with the filter. If you make a search for "why do my emails end up in the spam filter", you should find some information
 on how to adjust things and get out of the spam filter. Personally I don't send emails from the server, unless it's to confirm a sign up, or with an alert. I've given up newsletters, because nobody reads them (and you end up in the other folder). Hope this
 helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 build 10074 taskbar not functional</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I am running Windows 10 build 10074. I have had this issue since build 10041:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My start menu will not open, Cortana won't either, and the system icons and clock in the notification area won't open. Task view opens fine, and so do the programs that I had pinned to the taskbar. I had solved this in 10061 by running sfc/scannow in the
 command prompt as admin. However, the problem comes back every build, and I have&nbsp;ran&nbsp;sfc&nbsp;in this build, but it does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hmm... Well, first of all let your carrier know your phone is missing so a thief can't use your phone service and such. I've done this before with Verizon Wireless by calling their support number (1-800-VERIZON) and telling them my phone is misplaced.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Got that part done? Good. Now, here's the moment of truth.</p>
<p><strong>Did you enable your setting for "Save my location every few hours for better mapping"?</strong> If you did, great! This is going to make things a lot easier.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From the Microsoft Windows Phone Support page:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>"Save my location every few hours for better mapping.</span> Microsoft can save your phone's location details every few hours so that if your phone is out of range or the battery dies, we can still show your phone's last-known location on a map."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you did, all you need to do now is go to Find My Phone (<a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/my" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/my</a>)&nbsp;and look at the map!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If not, sadly Find My Phone cannot help you... :( Your best bet from here would be to see if your carrier could help somehow with locating your phone, or to just go the old fashioned way and try to remember where you placed it. Good luck! (I personally hate
 losing my phone! Arg!)</p>

            <p>If it is not on, there&nbsp;is no option available Capricorn29.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you feel it was lost and you will not get it back, I advise that you contact you cell provider and have them disable your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More importantly, via a PC, login to your Microsoft account and change the password.&nbsp; That way if some has taken your phone, they will not be able to access your account.&nbsp; If you do find your device then you will be able to add the password easily.</p>
