<h2>            Interactive Packing Lists</h2>
                    <p>I would like to create an Excel spreadsheet that will make a packing list for my shipping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Quickbooks, however the version I have doesn't make it easy</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to have the Packing List portion have a cell that I could put an assembly name into, and then&nbsp;have it populate the adjacent column with its corresponding parts and quantities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Widget. It's made of a box, 4 nuts, and paper. I would like to put quantity in A1, "Widget" in B1, and then C1-C5 the itemized parts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I have 5 different widgets I'd like to do it for... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

            <p>This would be reasonably easy IF all of your assemblies had the same number of itemized parts, but I doubt if it is that simple.</p>
<p>You'd want a master 'catalog' sheet of all assemblies with each laid out as a single row</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Unique ID</td>
<td>part #1</td>
<td>part #2</td>
<td>part #3</td>
<td>part #4</td>
<td>part #5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Widget</td>
<td>clasp A5</td>
<td>hasp B7</td>
<td>hook 4R</td>
<td>Line 3in</td>
<td>Sinker 2LB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gadget</td>
<td>box 2x2x2</td>
<td>hinge 3/4in x 2</td>
<td>#10 Screws x 4</td>
<td>#10 Nuts x 4</td>
<td>Lining - Cloth</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Then over on your Packing list sheet you could put Widget into B1 then </p>
<p>in C1 put = VLOOKUP(B$1,Catalog!$A$1:$F$100,2,False)</p>
<p>in C2 put = VLOOKUP(B$1,Catalog!$A$1:$F$100,3,False)</p>
<p>in C3 put = VLOOKUP(B$1,Catalog!$A$1:$F$100,4,False)</p>
<p>in C4 put = VLOOKUP(B$1,Catalog!$A$1:$F$100,5,False)</p>
<p>in C5 put = VLOOKUP(B$1,Catalog!$A$1:$F$100,6,False)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as I said, it's probably not that easy and it may take a 'macro' solution.&nbsp; First questions to be answered are:</p>
<p>Are there only 5 widgets total, or will there be more in the future?</p>
<p>Does each 'widget' have the same number of component parts to be itemized?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The example formula is set up assuming your Catalog sheet has entries down to row 100 at this time.&nbsp; You could make it 'open-ended' to not worry how many were in the list by changing</p>
<p>Catalog!$A$!1:$F$100</p>
<p>simply</p>
<p>Catalog!$A:$F</p>
<p>Less efficient, but maintenance free.</p>

    <title>Customizing the existing 2010 Symbols menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cool moe z  say:</h3>
<h2>            Customizing the existing 2010 Symbols menu</h2>
                    <p>I need to know if there is a simple UI way to add symbols to the existing Symbol menu on the Insert ribbon. I work in legal and I wold like to teach my users how to add the paragraph and section symbol to that menu if they prefer icons to key strokes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read through the entire thread of Christine's question and i think it goes above and beyond my needs. I do not want fancy extra symbols brought in from another source and I do not want to create a custom group or ribbon. I just want to modify the existing
 choices presented to the users when they open the Insert&gt;Symbol menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it takes a whole lot of code, XML and programming, I will have to forward the information to my integrator, but either way I appreciate your information in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Moe</p>

            It is actually quite simple: the symbols displayed in the Symbol gallery represent the 20 most recently used symbols&nbsp;from the MRU list in the Symbol dialog (there can be more than 20 displayed in the dialog if it has been expanded by dragging). Users just
 need to click More Symbols... and insert the paragraph and section symbols one time, and they will be added to the MRU display and the gallery. They will, of course, be displaced by other, more recently used, symbols, but as long as they use those two often,
 they'll stay in the gallery.

            <p>Thank you Sue. The problem has been that when the users go to More Symbols, the symbol sets at each desktop are different. (Not the same default font on open) During my three days of teaching, I could not even find the correct font that contained the symbols.
 Lucky for me a couple of long-time word processors know the ASCII key strokes to retrieve them. THAT is why I asked the question; so the integrator can modify the menu, add the two symbols and push out the adjustment across the firm network. Not many US attorneys
 and legal staff would think to go to a font called MS Gothic and then to a <em>subset</em> to find a symbol they use all the time. I need to make their life easy and save them from hunting around for it.</p>
<p>By the way - what did you mean when you sais "if it has been expanded by dragging"? I can not expand the many by dragging from any corner or any side.</p>

            The ¶ and § symbols are in the Latin-1 Supplement subset (immediately after the default Latin Basic subset) of almost all "body text" fonts; mainly it's the "symbol" fonts such as Symbol and Wingdings that don't have them. There's no need to go to MS Gothic.<br />
<br />
Suzanne's comment about expanding by dragging refers to the More Symbols dialog, not to the ribbon menu/gallery.<br />
<br />
While you can add symbols to the symbol gallery on a recently-used basis but not permanently, you could create a macro for each symbol, add a custom group to the Insert tab of the ribbon next to the existing Symbols group, and add a button to it for each macro.
 For the paragraph and section symbols, the macros would be<br />
<br />
Sub InsertParagraphMark()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Text = Chr(182)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.MoveRight wdCharacter<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Sub InsertSectionMark()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Text = Chr(167)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.MoveRight wdCharacter<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
For distribution across the firm, the macros would be stored in a separate template, pushed by a login script to the %appdata%\Microsoft\Word\Startup folder of each user (<a href="http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/DistributeMacros.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/DistributeMacros.htm</a>).
 The custom group and its buttons would have to be exported by the integrator to a *.exportedUI file, and the login script would have to place it where it could be imported to each user's profile. Read

            <p>Jay has answered most of your questions. Note that the default setting of the Symbol dialog is "(normal text)," which means whatever font is currently in use. As Jay said, the symbols you want are available in virtually all fonts, and when you insert them
 from "(normal text)," they will match whatever font you're using.</p>
<p>If you're going to type something to insert the symbols, it would make more sense to assign keyboard shortcuts to them through the Customize Keyboard dialog. Or you can type "b6" (without the quotation marks) and press Alt+X to insert the paragraph mark
 and "a7" followed by Alt+X to insert the section symbol.</p>

            <p>Hi Jay, I only mentioned the MS Gothic font because on my machine (not on my client's network) that was the default font set to appear from a Normal.dotm but the symbols were there in my face. When I was at the client site, the default was Symbols, I had
 never used font subsets and I couldn't find the ones needed anywhere. See the confusion? Most office users just want what they want where they expect it to be and when they need it. I would think that the Symbols font would be a perfectly acceptable place
 to have those two highly used symbols myself, but Bill Gates disagrees - as you have pointed out. (We love to hate don't we?&nbsp; :&gt;)</p>
<p>I was hoping to avoid custom ribbons but I can see this would have come up no matter what.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate you sending the code and I will pass it on to the integrator. I have already suggested using a network location for firm templates as they have no third party macro and template tool, so the concepts of "standard template" and "consistent firm
 styles" are foreign to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much,</p>
<p>-Monica</p>

<p>Just started having problems sending emails through outlook over the last week. Have used it for years and already contacted my email provider comcast and they said it is not their issue. The error shows<br />
Task 'mail.comcast.net - Sending' reported error (0x800CCC78) : 'Unable to send the message. Please verify the e-mail address in your account properties.&nbsp; The server responded: 550 5.1.0 Authentication required'</p>
<p>What can be done about this?</p>

    <title>Best Way To Keep Track Of A Bank Account Balance&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best Way To Keep Track Of  A Bank Account Balance&#63;</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I am a total Noob to Access (have 2010) and have chosen to develop a budget database as a learning experience.<br />
<br />
My Plan is to have tables for Accounts, Debit Categories (i.e. Transportation, Rent), Credit Categories (i.e. Interest Income, Consulting Fees) and Transactions.&nbsp; The Transaction table will have&nbsp; fields for Account (Lookup from the Accounts Table), Amount (Dollar
 Value of each transaction (Deposits would be positive numbers and Debits would be negative numbers), Debit Category (Lookup from the Debit Categories Table),&nbsp; and Credit Category (Lookup from the Credit Categories Table).<br />
<br />
One of the things I would like to accomplish with this is to be able to keep track of the balance of each bank account and review transactions for different periods (10 Days, One Month etc.)<br />
<br />
I understand enough to realize that to accomplish this I could filter the Transactions table, in a query or report, for the desired account and then total the Transaction amounts (Amounts Field) to get a current balance.&nbsp; This will however result in a large
 number of transactions over the years, and I am wondering if there is a more efficient method.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It will just be for personal use and I realize that even after a couple of years the number of transactions will not hinder Access in way.&nbsp; I am mostly curious for learning purposes if there is a better, more efficient solution?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can offer.<br />
<br />
A/R<br />

            You sound as though you are by and large on the right track.<br />
<br />
I've maintained my personal accounts in Access for a couple of years now, having previously used Excel.&nbsp; The following is a query used as the RowSource of a form for entering transactions into one of my current accounts (checking accounts in US-speak).<br />
<br />
SELECT Format(DSum("Credit-Debit","CurrentAccounts","AccountNumber = ""12345678""
<br />
And TransactionDate&lt;= #" &amp; Format([TransactionDate],"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "# <br />
And (TransactionID &lt;= " &amp; TransactionID &amp; " Or TransactionDate &lt;&gt; #" &amp; <br />
Format([TransactionDate],"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#)"),"£#,##0.00;(£#,##0.00)") AS Balance, *<br />
FROM CurrentAccounts<br />
WHERE AccountNumber="12345678"<br />
ORDER BY TransactionDate, TransactionID;<br />
<br />
A few points to note:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; The table has separate Credit and Debit columns into each of which values are entered as positive numbers.&nbsp; Each of the two column's Required property is True (Yes) to disallow Nulls and each has a DefaultValue property of 0.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The DSum function is used to compute the balances per transaction.&nbsp; Domain aggregate functions like this are little slow, and a JOIN would be the most efficient way of computing the balances, but this, or the use of a subquery, would make the query non-updatable
 and unsuitable for a data entry form.&nbsp; Using the DSum function on the other hand keeps the query updatable.&nbsp; I've found performance more than satisfactory.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Note how in the criteria expression for the DSum function the primary key TransactionID column is used as a tie breaker where more than one transaction has the same date.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Because the balances are computed on the basis of all rows in the table with the relevant account number, if any restriction of the query by date is applied, or similar filtering of the form, the balances would still be correctly computed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Outlook showing me emails grouped under &#34;Tomorrow&#34; in Preview Pane</h2>
                    <p>This morning, my Outlook preview pane started showing me emails that are grouped under "Tomorrow".&nbsp; I guess this has something to do with the fact that I am in a timezone that is ahead of the US time zone, and somehow the app got it mixed up?&nbsp; No matter
 what I do (changing system timezones etc), the grouping for "Tomorrow" remains.&nbsp; Anyone has the same experience?&nbsp; Any resolutions?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Eng,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This type of issue may have occurred due to the mail server has its time and date set incorrectly. To change the time zone in

<p>Try removing the battery for a couple of minutes and then replace and restart. If that does not work you will probably need to have it checked out at your local Nokia Care Pont.</p>

            Hi Alan,
<br />
<br />Let's see if there is any add-in causing the issue.
<br />
<br />Click on Start &gt; run &gt; outlook /safe
<br />
<br />In Outlook, click File &gt; Manage Add-ins.
<br />
<br />on COM add-ins click on Go
<br />
<br />Un-check all COM add-ins and try one by one until you can see if one of them is causing the issue.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Angel.

    <title>Android Outlook won&#39;t sync with IMAP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jannesalovaara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Android Outlook won&#39;t sync with IMAP</h2>
                    Since the latest update, 2.2.219, outlook hasn't been able to sync with imap servers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've been in contact with the android app tech support which seems to reply once every 24-36 hours and they just keep pushing me through the same loops of do this and do that - and still after 11 days we're in square one.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've force stopped the app, cleared the cache, resetted the accounts, I did the silly MS connection tests which all worked fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I even deleted and re-setup the accounts - which BTW won't all even go back as I keep getting random error codes from 408, 498, 500, 701 to 702. Most of the accounts I got back into the app by just relentlessly clicking okay again and again no matter the error
 messages. And they finally went through. Although, even deleting and after setting them up again, I can't get them to sync any emails I've gotten since 19th of September - the day I updated to this version.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
All of the servers and setups work just fine on my desktop and via webmail. As does the one O365 account I also have setup on my android app. But none of the IMAPs function properly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also Microsoft seems to have flooded the Google Play Store ratings through bogus accounts giving nothing but 5 star reviews, whilst real users are screaming for help with this latest disaster. You can see how around 20th Real people started to ask for help,
 while fake accounts suddenly appeared to rave about its 5-star features.<br />
<br />
Is this the reality of MS? Completely unfunctional apps, outsourced tech support companies that have no clue beyond: have you tried to restart it? And cover-up campaigns for mistakes? Sad.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi JaaneSalovaara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're experiencing a syncing issue right now in Outlook for Android. Just to confirm, what other troubleshooting procedures have you tried aside from the steps you've mentioned above? Also, may I know if you already tried uninstalling
 and reinstalling the application? Since all the servers are working fine on your desktop and webmail, this issue might be on the application itself.
</p>

    <title>How to install Windows 10 TP onto USB thumb drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j. slone  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to install Windows 10 TP onto USB thumb drive</h2>
                    <p>Alright I've already browsed the threads, found a bit of info but for the sake of clarity and doing it right the first time has anyone successfully installed the Win10 TP to a USB thumb drive while using another USB thumb drive as the installation media?
 The SSD in my laptop is just a tad too small to partition and install internally plus I'm in the Middle East for work and don't want to have my computer take a dump on me and then be left without a working machine...step by step instructions or a link to the
 process would be most appreciated!</p>

            Only the Windows 10 Enterprise preview supports this functionality through Windows To Go and you need to have Windows 10 Enterprise installed to accomplish it in addition to having a support USB 3.0 capable Windows To Go drive.

            Hi Michael,
<div><br />
<div>You really haven't given us much information about what you are experiencing with a letterhead... we can only guess.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So my guess is that your letterhead is a template and whatever is in the letterhead template has been placed into the "Header" layer of the document template. If you either double click in the header area on the first page of your document or go to View
 &gt; Header and Footer on the menu bar, you will open the Header layer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now go to View &gt; Toolbox &gt; Formatting Palette to get the Formatting Palette dialog open. On this dialog is a Header and Footer menu button. Selecting it reveals various settings and one of them is for Different First Page.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You probably want to check that box and then go to the page two header of your document and remove the letterhead from that page.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For more information on working with Headers and Footer go to Word &gt; Help &gt; Headers and Footers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

            <p>Hello <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/dde35b3f-3dc5-416f-804e-e1385d55488f">

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community! I understand that you want to know the steps on how you can either change the administrator account of your domain, or add another one to it. Let me guide you on the steps to perform them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that as the domain Administrator, you have the capability to change your administrator account or add another one. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Change an Administrator account for a domain: You should create a new Microsoft account to be used for the domain.</span></b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<div><span>Go to the Domain registrar’s site</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Acquire new MX record for the new LIVE ID</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Update MX record in WLAC</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Original Admin Account should turn False, then the new Admin Account should turn True)</span></div>
</li></ol>
<p><span><strong>How to add an administrator account to&nbsp;your domain:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<div><span>Open your web browser.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Go to <a href="http://domains.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://domains.live.com</a>.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Sign in with the Microsoft account you wish to make an administrator.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Click on <strong>get started</strong>. </span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Enter the domain name you wish to add to. </span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Choose whether to include hotmail service or no mail.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Click on <strong>I Accept</strong>.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>You will receive a new <strong>MX record</strong> or a new <strong>CNAME record</strong> depending on which mail service you chose.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Set the <strong>CNAME</strong> <strong>record</strong> or Add the new <strong>
MX record</strong> to activate the new administrator.</span></div>
</li></ol>
<p><span>I hope this helps. If you have clarifications, feel free to post back for further assistance.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank You.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you're unable to push through changing the administrator of your domain. I also understand that this must be inconvenient for you. Don't worry, let us help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've simulated the same issue on my end and it seems that I have successfully added an administrator. Kindly please confirm if you have an option to
<strong>Continue</strong> when you received the error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you get any error message while accessing IE?</li><li>Have you made any changes on your system prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>Kindly try the methods below and check if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>As an initial troubleshooting step, I suggest you to place your system in a Clean Boot state and check if the same issue occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. Check this issue in clean boot state.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows key + X key.</span></strong> And select <strong>
<span>Run.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Type msconfig in the&nbsp;Run box and hit Enter.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab of the <strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></strong> check box, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Disable all</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the <strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong><span>Open Task Manager</span></strong>. </span></li><li><span>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong><span>Disable</span></strong>. </span></li><li><span>Close Task Manager.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the <strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then restart the computer. </span></li></ol>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The issue may also arise due to the security software installed in your system. So, I would suggest you to temporarily&nbsp;disable the anti-virus installed on your system and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>I also suggest you to install the latest Windows updates and check if this helps</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Update helps keep your computer up to date with the latest system updates and drivers which can resolve the issue you are facing. You can check Windows Update manually to help ensure you have the latest updates.</span></p>

            <p>I speak with few friend who buy licence too and they said they also have different key and they dont have any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently do a online repair install. When I was promted to activate office again I choose to activate via product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I insterted that key and login with MS account. Then office promted that this computer has been added to my account and Office si activated but still I see diferent key in command line.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it isnt solved dont know for sure but looks like Im not only one who discovered that keys are different :/</p>

<br />
Thank you for replying.<br />
<br />
The product key to register and the product key for Office suite are different.<br />
<br />
As mentioned in the following article, you can&nbsp;check for Office product key from the following
<strong>My Account </strong>page on Office.com.<br />
</span><a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/2808266/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/2808266/en-us</span></a><span> (<strong><span>Obtaining
 media (Getting a back-up DVD</span></strong>).<br />
<br />
Provide additional information:<br />
<br />
1) Do you still receive any activation prompt?<br />
<br />
2) What happens when you&nbsp;o</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>pen any Office application then click on
<strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Account </strong>&gt; check in the right section? Does it state '<strong>Product activated</strong>?'<br />
<br />
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I look forward to your reply to assist you further.<br />

            I did this also - my seller gave me&nbsp; a link to the site for entering the product key but I could not find it.&nbsp; I chose another site and this said the same as you.&nbsp; So went back to the email and the original named site and was specifically looking for exactly
 what it said and it worked ... not sure this helps.&nbsp; still a long way into understanding the licence aspect.&nbsp; Did it because it was cheaper.

    <title>Calendar&#47;Contacts stay on phone after Workplace account is removed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chelansimonds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar&#47;Contacts stay on phone after Workplace account is removed</h2>
                    <p>Having an issue with several Windows 8.1 phones where after removing the Workplace account the email is removed but the calendar and contacts associated with that account still stay on the phone. When you look in Settings&gt;Email+Accounts the Workplace account
 is not listed there, so no option to remove it, but once again calendar and contacts remain on the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one phone after about 5 hours the calendar/contacts disappeared automatically. On another phone after waiting 6 hours I had to factory reset the device in order to remove them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main issue is that with the calendar/contacts still on the device, you can enroll in a Workplace account but email will never be pushed to the device unless the original Workplace calendar/contacts remove.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't found a better workaround then waiting hours or factory resetting the device so any insight on this would be very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft office installation problem&#40;s&#41;</h2>
                    My microsoft office installation has been chock full of problems. The bar gets stuck at 94% and slows down my computer. When I restart, I get "something went wrong" messages. My product key cannot be verified because I bought it from a school.
<br />
<br />
This is by far the worst software experience I've had. I suggest microsoft work out all of the bugs completely before releasing anything else. It's unprofessional.
<br />
<br />
My question: where do I go from here?<br />

            <blockquote>My microsoft office installation has been chock full of problems. The bar gets stuck at 94% and slows down my computer. When I restart, I get "something went wrong" messages. My product key cannot be verified because I bought
 it from a school. <br />
<br />
This is by far the worst software experience I've had. I suggest microsoft work out all of the bugs completely before releasing anything else. It's unprofessional.
<br />
<br />
My question: where do I go from here?<br />

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Why is my download playing up!!!</p>

            <p>I also couldn't install on Windows 7 having purchased via iTunes App store. Just get Page cannot be found when I click on Install to Windows 7 from my account. Spent ages on the phone to Microsoft to no avail and have pretty much given up</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shared my subscription with a colleague with Windows 8 and it worked first time&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think &nbsp;so many people have had problems which you cannot fx, you need to set up a web form to refund the cost of purchase.</p>
