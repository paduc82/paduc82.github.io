<h2>            Creating an inactive table for employees</h2>
                    Is there a way in the database that I can create an inactive table for employees and still keep the same records? Or is there a way that once the employee is consider inactive that their information is transferred into an inactive table?

<p>You can do that by running an append query to copy the record from one table to another and&nbsp;then run another query to delete the original record.</p>
<p>But, unless you have a huge number (about&nbsp;a million) of employess and a high percentage of them are inactive,&nbsp;that is not a very good idea. &nbsp;Better is to just add an Inactive&nbsp;field to the emplaoyees table, probably a date field, where you can store the date
 that an employee became inactive.&nbsp; Then you can use a query with the criteria Is Null on the Inactive field for your forms and reports where you only want to display active employees.</p>

<p>As with almost everything Ovi, it's pretty futile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you can find a slightly older (but still fully featured/usable) version of the official Windows Live Messenger S60 client by Googling "windows live mobile nokia e71" and looking carefully ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That same client also works fine on E5-00.</p>

<h2>            Legacy people are being ignored</h2>
                    I think a lot of us legacy people would still prefer Microsoft would give up combining keyboard and mice with touch screen in one OS. Like most businesses, I am a PC person. I do not use devices (other than to make a phone call). But, I suspect the Microsoft
 people have their orders and it's going to be one OS for all. This is unfortunate because those of us who do not have and do not want a touch screen feel put upon by having to work around and accommodate ourselves to an OS that is not aimed at satisfying our
 needs. For goodness sakes, why combine touchscreen and keyboard? Is it a cost issue? Somehow, I doubt it is. I put it down to a mulish insistence that it is going to be one OS come hell or high water. Microsoft, this is not the way to satisfy customers' demands
 and that can only result in loss of good will with a large portion of your customer base.&nbsp; &nbsp;

            <p>Huh</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 is currently highly desktop oriented if anything they have completely nurfed the touch interface they nearly perfected with win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you desktop users had to do was hit one button to go to the desktop on boot up and you could easily ignore the win 8 Start Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with Win 10 it is all desktop and they have removed all the tablet oriented touch feature that made the OS work very well for Tablet's</p>

            <p>I agree, the Charms are greatly missed on my SP3. I actually thought Windows 8.1 was an excellent tablet OS and just needed some refinement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think really in 'Tablet Mode' they will have to look at bringing back the charms for the 'share' and 'print' functions, but instead just add an additional button for the notification / action center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also liked the flyouts bar for Network Connections instead of taking us to settings right away. It was super easy to connect to wireless networks with the flyouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do however think that in 'Desktop Mode' it should switch to the charms being integrated into the title bar as a dropdown menu.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm sorry but Windows 8.1 was great for touch screen and desktop. The 8.1 start screen made for a really good workflow when opening and switching between apps,
<em>especially </em>on mouse and keyboard. Going back to the windows 7 start menu and desktop feel archaic and outdated now in comparison. Most of the people I hear complain about Windows 8 being "only for touchscreen" haven't really used the OS for any significant
 amount of time. Most of the complaints for windows 8 spawned before the release of 8.1, which significantly improved the OS and people never gave it a second chance because it looked similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry but legacy people need to just get with the times...</p>

            <p>I'm sorry ... but it's not about "getting with the times ..." or using what, clearly, YOU like -- it's about designing an interface that provides a real choice between two radically different perspectives of what works best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used BOTH the desktop interface and the Tiles interface ever since Win8 hit the scene and each one has its relative strengths and weaknesses -- and, as has been evidenced by the enormous number of comments on this and other forums, each one has its
 advocates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Microsoft does not appear to "get" (i.e., understand), is that there&nbsp;not a&nbsp;single interface that will satisfy the advocates of both.&nbsp; What they SHOULD have done with Win10 is either (1) give us a choice on installation to pick our default interface,
 or (2) auto-sense what hardware is on the PC, and if touch hardware is there, automatically default to the Tiles interface -- REGARDLESS of the screen size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, with 9879, they came up with a Hybrid Start Menu that neither the desktop nor the Tiles advocates liked -- trying to please BOTH.&nbsp; Now, they've&nbsp; changed course again and come up with a different Start Menu that is clearly oriented toward the Tiles
 folks -- generating almost immediately, forum posts of ways to "return" to the old "Win8-style" Start Menu of previous builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a BIG believer in personal choice -- so what I think MS should do is go back to two very different environments and let the computer USER decide which one they like the best.</p>

            <p>I'm beginning to believe that Microsoft already has there map laid out for Windows 10, and there's no deviation.&nbsp; I say this because of what seems to have happened with the Start Menu with Build 9926.&nbsp; Microsoft has basically said "Thanks for trying it and
 telling us what you think but, like it or not, you're not getting it.&nbsp; Now try this new idea we have."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also think Microsoft is&nbsp;mainly&nbsp;relying on&nbsp;us to debug the new software.&nbsp; They can't possibly try it out on every system configuration that's out there, so let the&nbsp;Windows Insiders help out.</p>

                    <p>Third party software our office uses to populate bookmarks on templates runs into this error after taking the June 2019 Office update:</p>

</p><p>It's been explained to me that the software is geared to reference that assembly so it is compatible with the lowest version of Office that they can support (2007). Normally this is fine as there are redirects in place that would point towards the current
 assembly version for the installed version of Office to use, such as version 15.0.0.0 for 2016/365.</p>

</p><p>The update breaks this redirect path somewhere in the registry, but we haven't been able to discover the exact spot as yet. The current resolution is to run Online Office Repair multiple times until it is corrected finally and if it still hasn't corrected
 after the third time, to do a full uninstall and reinstall Office hoping that'll correct it. We've found the MS Support Office uninstall tool is not a complete clean uninstall and there are some keys under HKCR/TypeLib that it doesn't touch and can leave lasting
 issues until manually corrected, but this is something a bit different.</p>
<p>Everybody in the office is started to get this as they each end up getting an Office update and it's getting more than frustrating. Nobody has bothered saying anything to MS up to this point because they all doubt it will be addressed with a fix for at least
 a month, if at all. Is there a chance a bug fix will be submitted so the following updates won't break the assembly redirects?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Decided to go ahead and post something about it for the community at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR- get that error after June update, spam online repair.<br />

            I think that you may need to contact the third-party software support as the issue only happens when you use the software with Excel 2016.

            This is not helpful as everything was operating properly until the Office update came through and it's only through multiple repairs of OFFICE or other manipulations of Office's installation that it gets corrected, possibly after hours of working on it.

<p>Just as an update to this issue - the application being used that is attempting to populate template documents that use bookmarking is built to be compatible with Office 2007 and up. That means it gets directed at the 12.0.0.0 assembly and then there SHOULD
 be redirect instructions in Windows that tell it instead of using 12.0.0.0, use 15.0.0.0 if using Office 2016/365.&nbsp; The recent monthly updates to Office are causing a link in this chain to BREAK somewhere and is happening to dozens of users around me as they
 get monthly updates rolled out to them. Nothing has changed with the application being used, only the monthly update for Office has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nobody at MS seems to take this seriously though. There should be instructions followed under polices set in C:\Windows\assembly that appear to not be working correctly with recent Office updates.</p>

<p>Found a solution finally.</p>
<p>There's a machine-level policy under C:\Windows\assembly that tells an application that is backwards-compatible with older versions of Office to to be redirected and use the appropriate newer interop assembly associated with the more current version of Office
 that is installed, such as 365.</p>
<p>Copying this policy code and going to the application-level, where the application is installed there may be a config file for the executable (e.g. APPNAME.exe.config) if you open this file in notepad or a visual studio viewer there is likely a section dedicated
 to dependent assembly instructions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add this to the end of that section before it moves on to other instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;dependentAssembly&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;assemblyIdentity name="Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel" publicKeyToken="" culture="neutral" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion="12.0.0.0" newVersion="15.0.0.0" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save the file, launch the program again, test the process to populate an Excel template with bookmarks again. You may see an additional error that is for version 15.0.0.0 and states "access is denied."</p>
<p>Run Office online repair and try it again. Should be resolved.</p>

            Thank you Nathan, this solved my issue with sending emails from our software via Outlook. Changed the name of the interop to Outlook and identified the keys, used your script in our email config file and we're back up and running. We really appreciate

            That sounds like the format is not compatible with the Real Player on the device. &nbsp;Try&nbsp;transferring&nbsp;the videos using PC Suite or Ovi Suite. &nbsp;The Real Player on these devices is very picky and most videos will not play unless it is formated just right.
 &nbsp;I don't believe the Care Center is gonna help you too much with this issue since it is not actually a problem with the phone; it is just how Real wrote their software. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>You can only attach files from your computer to your emails and not emails itself. With emails, you can only forward these emails to other people but not attach them.</p>

            You cannot open an Access app from a CD unless its a CD-RW that has been set up for Read/Write. As I said, the user NEEDs to have Write permissions on the location of the file. You can't write if its not set up for that.

    <title>How to transfer a rows data from sheet 2 to sheet 1 when date entered - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abdulkalamummer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to transfer a rows data from sheet 2 to sheet 1 when date entered is falling in next 24 hrs.</h2>
                    <p>HI</p>
<p>AM NEW USER ON EXCEL WITH ONLY BASICS OF EXCEL.</p>
<p>I have an excel file with 4 sheets in which data is entered for ships arrival and departure with details in separate columns. Sheet 2 is also having the same data but only the ships which are expected to arrive ie. ETA , now when i enter a date &amp; time which
 is coming in the next 24 hours i need those rows to be shifted to sheet 1 with due regards time , i meant to say 1 st will be with closest eta.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially we enter eta's for ship's whose ETA is 4- 14 days and it is stored in the sheet 2. so here i need the system to count the 24 hrs basis from those cells for which the dates are entered and transfer automatically to sheet 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance all.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>To do what you ask would probably require a macro and creating that would not be easy for a new user like yourself.&nbsp; You would probably need to get help to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you probably don't mean that you want the ships moved to sheet 1 when you ENTER the date, but rather when a date in sheet2 becomes within the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An alternative would be to use filtering on sheet 2 when you want to get a view of the next 24 hours.<br />
Assuming the data is arranged in a contiguous table with a row of headings, you can get filter dropdowns added to the heading row:&nbsp; Home &gt; Sort &amp; Filter &gt; Filter</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then create a filter, e.g. </p>
<p>Filter dropdown on date column &gt; Date Filter &gt; Before 19/01/2015 13:53</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another approach would be to use conditional formatting on the date+time field so that the row is highlighted, e.g. in green, if it is within the next 24 hours</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider the options and, if you need further help with your chosen option come back and ask</p>

            <p>Thanks to u bill, good suggestion but unfortunately filtering wont help,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now why? coz the sheet 1 is a shared page for a group of departments&nbsp;</p>
<p>viewing the same as live update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well if you have noticed i have made on more entry of the same file in forum for&nbsp;</p>
<p>easy reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some knowledge but not so hi-tech excel programmer , as you asked in your second line ,i&nbsp;</p>
<p>need those rows fully to be shifted to sheet 1, i use the phrase sheet 1 for understanding.</p>
<p>any way see the attached and if possible please give some idea about macro's or vba codes.</p>
<p>The sheet below is where we enter the forecast-ed ships and the second one below is the main page&nbsp;</p>
<p>which the whole port is viewing.</p>
<p>

            <p>To&nbsp;do what you ASKED for - to move a line from sheet 2 to sheet 1 when you enter it on sheet 2 and its date/time is within 24 hours ahead of the current time: -&nbsp;does not make sense; you might as well enter the row on sheet 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;MEANT - to COPY a line from sheet 2 to sheet 1 when you enter it on sheet 2 and its date/time is within 24 hours ahead of the current time: -&nbsp;that could be done by a Worksheet_Change event procedure in the module behind sheet 2.&nbsp; But it would only
 be sensible to do that if the date/time was the last item you entered on the row; otherwise the row would be copied before the other items had been entered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also doesn't deal with the case that there was a row on sheet 2 which was 2 days ahead when you entered it but you want it copied to sheet 1 in a day's time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would therefore suggest a macro that you would run manually when you want to update sheet 1.</p>
<p>It is critical to know whether you want the information copied or moved from sheet 2 to sheet 1?</p>
<p>If it is to be copied then the macro needs to avoid re-copying rows that it copied before.
<br />
Is VRC a unique number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have reservations about using a shared spreadsheet for this purpose.</p>
<p>If I were starting from scratch I would hold the data in a database (which is designed for shared access to data) and I would provide separate forms for viewing the next 24 hours data and for entering the future arrivals.</p>

            <p>I do not mean to copy the line from one sheet to another,i need that whole row to be moved to sheet 1.</p>
<p>when the date changes to today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the sheet 1 page we have a refresh button which is not visible here, so as soon as refresh is clicked</p>
<p>the updated sheet should show the ships which are expected to arrive today that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It basically means a person watching the live of sheet 1 when he refreshes it regardless of time , whether it be 19/01/2015 12:00:54 or 19/01/2015 18:00:32, the time calculated will be from the time he clicked refresh button. and it should check on sheet
 2 whether any vessels expected on the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on sheet 1 it will show up to 20/01/2015 12:00:54 or 20/01/15 18:00:32.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And VRC is a unique number called Vessel's Record.</p>

<h2>            asha 300 - new update - several SMS bugs not solved yet</h2>
                    
<p>After having updatet my asha 300 I&nbsp;noticed Nokia didn't solve the bug when the mobile is off and you receive SMS. When you turn on your mob the time shown is the time when you turn on your mob and not when&nbsp;the SMS has been sent. Previous S40 mobs (nokia
 6230) worked perfectly why Nokia has these bugs now? Moreover, there's another problem with S40. You are in the middle of the menu, the keyboard self-locks as usual, but if you receive an SMS in this meanwhile, in the display you don't see any advice about
 the NEW MESSAGE INCOMING... Only if you are in the main display menu you can see the advice. WHY????</p>

<p>I don't get one at all, despite settings saying i will.</p>

<p>In outlook 2010, if you make a change to an email account (eg: the display name or the display email address etc..) there is a tickbox on the right hand side titled&nbsp;"Test Account Settings by clicking the Next button" which is always ticked by default.</p>
<p>I need to be able to disable that&nbsp;because&nbsp;I change the display name on my email very regularly as part of my work (software testing) and need to be able to do so quickly without waiting for the test email to be sent and I should not have to untick this box
 everytime..</p>
<p>Does anyone know what registry key controls this setting?</p>

    <title>Controlling Image Width Using DPI in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rhetoric101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controlling Image Width Using DPI in Word 2010</h2>
                    Word does not seem to respect the DPI property of screen shot images I create in my graphics program (SnagIt). In other programs, such as Adobe FrameMaker and MadCap Flare, I can decide ahead of time what size I want my images to be by setting the DPI
 in SnagIt. Then, when I import them, they appear with the width that corresponds to this basic formula: DPI = Pixels / Desired Width.
<br />
<br />
For instance, if I have an image that is 400 pixels wide, and I need it to appear as a 2 inch wide image in my document, I can set the DPI to 200 in my graphics software (200DPI = 400pixels/2").<br />
<br />
In Word, the "100%" option under&nbsp; <b>Size and Position &gt; Scale &gt; Width </b>seems to be 96 DPI. Is there a way I can get Word to simply use the DPI of the image so it displays at the width I'd expect, following the formula of DPI = Pixels / (Desired Width in
 Inches)?<br />

            Try turning off the picture compression in Word. You can also set the the picture resolution for all pictures in a document of your choice. Have a look at this link.

            I'm afraid that compression is not turned on in my Word template, but that was an interesting article.<br />
<br />
I just did some additional tests, and despite what I said earlier, Word does, in fact, respect the DPI settings of screen shots from SnagIt! What led me astray is that I received a GIF image (not a screen shot after all) from a marketing person. This is the
 image that will not change width no matter what DPI setting I use. However, if I take a screen shot of that image, I'm able to adjust its size by changing the DPI!!<br />
<br />
Could there be a property of the GIF that is preventing Word from resizing it when I change the DPI?<br />

            <p>This is Joseph Engel, President and Owner of Engel Land Service, Inc. My land agent, Gary Majors sent the question at 2:08pm on July 11, 2013 at my direction, while I was in Business Meetings.&nbsp; So I called&nbsp;cox cable who is my provider for email,&nbsp;internet
 and business phones and fax machine, plus&nbsp;Cable TV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called cox at about 6pm (CT) and&nbsp;we spoke for almost an hour and got my incoming server and outgoing server fixed and my server account settings are corrected.&nbsp;but
<strong>I am not receiving any emails or send any because when I hit new email there is still no SEND Button.&nbsp; It has vanished into thin air and we could not get it fixed.&nbsp;
</strong>I'm a great&nbsp;end user, but working 12 -14 hours a day 6-7 days a week for the last 5-6 months has taken its toll on me.&nbsp; I stay up&nbsp;pretty late trying to keep up with my client (government&nbsp;entities, land&nbsp;for acquisitions for public use)&nbsp; that has&nbsp;loaded
 me down with 8 huge projects in 2&nbsp;States&nbsp;that we have going on and I guess I&nbsp;was so tired and weak and&nbsp;fogged out I hit some button or did something and tried to repair them myself which I will never let that happen again!&nbsp; That's the&nbsp;real story and I am sticking
 to it!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOW FOR MY QUESTION.&nbsp; THE COX TECH AND I&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;fixed the ingoing and outgoing server and I have and email account back up and running....at least I think so.&nbsp; the Tech said I did. He would know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but still I cannot receive any emails or send emails because there is NO SEND BUTTON, when I hit new email; just to: and from: and cc: &amp; subject and message space.&nbsp; SEND BUTTON TO THE LEFT OF THAT LIKE THERE ALWAYS HAS BEEN IS IN SPACE.&nbsp;I DON'T KNOW WHAT
 I DID, BUT IT AINT THERE!&nbsp; Also, my LEFT SIDE OF SCREEN ON EMAILS, WHEN I PULL IT EMAILS UP: AT THE TOP IS
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (My email) then under that is INBOX then under that is: DRAFTS THEN: SENT ITEMS, THEN: DELETED ITEMS: THEN ALL MY CONTACTS FOLDERS FOR NAMES AND BUSINESSES.&nbsp; IN A-Z ORDER....BUT IT HAS PROBLEMS TOO;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 A LOT OF TIMES ALL THE CONTACTS ARE MIXED UP AND THE FILES INSIDE ARE EITHER GONE OR MOVED TO SOMEONE ELSES CONTACT FOLDER AND IT HAS BECOME A SUBFOLDER.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I HAVE GOT REAL PROBLEMS...I HOPE YOU CAN SHED SOME LIGHT....IF NOT I'LL CALL MICROSOFT AT $6O-80/HR.&nbsp; BEEN THERE DONE THAT!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THANKS,</p>

    <title>Is it possible to reference a sparkline graph to a text string - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> piansa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to reference a sparkline graph to a text string formula&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Well, I know this maybe asking too much hehe.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>I learned about linking a copy of the sparkline graph to the original graph.</span></p>

<p><span>I also learned about using the Evaluate function to make the string formula return what is to be the result of the formula in the form of a string formula.</span></p>

<p><span>So my question now is if it’s possible for that string formula in an Evaluate function (showing the cell address where the original sparkline graph is located) to function as the link.</span></p>

<p><span>Although I’ve tried it for now but it says the reference is not valid.
</span></p>

<p><span>Well, I would just like to check though if this can be done.</span></p>

<p><span>Just wondering.</span></p>

            <p>I don't understand "the address bar of the graph".<br />
Maybe you were trying to create a linked picture in the way I suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't use a formula as the source of a linked picture; it has to be a direct reference to a cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think there is a way to do what you appear to be trying to do - use a formula to create a sparkline in a cell which matches the sparkline in another cell whose address you create as a string.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could however&nbsp;use a macro to change the source of the linked picture - e.g. a Calculate event.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Private Sub Worksheet_Calculate()<br />
&nbsp; Me.Pictures(1).Formula = "=" &amp; Range("L1") &amp; Range("M1")<br />

    <title>Autoarchive error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terradon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autoarchive error</h2>
                    <p>When I try to auto-archive I get an Outlook error popup that says, "Error while archiving folder "Eline" in store "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***". A folder by this name already exists.<br />
A couple of info points:<br />
Eline is a subfolder of the Inbox. Rules are set to move some messages into that folder.<br />
The store "*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is a pop3.<br />
No Exchange server.<br />
All subfolders already exist in the archive store. They have been through many versions of Outlook.<br />
Inbox is set to auto-archive with default settings, which have been modified.<br />
The main pst is 123MB<br />
The archive pst is 3.2GB<br />
All messages are unicode.<br />
Office 365 Home</p>
<p>I have run scanpst on both files until no errors found.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I did as you suggested. I no longer get the error, but messages aren't archived as specified. In File&gt; Cleanup Tools, I selected Inbox to "archive this folder and all subfolders:", Archive items older than Mon 12/1/2014, pointed to the new archive file that
 I created. The archive file was created with all subfolders, but no messages. Opening the pst that my pop accounts go to, messages from 11/3/2014 are in the inbox folder, Subfolders also have messages prior to 12/1.</p>

<p>I added the Modified column to the view. It looks like a message is modified whenever it is displayed in the reading pane. The message in question was shown in the Reading Pane every time the Inbox was opened because of the way that I have the Inbox sorted.
 I'm off to try to find how to get Outlook to archive based on date received rather than date modified.</p>

<p>Hi, christophero donnell.<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting on Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
You may try to perform a phone soft reset. This method will not remove anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.<br />
<br />
To perform a soft reset:</p>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Make sure your phone is turned on.</li><li><span>Press and hold the&nbsp;</span><strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>buttons
 until your phone vibrates and restarts.</span></li></ul>
<p>Note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).<br />
<br />
Keep us posted.<br />
<br />

<br />You can't mute ringer as of now.

<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open Skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/</a>
