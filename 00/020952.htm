<h2>            Unable to update from build 9926</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp; I was running build 10130 for a while and then installed Chromecast app. This seemed t cause serious problems to the sytem and many things stopped working. I then did a restore and went back to build 9926. However, I am now unable to update this,
 windows update is saying that all updates hav been applied. I've read a lot of posts about this as it was a problem back in January when this build came out, but none of them seemed to help. I've thought of geting a new ISO, but these are not available any
 more. Perhaps when the full Windows 10 is realised, my laptop will be upgraded to that, but I fear that the update mechanism is being blcoked by sonething. David

            <p>Hello David</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately Microsoft no longer supports Build 9926.&nbsp; Your best (only) bet is to restore your saved&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;Windows 7/8/8.1 and wait for a few more days for the final release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is not accepting any more new&nbsp;insiders, but you might be able to get a copy of 10240 (but I doubt that).</p>

            <p>Hi Julian, &nbsp; thanks for your reply and that explains why I could not do any updates. Unfortunately, the laptop I am using had no operating system on it when I bought it, so there is no restore possible to Win 7 or 8.</p>
<p>I've found a website with a download of build 10240, but some users are warning that MS will not allow this to be activated now as we are near to July 29th.</p>
<p>So not sure what to do, I should have backed up my faulty version 10130 and then I could have restored to that and then updated again possibly???</p>

            <p>As Windows 10 is out today, I've logged onto Windows insider using the laptop with Build 9926.</p>
<p>I noticed there was button to press which was for upgarding to Windows 10 using a download tool. I've downloaded and run that, selected the Upgrade option and now it appears that Windows 10 is being downloaded. So hopefully this will give me the full version
 of Windows 10 as used by insiders.&nbsp;</p>

            Good news!!! it took quite a bit of time and a few restarts, but i now have Windows 10 up and running. It appears to be the normal version now and is now longer the Insider Preview. I get the impression that to resume being an insider, I would need to
 opt to join in again.

<h2>            Display Language OneNote</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Microsoft Office 365 on a computer running Windows 10. The display language (or user interface language) for the Office suite is English except for OneNote, which is inexplicably displayed in French. How can I switch OneNote's display language to
 English?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>It appears I was running the OneNote for Windows "app" as opposed to the OneNote 2016 "desktop app". Window's default language display setting is to use the input language list and my keyboard is set to Canadian Mulitingual Standard. That might explain why
 OneNote for Windows was displayed in French... though I don't understand why the entire system isn't displayed in French. Anyway, I found OneNote 2016 and when I ran it, it opened in English. The OneNote for Window window that had been opened previously also
 switched to English. If I close OneNote 2016 and open the "app" version, it is in French again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having the same programme available as an "app" and as a "desktop app" is confusing and absolutely pointless (and having Cortina return the app first just makes this worse).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            New Message Arrival Notifications Cannot Be Disabled</h2>
                    <p>I run Office 365 Home on Windows 10 Version&nbsp;1809&nbsp;(OS&nbsp;Build&nbsp;17763.529). For email, I use Outlook 2016 Version 1905 (Build 11629.20214 Click-to-Run). I want to

<div><br />
<div>As you've mentioned, you were able to follow some guidance on how to disable the Outlook notifications but it is still appearing on your computer. I'd recommend performing the steps on how to change the notifications settings in
<strong>Windows 10</strong> on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028678/windows-10-change-notification-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Once done, you may proceed to turn off the new message alert pop-up
 instruction that is found in this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-new-message-alert-pop-up-on-or-off-9940c70e-b306-442e-a856-d94b20318481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.&nbsp;</div>

<p>I tried the safe mode access on the Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked —of sorts—, I was able to launch Word 2016 —just like when the wifi is off— but then the Mac crashed. This very very rarely happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restarted the Mac Word 2016 gave me the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Word 2008 doesn't work either. It launches but it doesn't recognize my fonts and it places spaces between letters and deletes complete lines of text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to stop on what I was working. I was afraid I would lose what I had done so far on a 15 page document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm not back to square one.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Alberto,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updated information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We understand your concern. But actually, reinstalling Office application won't lose these local files. If you are still afraid the files
 missing, you could back up the existing files and then reinstall Office 2016.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Besides, could you provide the crash log when the error message emerges via

<p>When you started your Mac in Safe Mode, several processes were put in place that can affect your Mac, overall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk Utility ran in the background and (hopefully) fixed directory problems. The font cache was emptied. Based on the behavior after doing your safe mode startup, I wonder if maybe there isn't something going wrong more seriously on your startup drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There does seem to be something really wrong with your fonts. Are you using a font utility to manage your fonts? There are some known issues in that your font management utility MUST be the very latest version or you will get system crashes and have application
 problems like the ones you are describing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first suggestion is to run Font Book app. On the File menu choose Restore Standard fonts. Then, install Office updates to get version 16.16.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Install Mac OS X updates first:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get Mac OS updates, go to the App store on your dock, and then click the Updates button to reveal available updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Then Install Office Updates</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get the update:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>1. Open any Office application</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>2. Go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>3. Let AutoUpdate check for and install updates</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>4. Restart your Mac</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have any add-ins such as WebEx, Mendelay, EndNote, Zotero, TypeIt4me, etc it is essential that you install the latest updates for your add-ins.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If restoring your system fonts and updating Office still doesn't fix the crashes, I suggest re-installing Mac OS</span></p>

<p>hi testo3651436,</p>
<p>you can choose to block, allow or quarantine the mobile device access to your organization’s office 365 accounts at the office 365 exchange admin center (eac) (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/</a>)&nbsp;by clicking
<strong>mobile</strong> &gt; <strong>mobile device access</strong>, then click <strong>
edit</strong> to choose to block, allow, or quarantine when a mobile device that isn’t managed by a rule or personal exemption connects to exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e926b552-c3d9-4ec8-92dc-c0082addccaf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e926b552-c3d9-4ec8-92dc-c0082addccaf" /></a></p>
<p>click the plus symbol to select an administrator to receive quarantine notification email messages when a mobile device is quarantined.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f15cc60b-f807-44d7-b71b-6f4e49f62dea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f15cc60b-f807-44d7-b71b-6f4e49f62dea" /></a><br />
please note: please don’t create a device access rules so that multiple devices access can be controlled by the exchange activesync access settings.</p>
<p>regarding “where would be the list of all the devices would be shown in o365 admin portal so that i will enable the quarantine and when there active sync gets blocked i will allow them”, you can view all the quarantined devices under “<strong>quarantined
 devices</strong>”, you can choose to block or allow these devices by clicking the allow or block button.</p>
<p>if i’ve misunderstood your detailed requirement, please don’t hesitate to post back to tell me more information about your detailed requirement so that we can help you further.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />

<p><span><span><strong>All web-based malware alerts are fakes</strong>. Microsoft actually does have an ongoing conversation with your PC (via telemetry) regarding updates, system errors, malware issues, and so forth – but it never responds with a warning in
 your web browser. Any legitimate alert from your AV app, or from your OS, will always appear in either a
<strong><span>notification area<em> </em></span></strong><span>pop-up,</span> or an
<strong>independent window</strong> (outside of your browser window) – never as a pop-up in your web browser.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>So whenever you see one of these security alerts pop up in your browser, it always means that somebody out there is looking to scam you, and that they’re using this fake alert just to lure you into calling their “tech support” number. If you
 call the number, they’ll just try to scam you out of some money by selling you worthless software or services at an exorbitant price, and maybe by stealing your personal information. If you refuse to pay up, there’s also a chance that they might punish you
 by installing some malware or by locking you out of your computer. These <strong>
<span>Tech Support Scam</span></strong> pop-up messages (dialogs) come in lots of familiar themes: virus detections; hacker alerts; firewall intrusions; hardware error reports; system error reports; and what have you – but all of these web-based warnings are
 fakes, and you just have to ignore the content and close the page. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And of course closing the malicious page is usually the problem, because most of these scam sites try to coerce you into calling their “tech support” number by preventing you from closing your browser. They do that with a
<strong>dialog loop</strong>, which is just a script that reloads the fake pop-up alert (dialog) every time you try to close it. So in order to escape from one of these malicious pages, the first thing that you have to do is try to close the alert. That allows
 the browser to detect the message loop – and the browser will then immediately add a
<strong>Dialog Loop Protection checkbox </strong>(e.g., “Don’t let this page create more messages”) to the fake alert popup. And then once you’ve checked that option, you should be able to close the scam page right along with the popup:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/microsoft-virus/5335f80f-4cfc-49e0-bbcf-8f575730779a?auth=1">h</a><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/microsoft-virus/5335f80f-4cfc-49e0-bbcf-8f575730779a?auth=1">ttps://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning/microsoft-virus/5335f80f-4cfc-49e0-bbcf-8f575730779a?auth=1</a></span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unfortunately, the scammers have come up with some pretty clever ways of hiding the
<strong>Dialog Loop Protection checkbox</strong> – and since they still haven’t resolved the issue with
<strong>AutoRecover</strong> forcing a last session recovery </span><span>in the Edge browser</span><span>, you might still need to use the old “indirect startup” method for closing a
<strong>Tech Support Scam</strong> page in Edge:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. First, right-click on the taskbar and select <strong>Task Manager</strong> – or use
<strong>Ctrl + Alt + Delete </strong><span>if the taskbar is hidden</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Then select the browser app and click on the <strong>End task</strong> button.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Now, restart Edge indirectly by entering a search topic (like “tesla”) for a
<strong>Cortana</strong> web search.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Then right-click on the search-result tab and choose “Close other tabs”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Edge will then close and reopen without bringing up the browser-locking scam page, then the issue was probably just caused by a dialog-looping script on the webpage itself, and not by any real malware. Of course there are a few
<strong>Tech Support Scam</strong> pages out there that won’t be removed by these procedures because they actually lockup the browser with binary malware&nbsp;that’s been installed on the system – and these can only be removed with specialized malware-removal tools:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-tech-support-scam-popups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-tech-support-scam-popups/</span></a>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On browsers that don’t support <strong>Dialog Loop Protection</strong>, though, you’ll still have to close the browser window with
<strong>Task Manager </strong>(right-click on the taskbar; start Task Manager; and then end the browser process) and then go directly to your
<strong>home page</strong> when you reopen the browser.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There’s also a newer version of the <strong>Tech Support Scam</strong> that shifts the scam page to
<span>full-screen</span> in order to hide your desktop and taskbar. With this one, you should be able to toggle the screen with the browser screen control keys; for example, I can toggle Edge’s
<span>full-screen<em> </em></span>on and off with <strong>Windows logo + Shift + Enter</strong>. But since the screen control keys aren’t very well known, what I would recommend for this would be the old familiar
<strong>Ctrl + Alt + Delete</strong>. That allows you to start <strong>Task Manager</strong> – where you can just close the browser app. In fact, if you start
<strong>Task Manager</strong> this way with Edge in <span>full-screen</span>, this will automatically minimize Edge, and that leaves the desktop wide open. So there are several different ways to get out of one of these
<span>full-screen</span> scams – provided, of course, that there isn’t any real malware running in the background that could interfere.</span></p>

            <p>so, if I understand correctly, publisher removed the facility to convert docs from rgb to cmyk in 2013. If so, publisher is now useless for those, like me, &nbsp;who wish to have their work printed, as sending an rgb pdf to the printers results in considerable
 unwanted colour changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Read the links above for MS rational. They apparently do not believe it is necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>check Scribus for a free DTP @ https://www.scribus.net/ </p>
<p>
</p><p>or Serif makes a good DTP. It even has a freebie. </p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 800 randomly re-sending old text messages</h2>
                    <p>My Lumia 800 is sporadically sending out old texts (sometimes many weeks old) to the contact I originally sent that message to. I am getting tired of receiving confused texts from people.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;I have the 'SMS delivery confirmation' setting on, I get a confirmation message when my phone randomly re-sends a text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted all my text messages threads but the problem persists. Please could someone help me find a fix to this. Thanks, Chris.</p>

            Hi  GWPugh 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Surface RT devices are no longer supported and you might be seeing the effects of this. 
<br />
<br />Click Start, type: internet options
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click the Advanced tab
<br />Click Reset
<br />Click Reset again
<br />
<br />Restart the browser then check if it loads the web page.
<br />
<br />
<br />It simply be that many web pages are not officially supporting Internet Explorer anymore. Internet Explorer 11 is hardly being maintain and is still around as a legacy web browser for Intranet websites and LOB apps that require ActiveX controls.
<br />
<br />You should consider upgrading to a newer device running a supported operating system such as Windows 10.

            Surface RT devices are different, because they are using ARM based processors. Also, the standards are there, its just that modern websites are not really putting in the effort to support Internet Explorer 11 anymore which is more than 5 years old. In contrast, Chrome and Firefox upgraded almost every 6 weeks, Edge on Windows 10 every 6 months and that will soon change this year since Microsoft is switching Edge to a Chromium based engine.

            The error points to the jscript9.dll which is a component of Windows.
<br />
<br />Another, possibility third party, module may actually be causing the crash.
<br />
<br />For instance an older version of Infragistics controls appeared to be the issue (with IE9) in the following topic:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/all/problem-event-name-appcrash-fault-module-name/213b9e1c-769d-4a18-bef8-74857ad75428?page=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/al...</a>
<br />
<br />To get more information on the crash and possibly pinpoint the cause I might suggest to capture a user mode dump of the crash :
<br />
<br />You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.
<br />
<br />If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as iedump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file at the time iexplore.exe crashes should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\iexplore.exe]
<br />"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\
<br />00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00
<br />
<br />
<br />After Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />More info on collecting user-mode dumps:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787181</a>(VS.85).aspx
<br />
<br />To stop the creation of the user mode dump files run the following registry file:
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />
<br />[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\iexplore.exe]
<br />
<br />You can delete the C:\CrashDumps folder anytime.

            Are you able to provide the following information which may help determine any issue(s):
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type msinfo32 in the "Open" box  &gt; OK &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file
<br />

            The link worked great.
<br />
<br />The .nfo file was corrupted. I could read some of it with Notepad.
<br />
<br />The .evtx file did show many of the IE crashes yielded this info :
<br />
<br />Faulting application name: iexplore.exe, version: 11.0.9600.19036, time stamp: 0x5b077ae6
<br />Faulting module name: unknown, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x00000000
<br />Exception code: 0xc0000005
<br />Fault offset: 0x0906f439
<br />Faulting process id: 0xd10
<br />Faulting application start time: 0x01d4961b6b1bcd29
<br />Faulting application path: C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe
<br />Faulting module path: unknown
<br />Report Id: b0750ac5-020e-11e9-94c2-6045bd83fa29
<br />Faulting package full name: 
<br />Faulting package-relative application ID: 
<br />
<br />That shows that rather than the jscript9.dll causing the crash an "unknown module" caused the crash.
<br />
<br />A user mode dump file has a good chance of identifying this unknown module.
<br />
<br />Can you check the following registry key :
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting
<br />
<br />if you expand that registry key is there a subfolder LocalDumps and if you expand LocalDumps is there a subfolder iexplore.exe ?
<br />
<br />Also, can you generate the .nfo file in Safe Mode and provide it.

<h2>            Build 10041</h2>
                    <p>This build downloaded and installed with no issues on both laptop and pc. However, so much stuff didn't work I do wonder if anything was changed for the better.</p>
<p>This build doesn't recognise sound cards or devices. It doesn't recognise or install wired or wireless devices. The feedback apps don't work.</p>
<p>This version appears to be a step back in terms of progress.</p>
<p>The look and feel of this build is in need of work. Its too harsh with the square, 90 degree corners. It needs softening, get some curves like in win 7.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to test much else as not much actually works. Even Halo Evolved game won't run properly and that's one of microsofts own game!!</p>
<p>With talk of a possible release of the full system later this summer I think there's a long way to go yet to iron out the bugs and flaws.</p>
<p>Launch this early with these type of issues will cost Microsoft dear.</p>

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look after the computers for **Organization** (CPA) &amp; when I tried to setup the automatic replies for a user when she was going to be out of the office for a week it just will not send the auto reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed into the Office 365 portal &amp; clicked on the Outlook app, I then clicked on Options&gt;Automatic Replies &amp; set the proper dates &amp; enabled it. Just wouldn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried to enable it on my personal Hotmail through the&nbsp;https://outlook.live.com/ site and it wouldn't work. (see image below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a connected account to my Hotmail &amp; the all have connected accounts in their Outlook portal accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the connected account in my personal Hotmail account and sent a test email &amp; bingo it sent the automatic reply instantly. I created a connected account again &amp; tested it and once again the auto replies would not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone ever encountered this situation?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Leo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am embarassed to say I just clued-in that where it is the outside account that they want the automatic reply to work for that they have to set that up on the hosting site for their **organization** email account.&nbsp; I just figured where it is being linked
 in the Office 365 portal Outlook settings that it would send an automatic reply for that account as well as soon as an email came into the inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The automatic reply was not working inside the organization or outside. But I guess that is because they were using their organizational email addresses. They do not use the Office 365 email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eric</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just tested this on my side and it worked: I added an IMAP account to my OWA, then set up an automatic reply and send a test message to my Office 365 account with another Office 365 account in same organization, and I have got a reply.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further investigate this issue, I'd like to ask:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Which account do you want to get a reply? The Office 365 account or your connected account?</p>
<p>2.Are the issue persists both for the inside or the outside senders? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Home - Outlook 2016 Inbox not showing any emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just upgraded to 2016 Outlook yesterday on my windows 7 laptop and the inbox now shows as empty although my mobile device and windows 8 laptop still receives and displays emails. &nbsp;Outlook on the windows 7 laptop still shows my previous emails in the 'Sent
 / Deleted / Trash / etc." folders but nothing in the inbox. &nbsp;It just states: "We didn't find anything to show here".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 email accounts in Outlook and this only happens with the 2 IMAP accounts. &nbsp;The Hotmail account works fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see any obvious errors with the settings as I did a direct comparison between the two laptops so would appreciate any assistance to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid neither the restart in clean mode, or new profile solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also uninstalled 2016 Office 365 and Visio 2016, and reinstalled them one at a time to see if that made any difference; but it didn't. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also deleted the 2 IMAP accounts in Outlook and reinstalled using the auto account setup on one, and manual setup on the other; it made no difference. &nbsp;The accounts would create fine with test emails sent and received on my other laptop and mobile, but
 still nothing in the inbox on the Windows 7 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, open to suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks for your assistance so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>Print Document with Balloons on the Margin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kh_916  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print Document with Balloons on the Margin</h2>
                    <p>I am working with a draft document that contains both in-line revisions (marked in track changes mode) and comment balloons.&nbsp; I would like to print this document with both the revisions and comment balloons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, under "Show Markup," I have "Comments" checked and under Balloons I have "Show Only Comments and Formatting in Balloons."&nbsp; When viewing it in Print Layout mode, it shows both the revisions (in-line) and balloons (on the margin).&nbsp; When I attempt
 to print, however, the balloons do not actually print--only the in-line revisions and some shaded notations where the balloons appear (e.g., "[RE1]" and "[JT2]" without showing the text in the balloon).&nbsp; I have selected "Print Markup" from the drop-down menu
 and the preview pane shows both the in-line revisions and the balloons.&nbsp; In other words, the preview pane is simply not matching what is actually printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed a workaround by printing the "List of Markup" separately to get a printed copy of the balloons, but it is not ideal to have to flip back and forth between the document and the list of comments, so I was wondering if there is a way to print
 the document with the balloons actually included on the same page (as I was able to do with prior versions of Word).

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure this is possible with one of the Visual Reports (that I don't use.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made a habit of copying and pasting data from the Resource Usage or Task Usage table to Excel where I create the histogram under controlled conditions. &nbsp;This could be a 5-minute exercise or a few hours depending on your facility with Excel. (Stacked-bar
 chart of the detailed resource use is pretty useful.)</p>
<p>Good luck, tom&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for posting detailed description about your questions.</p>
<p>For your questions about customize search in SharePoint 2010, it is best supported in
<strong>MSDN forum</strong>. This forum does not cover that kind of questions. I’d recommend you post a thread via the link below:<br />
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sharepointsearch%2Csharepointsearchprevious&amp;amp;filter=alltypes&amp;amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sharepointsearch%2Csharepointsearchprevious&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc</a></p>
<p>I find one more thread about authentication for SharePoint Online search web service if they can help you:<br />

                    <p>We have set up a OneNote Class notebook and invited students. &nbsp;We can see the authors in each notebook and in one of the student notebooks (shared only with instructor(s) and the individual student), we can see that two authors have contributed to the notebook
 - the student and another named person. &nbsp;We've checked the sharing of the notebook and the second person is not listed as having access. &nbsp;Any ideas how they would be able to contribute to the notebook without it having been shared with them by the instructor?</p>

<p>3.In the student's notebook, let the student make some changes manually to the part which is displaying modified by SD. The contents will display the student's name. Based on my knowledge, in this
 situation, the notebook should not be edited by others except student himself.</p>

    <title>Tables misaligned in Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard burke-ward  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tables misaligned in Word 2016</h2>
                    
<p>hi.</p>
<p>this problem happens with word 2016 on both yosemite and el capitan.</p>
<p>about 75% of documents that use tables are hopelessly misaligned:</p>
<ul>
<li>the table boundaries rearrange themselves randomly so they're in different places when i open the document from when i closed it
</li><li>the cursor gets out of alignment with the actual boundaries of the cells (see snapshot below - and bear in mind that the blue 'selected' area is supposed to be a single cell!)
</li><li>the cells frequently show double edges. often both displaced from where the single edge should be
</li><li>if i'm lucky enough to be able to locate a cell edge with the cursor, sliding it left or right simply doesn't work
</li></ul>
<p>basically, tables are unusable - which is something of a pain since i use them all the time.</p>
<p>here's a couple of screenshots that give you an idea of what i am contending with:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f9e952b3-9060-4b56-af1c-710ccd2d6cf3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df9e952b3-9060-4b56-af1c-710ccd2d6cf3" /></a></p>
<p>and:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e7026c3e-13dc-439f-b5ba-36d0bab335a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de7026c3e-13dc-439f-b5ba-36d0bab335a0" /></a></p>
<p>this is driving me bananas! any ideas?</p>

            <p>There's one possibility for a simple recovery. In Word, go to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced, scroll down to the Save section, and look at the option "Always create backup copy". If that box is checked (and was checked before you overwrote the original document),
 then look in the same folder as the document for a file named "Backup of &lt;your file name&gt;.wbk". If it's there, then it's a copy of the original document. You can open it in Word and use File &gt; Save As to save it to a different name or a different folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the option isn't checked, or if the Backup...wbk file doesn't exist, then the next best thing is if you've used
<a href="http://www.7tutorials.com/introducing-windows-8-how-backup-data-file-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
File History</a> in Windows to make automatic backups of your files, or if you've used some other backup scheme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A last possibility is if you've ever printed out the original document and still have the paper copy. That could be scanned and run through an optical character recognition (OCR) program to recreate the Word document.</p>
