            The FAQ page suggests "/find" but that doesn't work in the cloud Skype, or the Linux client, or the Mac client.

    <title>Locked out of administrator account - only have access to standard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cman3500  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of administrator account - only have access to standard account.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok... I have a unique situation that I could kick myself for.. and I must say that Windows 7 is the most secure version of Windows I have ever seen.... and it is very aggravating.&nbsp; If this was XP I'm pretty sure I could have already gotten past this problem.<br />
<br />
I am currently locked out of my administrator account and only have access to a standard account.&nbsp; This happened when I was going through&nbsp; some homework for one of my college classes and forgot to change the lock out threshold back to default.</p>
<p>What makes my situation unique is that my entire hard drive is encrypted using Truecrypt.&nbsp;&nbsp; When my computer boots it comes up to the Truecrypt boot loader... I enter the password and start tapping F8 and go into repair your computer.&nbsp; It shows no operating
 system to select, which I suspect is because of being encrypted.&nbsp; I have lost my physical rescue disk for Truecrypt... and my backup of the ISO is on the desktop of the admin account's desktop... I have attempted using admnalow to at least get into my files...
 but that doesn't work because it is a standard account and doesn't have the ability to take ownership...&nbsp; I would use a linux distro to get my files, but since the hard drive is encrypted... I can't touch the HD without formatting it, which would defeat the
 purpose.&nbsp; I have also tried starting in safe mode, but still do not have access to the built-in "administrator" account...</p>
<p>My answer= I'm pretty much screwed.&nbsp; Anybody come up with an answer better than the one I have come up with?&nbsp; I really need some of these files and don't want to have to reinstall Windows because I have a lot of programs on here that are a pain to load back
 up.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Cory</p>

            There might be a simpler solution to your problem: If your normal account lets you invoke System Restore then you could do so in order to reset the SAM (=password file) to its condition when your admin account was still unlocked.

<p>Why is your admin account locked? When you type the wrong password too many times then the account gets locked for the period specified in the local policy. You could therefore log back in again after waiting for a while.</p>
<p>You're playing a risky game in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>You encrypt your disk. This can backfire badly. </li><li>You have no external key file. </li><li>You have only a single admin account. </li></ol>
To me Item 2 is compulsory for all encrypted disks and Item 3 is compulsory no matter what. There is a chance you might be able to recover from this disaster by going through the process below. Whether it works I do not know - I have never tested it on an encrypted
 disk. The process is involved and requires some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area.<br />
&nbsp;1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp;2. Boot with a Windows Repair CD. <br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp;5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;6. Select the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
&nbsp;8. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; \&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;9. Reboot normally but hold down the Shift key permanently.<br />
10. When challenged for a password, tape the Shift key five time. You will see a small black screen.<br />
11. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see a list of all accounts that exist on your machine)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see if the Administrator account is active)<br />
12. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "xxx" ppp&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Replace xxx with the account for which you wish to set a new password, and ppp with the new password)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator /active:yes {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To activate the Administrator account if desired)<br />
13. Log on under this account, using the new password.<br />
14. Reboot the machine into Repair Mode as per Steps 1..6 above.<br />
15. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy \sethc.exe {Enter}<br />
16. Reboot into Windows.<br />
Instead using a Windows Repair CD in Step 2, you can use your Windows 7 Installation DVD. The steps are similar to the ones above.

<h2>            Canon hd camcorder does not recognize its own mp4 video files downloaded from Windows Media Player onto SD card</h2>
                    I shot high-def video on my new Canon Vixia HF R600, which has no internal memory but instead records to an SD card.&nbsp; My Dell PC running updated Windows 8.1 with Windows Media Player 12, also updated, readily downloaded the video from its built-in SD card
 port.&nbsp; I then edited out various files on the PC, making several different versions of the video.&nbsp; Each version was stored as a separate folder in My Videos.&nbsp; I had 2 objectives.&nbsp; First, I wanted to download various versions/folders onto new SD cards to be
 given to friends and family who had equipment to view high-def downloads from an SD card.&nbsp; Second, I wanted to hook up my camcorder (with the new SD card of choice containing one of the edited versions) to a DVD burner so as to make a (standard def) version
 viewable on the generic family DVD-V player.&nbsp; Yes, I have the appropriate cables to do all this.&nbsp; The problem is that the new SD card--the one that received the download of an edited version

            <p>Just a couple of guesses, but are the SD cards correctly formatted for the camera and is the directory structure the same as as the camera is expecting?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try formatting the SD cards in the camera to start with (you'll have to reload the mp4s again) and if that doesn't work make sure the cards have an identical directory structure to the card that came out of the camera.</p>

            Hi RC2076, <br />
<br />
First I would make a backup of the driver. Doing this will allow easy re-installation of your display adapter after you remove it. You most likely cannot uninstall it because there is a file in use by the system. Reboot your computer to safe mode. To do this
 restart and before the widnows logo screen press F8. This will give you options. Choose Safe Mode. Log in and now see if you can unisntall your driver. If you can reboot and it will return your computer to normal. Post driver removal you may notice that everything
 is larger. This is because your screen resolution is much less without the driver. To return it to normal just reinstall the driver from the OEM that you uninstalled.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!

 </blockquote> <p>Thanks&nbsp;I have tried all HDMI audio options. &nbsp;bitstream out, 7.1 and 5.1 uncompressed, stereo, etc. &nbsp;I finally got bitstream out with dolby digital to work when I tested Halo. &nbsp;I also&nbsp;just tested&nbsp;a few minutes ago with a music video on YouTube but the sub didn't work with that which I still think is weird because if I change it to stereo YouTube will play my sub but who wants to listen in stereo lol. &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Again Blurays still work perfectly fine because I have&nbsp;enabled the setting that allows my receiver to decode Blurays. &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for the help I will continue to test it for a few days and make sure it is still working correctly. &nbsp;</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen resolution stuck on 800x600, is this a graphics card problem&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I've in the last couple of days trying to get my PC working properly, the PC will turn on but the problem is that it won't load windows ( most of the times ) but when it does I am stuck with the resolution 800x600 and it's fully locked. Which means
 I can't change it or do anything with it. Do you think this might be due to the graphics card ( gtx 580 ) or is it something wrong with the windows files?

<p>The best bet would be Reinstalling the windows and then installing latest Graphics driver from GeForce Experience :)</p>

<p>a) did phone about a year ago about this and still it seems to be alife</p>
<p>b) your phone number to get this done, does not redirect correctly and put me into an endless loop with scrambled music
</p>
<p>c) If i can subscribe so easilly, why can't i unsubscribe so easilly? Almost looks like this is done on purpose (which is illegal for companies offering their services in the NL)</p>

<h2>            Changing a product key from Retail to OEM</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an OEM version of windows XP pro that I had assumed to be lost. I bought and installed&nbsp;a new retail version of XP about&nbsp;2 years ago and have now found my OEM disk and product key. I'd like to change the product key to my OEM version and sell my retail
 version. Is this possible? The change product key tutorials out there are for Volume License versions. How is this done if it is possible?</p>
<p>Thanks! Andy M</p>

<h2>            Problem with Ndis.sys</h2>
                    My system keep giving the BSOD but I cant find whats causing the error. I've tried using memory checker and doing a windows vista repair and recovery but it hasnt worked.<br />
<br />
The error message I noted was 0x000000F7<br />
<br />
i've checked the minidump and its saying likely cause ndis.sys&nbsp; (ndis+14f52) which I gather is an important file<br />
<br />
how do I replace/repair this file to stop my pc running like a 486?<br />
<br />
Additional info had another BSOD and crash dump viewer is saying probable cause ntoskrnl.exe
<br />

            I've tried the microsoft suggested actions and no joy sadly<br />
<br />
the last crash dump check did pointed at Authentic AMD though<br />
<br />
I've found a utility that allowed me to easily update my motherboard and chipset drivers and I thought this had sorted the problem as my pc was fine for the next few hours but its just restarted itself (even though the auto restart is switched off) no minidump
 record though<br />
<br />
I did find a link that suggested using this at command prompt<br />
<br />
<br />
however I got an error message saying filename, directory name or volume label syntax is incorrect<br />
<br />

            while its slightly more stable now its still turning itself off, no minidump since the chipset drivers etc got updated<br />

            shameless bump, back to the usual crashes especially when I try to run games on it<br />
<br />
some of the things i've done so far<br />
I've gone through all the hardware on device manager and told them to update the drivers and I've updated my motherboard and chipset drivers.<br />
.I've uninstalled various anti virus and utility software in case they are causing a clash; I'm just running microsofts security set.
<br />
I've also run the system repair via my Vista install DVD. <br />
I've run memory test previously and nothing came up, however when I've tried to run it today it crashes on the 2nd run does that indicate something?<br />
<br />
does anyone have a further course of action to suggest? I feel like I'm chasing my tail currently<br />
<br />
is there any other information I can provide that would help narrow down the cause?<br />
<br />

</p><p>I received the laptop a week back and have only installed Microsoft office. I have installed few other application like Avast, Netflix but that's all I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I received the laptop first time, I got the same issue. Then I read in some forum that by restarting the laptop second time, the screen to enter password appers. I tried it for 3-4 days and everything looks fine. Only problem was I had to start my laptop
 and once it comes to blue screen, I restart it and next time I was able to enter password. But since last 3 days, even after restarting multiple times the screen to enter password doesn't come.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to follow many threads and trying many things like this from last 3 days but still not able to resolve it. Its unfortunate that Microsoft is making its users do testing for its buggy software. It seems to be a common problem from last 2-3 years.
 Denial of service on a new, genuine laptop with all genuine softwares is a serious issue.</p>

<h2>            phone scam or legit&#63;</h2>
                    I received a pair of calls, yesterday and today, from a woman claiming to be from a company called MacroSolutions. She said that they are a microsoft windows service provider and that they remotely detected that my computer has malware. She directed me
 to look at the errors in the event viewer (run eventvwr -&gt; custom views -&gt; administrative events). She then told me to run www.sup123.tk (which I suppose would have taken me to a website somewhere outside the United States if I had continued for follow her
 directions). I told her that .tk domains are easy to get anonymously and hence are often used for running scams. She insisted that her company was legit and that if I didn't follow her instructions, my computer would become useless. Before I hung up, I managed
 to talk to a guy who claimed to be her supervisor, and I also managed to get them to give me a phone number: (800) 476-3134, which I called later to confirm that it worked. It feels scammy, but if it's a scam, why did they g

 hace hitmarker por ratos, abrir puertos con portforwarding y nada, use al mismo tiempo porttriggering y solo mejora un poco, cambie dns y mejoro un poco más pero no como debería ser, he visto que es el upnp mejora la experiencia al desactivarlo pero al hacerlo
 me da nat estricta aún tenga portforwarding o porttriggering o dmz. Es bastante molesto y frustrante, y desafortunadamente donde vivo es lo único que hay: Izzi. Alguna solución? Aclaró igual que tengo desactivado el firewall en cada una de sus opciones mejorando
 un poco más, pero hay partidas es que se juega decente y otras muy malas

            Hi OP.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If a tile can't be resized larger it's because it doesn't have Live Tile display (like News, MSN Money, Weather, Mail, Photos, etc) that uses the larger space to display more information.  If it's just a static icon then it will be limited in size.  
<br />
<br />See here for how to further customize Start Menu:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/197836/8-ways-to-customize-the-windows-10-start-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/197836/8-ways-to-cust...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Good thing I'm not bored of Titanfall yet. I heard the Carrier mode was a disappointment too, which bummed me out, as the Titan mode in 2142 was the greatest online FPS mode ever.
</p>
<p>I have premium, eventually I'll try it, after (if) they fix the rubber banding issues.</p>

<p>I have a 60MB fibre optic connection and still rubber band, i went on about a week ago to try out the carrier assault since a bought the season pass, first game was unplayable, second game was alot better but every 10 seconds or so i rubber banded, turned
 it off after that and haven't been back since. I definitely wouldn't recommend the season pass.</p>

            <span>Some programs will give you an option to have a shortcut placed in only the current account or all accounts during installation of the program.</span><br />
<br />
<span>If not, and when it doesn't automatically create a shortcut for all users, you could manually create a shortcut from the .exe file of the program in the Start Menu all users location for all users to have the shortcut.</span><br />

<h2>            Threat</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I'm in danger of a hacker/modder named <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>I will tell bits and pieces of the story so get ready.</p>

<p>Ok, it all started when one of my good friends got a new boyfriend and he said for me and my bestfriend to stay away from her, He made death threats to me and my buddy and to one point he said he was going to hack everyone on my friends list and balm me
 for it. And he keeps telling me that i'm "dead" if I talk to her and he will get my IP Address from my account and get my credit card info and steal it from me. But today hes worried that I will call the Police and everything so now he says he will just hack
 me and my friends. This guy has a J-Tagged xbox and he has hacked people in the past to. Thats the bits and pieces of the story what should I do?</p>

<p>Report him. File a complaint. It is unbelievably difficult to hack anyone's profile via Xbox LIVE. He can get your IP address, potentially knocking you offline, but the rest is bluffing. If you're worried just don't join his parties, and don't send him voice
 messages. And he's kind of pathetic for getting a girlfriend on LIVE.</p>
<p>You couldn't call the police unfortunately, but, if he decides to knock you offline. I know you can check who has been sending you the most data packets via your router and ISP. It would show his IP, as he'd be the one sending them. That's a felony, so then,
 he could potentially be in legal trouble.</p>

<p>There is nothing the police can do about that.</p>

<p>Now if you make a joke about shooting up a school while playing League of Legends, then that will get you 5 months in solitary confinement, put on suicide watch, and be held without being charged.</p>

<p>The police would have to issue a warrant to supeona the persons information from MS. If the person making the threat does not live in the same police jurisdication, then it just gets passed on.</p>

<p>Taking into account the odds are high the person is a minor anyways, and nothing will be done anyways. The police would have spent THOUSANDS of dollars in resources for nothing.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Your local police will do NOTHING about some idle internet "death threat" made over a video game. They will file a report just because they would have to, but ZERO resources would be out into that "investigation"</p>

<p>Police take CREDIBLE death threats seriously. Not idle death threats made over CoD.</p>

<p><span>I'm not going to debate this with you. If someone threatened me on Xbox Live then I'm going to report them to Microsoft and the police. That is my advice from my own opinion and experience dealing with the police. If someone wants to take it then fine,
 if they don't and want to risk that it was just a "joke" or whatever, then fine, that's their decision.</span></p>
