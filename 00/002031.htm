<h2>            Nokia N8 and 808 - Battery and Symbian thoughts</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time lately reading about 808. While it seems fantastic at first, it has the same battery as Nokia N8 while having bigger screen and being more chunky overall. I understand if you want to use smartphone you have to realize it eats battery
 and mostly will last you for a full days usage. Well, I wish!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I own N8 more than a year, recently I switched everything to offline, lowest brightness and so on, to save battery. It helps quite a lot in standby mode, but when I'm using it it's no good:</p>
<p>- browsing web - less than 3 hours on 3G (I was once in a bus from Kilkenny to Dublin, battery was drained before reaching destination),</p>
<p>- reading e-book - around 2 hours (I was in a park lately, reading Steve Jobs biography and was surprised how fast the battery drained).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wouldn't call it even heavy usage, just one app running, no multitasking. Since Nokia 808 has bigger energy consumption, I expect it to have worse battery life. That's why I'm thinking about switching to Samsung or Apple. There aren't any good or new apps
 for Symbian like there are on Android or iOS. I just wish we could have all in one device - perfect compact camera, phone, good battery and game console. But that's wishful thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also what I like about N8 - it has Sim Card and Memory Card slots beside each other on the side, extremely easy to access, the best I've seen. Now 808 has them all hidden behind the cover under the battery. If somebody is using phone as external hard drive,
 it's easy to remove Micro SD and copy files to a laptop via SD Card adapter. Pitty they revamped design so much it doesn't have such a good solution.</p>

<p>Friend herrzeba,you said only one thing about nokias no 1 camera N 808.With a 41MP camera nokia made people blind so that they are not seeing other side of it.firstly n8 body is made of silvery aluminium.n808 is plastic body.n808 can record and play 1080
 resolution videos.but screen resolution of n8 and n808 is same 640*360.what use of playing hi resolution videos on such a low resolution screen.and people with some knowledge know that a 720 video and 1080 video recorded with a mobile phones camera shows no
 difference at all,wheather it is n808 or iphone or any other phone.it is simply a marketing method.then a 41mp camera phone has only 1.3hz processor with 512 mb ram.and in practical we will only get some 240mb of ram.n8 has 256 mb but we get max 138mb.we all
 want a phone lke this as n8's brother, a screen resolution of 720p,768mb ram,minimum a dual core processor.screen size 4.5 with edge to edge display,full aluminium body, a more power full battery.every phone making companies are half fools.they are not making
 what people want. they are making what is in their dreams.what we really want is nokias camera combined with iphones display technology joined with a great hardware features.</p>

<p>Marketing is the thing, Graceboy9, I almost got caught.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>720 or 1080 is irrelevant when we don't see sharpness and quality of an expensive video camera. It only makes sense when viewing in low-res. So what's the point? Yeah, that's what people want. But after viewing
<a href="http://youtu.be/o7ho-poi9_Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this video</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/o7ho-poi9_Y?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/o7ho-poi9_Y?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div> I have to admit 808 looks much better than what we are used to with mobile phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't care that much about the body, be it aluminium or plastic, it's still pretty resistant. Especially if you are going to use hard cover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia's ram and processor are a bit let down, but Damian Dinning said during Barcelona Event, that the camera of 808 has dedicated camera chip built in which makes it work so fast and efficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, battery is hopless and apps are dissapointing. If Samusung or Apple brings something equal or bigger than 4 inches with better specs and 12mp camera, I will be switching in upcoming months. I don't care that much about 41mp marketing efforts.</p>

<p>Hi herrzeba,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 808 Pureview has a 1400mah battery unlike the N8's 1200mah Battery, it also supports battery swapping unlike the N8 so you can carry spares with you if your going out for the weekend etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This boost in mah should give you extra usage time as the resolution is not larger than the N8's and the O/S Software is the same so battery drain speed should actually be very similar (slightly less due to 4" slightly more due to a better processor setup)
 and the extra 200mah should give it about 5-14% extra life. (depending on what you do with it)<br />
<br />
Also if you use APPs like Ramblow to clear your ram of unused programs and</p>
<p>"Brightness Control" to set screen brightness to minimum (also with the Light Sensor off)</p>
<p>You can get significant more life from your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally went from charging 2 times a day + night time recharge on the N8 to be able to just charge at night after using the above APPs, with the exception of full on gaming or intensive web browsing for 3 hours which kills the battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do note: The screen in dirrect sunlight becomes very hard to read with the Light Sensor off, so consider that if going to the beach or similar remember to turn the Light Sensor back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found the phone easier to look at, at night time with the Light Sensor off also... as I found it far too bright at night with the default setup.</p>

<p>AS FOR FUNCTIONALITY</p>
<p>I think it all depends on what you want from your mobile phone. In the past you had to carry severeal gadgets with you - one for each purpose. Nowadays they can put several functions well enough into one device. What are the key devices we are talking about?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few:</p>
<p>- phone</p>
<p>- adress book (don't laugh, remember the old days!!!)</p>
<p>- diary with calendar etc.</p>
<p>- (GPS sattelite) navigation</p>
<p>- camera</p>
<p>- radio</p>
<p>- walkman/discman/mp3 player</p>
<p>- electronic translator (or even a dictionary)</p>
<p>- notebook</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a lot of stuff, right? So if someone manages to squeeze a few of these into one device small enough to fit in a pocket... I am happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment it's a toss up for me:</p>
<p>- phone+focus on notebook/applications/web access --&gt; Samsung Galaxy Note. Long battery life, good screen size, stylus (I am a long term Palm user). Almost no bad things, it's just a bit huge.</p>
<p>- phone+focus on navigation and camera --&gt; Nokia 808. Let's face it... it would be an upgrade to my 5800 and this is, what I use that mobile phone for at the moment. I don't need a super high-res screen for these 3 tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AS FOR BATTERY LIFE</p>
<p>This is a very important thing for me. With the 808 I would take a lot of photos at events where I don't want to bring my dSLR stuff. 1 weekend trip ~ 200 - 800 photos usually. Lets be fair and turn down numbers... we talk about a phone here... but still
 it would be ... ummm... 50-250 images. Consider taking them, reviewing on screen etc. Maybe even show around some. Think of a convention type of thing, street photography, catching a moment. Even newer consumer/prosumer cameras struggle with battery life at
 such usage profile. The 808 has 1 big advantage, though: no moving parts like zoom. Just the auto focus to spend energy on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd big part: navigation: at times my 5800 guides me well for 5hrs+ and looses just 1-2 bars, on other days it eats a full battery in less than 2hrs when navigating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary: I am VERY INTERESTED to know more about battery life of the 808.</p>

            The argument that video recording at 1080p or 720p is just marketing gimmick in 808 PureView because its screen resolution is 640 x 360 is laughably silly.<br />
<br />
It is there so you can enjoy those videos you captured on a big screen display back home at the captured resolution. Nobody has forces you to view it on the phone screen alone. Nokia has helpfully provided high quality video output and allows you to transfer
 the video to a home computer too.<br />
<br />
Do you watch all the videos you capture using camcorders only their view screens or on your TV?<br />
<br />
I agree it would have been better if the screen resolution had been increased though. May be to VGA at least as seen in my E6.

<p>We are discussing&nbsp; phone that have not come out yet.&nbsp; Also, we all agree there is not as many apps as iphone or android.&nbsp; The reason for that is because they have a greater share of the us market, which is still that worlds largest economy because americans
 are wasteful.&nbsp; Until Symbian gets that kind of market share iphone and android will always have more apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Nokia produce a symbian phone with large displays faster processors and more ram, then the symbian platform would have a greater market share.&nbsp; I for one love the symbian os and the nokia phones, but Nokia missed the boat on this one.&nbsp; Now us as consumers
 have deal with this</p>

            bbnaco,you dont understood what i mean.a video captured in 720p and 1080 in mobile phone looks just same whatever screen you see it, plasma,led, lcd.what is the use of this 41mp to common people. May be people who owns hollywood studios can make a movie
 with it.NOKIA SAYS TO CREATE A GOOD 5 OR 8MP PHOTOS, PHONE WILL TAKE ALL THE GOOD PIXELS AND CREATE A PERFECT PIC.SO FOR THAT WE HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE OF A 41MP SENSOR.I have a request to nokia,why dont they make a phone which will take photos automatically,
 that is if we go to some place phone will fly or run around all that place and take pics smartly.if people dont view videos on phone then a 320 *240 res is very best.and i think people dont carry a 50 or 60 inch screen where ever they go.what applications
 are there for symbian.is there is a good download manager for it.if we have to download something we have to use browser.nokia is smoking their heads over camera they dont want anything else.so is there is a good photo editing software for

            Have you seen any of the pictures/videos posted on the internet? They seem quite good to me. I am yet to see a single post on the internet that says the pictures are bad.<br />
I really appreciate good cameras on phone. I have an old 6220 Classic with 5MP Carl Zeiss camera and Xenon flash. I carry that as my 2nd phone just for its camera. When 808 comes out, if I can afford it I am surely buying it.<br />
As for software, past is past. Symbian was in a mess which led to nobody developing software for it. Now with Belle and Qt we are seeing lots of new software. Things may improve. Software will be written if there are enough buyers and that will only happen
 if they sell enough phones and that will happen when phones have some or other USP and PureView is indeed a USP for long time to come.<br />
There is a software called Download Manager in Nokia Store. It is supposed to support pause and resume. Please try it.

<p>Please have a look at some information about common problems and techniques of modern digital photography. You will find, that image stacking is used for two main reasons: increase DOF (depth of field) and NR (noise reduction).</p>
<p>The standard approach for NR is to take more than 1 photo of the same scenery and combine these (lets say 7 images). As digital noise is kinda random, chances are good, that only some of the 7 images have a noise pixel at a given point, where the other images
 show the true color/brightness.</p>
<p>Taking several images in a row is easy if you have a static scene with no moving objects and the same lighting conditions etc. - but it's very hard if not impossible to use it for everyday shots of people, sports etc. - and this is, what a camera handy will
 do: everyday photography. So if you can't take 7*5mp images in a row fast enough (like in a 1/250s, all together), what else can you do?</p>
<p>Nokia's approach is, to take one 35mp image and split it in 7 "grid-images" holding 5mp of data each. THIS can be done in 1/250s. Chances are, that only a few "neighbor" pixels will be noisy and the others show the true color/brightness. Combine the 7 "grid-images"
 and you get an image with less noise and more accurate color information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So YOU don't have to pay for a 41mp sensor. Choose another phone with a 5mp sensor and blame it for taking noisy images. However, IF image quality is important for you, then Nokias approach might be a reason to consider buying the 808.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your argument, that images and videos only have to be as big as the output device (i.e. the screen of the mobile phone): well, that depends. IF you only want to show images/video on the phone, you are right. If you plan on printing your photos or
 postprocess them and show these and the videos on a TV screen, you are wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just give it a thought: why do dSLR cameras take high resolution images bigger than their rather small monitor on the back can show?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for having a download manager or not in Symbian... I don't need one for my TV, fridge, car or other devices that have their own special purposes, including my dSLR camera, my phone and my car GPS navigation device. IF you need a mobile phone for heavy
 internet usage, the 808 might not be the one for you - it's that easy. To my mind it's a good ide to do things right and not only so-so. If the 808 can do the phone/navigation/photo job all in one device, what's wrong with it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for having my mobile phone flying around and taking photos automatically... I like that idea. Why don't you launch a company to build and sell such devices? Maybe as add-ons to existing mobile phones?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a nice weekend.</p>

<br />
<div>Depends on what data you want to get back.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are two things that only a restore to your last pre-update Zune backup will replace:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>text messages and other application data that doesn't get sync'd anywhere (e.g. Office documents that aren't sync'd with SkyDrive), and</li><li>application and 'phone configuration settings such as accounts, internet sharing, etc.</li></ul>
So the first thing to do is to decide how desperate you are to get those back (assuming that you've at some point updated your 'phone - otherwise this avenue is closed to you anyway - and also, obviously, assuming that the backup isn't too old to be any use).</div>
<div><br />
<div>So first, restore from a Zune backup if you can and want to. If you do, your 'phone will need re-updating, but I'm not going to cover that bit here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, whether you've restored or not, now make sure that all your 'phone settings are as you want them, especially your accounts.&nbsp;All the below assumes you use the same main Windows Live id as last time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can then start re-syncing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Email, contacts, calendar, Windows Live tasks, and anything that was sync'd to SkyDrive should sync with the cloud as normal and you should be able to get back to where you were, except for anything really newly entered that was only on the 'phone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Media should sync with Zune as normal and again&nbsp;you should be able to get back to where you were, except for any photo really newly taken that was only on the 'phone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you didn't restore, or if you've bought/downloaded apps since the backup, some or all of your apps will re-install automatically (Zune does this, but it seems that it doesn't always remember all of them). If any app doesn't re-install, go through the
 purchase process as when you originally bought the app - you won't be expected to pay again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now configure all automatically or manually re-installed app(s) as needed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any app that has its own sync mechanism should now sync as before.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope that covers most of it - if you need more info, just post again.</div>

<p><span><span>Please provide us more information:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) Mention the type of email accounts configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) or Exchange Server Account)?</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are referring to winmail.dat, this may occur if you are sending the emails in RTF format. You have to send the emails in plain text format and check if it helps. Open Outlook&gt; click on

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>Create a new mail with attachment, send it to yourself..........received OK?<br />
Usually a BT mail account is either pop, or IMAP</p>

<p>There is no specific BT setting regarding format</p>
<p>PS Another BT user, using a different version of MS Outlook has reported the same issue, he found that using plain txt format the mail passed the BT servers OK</p>
<p>So it would appear to be a BT specific issue</p>

            I am having a similar issue with Outlook 2016 running thru an exchange server. I have all the global settings on my end terminal set to send all messages in plain text but my receiver using windows 10 mail as their reader is getting all messages from me
 with attachments converted with winmail.dat attached. Would the exchange server switch them back to RTF for some reason?

<h3> momooak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#33; Flip-flopping pages and unwanted page numbering Word doc...</h2>
                    <p>First off, I am NOT very computer savvy, so the answer to my question may be simple. In any case, I've combed through stuff here, and I can't find the answers&nbsp;that I need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have written a book in Word 2013, and have the page sizing, margins, etc. correct.&nbsp; It took me awhile, but I think I got the page breaks right, with the exception of having a blank page before most chapters, which all are on&nbsp;odd-numbered pages, they look
 fine in the CreateSpace&nbsp;Interior Reviewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go back to look over the original doc in Word,&nbsp;I've noticed that it's hard for me to make any changes, due to the pages 'flip-flopping'. Also, I've noticed that while I have no page numbers entered&nbsp;(lost those when I started using the page breaks),
 the pages are 'counting' all over the place. 1 through 10, then 1,2...1 through 5, going back to 1 again, etc. ??? I'm assuming it has to do with the pagination, but I don't have a clue on how to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Things I need help with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Get rid of the flip-flopping pages</p>
<p>2. Get rid of the blank pages before the chapters. I don't mind the chapters starting on the left or the right. I'd rather use all of the page space that is available.
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Get my page numbers back on&nbsp;without screwing up the page breaks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that this is a lot, but if someone could help me, and/or direct me to the articles which would help me, I'd appreciate it a lot! (I do better with articles/answers with easy explanations and pics. lol)</p>

<p>OK, glad to hear that you are willing to spend some time learning.&nbsp; There is lots of free learning materials on the internet too. When you search for them, don't limit yourself to your specific version. Change in Office programs tends to be "evolutionary"
 rather than "revolutionary", gradual rather than earth shattering. Even the switch to the "ribbon" was primarily cosmetic.&nbsp; In other words training material for 2007 is 99% applicable to 2013. Even material for 2003 is still mostly relevant.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than going for a "dummies" book, they tend to be VERY kindergarden level, go to a book store and take a look at other Word books they have. There are lots of them. Most cover the basic information you want in the first few chapters, but they also
 cover much of the rest of the features in Word. And their price is only a few dollars more.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot use &#39;Send as Attachment&#39; from Word 2010</h2>
                    
<p><span><strong>Software used:<br />
</strong>OS - Windows XP Pro SP3<br />
Outlook 2010<br />
Word 2010</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Problem:<br />
</strong>Cannot use 'Send as Attachment' from File menu in Word.&nbsp; It doesn't open new email with new attachment if Outlook is open.&nbsp; If I close Outlook and Word and try again, it works.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Symptom:<br />
</strong>It seems that&nbsp;Outlook cannot be running when I try to send the email attachment from Word.&nbsp; With both programs running,&nbsp;I get a MAPI error from Word.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Error Message:<br />
</strong>Word couldn't send email because of MAPI failure: "Operation not supported".</span></p>
<p><span><strong>History of Troubleshooting:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Old Errors -<br />
"Mapi32.dll is invalid extended MAPI library" in the first error&nbsp;message and "Mail is not installed on your system" in a second error message from Word.</span></p>
<p><span>Tried to reinstall and repair of Office with no help.</span></p>
<p><span>Resolved Old Errors -<br />
Copied working file&nbsp;'OLMAPI32.dll' for Office 2010 from other computer running Windows 7.&nbsp;Replaced problem PC's OLMAPI32.dll in Office 14 directory.&nbsp; Ran FixMAPI.exe from System32 folder and restarted computer.&nbsp; That resolved the old errors and now we have
 the new one.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What works:<br />
</strong>Using Windows 7 and Office 2010 we have no issues like this.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Question:<br />
</strong>Is Office 2010 running inside Windows XP capable of using 'Send to Email' functionality across the entire office suite while Outlook is running?</span></p>

<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Kindly provide more information to assist you better.</div>
<div>1) What happens when you open Publisher or Publisher file? Mention if there are any error messages.</div>
<div>
<p>2) What do you mean by "Publisher 2013 was downloaded and installed outside of Office"? Is it a standalone application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Publisher Standalone version, you may uninstall using Easy Fix tool and reinstall it.</p>

            Hi Faizal,
<br />Is everyone using the same exchange server as you? Voting results are stored in a TNEF blob (winmail.dat file) attached to the email message and if the voter is on a different server, the message may be converted to HTML or plain text, which removes the vote information.  Antispam scanners can also remove it.

            It could be because you moved the message - unfortunately, AFAIK, you can't manually edit the vote responses (like you can edit meeting responses).

            Try adding a hidden text box, txtCountChecked, to the subform, with a ControlSource property of:<br />
<br />
=Sum(IIf([IsChecked],1,0))<br />
<br />
where IsChecked is the name of the Boolean field used for selecting a record.<br />
<br />
You can then reference the hidden text box with:<br />
<br />
=[frm_AddNewEventDataSubform].[Form].[txtCountChecked]<br />

<h2>            Shared Excel file font and formating gets disappear if users start updating same file.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I bumped into something strange on my&nbsp; O365 site pages.</p>
<p>I have a library, with an excel onto which lots of colleagues have to provide input to.
</p>
<p>The file in that library seems to lose its formatting again and again (like colored texting and columns and fonts… even column filters disappear.)</p>
<div>
<p>I prepared this file long time ago</p>
<p>and each time i had to redo the formatting</p>
<p>&nbsp;I mean</p>
<p>different fonts, colours, bold, etc...</p>
<p>but this formatting just dissapears.</p>
<div>
<p>no colours,no fonts, no nothing,plain excel</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Is this is problem you’re aware of?</p>

                </div>

<p>Hi Megha,</p>
<p>I cannot repro the issue from my side.</p>
<p>To look into the issue, could you confirm the following information?</p>
<p>1. When you find the file lose its formats? Does it happen just after you close the file after coauthoring then reopen it, or does it happen after some time?</p>
<p>2. Does the issue only happen to the coauthored file? How about a normal Excel file that only can edit by yourself?</p>
<p>3. Does the issue occur recently?</p>
<p>4. How about changing to other browsers? And, how about storing the affected file in another newly created library and site?</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any update.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Iris</p>

<p>Hi Iris,</p>
<p>Please find below answers to your question.</p>
<p>1. When you find the file lose its formats? Does it happen just after you close the file after coauthoring then reopen it, or does it happen after some time?</p>
<p>Ans - It seems that formatting is lost when other users edit (after checking out), &nbsp;information in that file and checking the file back in afterwards</p>
<p>2. Does the issue only happen to the coauthored file? How about a normal Excel file that only can edit by yourself?
</p>
<p>Ans- Don’t know, I’ve created a second folder and will ask a colleague to do some edits to the file I stored there</p>
<p>3. Does the issue occur recently?</p>
<p>Ans-Yes, we have this issue with a file we’ve been working on since a few months.</p>
<p>4. How about changing to other browsers? And, how about storing the affected file in another newly created library and site?</p>
<p>Ans - That is not an option. We’re cooperating with colleagues from all over the world to this file. And this kind of collaboration is done frequently, any additional steps are only creating confusion.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Megha</p>

<p>hi megha, <br />
<br />
thanks for the updates.<br />
<br />
please confirm if the user has chosen discard check out option when trying to check in the file. if so, all changes will be loose. they should click check in instead.
<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=67dd42db-61ef-4d73-828a-9d0599c8f046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d67dd42db-61ef-4d73-828a-9d0599c8f046" /></a><br />
<br />
if not, to further narrow down the issue, i would like to confirm the following information:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;are there any errors when users try to check in and check out the issue? if so, show me the screenshot. [click
<strong>use rich formatting-&gt;insert image</strong> to upload pictures]</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;imagine this, you have an excel file, there is a <strong>red a</strong> in a cell. then you share the excel file with
<strong>user b.</strong> he checked it out first, then open and add a <strong>red b</strong> in another cell in the file, then check in the file,. in this situation, what is exact scenario:
<br />
a: only the red color of <strong>red b</strong> disappear(<strong>b exists</strong>),
<br />
b: both the color of <strong>red a</strong> and <strong>red b</strong> disappear(a and b exists)<br />
c: only <strong>red a</strong> is there. <strong>red b</strong> disappears.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;to identify the cause scope, please do the following test then show me the outcome.<br />
a: create another excel file in another library to test.<br />
b: test coauthoring the excel file without checking out/checking in.<br />
<br />
please let me know the update at your convenience. <br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<h2>            Hyperlink to ppt slide prevents animations from appearing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>here's a weird bug I found:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Create a hyperlink (picture or text), linking to slide X in the same presentation.</p>
<p>- If slide X contains animations, they won't appear, and you have to click to pass them until next slide appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- This bug only appears if you save the presentation (If you try to test this problem on an unsaved document, you will not be able to reproduce it).</p>
<p>- The problem also appears on a colleague's mac with ppt 2016.</p>
<p>- The problem does not appear on another mac with an older ppt presentation.</p>
<p>- my mac: mac os Sierra 10.12.6&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do other people observe the same bug ? Do you have a potential solution ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To clarify your concern, may we know if you already tried completing the installation by following the process? Because some updates can only be installed after you restart your program or computer.<br />

            Im just curious, did you actually tried clicking "Quit" and it actually happened that the AutoUpdate restarted from installing the same update? Hence the loop issue.<br />
<br />
If you are using an older version of AutoUpdate, you may want to install an updated version. Try this link:

            <p>Hi Zach,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install the update manually, but the result was the same. I watch the update download, but when it comes to the end, I am advised that I must quit the MS AutoUpate function to complete the installation. And when I do that, the loops begins anew.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether I am using the current or older version of Update. When I subscribed to Office, I got the 2016 version. However, I was working with a book publisher that was using an outdated version of Word, 2003 no less. To edit the manuscript, I
 had to activate macros. Initially, I ran into trouble, and the editor suggested I download an earlier version of it. So I downloaded the 2011 version. Do you think that has something to do with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just looked at my applications, and the icons there for the various Office programs differ from those in my dock. Would you suggest I delete what I think are the older programs and download the 2016 version from scratch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit of a technodunce, so I have no idea of what I've gotten myself into or what to do to make things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>

            <p>You can try reinstalling Office 365. But since this is Mac, I am not sure if it will solve the issue. If it will, it will surely save you time instead of waiting for someone on this forum who got an answer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You already tried doing some troubleshooting, so reinstalling Office 365 may not hurt.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After you reinstalled Office, if you want, you can just disable AutoUpdate to check or install updates for your Mac (set to manual checking). See here:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Check-for-Office-for-Mac-updates-automatically-bfd1e497-c24d-4754-92ab-910a4074d7c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />

And then you can just install Office updates manually. Check here: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I worked around the problem by deleting all the Microsoft files in my applications and downloading MS Office 365 a second time. That seems to have added all the updates I'd been unable to make.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I receive notice of updates the next time, I'll try to upload them, but it may be the only way to keep current is to start from scratch, though that is far from ideal.</p>

            It appears the problem was introduced with macOS X Sierra. &nbsp;The AutoUpdater downloads updates but will not install them. &nbsp;I run Office 365 on two machines. &nbsp;Microsoft did something to fix one machine by remote access. &nbsp;When I called for the second machine,
 I got a clueless support tech who could not accomplish a thing. &nbsp;I think Microsoft support has not yet got their heads around this problem.

            <p>Well, at least I know the problem is not on my end, and for that I am relieved and thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not at all surprised to hear of your experience with MS support. "Clueless" is the right word. I subscribed to Office 365 only because I had to for freelance assignments. I edit manuscripts for publishers, and almost across the board, they use MS Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Early on, I had a problem with tracking my changes. They were appearing in a column at left in one chapter, while in another chapter, they showed up at right in a much more visible and useful way. I spoke to two, I think, MS techs, and both were convinced
 it had to do with the macros I had to instal for the university press that was my client. They were so stumped, they sent me to a special tech support that would have cost me $400. In lieu of that, they put me in touch with an "MS engineer," who agreed that
 the problem lay all in the macros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In utter frustration I sent a screenshot of the two chapters to the production editor at the university press.</p>
<p>She wrote back right away and said all I had to do was change the view at the bottom of Word, clicking on a different icon. Duh. I'm a technodunce, but you'd assume MS tech support worth its salt would be able to figure this out. No such luck. So glad I've
 always worked with Macs. PCs and the MS stranglehold are for the birds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my problem, I think I'll continue to redownload Office when there are updates. From what you say, it's hit or miss with MS tech support, and it's not worth asking them for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much.</p>

            <p>Hi Annette,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the most part backing up the database and doing as Save As are the same.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The benefit to using the Back Up Database option is that it will back it up in the file format<span>&nbsp;
</span>you are currently using and it include the date the backup was done within the file name.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 700 - Free up space in C&#58;Phone memory &#43; Delete Data.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I am new to the forum. So if this is posted in the wrong section, I do appologize.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of issues with my Nokia 700, and have done for some time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#1.) Whenever I start my phone, I get a pop up message. Saying, "Memory Low. Delete or move some date from C:Phone memory". I have hardly anything in the folder, and I was wondering how I will be able to resolve the issue. There isn't even enough space to
 install Nokia updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2.) Whenever I go to open a text message, a pop up message shows and says, "Messaging. Not enough memory to perform operation. Delete some data first". &nbsp;At the current moment, I have 2 sent messages and 2 new and unopened messages. I am unable to open them.
 I was wondering if anyone had the same issue, and how they resolved it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            in this case, you will need to visit your nearest Nokia Care outlet with proof of purchase/ownership, for them to reset your security codes.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I can record negative actuals, if I use a Material resource, but what if I wanted to forecast a credit note or a reduction of&nbsp;any sort of cost (and no, I can't nett it off)??</p>

            You can record a negative value in the Fixed Cost field. Add the field to a task table (Left side of Gantt chart view) and record the negative value.

            The fixed cost field may also be added to the time phased side of the Task Usage view.&nbsp; You may also assign materials on a per day rate as needed.&nbsp; As the duration of the task increases or decreases, you can increase or decrease the costs.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - Build 14936 - Family Safety no longer works for child accounts</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to 14936, all of my child accounts have full access to the computer. Family Safety has no effect. Prior to this build everything seemed to be working properly. I have my children's accounts set "Block access all day" so that they have to
 request permission anytime that they log in. With 14936 (including 14942), my children are able to login unchecked. In addition, none of the other safety settings (i.e.&nbsp;App Content restrictions, Web Browsing, etc.) are working either.</p>

Want to try out software that’s still in development and like sharing your opinion about it.<br />
Don’t mind lots of updates or a UI design that might change significantly over time.<br />
Really know your way around a PC and feel comfortable troubleshooting problems, backing up data, formatting a hard drive, installing an operating system from scratch, or restoring your old one if necessary.<br />
Know what an ISO file is and how to use it.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">This is beta software and the Redstone &nbsp;builds require lots of code changes, so what worked before might not work now,. Post your comments in the Feedback Hub.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you hawkeyes46. This is the exact reason why I have the Insider Preview build installed on a couple of machines (in order to test and validate these kinds of issues). I apologize if my original post sounded like I was complaining to Microsoft that
 their beta version of Windows 10 wasn't working 100%. This was not my intention at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a seasoned developer and very familiar with the risks of running beta software, but if nobody reports the issues, they may get overlooked. Isn't that one of the primary purposes of the Insider Preview program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record. I am very familiar how to do all of the above tasks. I have several computers at my house... only 2 of them are on the Fast Ring Insider Preview (my primary computer and one of the four&nbsp;computers set aside for my kids to use). One of the
 common issues with Windows 10 has been with the Microsoft Family Safety integration (even with the production releases). This is why I have one of my child computers on the Fast Ring so that I can test that everything still works in future releases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes... I know how to troubleshoot, backup data, format a hard drive, install the OS from scratch (in fact I just did that yesterday), and I definitely know what an ISO file is.</p>
