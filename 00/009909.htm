    <title>Backing up outlook 2016 automtically - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Backing up outlook 2016 automtically</h2>
                    <p>After several conversations with the techs from Microsoft I am even moire confused about backing up my outlook app to a cloud or to the microsoft server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short I had to replace my computer and as it turns out my original outlook set up on the old computer was set up as a pop account. &nbsp;I was informed that since it was a pop account it was not backed up. &nbsp;After some work they were finally able to
 restore my outlook account from my old computer and transfer to my new computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of my folder setup, my saved emails in those folders, contacts, calendars, to do's etc. &nbsp;my new outlook is set up as IMAP, does this mean it is automatically backed up so that if I lose or my computer gets stolen I can set up a new outlook on a
 new one that will be copied from my old one? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if not is the best way to ensure I have the date to do an automatic backup to one drive every night?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>An IMAP or Exchange mail account data file is a local cache copy of what is on the mail server, so no backup required. (IMAP is mail only)</p>
<p>You simply add the same mail account to your mail program to sync the data with the server</p>
<p>Calendar/People/Tasks in an IMAP account are somewhat different</p>

<p>On the original PC any pst data file could have been included in your default win backup process</p>

            Hi Jeremiah,<br />
<br />
The add-in may need to be updated to run on 64-bit systems by the developer. As this is a third-party add-in, we suggest contacting the developer to make them aware of this.<br />
<br />

    <title>Location of save file moves on desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmcdona01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Location of save file moves on desktop</h2>
                    I am very OCD when it comes to where I save my files on my desktop. I usually keep most of my new word documents on the right side of the desktop. When I open one up to edit it and then save it, it suddenly moves to the lowest lefthand position on the
 desktop. It has done this for a long time, but it is really starting to annoy me. It is almost like Word creates a temp file, and then saves it in the temp file's location and deletes the original. I would like to be able to set it so that it will save it
 in the current location and stop rearranging it to the left side.<br />
How do I do this?<br />

            I agree with Doug that the desktop is a poor place to store Word documents, particularly because of the temp files that Word creates whenever you edit. At most, you should put shortcuts on the desktop, pointing to documents in other folders.<br />
<br />
There are a number of free utilities that will save the locations of desktop icons so that, when they move for any reason, you can restore them with a click. A couple of them are mentioned in the thread at

<h2>            Windows 10 mobile email app&#59; sync &#38; sounds</h2>
                    <p>Howdy folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lumia 650 updated itself to build 10.0.10586.218 a couple of days ago.&nbsp; Since then, my Office 365 account seems to sync whenever it wants to, as opposed to "when items arrive", which is what I specified.&nbsp; Sometimes it takes 5 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also no longer plays any notification sound when messages arrive, no matter what sound is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking of sounds, does anyone know how to preview sounds&nbsp;before selecting them?&nbsp; This used to be a standard feature for all phones goin back to Symbian ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>You asked how to preview the sound - I told you how. the fact that the button works or not is a different matter. if you had bothered to explain that you already tried the button and it didn't work, you would've saved us both some time.</p>

<p>This play part of that selection drop-down menu works here, but challenges me every time:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you long press, the menu closes (should stay open).</li><li>If you press on the name, the sound is selected but not played (should be played).</li></ul>
<p>Because of that, I tap on the left border of the drop-down menu ‚Äì very shortly ‚Äì then, the sound plays for me, even in OS build
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/54a41a2c-c28b-4c44-9f01-dfee82aaf2d0">
.218</a>. If that still does not work for you, where in the phone menu are you exactly? Perhaps there is another software usability bug being around. If that did not help, your ringtone/sound database might be broken. I have to see, if I find a similar thread
 about.</p>

<p>I cannot comment on this. Therefore, I recommend to create new thread just with this issue. Then, your are able to create a more concise subject/headline, which might attract a more specialized enthusiast. Here in Microsoft Answers and thanks to the openness
 of the Internet, people untrained in Computer Science or Customer Support are able to answer. Some try to answer everything but are not about to help/understand your concern. This can lead to misunderstandings and frustrations. Anyway, in that new thread,
 please, specify which Office 365 subscription type you are using (Personal, Home, Business, ‚Ä¶) and whether that E-mail account is part of your primary Microsoft account, or work Microsoft account, or if that is just an additional E-mail account. Furthermore,
 please, mention which network operator you use, in which country. Furthermore, if you tried via Wi-Fi as well, which Internet Service Provider you use, in which country. Might not be related at all, especially because it worked before in previous OS builds,
 but it could help to answer your issue ‚Äì or stated differently: Mentioning it, does not hurt.</p>

</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply.&nbsp; I followed your advice on the sound preview and got it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the settings for the Outlook notification sounds and they are all correct.&nbsp; All other app notification sounds work properly.&nbsp; Switching to a different sound for Outlook doesn't help.&nbsp; This was working properly prior to the latest update.</p>

<h2>            Keep &#40;not remove&#41; Duplicate Data</h2>
                    
<p>I have two spreadsheets; I copied the data I needed from each to a new sheet.&nbsp; The first column is a list of companies, the second a dollar amount.&nbsp; From the second sheet I copied another list of companies to the third column, and their dollar amount to
 the fourth column.&nbsp; What I want to do is to KEEP (ideally highlight) the duplicate information from each company.&nbsp; If it matters, the second list is longer than the first, but the same companies are in both.</p>
<p>I tried using a filter on both company columns, without luck.&nbsp; Please help -- I'm a fairly novice Excel user.&nbsp; Thanks so much.</p>

<p>Do you want to do this one company at a time or do all unique companies at once. If the latter, how do you want to tell each company apart? Can there be sometimes NO dup and sometimes more than TWO. Always best to fully explain in the FIRST post along wwtih
 EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>What I really want&nbsp;is to be able to see just the unique companies and dollar amounts at once, like above.&nbsp; If I can't do that, than just highlight the companies with the same names would be very helpful.&nbsp; Of course, the list is not in the same order for
 each company column since there are more companies in column 3, so just alpha sorting doesn't really work.&nbsp; Does that help?</p>

            The ultimate goal is to see companies that have the same name and same dollar amount, but if I can just show the companies with the same name, that would be great.&nbsp; I'd like to be able to do this quickly, not one company at a time.&nbsp; There were about 50
 companies in the first list and 200 in the second.&nbsp; Is that helpful?

<h3> ¢µºΩ∞Òè õµ¥∏  say:</h3>
<h2>            Impossible to use brackets in Outlook.com rules</h2>
                    <p>Hello, when I make a new rule to automatically move a message based on it's topic, Outlook.com strip the brackets of the rules, for example, if I wish to move everything that has "[jitsi]" in the topic, Outlook.com will force me "jitsi" wich is not the same,
 I don't want a mail from a friend putting jitsi in the topic to be moved there, and i know a friend will never take the time to put jitsi in brackets like the mailing list does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make this forcing stop ? Microsoft doesn't know what I need, I don't need their automatic assistance to create rules, I already know what I want.</p>

            <p>Problem is it was working correctly before rules revamp, older rules with brackets still works, this is frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the rules to be server side because the mail should be moved to another folder before mobile clients try to sync and not after, to save bandwidth.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation, we suggest you adding the calendar first in OWA (Outlook web app) as a workaround. To open a shared calendar in OWA: navigate to calendar tab in OWA&gt; right click
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, may I ask what permission level has been set up on the calendar?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<p>I will try to explain the problem better. My android version is 6.0.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Microsoft account and e-mail I subcribe is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (alias).</p>
<p>I use 2-step verification for password..</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I downloaded word, excel,...and OneDrive to ANDROID. I signed up without any problems. I have problem only with MS calendar and contact. Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm trying add account on ANDROID, because I want to sync my calendar and contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tap accounts -&gt; choose Outlook -&gt; insert e-mail adress&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (alias MS account) -&gt; choose&nbsp; change account provider -&gt; I can choose (office, outlook, exchange) -&gt; I click Outlook -&gt; sign up with MS account and 2-step verification -&gt; passwords
 are OK -&gt; then I have to set up IMAP... I don't want use client I only want my calendar and sync contact with MS account on ANDROID...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any easily way how to set up? Should I set up something in MS account?</p>
<p>I lost few days and my nerves tell me slowly export contact to Gmail and start use Gmail calendar, because it take few minutes only :-D :-D

<p>Easiest thing to do is install the Outlook app from the Play Store.&nbsp; Once you've added your Outlook.com account to this you can go into the account settings and enable "Sync contacts".&nbsp; This will allow you to see your contacts from the Android Contacts app,
 it will also allow the phone to use your Outlook contact list to identify callers.</p>

<p>I went through the same process moving from my Windows phone so I know the pain :)&nbsp; Outlook client doesn't support alias which is why you are seeing the issue.&nbsp; You need to login to your Microsoft account (https://account.microsoft.com) from a PC.&nbsp; Click
 on "Your Info" and then select "Manage your sign-in email or phone number" then select "Add an email alias" and create an alias, this can be called anything you want but make sure it has the @outlook.com domain name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, so when you setup your email you open the Outlook client and then click to add and account and then add your normal email which will be an IMAP account, details for the mail server your provider will be able to give you.&nbsp; Once that is done then add another
 account, again enter your email address and this time select "Outlook.com" from the options and enter your newly create alias *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and login.&nbsp; Now you'll be able to see your contacts and calendar etc.</p>

Finally, I managed to sign in to my account and see my calendar. I'm happy. :-D :-D
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I haven't seen contact neither in ANDROID contact or in Outlook client..yet. There is only calendar? Will I have to do any another steps?</p>

<p>Glad you got it working, make you appreciate how simple Windows phone was to use/setup :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the contacts you need go into settings in the Outlook app, then tap on the @outlook.com account and there you will see the sync contacts option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way to sync the calendar to the Android calendar app, at least I've not found a way so I've just kept to using the calendar from within the Outlook app.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's indeed weird. Have you tried another carrier by using "manual network selection"?</p>
<p>Alternatively, can you check in your settings if your carrier is using a proxy server which might not be supported from a foreign network?</p>
<p>Last but not least it might be the DNS settings (if used), maybe the DNS server isn't accessible from roaming networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In which country are you and which network do you try?</p>

<h2>            Export selected sheets as separate pdf file</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need help to create macro to export certain selected sheets as separate pdf files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. An excel file is open</p>
<p>2. It contains several sheets</p>
<p>3. It also contains a sheet named "Index"</p>
<p>4. Column A of the sheet "Index" contains name of some of the sheets form the same file.</p>
<p>5. Need to create macro that will export each of the sheets that are mention in range A1, A2 and so on in the sheet "Index"</p>
<p>5. Each pdf file should be saved at a specific location (at ruta4, refer code given below)</p>
<p>6. Each pdf file should be named like (yyyy-mmm-dd) and (sheet name)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using below code to create directory. Need help to create macro to select sheets and save these sheets as separate pdf files.<br />
</p>
<p>Sub ExportPdf()<br />
</p>
<p>Dim wb As Workbook</p>
<p>Set wb = ThisWorkbook</p>
<p>Dim ruta As String, ruta2 As String, ruta3 As String, ruta4 As String, nFile As String</p>
<p>nFile = Format(Date, "dd-mmm-yyyy")</p>
<p>ruta = wb.Path &amp; "\"</p>
<p>ruta2 = ruta &amp; "export\"</p>
<p>If Dir(ruta2, vbDirectory) = Empty Then</p>
<p>MkDir ruta2</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>ruta3 = ruta2 &amp; "PDF\"</p>
<p>If Dir(ruta3, vbDirectory) = Empty Then</p>
<p>MkDir ruta3</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>ruta4 = ruta3 &amp; nFile &amp; "\"</p>
<p>If Dir(ruta4, vbDirectory) = Empty Then</p>
<p>MkDir ruta4</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Macro to create pdf as above steps and save it to ruta4 location&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />

<h2>            File History not actually storing any data.  WI version 14295.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just noticed that my File History isn't being stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/adbaf808-14e1-4c77-b29f-afa828e3bbf7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/adbaf808-14e1-4c77-b29f-afa828e3bbf7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have formatted the external drive, ensured that the File History and Volume Shadow Copy services are both on automatic and running and File History seems to think it is working but no data is written.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the logs I see I am getting the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38e0a4e3-347d-4b0d-a745-7eaa4833230d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38e0a4e3-347d-4b0d-a745-7eaa4833230d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched through previous answers but have yet to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            <p>Out of curiosity Ian have you noticed this in earlier builds? Have you updated to b.14342 yet and does this happen with the latest builds? I don't use File History I use Back Up and Restore (Windows 7) instead.</p>
<p>Also I assume that you have reported this in Feedback hub?</p>

            <p>First of all, thank you for the notification about the build. &nbsp;How odd as I only recently went to 14295 but sure enough, there was an update waiting for a reboot. &nbsp;I rather like the changes. :)<br />
<br />
Alas, File History is doing the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5e678ae-3ec8-4c97-a84d-3772123f10cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5e678ae-3ec8-4c97-a84d-3772123f10cb" /><br />
<br />
</a>Unfortunately, I don't know whether this was happening in previous builds as I left WI for a while due to problems with disc space and WI installation not working when it gave the option to use a different drive during the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now on build 14393 and have yet to see ANY File History backup. &nbsp;I can hit "Backup now" and the system goes through the motions but nothing is created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it doesn't seem to be a wide-spread problem is it possible it is my profile? &nbsp;If so, what is recommended, please?</p>

            <p>Any chance you can share the URL to the Sway with the example comparisons (remember this is a public forum)?&nbsp; If you don't want to share the Sway, can you make a new Sway with some examples of what you're referring to and share that?&nbsp; Screenshots can be
 a useful illustration too.</p>

<h2>            MS Security Scanner using 100&#37; CPU, yet should be idle. Has it become infected with virus&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>I'm watching MsMPEng using anywhere between 36-100% cpu, but it's not time for a scheduled scan of my system.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I'm "idle" and not doing anything -- so since it's only supposed to be active when I download things or run programs, is it taking that
 much cpu power to scan my computer when I'm doing nothing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shouldn't it be idle when I am (or unless it is doing a scheduled background scan)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>LTE or no LTE on 640 XL Dual Sim - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasperglasbergen  say:</h3>
<h2>            LTE or no LTE on 640 XL Dual Sim</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a Lumia 640 XL Dual Sim from Microsoft Store Spain, and according to customer service and the technical specs on the site it should have several LTE bands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somehow I cannot select 4G as highest connection speed, there is only 2G and 3G. When I put the simcard back into my old Android (4G) phone, I have 4G without a problem. I am using the exact same APN settings for my provider (KPN in the Netherlands) and
 both the phones should have LTE band 20 (800).</p>
<p>The model on the back of my Lumia 640 XL Dual Sim is RM-1067. Could it be that I received the wrong phone, without LTE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist.</p>

<p>I think your response misses my question. I agree it's easy enough to save the file but when searching for it later my windows applications don't readily show the PDF files rather they're only displaying Word and Excel files and seemingly hiding the PDF
 files? When I type search for PDF files in the search box there is no clear and ready response which simply takes me to the PDF files or their location. For some reason it appears that PDF files are rendered invisible as though there is a default setting in
 Windows that sets aside this type of file extension</p>

            I will reread and follow your suggestion when I'm near a computer to see if that provides a solution to more easily locating these currently difficult to find PDF files which I haven't been able to turn up using searches on Explorer or OneDrive

<h2>            New Datacentre Regions - When will my tenant be migrated&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi O365 Community,</p>
<p>With the Microsoft data-centres being brought on-line across Melbourne and Sydney, it was announced that&nbsp;Office 365 tenants currently hosted in Singapore ‚Äì&nbsp;previously the closest Office 365 location ‚Äì will see Exchange Online and SharePoint Online services
 moved to Microsoft's Australian points of presence. Hoorah! There is light piercing through the end of the tunnel!</p>
<p>This announcement was music to many O365 admins ears, especially as the latency experienced by users in Australia accessing tenants hosted in Singapore (predominantly using OWA) has become one of the most prominent issues within my organisation - well at
 least that;s the noise coming in from the service desk - but a quick search through a few well known on-line communities highlights that this is an issue being faced by many. MS has provided a comprehensive plan, albeit very high level, via the MSDN blogs
 (links below) - great stuff. These posts detail that migrations will begin in September 2015 and continue for several months. OK great, I can live with that.</p>
<p>Fast forward 8 months - May 2016. Our tenant is still in Singapore and the latency faced by OWA users is still racking up daily service desk enquiries. Requests to MS support around any indication as to when our organisations tenant may be moved (even a
 high-level target such as Q32016 would be acceptable) has been futile. The most information support can provide is, "You will be notified two weeks prior to your move, please continue to check your message centre." Escalating to our account manager and customer
 success relationship manager has yielded identical results. Scouring the internet, forums and on-line communities provides no hints either.</p>
<p>There has been no MS announcements, blog posts or updates (well that I could find anyway) that provide any inkling as to the progress of the migrations - even a rough percentage would be nice to know. I&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">So to the point, fellow O365 community members</span> --&gt; Has anyone been able to find an update to the tenant migrations (specifically Singapore to Australia) that details the progress, expected completion date....or
 anything...anything at all.</p>
<p>Are we talking weeks, months, years or should we start looking Gmail?</p>

<p>Hi Aread007 --&gt; We signed up to the same beta program too! Have not heard anything as to its outcome. Fingers are still crossed though.</p>
<p>Hi Ran --&gt; Thanks for your private message, I've replied with the information you have requested. Hopefully you have everything you need.</p>
<p>Hi Daizy --&gt; Not surprise you can't provide any further information on the status of tenant migrations. I also don't know how you can say "We will assist you promptly to address the issues." when the root cause is the location of our data and it's distance
 from our end users.</p>
<p>I've been wanting to avoid extreme measures such as manually migrating mailboxes to a newly provisioned tenant in AU --&gt; However MS support has strongly advised against this and suggested to wait for the scheduled migration.
</p>
<p>Someone, somewhere has a list of tenants and a proposed migration date in the next column. Can you please ask this person?</p>
<p>M</p>

            <p>I'm in the 'same' opposite boat - I'm an Aussie in Singapore having recently relocated and setup a new company here.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ticked all the right boxes on the O365 migration in March and all the correct OST migration happened here in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was blindingly
 fast for the first few months, yes much higher than Australia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However have noticed it's been slow for a couple of weeks, and I've just checked today, and bugger me - they've moved my O365 tenant to Sydney.!&nbsp;&nbsp; I've double checked and all billing is being done from Singapore, all addresses are Singapore but traceroute
 shows Sydney.&nbsp;&nbsp; OMG.!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How seriously annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it makes a mockery of the above cases been waiting (in some cases beta) for just the opposite to happen - sorry Mitch and Aread007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe that's why I've been having so many OneDrive Business sync issues lately (or maybe that's just OneDrive Business not being up to scratch yet)&nbsp;. . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts anyone.?</p>

            <p>Not to rub salt in those fresh wounds of yours, but our tenant has been successfully migrated to the AUS data centers and we are firing on all cylinders now! The latency drops have created an all-round improvement for users across all environments --&gt; Citrix,
 Mobile, OWA... you name it...it's better to some degree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@David - That would be beyond frustrating, I think my head would explode if that happened over here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Food for thought - you may have a case to jump up and down if you did not receive a prompt in your message centre? Do you know if you received one of those 'Plan for Change' notifications about the move? If not, I'd be livid!</p>

            The older installs had a stage that said we are getting a few things ready for you. Now the skip that and go directly to your desktop so you can watch thing being setup. Some times it takes a little bit for everything to show up but it sounds like something
 went wrong on your system. So you might have to do a Reset and see if it will help&gt;:)

    <title>Access 2016 Date function not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterscurrah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2016 Date function not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an access application that has been working perfectly until I installed Access 2016.&nbsp; Now, the following VBA code snippet returns an error:</p>
<p>MySQL = "SELECT TOP 1 Event.ID FROM Event WHERE (((Event.EventDate)&gt;=Date()) And ((Event.CarnivalID)= " + CStr(intID) + ")) ORDER BY Event.ID;"</p>
<p>Set rs = CurrentDb.OpenRecordset(MySQL)</p>
<p>The error is "Undefined function Date in expression"</p>
<p>When I create a new query using the value of MySQL </p>
<p>SELECT TOP 1 Event.ID FROM Event WHERE (((Event.EventDate)&gt;=Date()) And ((Event.CarnivalID)= 9)) ORDER BY Event.ID;</p>
<p>and run this query, I of course get the same error</p>
<p>When I enter ?Date in the immediate mode I am returned todays date, so the Date function is working.</p>
<p>I have checked all references and none are "missing"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This exact code works find under all version of Access prior to 2016 - can you help please</p>
<p>

                    <p>Hi guys, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded to Office 2016 and found out that I cannot add multiple animations to an object, for example, I want to move and object right (On Click) then down (On Click) - meaning 2 separated animations using Path, how can I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I can't seem to figure out how to customize the ribbon, I have been looking around this forum but answers have been from 2015 so they might be outdated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>

            <p>Hi An Phi,</p>
<p>To use two or more animations on an object, all you need to do is select the image, add your first animation, then click off of the picture. Now when you click on the picture and then a animation, it will add another event to it!</p>
<p>Im not sure about part 2 of your question unfortunately though. Hopefully this helps you for now!</p>
