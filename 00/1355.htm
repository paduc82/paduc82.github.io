<h2>            Microsoft Spelling and grammar checker Office 365 - UK English</h2>
                    <p>For anyone who likes baking out there, we might ask why is 'Self raising flour' rejected by the grammar checker. It suggests putting in a hyphen. Checking on-line, most manufactures of this product do not include a hyphen, but Nigella Lawson does as do some
 others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay... I give in! Add the hyphen. Now I get another error; 'raising' is rejected with 'rising' suggested as a substitute. Do any of you bakers out there use 'Self-rising flour'?&nbsp; I've always called it 'Self raising flour'. So does McDougals and Homepride.
 Not the bakers at Microsoft though it seems...</p>

            Hi Chris,
<br />
<br />This forum is for people trying to get help with making Word work. What you really have is a suggestion for a change to the grammar checker. (Although I agree with the hyphen.) Unfortunately, the people who can make changes to the program seldom see anything posted in this forum.
<br />
<br />You can make such a suggestion through the Feedback available under the File button or by posting a suggestion here. <a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304924-word-for-windows-desktop-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304924-word-f...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

    <title>Moving text with footnotes within a document - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Moving text with footnotes within a document</h2>
                    I'm working on a rather large academic paper and when I move text from one place to another within the paper it does NOT bring the footnotes with it.&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp; Anyone have any idea what is off in the settings that would cause this?

<br />
I know that is the way it is supposed to work.&nbsp; And I wish it did work that way.&nbsp; But the problem is that it isn't working that way.&nbsp; Whether I copy and paste text, including the footnote code created in References, cut and paste, or copy to a new document
 completely, it will not bring the footnote reference code nor the footnote text to the new location.

<br />
That's the problem.&nbsp; Operator error.&nbsp; Word has at least three ways to cut and paste.&nbsp; One does not bring the footnotes with it.&nbsp; I was selecting the "text" icon from the dropdown menu and didn't realize that meant plain text with no formatting or imbedded references.&nbsp;
 Thanks for your help and I apologize for not figuring this out sooner.&nbsp;

<h2>            Excel is slow in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After upgrade to Windows 10 had no problem this week. Until Edge got loaded (not my keys or wish!). Now&nbsp;Excel 2013&nbsp;so slow; right click to select Formatting cell is slow; and choice box hardly ever comes up within 5 minutes! Every other few minutes the Zoom
 box goes off on its own and defaults to custom - obviously random larger or smaller. It makes most programmes un-useable. Can you/one automatically uninstall Edge? P.G.Thompson</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got no notification when someone replied to my last post. Found&nbsp;it a good Community response by one person&nbsp;( but knowing about it was by various means and accident). I had ticked the notify box. Philip.</p>

            Below are general troubleshooting steps to solve various problems in Excel. Try them one by one and check the result after each step -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors. If Feb 10, 2016 update (KB3114717) is installed, this should be uninstalled.<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-Office-and-your-computer-with-Microsoft-Update-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5<br />
<br />
2. Perform Quick Repair of the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
6. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
7. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
8. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
9. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
10. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
11. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
12. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
13. If above don't solve your problem, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license
 keys ready before you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

<h2>            How to forward all incoming e-mails, to another e-mail address</h2>
                    Hi, sorry if this has been answered before, I tried a few searches and no results came up, but then again I wasn't really sure what to search for.<br />
<br />
I, as many others, have decided to leave microsoft's e-mail service and use gmail instead. I would like to know how I can just forward all of the incoming e-mails on my outlook.com e-mail address, to another e-mail address?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<p>Are you using an email client? If yes, then you really cannot follow the steps that Marco_Mi provided because that's supposed to be done via web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please go to this <a href="http://outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>, sign in your Microsoft account, then you can now follow Marco_Mi's instructions.</p>

                    Hi everyone. Im having a problem with my bluetooth on nokia E65. The bluetooth is switched on an shown to all, but other devices cannot find me and I cant find them. I tried restoring the phone by *#7370# twice and still does not work. Where could the
 problem be? Thankyou.

            Hello<br />
<br />
I guess you may have a fault with your handset, but just running through the 4 option under bluetooth:<br />
<br />
Bluetooth: On<br />
My Phone's visibility: Show to all<br />
My Phones name: xxxxxx - keep this short with no special symbols<br />
Remote SIM Mode: Off

            Mine is visible and pairs ok but I can't get it to connect automatically to my Motorola HFW8000 car kit. I've tried pairing in both headset and handsfree modes and setting as authorised but when the ignition is turned on and the kit tries to establish
 a connection absolutely nothing happens on the phone.<br />
<br />
The kit works fine with other bluetooth handsets and the E65 work (links automatically) with my Nokia earpiece (can't remember the model no. but its the one that hangs round your neck and has a lift out earpiece held on a magnet).<br />
<br />
I should also say that the E65 will connect to the car kit manually and seems to work ok.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts anyone?

            My E65 will not pair/connect to my Motorola IHF 1000 car kit. I have tried other (branded and unbrabded) "E" sereies Nokia's and they wont pair either. They also wont pair with my colleagues BMW factory fit car kit (I think the factory fit car kits are
 Motorola components) and I believe its the same with VW and others.<br />
<br />
Does any one know how to fix this? Possibly intstall a defferent Bluetooth stack?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

 how to correct that.

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Try opening excel in safe mode.
<br />
<br />Windows + R, then type excel.exe /safe
<br />
<br />Disable the addins
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />
<br />And try opening excel in normal mode again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work perform an Office repair

            This would be a generic message about activating Microsoft Office. If you have not purchased
<strong>and paid for</strong> a copy of Office 2013 (or some earlier version) or <strong>
paid for</strong> a subscription of Office 365, then you don't have access to Office unless perhaps there is a copy of Office 2010 Starter on your machine.

<br />
Please confirm exactly which version of Office you have, one of the Office 365 bundles or one of the Office 2013 "local installs"?<br />
<br />
If you have 365, then the product key is irrelevant. After you use it the first time, it is permanently associated with your email address.<br />
<br />
If you have Office 2013, then you MAY be able to use one of these tools to extract the key from your HD. At least one person has reported that some of them don't work on Win8/Office 2013. I haven't made time to test them myself. Please let us know which ones
 work or don't work.<br />

<b><span>Tools to Extract Product Key</span></b>
<p><a href="http://www.7tutorials.com/how-recover-your-lost-windows-7-or-windows-8-product-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://www.7tutorials.com/how-recover-your-lost-windows-7-or-windows-8-product-key</span></b></a><b>
</b></p>
<p><span>You can use any of the following tools to extract the Product Key from you computer. These tools report on many installed programs on your computer, not just Office.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>PS</span></b><span>: you should keep a copy (printed and/or file copies on external storage devices) of the report(s) generated by these tools so you have
 all of your product keys / registration numbers available for future re-installs</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>FYI</span></b><span>: I (Rohn) have not tested these tools in Windows 8 (just haven’t had an excuse to make/waste the time), but I don’t expect any problem.
 The underlying mechanics of Windows 8 are essentially the same as Windows 7 if you ignore the Metro User Interface. Think of metro as “lipstick on a pig”. The pig is not changed by adding a little paint on the surface.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Normally you have several resources to find your Retail Product Key.</span></p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span><span>Your original package or purchase confirmation e-mail</span></p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span><span>Online download account</span></p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span><span>You can extract the Product Key from the machine itself</span></p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span><span>Image copy backups of system with Office installed</span></p>
<p>
<span>o<span> </span></span><span>Activation backup utilities</span></p>
<p>From what I’ve read, MS uses a file called
<b>TOKENS.DAT</b> to store encrypted product activation keys:</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\<b>Tokens.DAT</b>
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SoftwareLicensing\<b>Tokens.data</b><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>C:\Windows.Old\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\<b>Tokens.DAT</b> (if you did an in-place Windows Upgrade)<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Do not expect the Windows.OLD folder to be there until you delete it. Many people have complained that windows 8 and 8.1 automatically delete it WITHOUT WARNING<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-files/windows-8-has-deleted-my-windowsoldprogramfiles/dbdf75c0-09d9-4992-b8eb-d9fac3efe9b8?page=2">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-files/windows-8-has-deleted-my-windowsoldprogramfiles/dbdf75c0-09d9-4992-b8eb-d9fac3efe9b8?page=2</a>
</p>
<p>After you extract the Product Key, make sure to write it down and keep it in a safe place. Burning a copy of the installation file to a CD would also be a good idea if you don’t have the installation disk.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: OEM (factory install and activated) licenses use a different key than the one reported.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only the factory can use the PK from the original factory activation. You would have been provided with a separate piece of paper with a Product key for reactivation.</p>

<p>ProduKey may be able to extract product key information from a registry file saved externally. This is useful if you’re trying to get the key details from the backup of a now defunct machine. Try the /Regfile
 option.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>After installing on my system, I ran the program --&gt; AS ADMINISTRATOR &lt;-- and then clicked on File --&gt; Select Source. Once in this menu it may appear a little overwhelming, don't worry it's not that complicated
 and your not going to break anything else. Select the circle next to "Load the product keys from external Software Registry hive". Now from here you may have to browse to a slightly different location depending on where your windows.old folder is located,
 but you want to basically browse to the following and open this file:</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>C:\Windows.old\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\SOFTWARE</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>After opening this file select ok; you may have to wait a few minutes for it to load the hive and give you your keys, but if they're there you should see them and be able to fresh install your MS Office.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Please note that this did work for my Office 2007, it also gave me my Vista Home &amp; Personal Key, and Internet Explorer... lol! I hope this helps someone else too! And remember backup before you do any upgrading/downgrading/or
 destruction to you PC.</p>

            See the suggestions in Rohn007's reply that refer to "Tools to Extract Product Key." The Magic Jelly Bean have been used by others (but note that I can't recommend any of that software personally, because I haven't tested it).

<h2>            Back button issues with Internet Explorer 11 using Google search engine</h2>
                    <p><strong>Clicking the back button unsuccessfully</strong>, repeatedly in hopes of going back one level after doing a search using google in IE11, or clicking it fast enough to be lucky to go back a step, without going back multiple, or if you're like me and
 have resorted to the ridiculous task of clicking and going down the drop down list to the previous page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a very annoying problem for so long...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know whether this is</p>
<ul>
<li>Google trying to make things harder for Microsoft users so they will jump ship and go to Chrome</li><li>Microsoft "persuading" Google search engine users to use their Bing search engine</li><li>genuinely an issue that just hasn't been resolved (for a long time!)</li></ul>
<p><strong>I&nbsp;simply wish to use IE 11 and the Google search engine.</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft 1 - Google 1 = a tie! both win!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, I have tried the two alternatives of using Chrome exclusively and using IE 11 with Bing, and to be honest, the first solution is much better for my needs. I would prefer to keep using IE 11 and Google though! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If anyone has a <strong>real </strong>fix or workaround, or&nbsp;a link of where&nbsp;I might find one,&nbsp;I would sincerely appreciated it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in response from our end.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>This issue could occur due to corrupt Internet Explorer settings or could be issues with add-ons.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let’s try to optimize Internet Explorer. Please follow the steps mentioned below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 1</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: Internet Explorer troubleshooters in Windows 8.1.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">By default, Windows 8.1 has the following two Internet Explorer troubleshooters :( A) Internet Explorer Performance (B) Internet Explorer Safety.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Run Internet Explorer troubleshooters. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Close all <strong>Programs.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Press <strong>Windows key + C.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Type <strong>Troubleshooting,</strong> under <strong>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and Click
<strong>View All</strong> on the task pane on the left.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e. Click <strong>Internet Explorer Performance</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">f. Click<strong> Next</strong> in the dialogue box.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">g. The troubleshooter will run and fix all identified issues automatically. Click
<strong>Close.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span>After you run the "Internet Explorer Performance" troubleshooter, start Internet Explorer to see whether the issue is fixed. If the issue still occurs, run the ‘Internet Explorer Safety’ troubleshooter by using the
 same steps as mentioned earlier.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 2</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: Clear cached data in Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To determine whether a performance issue or an error message is caused by corruption in the temporary Internet files or in other cached information that is used by Internet Explorer, you must clear cached data. To do this, follow
 these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Open Internet Explorer 10. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Click Tools, and then click Delete Browsing History.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. In Delete Browsing History, click Delete All. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Click OK.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 3:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When you connect to a secure website, Internet Explorer uses an encrypted channel that uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt transactions. Corrupted information in the SSL can cause websites not to load correctly.
 Clearing the SLL state may resolve this problem. </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Open Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Click Tools, and then click Internet Options. </span>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Reset security settings for Internet Explorer</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you configure security settings to be too restrictive, you may prevent Internet Explorer from displaying certain Web sites. To determine whether an issue is caused by overly restrictive security settings, revert to default
 security settings. To do this, follow these steps: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Open Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Click Tools, and then click Internet Options. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Click the Security tab. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Click Reset all zones to default level, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After you do this, test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly. If issues still occur, try Step 5.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: If this method does not resolve the issue, you can restore Internet Explorer to its previous security level.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 5</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Internet Explorer add-ons, such as ActiveX controls and browser toolbars, are used by some Web sites to provide an enhanced browsing experience. An error may occur if an add-on is damaged or if an add-on conflicts with Internet
 Explorer. To determine whether the error is caused by an add-on, run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a. Press Windows key + R and then type <strong>iexplore -extoff</strong> without quotes and press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<span><span>If you are able to access Internet Explorer without any issues, then add-ons may be causing the error.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span>

<h3> rosiedarobot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to sign into Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I cannot sign into my Microsoft account which renders my phone useless. I have read countless forums and blogs and none of their advice has helped. I've tried support thru Microsoft but their link keeps telling me I don't have a valid phone number. Tried
 calling the 800 # for support and since i wished to speak with a real person not be sent a text message with another link that wont help me, they hung up on me.
</p>
<p>Can anyone help me? Please don't tell me to upgrade to Windows 10 as I can't do ANYTHING without access to my Microsoft account. And, yes,I can LOG IN to said account from the browser but that doesnt allowe to sync any of my accounts to my phone. The apps
 are all useless. My Yahoo mail keeps saying attention is required however, I can still login from the browser. Its a pain in the a&amp;% to have to do this each time. The store is just advertising for me. Phone is a Nokia Lumia 635. Please help to sign into Microsoft
 account! </p>

<h2>            Email search is not including recent items</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook 2010 as an app on my PC. I also subscribe to the most basic level of Outlook service from Microsoft office 360</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, when running a search, my results don't seem to include the most recent emails.&nbsp; For example I received emails from customer&nbsp;A on oct 5 November 2, and November 28.&nbsp; When I run the search using the FROM criteria only the Oct 5 and Nov 2 emails
 appear.&nbsp; The November 28 is not included in the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>What if you search items in All Outlook Items or run a second search by using the same search term? Do you get any updates?</p>

<h2>            Contacts cannot video call me &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded the&nbsp; latest version of Skype to find that I now have a problem, being that I can video call out but my contacts cannot call me, they get a message that I'm unavailable. It does ring but drops after a couple of rings. Please help me get
 your program working again as I'm 83 yrs old &amp; not all that bright with computers. I have checked the settings several times &amp; all appears okay ???<br />

<p>Hi Ruwim.B, Thank you&nbsp; for your quick response, I downloaded&nbsp;the link you sent to me &amp; now Skype is back to what I'm used to... By the way if you could mention to the programmers to use the sound section &amp; check&nbsp;for new updates&nbsp;etc.... It would be a winner
 I'm sure especially the notification sound when Skype opens &amp; closes, after all these years&nbsp;of having same it's like a signature tune.... Thanks again for your help, it was really appreciated</p>
<p>Kindest Regards to you.</p>

<h2>            Action Center&#47; Notifications not working Build 10162</h2>
                    Hello, My Notification bar isn't working, and I am also not receiving any new notifications since yesterday morning at least, it may have started before then and I just never noticed. I tried to take a screenshot of what it looked like but&nbsp;I must have
 done it wrong because I looked in the pictures folder and it wasn't there. I am on Build 10162,&nbsp;&nbsp;in the fast ring.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description of the issue, I understand that the Action Centre feature is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would want to know few more answers on the below questions to understand the issue better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the occurrence of the issue?</li><li>Is the Action Center feature available from the Control Panel?</li><li>Does the issue persist when you try to log in from a different User Account?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;Please try the below suggested methods and see if it restores the functionality.</p>

            <p>I haven't made any changes to my computer recently. The only change I can think of, is upgrading from the slow ring to the fast ring about 2-3 days ago, because my Cortana was broken on slow ring, and I&nbsp;wanted to help find issues with Windows 10.&nbsp;Cortana
 is working now so at least that is good. The action Center isn't available from the control Panel, I don't see any option for it. The icon is on&nbsp;the taskbar, but when I click on it is brings up<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/670f6f5b-5718-4449-abd5-ab236eeebd4f" /></p>
<p>Should I still follow the other steps or is this issue different?</p>

            <p>Greetings</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too now have this problem; it worked on 10162 then the update to 10166 on July 10th seemed to impact it. Not only does New Notifications no longer work, but I cannot access MS Feedback (via the app) or the store; both flash and crash. The error logs are
 full of messages dealing with ShellExperienceHost.exe, WinStore.Mobile.exe and many others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC and DISM come up clean.</p>
