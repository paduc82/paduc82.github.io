<h2>            After update 1803 is there a way to share files&#47;drives on my LAN&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just had all my machines update Windows and now can't use HomeGroup, Remote Desktop, or see mapped disks. Is there a new way to share data on a LAN?&nbsp; The Microsoft web site about the 1803 update removing HomeGroup was no help. I don't a Share icon in any
 File tabs.&nbsp; Also I can't see any of the computers on the Network.</p>
<p>All my computers are Windows 10 Pro and sadly got all updates today.</p>
<p>This is like a snow day without the fun.<br />

            Since Homegroups has been removed in Windows 10 1803, your best option is to use a basic peer to peer workgroup network with Public File Sharing and Permissions. Learn more:

<br />
<br />Other troubleshooting steps you can perform for viewing network computers:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />Scroll to the bottom
<br />Click Network and Sharing Center
<br />
<br />Click Change advanced sharing settings
<br />Expand All Networks
<br />Under Password protected sharing
<br />
<br />Switch between 'Turn on password protected sharing and Turn off password protected sharing' 
<br />
<br />Then choose 'Turn off password protected sharing' 
<br />
<br />Then click 'Save changes'
<br />
<br />Also:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: optionalfeatures.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support
<br />Tick the SMB 1.0/CIFS Client
<br />Untick SMB 1.0/CIFS Automatic Removal and
<br />Untick SMB 1.0/CIFS Server
<br />
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />Restart if prompted. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft apparently has a workaround which does not require enabling SMBv1, for those who rely on the ability to 'browse' the network.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034314/smbv1-is-not-installed-by-default-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403431...</a>
<br />
<br />Explorer Network Browsing
<br />
<br />The Computer Browser service relies on the SMBv1 protocol to populate the Windows Explorer Network node (also known as "Network Neighborhood"). This legacy protocol is long deprecated, doesn't route, and has limited security. Because the service cannot function without SMBv1, it is removed at the same time.
<br />
<br />However, if you still have to use the Explorer Network in home and small business workgroup environments to locate Windows-based computers, you can follow these steps on your Windows-based computers that no longer use SMBv1:
<br />Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start). When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />All Windows devices within that subnet that have these settings will now appear in Network for browsing. This uses the WS-DISCOVERY protocol. Contact your other vendors and manufacturers if their devices still don't appear in this browse list after the Windows devices appear. It is possible they have this protocol disabled or that they support only SMBv1.

<h2>            Had Win 10 Pro On Computer - After &#40;Forced&#41; Clean Install &#47; Reinstall Win 10 Home Showed-up Instead Of Professional</h2>
                    <p>I can't be the only one this has happened to but neither have I been able to find a concrete answer on how to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Have a fairly new Dell computer which came with Windows 8.1 Home that was upgraded to Professional via a "Pro Pack".&nbsp; Recently the unit was upgraded to Windows 10 Pro (via the standard MS Internet update process where the files were downloaded to the computer
 &amp; used to upgrade it) with no problem; verified that it was running Win 10 Pro.&nbsp; However, due to a terrible problem that was brought on by&nbsp;a subsequent-but-unknown&nbsp;defective Windows&nbsp;update the printing function in Edge, Maps and Photos (all built-in Metro
 apps) was destroyed, making it impossible to print out of these 3 programs (which has been extensively documented in many postings in other Forums elsewhere).&nbsp; Microsoft tech support&nbsp;never came up with a fix, thereby necessitating a clean (bare-metal)&nbsp;re-install
 in order to restore the printing functions in the afore-mentioned three programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this I used a flash drive (created by the MS Media Creation Tool) which&nbsp;had Windows 10 Professional on it (the latest version 1511) which I had used for 2 other different
 installs / re-installs (to computers which had Win 10 Pro on them previously) and had no issues whatsoever with the correct Win 10 Pro version being installed and retained.&nbsp; Supposedly MS takes some kind of "snapshot" of your system, with the latest, most
 recent version of Win 10 which was on the hard drive and records it permanently in their database so no matter how many times you might need to reload Windows 10 it will always default to the correct version, in this case Professional - only in this case it
 didn't work and it installed Home Edition instead.&nbsp; I caught it pretty early on, wiped the hard drive and tried another install, but to no avail; it once again installed Win 10 Home instead of Pro. As an aside, I don't know why or how this even happened, given
 that I had Win 10 Pro on the flash drive to begin with.&nbsp; Anyway, I had to go on and finish up the job as the unit was scheduled to go back online the next day but I now need to know how to "unlock" the Professional version which it had on there to begin with;
 the computer is certainly entitled to it seeing as how it had Win 10 Pro on it before; paying for it again is out of the question, of course.&nbsp; My guess is that somehow the reinstall&nbsp;mechanism thought that because the OEM version was originally Home Edition,
 it somehow read some hard-coded message on the BIOS and put it (Home Edition) back on there, even though:</p>
<p>1. It had been previously upgraded to Pro back when it had Win 8.1 on it and then later clearly had Win 10 Pro after the upgrade, and</p>
<p>2. The "snapshot" that was sent back to the MS database should have&nbsp;permanently&nbsp;recorded that it had Win 10 Pro installed on it, from now till Doomsday.</p>
<p>Please advise as to how to handle this crazy scenario and unlock the Pro version of Windows, which I am rightly entitled to.&nbsp; (And please don't suggest a rollback / reinstall of Windows 8.1 Pro; there's no time for that and the 8.1 Pro Pack upgrade key is
 probably long-gone by now anyway).&nbsp; Thanks and standing by...</p>

            <p>Because the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack is not considered as a full license, you will have to start over. The reason why Home was installed, it is checking the OEM Marker in your BIOS during setup which checks for the original version and edition that came preinstalled
 on the system. </p>

    <title>No audio via optical output - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No audio via optical output </h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Hoping someone might be able to lend a hand here - I am using an original 360 elite (not S), and have it connected via HDMI to my television and via a slim AV adapter with optical output to my receiver for audio.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am not getting any audio
 output from the 360 to my receiver via the optical output.&nbsp; This was working at one point, because I had it hooked up this way right after we purchased the 360.&nbsp; For the past couple of months, the system was set up in a different location and did not require
 the optical for audio, so was being used strictly HDMI.&nbsp; Now that i have it hooked back up this way, it seems like the system just is not sending audio signal across the optical output.</p>
<p>I know the optical cable itself is good because I've been using it with a PS3, attached to the same receiver, so I know the optical port on the receiver is good also.&nbsp; I have no reason to believe anything is wrong with the AV adapter for the 360 because
 it has just been sitting unused.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>That would be great if that were an option, but it isn't. &nbsp;The only audio options are to set it to Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1, or Dolby Digital 5.1 w/ WMA; there are no options that I could find to force the audio to optical. &nbsp;If there is, maybe you

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present you do not&nbsp;have&nbsp;the latest&nbsp;Anti-virus protection as McAfee subscription has expired, as it would have been a trial,&nbsp;and you&nbsp;are in all probability infected with Malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to remove McAfee completely and get Windows Defender started again as 3rd party AVs disable Windows Defender (which is an Anti-virus)&nbsp;by default and do a thorough scan of your machine for Malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the McAfee Removal Tool.</p>

</p><p><span><span>1) No change to hardware or software. By mistake I pressed Fn+F7 (turn off monitor &lt;ASUS ROG laptop&gt;) instead Ctrl+F7. Press on Fn+F7 again turned on laptop screen but not external monitor. Checking driver I discovered in Events

<p>

<p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did answer all of your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can not be that hard, i guess. Microsoft put 'delete' functionality, so they must have undelete, right. Why would you put 'delete' without ability to 'undelete' if you made a mistake ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst case scenario ( MS do not care if you made a mistake = reinstall everything from zero) is I have to go manually in Registry and delete some keys. Can you tell me where can I find those keys and delete them so I can have my monitor back ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Some registry string may have been deleted or modified. Another possible reason why this happens is a corrupted system files. To fix this kind of issue, kindly try these following initial troubleshooting methods while your External Monitor is connected:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1: Run DISM</span></strong></p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Right-click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Start Menu</span></strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong><span>Command Prompt
 (Admin).</span></strong></span></li><li>
<span>Run this command:&nbsp;<em><span>DISM.EXE /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></em></span></li><li>
<span>If the operation is completed successfully, close the command prompt and check if your issue has been fixed.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2: Run System File Checker</span></strong></p>
<p>
 steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Right-click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Start Menu</span></strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong><span>Command Prompt
 (Admin).</span></strong></span></li><li>
<span>Run this command:&nbsp;<em><span>SFC /scannow</span></em></span></li><li>
<span>This may take several minutes to finish. If&nbsp;<strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong>&nbsp;shows<strong><span>&nbsp;Verification
 100% complete,</span></strong>&nbsp;close the command prompt and check if your issue has been fixed.</span></li></ol>

<p>Undeleting a device requires <strong>Restoration</strong> or <strong>PC Reset</strong>. We recommend r<strong>estoring your PC form a system restore point
</strong>before resorting to<strong> PC Reset</strong>. To do so, follow the steps indicated in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> under <strong>Restore from a system restore point</strong>. Assuming that restoring your PC didn't resolve your issue, try resetting your PC. Steps on how to reset your PC is also indicated on that link under

<p>Hello Allan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Monitor started working after I disabled loading of "Generic PnP Monitor" via policies.</p>
<p>I was using '<strong>Methods 2: Configure group policy settings</strong>' from this link:</p>
<p><strong>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2500967/how-to-stop-windows-7-automatically-installing-drivers</strong></p>
<p>After that monitor started working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generic driver still has "Device deleted".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not believe that you implemented deletion of device with no option to 'undelete' it.</p>
<p>What if I was developing driver for some device and deleted device (not driver) by mistake ? Reset PC, reinstall everything ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
It can take a long time to complete however if it is stuck then you can push and hold the power<br />
button to shutdown.<br />
<br />
Use the Advanced Methods, the Manufacturer's Diagnostic Utilities, and others below.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and be sure<br />
to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

For even better and more efficient checking :&nbsp; <strong>&lt;- Advanced Methods.</strong><br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista/Windows<br />
7&nbsp;disk - if you do not have a&nbsp;Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same<br />
32 or 64 bit and they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will sell the<br />
physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before /<br />

<br />
Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Windows&nbsp;disks (Vista or Windows 7 whichever you have installed.)<br />
Remember to set back when done.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade - We can&#39;t tell if PC has enough space error.</h2>
                    <p>Trying to upgrade from 8.1 to 10 on an HP refurb laptop. &nbsp;Getting the "Something happened. We can't tell if your pc has enough space to continue installing windows 10"<br />
<br />
Already gone through fixing the mbr, seeing a few people here talk about it possibly being a bootloader problem. &nbsp;That didn't work. &nbsp;I've attached a screenshot of the partitions, as I'm leaning towards there being something screwed up with them. &nbsp;I haven't
 really dabbled with the inner workings of computers in 10 years, but I'm not understanding why there are so many seemingly 100% free space partitions.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I ran that power shell command you suggested, then followed the App store fix guide. The issue was resolved when I finished&nbsp; solution 2 of the guide.&nbsp;</p>

Solution 2 – Reset Store’s cache
</p><div style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); text-align: center">
<p>
As you might know, the Windows Store is quite similar to other third-party apps in Windows 10 platform. One of the main differences is that you can’t reinstall or repair the Windows Store like other apps. Nonetheless, for the sake of troubleshooting possible
 issues, Microsoft developers implemented one command that enables you to restart the Windows Store and clean its cache.</p>
<p>
By doing so, you’ll, hopefully, resolve the issue at hand. If you’re not sure how to run this tool in the elevated&nbsp;<a href="https://windowsreport.com/ctrl-c-not-working-command-prompt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Command
 Prompt</a>&nbsp;line, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Windows Search bar, type&nbsp;<span>CMD</span>.</li><li>Right-click on&nbsp;<span>Command Prompt</span>&nbsp;and choose to&nbsp;<span>Run as administrator</span>.</li><li>In the command line, type the following command and press Enter:
<ul>
<li><span>wsreset.exe</span></li></ul>
</li><li>The procedure is swift and you can immediately close&nbsp;<span>Command Prompt</span>&nbsp;and start the&nbsp;<span>Windows Store</span>&nbsp;again.<a href="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Windows-Store-app-download-stuck-Heres-how-to-fix-it-in-7-steps-7.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwindowsreport.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f09%2fWindows-Store-app-download-stuck-Heres-how-to-fix-it-in-7-steps-7.png" height="360" width="720" /></a></li></ol>
<p>
As a quick reminder, if you don’t clean your Store cache regularly, Windows Store won’t open smoothly. If you can’t open the Windows Store, check&nbsp;<a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-store-doesnt-open-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this

    <title>Webcam constantly on with Windows 10 Professional - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bgm12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Webcam constantly on with Windows 10 Professional</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft LifeCam Cinema connected to my new Surface Book (Windows 10 Pro, 64 bit) via a Surface Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had no problem in regard to drivers etc (the camera appears correctly in <em>
Devices &amp; Printers</em>), nor with Skype finding the camera - but regardless of what I do, the blue "online" light stays on at all times, which I assume to mean the camera is on at all times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no viruses or malware that has been found by checkers (Malware Bytes, EndPoint Protection, Defender) and the camera stays on with or without an active internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a suggestion as to what could be causing this, or how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ben</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue persists in Windows 10, there could be a issue with compatibility. So I would recommend you to get in touch with the Hardware support team to know about its compatibility.

 mostly noticed this with newer titles like Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 but when trying to upload game clips and/or captures on the Xbox app for Windows 10, it always comes up with “Sorry, this capture can’t be shared. We don’t recognize this game.” Though,
 it even says the game is called Tom Clancy’s The Division 2. I’ve tried numerous times with different clips, edited and unedited, 30FPS and 60FPS, and nothing changes.&nbsp;

            Hi Piixen_, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Run the SFC and DISM Commands, restart your computer and let me know if the same thing happens.

<br />If that doesn't work, try re-registering the Xbox app.

<h3> toyadaman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Plugged in as a 360 controller...over bluetooth, just a gamepad</h2>
                    <p>So, I got a cheap bluetooth controller to game wirelessly on my PC. I plug it in and it's all good, it shows (and plays) as an Xbox 360 controller.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then unplug it, connect it via bluetooth and it connects (as a Gamepad) and the button mapping is all over the place, i.e. the Right Shoulder button is Start. I have tried changing the button mapping in each game, but I've found some of the buttons don't
 even register. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Devices, then Gamepad Properties, the gamepad only shows up as as a GamePad, where, if it's plugged in, it shows as an Xbox360 Controller.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at a few button remappers, but nothing works. I bought it to play without the wires, but there doesn't seem to be a way to change the settings of the gamepad anywhere.
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Toya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge you're experiencing with using your Xbox 360 controller on your Windows 10 PC might be caused by a corrupted device driver. It would be great if you can tell me more regarding your concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Have you installed the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Update">latest updates</a></strong> for Windows 10?</li><li>What is the <strong>OS Build</strong> of your Windows 10 PC? Click the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Start</span> button, type <span style="font-weight: bold">About your PC</span>, press
Windows specifications</span> to find this information.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend running the troubleshooter for hardware and devices with the controller connected. This tool will automatically scan and fix your PC for any issues found with your device drivers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start</strong> button.</li><li>Type <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> and then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> under <strong>Find and fix other problems</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should the issue continue, you can remove the existing driver and then reinstall it again after restarting your PC. For the steps on how to perform this operation, please refer to this

            <p>Hello&nbsp;Icarusael,</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention. While investigating your issue, we identified why this is occurring, and are working on a hotfix for this issue. While we are tracking all your activity, the sweeps are not being displayed as available for some users on the Crack the Keg page. Apologies for the inconvenience. We are working with our web team on getting this issue resolved ASAP. Since we are only tracking to see if you have downloaded Gwent into your library, not using the link on the page has not affected your 5 sweeps for downloading and playing. We see that you have completed that portion of the sweepstakes, but due to this error the 5 sweeps are not showing up as available. We'll update this post as soon as our web team can confirm that the sweeps are being properly populated on your web page.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Above link shows what the process looks like, and a how-to, as it loads to the Repair Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>
<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Ask them if you can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in the Boot Order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.

                    I just bought a Sony walkman. When I plugged it in to put music on it, it just keeps saying calculating. And I also checked to see if it was synced with my computer it showed nothing. What can I do to fix this?<br />
