<h2>            How to turn on &#34;Firmware Protection&#34; of Windows Security System Guard&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For background information, I am currently on Windows 10 Education version 1809 (OS build 17763.292). After turning on the "Memory Integrity" under "Core Isolation" of Windows Security, I also changed my Group Policy to enable Virtualisation-based Security.
 This then prompted a change in Windows Security with a new feature called "Firmware Protection" under "Core Isolation". However, I have no way of turning it on. Any advice/help to activate that option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Further clarifications</p>

<p>Happy Chinese New Year and thanks for your reply, Shafeeq!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I shall provide some information to your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are no issues prior, hardware and software wise. In fact, I restore my computer using factory image and straight away turning on the "Virtualisation-based security" feature in Group Policy. It has to be noted that there is
 no "firmware protection" prior to turning on the "virtualised-based security" feature. After enabling that feature, then the "firmware protection" option appeared and it can no longer be turned on as I "need permission from an administrator". I have tuned
 my local account to have highest permission by making myself a member of all possible user category afterward, but still it would't allow me to turn the feature on. I suspect either my hardware is not supporting the feature, although I have 8th Gen Intel processors
 with vPro and a TPM 2.0 chipset, or that certain Group Policy option is not enabled yet, and I didn't know which one.</li><li>I am the sole administrator and I did log into the "super"-administrator account and it still wouldn't be allowed to turned on, with the same reason I "need permission from administrator".</li><li>Yea, I have Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS) installed but there is no documentation of conflict between KIS and System Guard.&nbsp;</li><li>Even on a private network it still has the same problem.</li></ol>
<p>I also tried out the method you mentioned, but still to no avail.. Any other suggestions? I seriously appreciate your help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Alex Goh.</p>

<p>Hi Chun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have enabled Kaspersky on your computer, Windows Defender will automatically get disabled and once you uninstall Kaspersky, Windows Defender will be up and running. So, please let us know the status once you uninstall Kaspersky after it expires.</p>

<p>Hey Shafeeq,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it wasn't Kaspersky. I factory reset my laptop yesterday and performed the "virtualisation-based security" on Group Policy. Prior to doing that, there is no "firmware protection" but after doing it, it appears but cannot be turned on. During
 the whole process, there is no Kaspersky or any other anti-virus other than the Windows Defender at work. So I think this is something totally different. I will post it on the IT forum later to ask for advice. Thanks for your replies!</p>

<p>SEE the Statements in RED in your Original Post. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your image reflects settings from the "Windows Anti-virus &amp; Threat Protection system\Device Security\". The image suggests your PC is being protected by the Windows Anti-Virus &amp;Threat Protection (WDAVTP) system. The WDAVTP System ONLY runs IF No Other anti-Virus,
 threat protection software is installed; therefore your mention about KIS is a bit confusing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF you want to manage the WDAVTP Device Security\settings as shown in the image of your first post, you need to eliminate any/all other threat protection software from your PC; *including entries made by the non-MS Windows software (KIS) in your PC's W10
 Registry. Therefore, see Mr. Khans entries of Feb 7&amp;9, 2019 regarding the W10 Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF you have little or no experience with the W10 Registry, I suggest you get a friend with *experience with the W10 Registry and carefully delete any and all references to *any other AV&amp;TP software found in the W10 Registry. **ALWAYS make copy of the existing
 W10 Registry BEFORE deleting or editing any existing W10 Registry entries, so that you can Restore your existing W10 Registry entries if you need too...!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> spb77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook messages always open full screen</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook 2013 on the Surface Pro. Whenever I open a mail message, the message opens in full screen mode. In previous versions of Outlook, it remembered the size of the last message window. It seems that this is still the behavior when using Outlook
 2013 on other machines. Any idea why this works differently on the Surface, and if there is a way to change it?</p>

            <p>After reviewing the complete thread it appears it is not a fix at all, rather an acknowledgement that the issue exists and identification of exactly what settings cause it. I am in the same situation as the original poster to this thread, using Microsoft
 Surface Pro at native resolution and default DPI setting of 150% causes Outlook messages to open full screen. They restore to the user-defined size but Outlook doesn't remember the size and all new messages, replies and forwards open full screen. Setting the
 DPI to 125% resolves the issue however it makes text impossibly small and hard to read on the Surface Pro (presumably why Microsoft chose 150% for the default setting).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be interested to know if there is a registry setting that controls this behavior or some other parameter that can be adjusted. It would really improve the usability of the Surface Pro, which is otherwise an amazing unit.</p>

            It would be better to call support once and report the issue. The more reports of the issue the better chances of a fix for this issue.

            <p>I have just come across this issue and it is incredibly annoying.</p>
<p>I am using Windows 8 Pro 64 bit, with Office 2013, on an HP Revolve 810 hybrid laptop/tablet.</p>
<p>Every time I open an e-mail, or open a new mail window it comes up full screen. I have tried everything suggested in the previous posts, but nothing works.</p>
<p>I am using the native resolution for this machine and have not increased the dpi settings at all, it is set for 100%.</p>
<p>I have used Outlook 2013 on a number of different machines before, but this is the first time I've seen this issue. When will Microsoft acknowledge it as a problem and do something about it??</p>

            I am also experiencing this annoying issue, and also have my screen resolution set as high as it can go, and have the DPI setting at 100%. I am using an HP Revolve 810 with an 11" screen. Maybe the reason the "fix" doesn't work is that the screen size
 is small to begin with. Either way, this should be fixed.<br />

            Actually I'm seeing this fixed on 8.1 (Surface Pro 2) - not terribly helpful I know. I assume you've got all updates to Office up to date?

<p>I can see that BCM is on disc 1, this appears to be the first thing that attempts to load, but then I get that error message.</p>
<p>I clicked on the link you provided to download a copy, but have noticed that my disc is office professional plus 2010?</p>
<p>I then get a message saying that my product tis not available for download!</p>
<p>So something is stopping office to load BCM?</p>

    <title>Word 2016 Defaults for Inserted Images&#47;Pictures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 8alarm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 Defaults for Inserted Images&#47;Pictures</h2>
                    <p>In word 2016 how do I change the defaults for inserted images for 2 things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Wrap Text - I would like to be able to set the default to "Tight" instead of "In Line with Text".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Size and Position - I would like to be able to set the default to allow for free positioning anywhere on the page. Word 2016 changed the behavior so that the default doesn't allow for moving the inserted image vertically above or below the page margin
 lines unless you go into "Size and Position" and change the position to 0" below page. Going horizontally to the right or left margins is still possible as default. The image will stutter at the margin and then can be moved beyond it, but for the vertical
 margins it is a hard stop. Can the vertical behavior be changed to mimic the horizontal behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

</p><p>2. There is no simple solution for this one, unfortunately. For content that you want to reuse, such as a shape or text box, you can define an AutoText entry (Building Block) with the desired characteristics. Whenever you need that particular format and
 content, insert the entry.</p>

            <p>Hello cloudlands,</p>
<p>Check if you have a section break after page 4. You can see the section break by turning on the "Show all non-printing characters" option on the toolbar.</p>
<p>Usually section breaks contain much of the header/footer information. If you delete the section break do the page numbers change behavior?</p>
<p>Also when you click in the footer section on page 5 do you see "same as previous" in the header/footer bar?</p>
<p>When you view the footer do you see a # mark somewhere?</p>
<p>Take a look at this Help and How-to about section breaks. It might helps to reveal some of what is going on.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2007 constantly asking for password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fhorton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 constantly asking for password</h2>
                    I have had two users experience this issue so far. We are using office 365 and Outlook 2007 on Win7 Pro 64x
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When opening Outlook, the users sometimes get a popup asking for the password&nbsp;repeatedly. It may ask for a password 5-10 times in a row and then work fine for an hour or so and repeat the request again. So far, I have removed their email accounts from
 control Panel --&gt; mail and then added it back on which seem (so far, at least) to have fixed the issue. The popup isn't asking to log into the normal Office 365 server, and is instead pointing to outlook.office365.com</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there an easier or better way to resolve this issue?</div>
                </div>

                    <p>I've had problems the last couple of days with opening Word 2007 documents.&nbsp; I thought installing a new office program might fix it.&nbsp; I had recently&nbsp;Installed IE8, then&nbsp;installed and tried to uninstall Adobe Air 2.7.019480, and ParetoLogic Health Advisor&nbsp;...seems
 to have happened after these installations.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;in this order&nbsp;these messages when trying to open a Word 2007&nbsp;document:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Word cannot save or create this file.&nbsp; Make sure that the disk you want to save the file on is not full, write-protected, or damaged.&nbsp; (C:\...\Normal.dotm)</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; File Name:&nbsp; Normal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save as Type:&nbsp; Word Macro-Enabled template&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save, Cancel</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Changes have been made that affect the global template, Normal.&nbsp; Do you want to save those changes? Yes, No</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; Microsoft Word not responding</p>
<p>5) After each attempt at opening a document, there appeared in My Documents a new document with several Chinese-looking characters followed by an R with a circle around it, then the numbers 1033.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I opened Computer, then C drive, then removed everything connected to a program that I no longer use.&nbsp; Then I downloaded the Office Home and Student 2010 trial edition to my desktop, and ran it.&nbsp; Halfway through the run, I got the message about Error 1606.</p>

            1. The normal template should be in the folder <br />
C:\Users\&lt;YOUR_USER_NAME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates<br />
<br />
Locate this folder using Windows Explorer, then right click the normal template it contains and rename it.<br />

<p>Thanks for posting in our community.</p>

<p>Since we cannot reproduce the problem on our side, I'd like confirm some information first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Please share the Word version with us, you can check it in
<p>2. Does this problem happen to other Office applications?</p>
<p><span>3. You can try using another user profile to check if the problem persists:

<h2>            MapInfo GIS &#40;64 bit&#41; unable to open Excel or Access tables</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 365 Professional, Windows 10 and the GIS software - MapInfo (which is 64 bit). When I try to open an Access or Excel table from within MapInfo it causes an (un-numbered) error and shuts down MapInfo. MapInfo Forums suggested downloading
 and installing the Access 64 bit driver, I have done this but it has not fixed the problem. Any suggestions on a fix would be appreciated.

<p>I'm guessing your Office installation is 32-bit Click-to-Run, per best practices.</p>
<p>It does not work at all with 64-bit applications, drivers or not. It also runs in its own sandbox, so even installing 64-bit office may not solve the problem. There are some HORRIBLE side effects of CTR technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with the advice given: let MapInfo support deal with this. Maybe they have (should have) seen this situation before.</p>

<h3> eneff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t uninstall internet explorer 10 on my windows 7 computer</h2>
                    I mistakenly downloaded internet explorer 10 on my windows 7 computer and can not uninstall it. Explorer 10 will lock up before it completely downloads my "home page" and I can't do anything. I have gone to Control Panel / Programs and found the Explorer
 10 update.. when I click uninstall it goes through the process for a few minutes (the little blue bar completes to the end), then after about 1 minute it says that the uninstall failed. Are there other solutions for uninstalling this version of explorer?

            I finally resolved the problem. Internet Explorer 10 would not work and I could not uninstall it. Once the screen for IE10 came up, it would stop working and I couldn't do anything. I finally went through the control panel to internet options, selected
 advanced settings and did a complete reset of options. It immediately solved the problems and IE10 is now working perfectly on my computer. Thanks for answering my initial question

            <p>Sync Services are supposed to be a two way sync system, but I know they've been problematic for a while and are depreciated by Apple in 10.8.<br />I'm not sure I have any workaround unfortunately beside trying to turn them off, then a few minutes later, back on.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corentin</p>

    <title>Photo and Camera apps not working due to new Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Photo and Camera apps not working due to new Windows Update</h2>
                    Unfortunately, my Camera and Photo apps will not work after the new update that was released to select windows phones, mine being the Lumia 635. Whenever I attempt to open either of the apps, a message pops up saying I need to either uninstall the app
 and reinstall it, or I need buy the app again. I've tried both of these several times and I still can't seem to fix this issue. I don't know if its just a bug with the update that will be fixed later, but I would love to be able to fully enjoy this update.
 Thank you.

            Are you talking about the new Win 10 Tech Preview build, or something else?&nbsp; If the tech preview, hopefully you understood this is test software not final shipping code. Issues are to be expected. If it is the TP, I would try a hard reset (Settings, System,
 About, Reset your Phone, way at the bottom. Yes this will erase everything, but if you are using the TP, it isn't on a primary/important device, right?&nbsp;

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Cameras
<br />Right click the camera, then click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Note: If you don't see it under cameras, look under Imaging devices. 
<br />
<br />Exit device manager then restart.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 should redetect it then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Check if the camera is working again.
<br />
<br />If you have a third party Antivirus utility installed, please remove it.
<br />Also check the manufacturers website for updated driver. 
<br />
<br />If its an external web cam and you have it plugged into a USB Hub, that will not work. You need to plug your web cam directly into the USB port on your system unit. USB hubs are not necessarily powerful enough to power devices like web cams.

            Not really - you could insert a media player control but it would float on top of the worksheet, covering the cells. As far as I know, there is no way to run a video clip in the background in Excel.

<h2>            Microsoft Office Won&#39;t Log Into OneDrive</h2>
                    I have used Office 2013 with my documents saved on OneDrive for years, but since reformatting my hard drive and upgrading to Office 2016 it won't let me log on to access my files. Whether I log onto OneDrive and click Edit in Word or go into Word and try
 to open from OneDrive the two applications will not work together. When I try to log into my account on Office it asks for my email/password. When I enter both it reports no problem but I am still not able to access OneDrive. When I open it through OneDrive
 it opens Word but nothing shows up.
