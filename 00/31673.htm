<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Which Operating System is installed in your computer?</div>
<div>2. What is the exact error message you get?</div>
<div>3. What happens when you try to run the game?</div>
<div>4. Was the game working fine earlier?<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Currently there is no information on Phlinxtogo's compatibility with Windows 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, you could perform couple of steps and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once Phlinxtogo game is downloaded, right click on the .exe file and run it as administrator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that does not help, run the game in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows compatibility mode </a>and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If none of the suggestion's work, I am afraid that you would have to contact the game manufacturer for best support.</div>

<p>This was caused by the video on the mother board.&nbsp; I installed a new video card that's Windows 10 compatible, and it's running properly.&nbsp; So, far the "Get Windows 10" has not rechecked for compatibility.&nbsp; And, I've not been able to force it to re-run by
 using: schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not really ready to install Windows 10 yet, but want to make sure that my system is ready.&nbsp; How do I recheck to see if it meets system requirments?</p>

            <p>TE,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bear with me for a sec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading a PC from 7 to 10 is not the cleanest process, leaving downgrade partitions and all sorts of other stuff on your HD, so most people would prefer a nice clean install. &nbsp;But as you know you need to upgrade first so if you jump ahead and do a clean
 install of 10 it may not authorize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But eventually we want that clean install of 10, so just get comfortable with the fact that the best thing to do sooner or later is to wipe the disk. &nbsp;So do your backups and get on with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran into this same problem with a NVidia Quatro CARD and even after the card was physically out of the machine and replaced with a new compatible card, I still got the error message referring to the old card - so the upgrade process is not able to reset
 itself. &nbsp;I tried everything but still got the error message referring to the old card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, what I did was to put the new card in and do a nice clean fresh install of Windows 7, do all the updates, and then run the compatibility appraiser. &nbsp;Then the upgrade worked and I made sure that 10 was authenticated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I did a nice clean fresh install of 10 which authenticated fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, and here's the kicker, I put the old incompatible card back in, loaded a win 8 driver and everything works great even with the old card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah it will take some time, but in the long run this is the way to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: &nbsp;I've heard that Microsoft is considering changing the authorization process and allowing entry of win 7/8 keys into a fresh install of win 10 to authorize. &nbsp;That means we can skip the whole upgrade process and do a fresh install to begin with. &nbsp;Again,
 that means wiping the drive so we wind up in the same place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the Media creation tool is fine. &nbsp;Just make sure you load the windows version appropriate for your key.</p>

            <p>Easy there, I am trying to help. &nbsp;I had the same problem as you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter if you are upgrading from 7 or 8. &nbsp;The problem is the upgrade tool (which is the same for both) does not reset it self properly after detecting an incompatible card/onboard graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in your case it detected your geforce on-board graphics, in my case it detected the Quadro card, again it's really the same problem - the upgrade tool detects an incompatible card/onboard graphics and does not reset even after installing a new card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your problem really has nothing to do with the facts that you have windows 8 in particular or the geforce 430 in particular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem is that the upgrade tool is 'stuck' and won't recognize your new hardware. &nbsp;I had the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So don't get hung up on windows 7 vs 8, or the particular card, those are throwing you off the track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case a fresh install of windows allowed me to do the upgrade and then the fresh install. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just trying to help.</p>

</p><p>A couple days after the New Year of 2019, I tried to login to my Microsoft account, only to find out I had forgotten my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Derp. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to completely revise my security information on my Microsoft account after miraculously logging in without either a recovery code or second-form factor authenticator available in the process, as my phone's SIM card had failed. Before I had successfully
 logged in to update everything though, I triggered a security information account review (which MS says takes approximately 30 days) with my logins through the account information recovery page, as I had forgotten my own password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, password got changed, I got rid of two-factor authentication, and the Microsoft Authenticator app linked to my account (by deleting it straight from the app on the mobile device). I also revised my security details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought everything was solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then today I'm snooping around on my recent activity page under accounts.microsoft.com, and I find 2 "successful logins" that happened roughly 20 hours apart, exactly 1 week ago, not even with some form of verification that was used, each from an "Unknown"
 Device/Platform, from an "Unknown" Browser/App. The IP addresses (not listed here) both are tied to a domestic, Microsoft Azure managed servers, "belonging to the Microsoft Corporation", in the central parts of 2 cities where Microsoft has centers. But the
 locations are quite odd far away and odd, 1 of them having been a place I once was at within the past year (though this may just be coincidence I suppose).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What surprises me utterly is how this happened, given that the logins were AFTER my whole debacle detailed above about changing my password. They happened without even warning or an "unusual/suspicious activity" email from Microsoft. Could these have been
 associated to the security information audit I requested from Microsoft when I had failed to remember my password in trying to login earlier in the year? I need answers, because frankly I refuse to believe my device is "hacked" as Microsoft warned me today
 when I changed the password yet again, and I never saw these sort of strange logins going on before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that at the time of these instances, I was never using a mobile app or service on a third device for any Microsoft products whatsoever.</p>

            Hi T, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi TLaudy,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            None of the technical solutions offered so far will keep your husband out of your PC if he has the right skills. I could access all of your files within three minutes without knowing any account names or passwords, if you gave me your PC. Here are your
 options:<br />
<ul>
<li>Use one of the non-technical solutions offered so far.</li><li>Encrypt your disk.</li></ul>
The second solution requires expert knowledge and is not without risks: If not done properly then you might lose all your files some day.<br />

    <title>BOOTMGR is compressed. Press Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;Del to restart__But when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kfogs  say:</h3>
<h2>            BOOTMGR is compressed.  Press Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;Del to restart__But when I do the same message appears and now my netbook won&#39;t start up.</h2>
                    
<p>I am not a computer whizz and now I fear I may have made a big mistake when I thought I was doing something safe.</p>
<p>So, here's the story,&nbsp;I wanted to make a bit more room on my hard drive since I only have a small memory netbook. After doing the usual disk clean up and stuff I also saw a tick box option to compress all the files and folders on the C:/ drive. I ticked
 this box and all was fine until I shutdown and turned it on again today.</p>
<p>As soon as the first image - the HP logo disappears (with the following&nbsp;key instructions below&nbsp;'&lt;F9&gt;= Change Boot Device Order' and '&lt;F10&gt;=BIOS Setup Options'&nbsp;) I get a black screen with the following script in the top right hand corner:</p>
<p>'BOOTMGR is compressed'... and underneath, 'Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart'.</p>
<p>However, when I do restart, nothing chages and I come back to the same message over and over. I think its pretty obvious that my 'poking' around has potentially messed things up good and proper and I would be soooo grateful if anyone knows how to solve my
 problem and what to do. I have tried to look into it already and so far I think I may have to reinstall windows but when I bought this netbook, windows was installd for me so&nbsp;I have no disc. I don't even have a disk drive anyway. I also read on the windows
 troubleshooting pages that pressing F8 repeatedly would bring up the 'restart from last saved point' etc options&nbsp;however this has not worked either... unless I am doing it wrong.</p>
<p>I hope I have given enough information above so that someone might be able to help. Thanks for your time and I'll look forward to any replies and hopefully the answer.</p>
<p>Kirsty</p>

<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=c01872275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=c01872275</a></p>
<p>Compressing is not a big mistake, but in todays world where disk storage is cheap it is usually not worth it - you just buy more storage or do dome disk&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;(remove things).&nbsp; Compressing can actually slow down your system performance too.&nbsp; I think
 it is just some kind of leftover from the old days and can have negative consequences today.</p>
<p>Using the HP article, you can fix your system in a few seconds after getting into the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>There is a similar problem with non HP systems where the ntldr file can get compressed and resolving it is a little different, but the concept is the same and just takes a few seconds to fix.</p>
<p>You will not be booting into any kind of Safe Mode either.</p>
<p>Getting into the&nbsp;Recovery&nbsp;Console could be the biggest challenge.</p>
<p>Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD? &nbsp;This is not the same as any System Recovery type CDs that may have come with your system. &nbsp;If you don't have one, you will have to make a bootable Recovery Console CD using a working system - or physically
 move your HDD to a working system, fix it and put it back.</p>
<p>Does your system of unspecified model number have a working CD drive?</p>

<h2>            Installing KB953297 and getting error code 653 ... This worked&#33;</h2>
                    I manually installed KB867460 framework 1.1 SP1&nbsp; then manually installed KB953297 framework 1.1 SP1. Save these to your hard drive and run from there and hopefully you have no probems. I tried all the other methods but they wouldn't work for me.<br />
<br />

            Hello,
<div><br />
1. Which fix it tool is causing the issue?<br />
2. Were there any changes (hardware or software) made to the computer prior to the issue?
<div><br />
You can post the query in the Windows Fixit solution center and see if the issue persists.

I suggest you unmark the marked answer first.&nbsp; If your issue is not resolved, then there should not be something marked as an answer.</p>
<p><span>"I marked a response to my question as "Answered," but then I found out it was wrong. What should I do?</span>
</p>
<p>You can go to the response and click <b>Unmark it</b>. </p>

<p><br />
Then I would suggest you utilize the SFC /SCANNOW command to scan your Windows Vista installation for issues.</p>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</a>
<p>You may also want to scan for any sort of malware/etc.</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a>
</li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Removing everything they find.&nbsp; Rebooting when needed.&nbsp; (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Sleep Mode disabled &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    I've been struggling for a couple months to figure this one out to no avail.
<div>My computer's sleep mode is disabled and I am unable to enable it.</div>
<div>There is no option for Sleep in the charm bar and it is greyed out in the Power Management settings.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have checked, double checked, and triple checked drivers for all devices and am continually updating them with their new releases and reassessing after every update. I believe the issue is with the Nvidia GTX 650 TI, but I cannot confirm it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone found a way of addressing this?</div>

            <p>Hi Austin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824987.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
secure boot </a>enabled on your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If secure boot is&nbsp;turned off it might cause your&nbsp;computer not to recognize the built in video card and which may lead to the sleep mode option&nbsp;missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><strong>Method 1:</strong></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Also, your video card might not support sleep. I suggest you to update the latest&nbsp;video card drivers manually from the following link&nbsp;and check if it helps.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><b><span><font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.geforce.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geforce.com/drivers</a></font></span></b></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><br />
<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><b><span><font color="#000000">Method 2:</font></span></b></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Sleep and other power-saving states are turned off in your computer's basic input/output system (BIOS). To turn on sleep, restart your computer, and then enter the BIOS setup. As your computer starts, instructions typically appear

<p>Thanks for the reply. Yeah, I had gone through that. Under the Sleep tree node, the only settings available are for Hibernate. Both before and after "Change Settings That Are Currently Unavailable".</p>

<h2>            How do I prevent the repeat keys and filter keys option to act completely&#63;</h2>
                    Whenever I attempt to crouch (using CTRL) more than once in CS:GO, the key tends to take a longer period of time to activate. This occurs as well while I type. I have turned all Filter Keys options off and it continues to occur.

<p>Hi Hayden,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue you're experiencing might be due to a variety of reasons.<br />
<br />
Since you've mentioned that you've already cleared out all the keyboard options from
<strong>Ease of Access</strong>, let's run the <strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter
</strong>and the <strong>Keyboard Troubleshooter </strong>to repair problems with your devices, hardware, and keyboard settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> icon, then select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Choose the<strong> Large icons</strong> option from the <strong>View by</strong> drop down list found on the upper-right part of the Control Panel window.<br />
</li><li>Locate then select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>View all </strong>from the left pane.<br />
</li><li>Locate and click <strong>Hardware and Devices/Keyboard</strong> to run the troubleshooter then follow the next steps.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Are your drivers up-to-date, especially your keyboard driver? If not, you can follow the steps found on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how to update your drivers in Windows 10.<br />
<br />
You can also consider <strong>reinstalling</strong> them to further troubleshoot the keyboard issue you're experiencing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click <strong>Start</strong>, then select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Right-click the driver under <strong>Keyboards</strong>, then select <strong>
Uninstall</strong>.<br />

            <p>If you do not change out the motherboard, you are fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Worst case, you will have to activate.&nbsp; Likely can do so online - but worst case for that is having to do it over the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words:</p>
<p>Yes - you can upgrade your CPU (Central Processing Unit) to a faster one, if your current motherboard/mainboard will handle it/use it.</p>
<p>Yes - you can upgrade your video card to a better performing one, if your current motherboard/mainboard will handle it/use it.</p>
<p>Yes - you can upgrade your RAM/system memory (increasing it and/or putting in better performing options), if your current motherboard/mainboard will handle it/use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you have to change your motherboard/mainboard to do any upgrade you want, your Windows 7 OEM license goes with the old motherboard/mainboard and you need a new license.</p>

            <p>As long as you don't change the motherboard you should be OK.&nbsp; I would not make all the changes at the same time, do one change and verify that the computer is still stable after a week of use.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1) Start with the graphics card. You will more than likely need to update or re-install the graphics driver.</strong></p>
<p>Check the Graphics card manufacture's download site:<br />
Download and install the most recent Windows 7 or 8 drivers for your card.<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong>2) Then install the memory and test it using Memtest86+</strong></p>
<p>First run Memtest86+:&nbsp; <br />
This runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or confirm if one or more of your memory<br />
sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (<strong>at least 3 full passes</strong>), if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

Note #2: <br />
Compare the two values, the actual memory speed should not exceed the rated speed of your memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3) Run Prime95 to verify the processor is stable. (Prime 95 tests both the CPU and memory). Failures in the first 2 hours of a test are usually associate with a CPU voltage that is too low. Monitor your CPU core temperatures while Prime 95 is running

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is it possible?</p>

<p>I just want to upgrade my computer hardware. If not, Should I just buy a new Windows OS that is not OEM and install it after I changed some of devices inside my CPU like my video card, processor and ram?</p>

<p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p><strong>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</strong></p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you are changing everything except the motherboard, you should be good to go.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;are OK with those changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the Microsoft information on what you can and can not change with an OEM License:.</p>

<div><strong>Q.</strong> <span>If my customer asks me to upgrade a PC with new hardware components, when is a new operating system needed? When would the PC be considered "new"?</span></div>
<div>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Generally, an end user can upgrade or replace all of the hardware components on a computer—<strong><em>except</em> the motherboard</strong>—and still retain the licence for the original Microsoft OEM operating system software. If the
 motherboard is upgraded or replaced for reasons other than a defect, then a new computer has been created. Microsoft OEM operating system software cannot be transferred to the new computer, and the licence of new operating system software is required.</p>
<p>If the motherboard is replaced because it is defective, you do <em>not</em> need to acquire a new operating system license for the PC as long as the replacement motherboard is the same make/model or the same manufacturer's replacement/equivalent, as defined
 by the manufacturer's warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the quick response guys. Really appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 thing also, I just found out that my OS is 32 bit and it's capable for 64 bit. So I want also to upgrade my OS from 32 bit to 64 bit since some of latest games like Ghost requires a 64bit OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is this the time that I should have to change my OS to a newer one?</p>
<p>or can I just use my license key to Windows 7 Pro OEM 64 bit from 32 bit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What if, I will just change my OS to a non OEM Windows 7 any version with the same motherboard? is it okay?</p>
<p>

<p>If you do not change out the motherboard, you are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst case, you will have to activate.&nbsp; Likely can do so online - but worst case for that is having to do it over the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words:</p>
<p>Yes - you can upgrade your CPU (Central Processing Unit) to a faster one, if your current motherboard/mainboard will handle it/use it.</p>
<p>Yes - you can upgrade your video card to a better performing one, if your current motherboard/mainboard will handle it/use it.</p>
<p>Yes - you can upgrade your RAM/system memory (increasing it and/or putting in better performing options), if your current motherboard/mainboard will handle it/use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have to change your motherboard/mainboard to do any upgrade you want, your Windows 7 OEM license goes with the old motherboard/mainboard and you need a new license.</p>

            <p>Your product key will likely work with a 64-bit edition of Windows 7 as well.&nbsp; It is a CLEAN INSTALLATION prospect - nothing you do not save elsewhere will be saved at all and you will have to manually download and install all hardware device drivers and
 such.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>Do you have the 64-bit media?<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>My suggestion: get yourself a couple of 4GB or so USB sticks and create installation media for both Windows 7 Professional 32-bit and Windows 7 Professional 64-bit using these ISO image downloads:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59183.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Professional x86 English</a></li><li><a href="http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59186.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Professional x64 English</a></li></ul>
<p>... and this Microsoft provided tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool</a><br />
</li></ul>
<p>Then copy your product key from the sticker on the machine to some external system as well (piece of paper you store with the two USB sticks, a text file on the USB sticks themselves, both of those, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In this manner you will be prepared for whatever the future may hold with installation media and the product key you need to re-install the operating system on that computer at a whim.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I’m looking at getting the afore mentioned combination and want to run some external monitors. I know you can’t run dual 4k monitors, but i want to know if a 4k monitor (i.e. a tv) will run at 60hz even if I have another monitor connected, but have it
 turned off or have the Surface set to only display on the tv. For the second monitor I’m getting a 21:9, not sure if 2560x1080 or 3440x1440.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> davekayadlib  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I use credit on my microsoft account to pay for an item that a member of my microsoft family has requested</h2>
                    <p>My son received some x box gift cards for his birthday so I redeemed them on my account thinking that when he requests some V-bucks then I can approve the purchase rather than him spending them all without my approval.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a way to use my microsoft balance to pay for something that a member of my family has requested, I can only use my credit card to add more money to their account and then approve the purchase.</p>
<p>I'm not going to use this balance myself so does anyone know how do I get the money transferred to his account / why can't I use it to pay for something that I would have to buy on my credit card anyway ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or can I buy the robucks on my account and give them to him or would they then be on my account too ?</p>
<p>Or can I buy a new x box gift card with my credit balance and redeem it to my son's account ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system needs to be changed to allow approval of child's purchases when they have a credit balance as you can't transfer in the exact amount that the child wants to spend either, so they then spend the difference with no approval.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm new to this but it doesn't seem to make sense or am I doing something wrong ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>there doesn't seem to be a category for gift cards / account balances so apologies if i have posted in the wrong section</p>

Thanks, how do I get a refund for the gift card that is redeemed on the wrong account or is that money just wasted ?

            You can try contacting support and speak to billing, but generally once the funds have been redeemed, it is not possible to refund them.&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>

<p>Hello dave, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Forum support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there is no way&nbsp;to refund a redeemed code, but you can buy&nbsp;content or send it as a digital gift if the option is present when making a purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you go to the store on your account there may be an option to buy as a gift. you can then enter the persons gamertag and they will receive a message or email with a code to download the item<br />
<br />
Not all items are giftable if the item in question is not giftable you wont be able to purchase it for another account using your account credit</p>

<p>Seems like the only option is to find someone who needs a game and gift it to them and get them to buy me a new gift card for the same amount to then redeem on my son's account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of people with the same problem on the forums, also people who have bought V-Bucks on the parent's account and then can't transfer them to the kids account ( glad I saw that before I made the same mistake).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried logging into x-box with my account and then logging into fortnite with my sons account to buy the v-bucks with my money but that isn't possible either as the fortnite account is locked to my son's login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions but looks like I will just have to ask around or wait to see if there is a game I can gift to him or a friend in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also&nbsp;for future references, In-game or virtual currency is something that cannot be bought as a gift. Everything else on the store is fair game but virtual currency has that limitation since that currency is handled and distributed by the game developers
 or publishers themselves, not by Microsoft as mostly every game has it's own unique method of virtual currency that benefits the creators of the games the currency is spent on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option to "Buy as Gift" will be in small print below the blue box that say's "Buy" on it on items where that is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for any inconveniences this has caused but I hope we were able to answer your questions and clear things up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            STOP&#58; C0000135 The program can&#39;t start because &#37;hs is missing. Try resintalling the program</h2>
                    <p>Hi.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what this is? I've been experiencing other errors and blue screen like KERNEL Debug, but now that I have installed a fresh copy of Windows 7, tonight for the first time I experienced a problem, beginning with the screen freezing, then Crtl+Alt+Delete
 wouldn't work at all, and it ended up with the blue screen saying: ''STOP: C0000135 The program can't start because %hs is missing. Try resintalling the program. ...''&nbsp;&nbsp; blla blla blla...</p>
<p>I wonder whether the cause might be because I have installed the Windows 7 from a copy cd, not from Original Windows 7 cd, or maybe I use some music softwares and maybe ANY of them might cause this.<br />
<br />
Whatever the cause is, is there a way of frixing it, or shall I end up with formatting and installing again a fresh Windows 7?<br />
<br />
If any of you would tell me to do a Disk Check, I have tried before to CHKDSK but funnily, Windows 7 sucked in it. It was going damn slow, never would end. It would take days or weeks. You can't even make a Defragmentation with the Windows 7's&nbsp; own defrag program.<br />

<p><a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.microsoft.com_en-2Dus_download_confirmation.aspx-3Fid-3D54327&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=-5LgSL_TkF3nGRQI95ci6eeFVMQ5VESHPf5koMIAxOA&amp;r=JH49qvB_BeokFg-8vF3VIseGqxUrBSRGfUtAt0Fndl0&amp;m=vgdhLeY5brkaTwB58uzT0tIp37AUQoMbfoauWrcbTQ0&amp;s=pT7DJqQrmEGx3GfpXU-NpQeLDE6mic5--6QXW4enP4o&amp;e=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54327</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I click download, it provides me with a Word doc asking what language I want it in.&nbsp; When I click English at the top, it just lands me back to my O365 home page.&nbsp; The rest of the language options seem to have a ZIP extension but the English one
 doesn’t.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>How/where can I obtain the English versions of the Quick Start Guides for Skype for Business?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance for any direction!</span></p>

            Hi ppeelloonn,<br />
<br />
Can you check does this option still work if you press WinKey+ left/right arrow with active window?<br />
<br />
You may want to read this thread: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7desktop/thread/fe3ab7b1-1b08-44c9-bfef-858c0d26c98e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Aero Shake works, but Aero Snap does not</a> . You will find there information what registry entries you need to change:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>WinKey+R</strong> &gt; type <strong>regedit</strong> and press Enter
</li><li>Navigate to <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop</strong> </li><li>Set appropriate values for these keys by double clicking them:<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>DockMoving</strong> = <strong>1</strong> </li><li><strong>DragFromMaximize</strong> = <strong>1</strong> </li><li><strong>SnapSizing</strong> = <strong>1</strong> </li><li><strong>WindowArrangementActive</strong> = <strong>1</strong> </li></ul>
</li></ol>
<br />
Also you may need to check this: Press <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt;
<strong>Ease of Access</strong> &gt; <strong>Change how your mouse works</strong> &gt;&nbsp; Make sure that
<strong>Prevent windows from being automatically rearranged when moved to the edge of the screen</strong> is deselected.

            Grzegorz's info is a little too complicated. &nbsp;You just need to know this: &nbsp;when you drag a window to the left or right edge -- keep dragging until the mouse pointer bumps into the side of the screen. &nbsp;It's your mouse pointer touching the edge
<em>while</em>&nbsp;dragging that triggers the snap.
