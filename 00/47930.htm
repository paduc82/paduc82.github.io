<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide
 you with better assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Have you tried any other Bluetooth device on this computer? Was the result same?</li><li>What is the make and model number of your computer?</li><li>Have you check the same Bluetooth device on any other computer? Was the result same?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Try the below mentioned methods and see if it works for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>When Bluetooth communication fails at that time please check that the <strong>
Bluetooth service </strong>and<strong> Bluetooth Support </strong>are running on the computer. To check the Bluetooth services follow the steps provided below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong> </li><li>In the <strong>search</strong> box type <strong>run.</strong></li><li>Type <strong>Services.msc</strong> in <strong>run box</strong> and press <strong>
enter.</strong></li><li>In the list find <strong>Bluetooth service </strong>and<strong> Bluetooth Support
</strong>services and double click on that.</li><li>Ensure that the <strong>service</strong> is both set to <strong>automatic</strong> and
<strong>started</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: </p>
<p>Try to run the <strong>Hardware troubleshooter</strong> and check whether the issue is resolved or not.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>The issue which you are facing might be due to the drivers. So, I would suggest you to update the drivers of Bluetooth from the link provided below and if issue still persists, try to update the drivers from&nbsp;manufacturer's website and check the status. You
 may refer to the link provided below to update the drivers.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu &#38; Windows Apps Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Start Menu, Cortana Search, and all other Windows Apps are completely unresponsive. I'm also not seeing any "Critical Error" dialog as others have. I've been having trouble with this for weeks and I'm really trying to avoid a clean install seeing as it
 would take forever to set up and reinstall my applications. I've seen various solutions to this issue and have tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;sfc /scannow</li><li>I have no corrupted AppLocker plugin files</li><li>I have started the Application Identity service</li><li>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</li><li>replaced the TileDataLayer database</li></ol>
<p>and finally, I've also tried the windows powershell command:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(89, 89, 89, 1)">Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, each attempt to add the package fails with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80073CF6, Package could not be registered. Adding a tile failed with unexpected error."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the log:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"While preparing to process the request, the system failed to register the windows.visualElements extension due to the following error: Catastrophic failure. The last successful state reached was ResolveDeferredRegistrations, Failure occured before reaching
 the next state RegisterChanged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate any help in getting this resolved...if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Fulmer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing at this moment. We will assist you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need at least <strong>1024 X 768 </strong>screen resolution for Metro apps to work. The Windows apps will not work in screen resolution less than 1024 X 768. To snap apps, you need a screen resolution of at least
<strong>1366 x 768</strong>. Make sure that the screen resolution meets these requirements. You can check this by:<br />
<br />
1. Right-click the mouse from the desktop interface and select <strong>Display Settings
</strong>&gt;<strong>Display</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display settings</strong>. <br />
2. Check the screen resolution shown there. It should be at least <strong>1024 X 768</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To diagnose the issue, I suggest you follow below troubleshooting steps and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1: Run Windows Apps Troubleshooter.</strong><br />
</span></p>

                    <p class="contentStandard">I have a 525GB SSD with GPT table where openSUSE (Linux) is installed. I'm trying to install Win10 (for games, you know, WINE is not good for all cases).</p>

<p class="contentStandard">I've downloaded Win10 Creators Update ISO file from MS site (Win10_1703_Ukrainian_x64.iso), made a USB with its content. Installation starts fine. I'm proceeding to partitioning. While creating partition (set size slightly more

<p class="contentStandard">There are 4 new partitions: Recovery (450MiB), System (100MiB), MSR (16MiB) and primary (150GiB) in that order.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">The last partition is selected, I'm pressing ok to install Windows but it doing something for several seconds and after that notifies that partitions on disk selected for install aren't placed in recommended order. WTF? Pressing
 OK to continue installing and after that got error that system EFI partition formatted as NTFS (which is not true) but should be FAT32 (and it is). Pressing OK returns to partitioning and there are 2 more partitions: Recovery and System (again).</p>

<p>I would not have used Windows 10 setup to create any partitioning schemes. I would have done that prior to setup from within OpenSUSE using a utility such as Gparted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you would need to do is boot from the Windows 10 setup media, select the partition then proceed with the installation. You could then use a free utility like EasyBCD to add a boot entry for Linux.</p>

            All you need to do is create a partition with enough space to accommodate Windows 10 for your needs. I would boot into OpenSUSE then delete those unnecessary partitions that were created.&nbsp;

    <title>Why does Windows 7 interfere with boot priority sequence when using - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anonymoustxusa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 7 interfere with boot priority sequence when using EFI and GPT&#63;</h2>
                    Motherboard:&nbsp;&nbsp; ASUS-P8P67-LE<br />
Chipset:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; EFI/UEFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) with Intel B3 bug correction<br />
Disk:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Seagate 500G<br />
Disk Mode:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SATA set to AHCI mode (Advanced Host Controller Interface)<br />
Partitioning:&nbsp;&nbsp; GPT<br />
OS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit version<br />
<br />
After installing Windows 7 Ultimate, we set boot sequence to (1) DVD (2) HD1. A third item appears in the BIOS setups, called "Windows Boot Manager."&nbsp; It has a diagonal slash with the "UEFI" identifier.&nbsp; The HD1 icon does not show this identifier.<br />
<br />
As expected, the system boots to the DVD when a disk is in the drive. However,<br />
<br />
With DVD drive empty, the computer will not default boot to Windows when the second boot choice is set to either HD1 or "Windows Boot Manager".&nbsp; In order to boot to Windows, you have to have "Windows Boot Manager" set to the first priority.&nbsp; But then, you cannot
 boot to a DVD or CD.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
In order to choose the boot, we have to either go into BIOS and change the first priority, or enter the BIOS boot menu and choose.&nbsp; It won't do the sequence automatically.&nbsp; Whenever DVD is the first choice, and the DVD drive is empty, it just hangs and does
 not boot into windows.<br />
<br />
The shop that built the box says that somehow, Microsoft Windows Installer has put some code into the motherboard's NV memory, and that is what is represented as "Windows Boot Manager."&nbsp; And that this is extremely unexpected.&nbsp; No one who has looked at this
 recalls anytime that an OS install would alter the routines built into the motherboard.<br />
<br />
The usual 3 partitions were created as expected by Win7 in GPT, that is, (1) the ESP (EFI System Partition), (2) the MSR (Microsoft Reserved partition) and (3) the C VOL partition.
<br />
<br />
That shop that built the box worked on it for a long time, and said that they think that the problem is that Win7 alters the motherboard's routines.&nbsp; And that maybe the only way to make the boot sequence happen normally would be to convert back to the MBR method
 of partitioning.&nbsp; They suggested that I just leave it the way it is,&nbsp; and use the BIOS boot menu whenever I need to boot to a DVD or USB device.<br />
<br />
I would like to keep the GPT method, because it's been advocated by Microsoft for some time now as being much better, as well as for future compatibility. See for example "Windows and GPT FAQ" at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463525<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to boot to a DVD or to a USB device when appropriate, in sequence without having to re-set the boot priority in the BIOS every time.<br />
<br />
Should I go back to MBR partitioning?&nbsp; I am concerned that if I try that, it might mess up the "Microsoft Boot Manager" routines on the motherboard, or install duplicate ones.&nbsp; I do not know how to reset or clear these routines in motherboard memory.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions summary:<br />
<br />
(1) How can I get the boot sequence to work normally?<br />
<br />
(2) What should I do with the partitioning scheme; leave it as GPT or go back to MBR?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; The system is custom-built by Fry's Electronics and so, the make and model number are identified only as the motherboard number P8P67-LE.<br />
<br />
Their technical department worked on this problem a long time. They tried swapping out the motherboard, and swapping out the DVD drive. They updated the BIOS flash and assured that the motherboard is good, and is configured correctly.<br />
<br />
The Asus site chipset version 9.2.0.1015 is earlier than the one that shipped with the motherboard, version 9.2.0.1021, so that is supposed to be the latest.&nbsp; I reposted this question at Asus.&nbsp; A search there shows numerous questions about the "Windows Boot
 Manager" placed on the motherboard as opposed to a disk partition.<br />
<br />
The shop that built the machine says that as far as they can tell, the motherboard is good, and is configured correctly.&nbsp; They think that the problem has something to do with the "Windows Boot Manager" being in the board's NVRAM.&nbsp; That is the aspect that is
 different from ordinary boot sequence.&nbsp; They also suggested that when the boot process hangs, it may be looking at an incorrect file in the Win7 boot area.<br />
<br />
Is there perhaps some change that could be made in the Win7 boot files on the HD that would fix this?<br />
<br />
I have a second identical HD, which I could install and configure this as an ordinary MBR partitioning scheme (without altering the original HD) as an experiment.&nbsp; Would that be advisable, or would it alter or harm the existing "Windows Boot Manager" in the
 motherboard?<br />

            There are 2 hard drives in the computer, both using GPT.<br />
One is the system disk containing the ESP, MSR, and CVOL (Win7) partitions.<br />
The other is simply a data disk with two partitions on it.<br />
<br />
The number assigned to the disk depends upon which disk management tool you're using.&nbsp; Windows disk manager begins its numbering with "0", while Acronis begins the numbering with "1".<br />
<br />
Windows Disk Manager is referring to the two HD's as:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; System Disk = &nbsp; "Disk 1"<br />
&nbsp; Data Disk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; "Disk 0"<br />
<br />
The Acronis disk management tool refers to these two HD's as:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; System Disk =&nbsp;&nbsp; "Disk 2"<br />
&nbsp; Data Disk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; "Disk 1"<br />
<br />
This is somewhat unexpected since I had thought that yesterday the system disk had the lower number.&nbsp; It seems to have changed, in that the system disk is being assigned the higher of the two numbers, no matter which management tool is used.&nbsp; I had thought
 that the system disk (the one containing the OS) was usually assigned the lower of the two numbers.<br />
<br />
Can this have anything to do with the inability of the boot sequence to boot to the DVD drive?<br />
<br />

            <p>Yes. The system is obviously trying to boot&nbsp;off the data drive where there is no Boot file.You need to get all three in agreement i.e. Disk Management, Acronis and the Bios. Which drive has the System Reserved partition?</p>

            Thank you for your comments. <br />
<br />
It has no trouble booting into Windows from the "Windows Boot Manager" (WBM) which is in the NVRAM on the motherboard. The WBM is not on any HD.<br />
<br />
When the sequence for boot order is set to (1) WBM, (2) DVD, (3) HD, it has no trouble booting into Windows.<br />
<br />
In order to boot directly to a CD or DVD, it's easy to simply set the DVD to first boot priority, and the WBM as the second&nbsp; priority.&nbsp; The sequence then becomes (1) DVD, (2) WBM, (3) HD.<br />
<br />
But then, if there's no disk in the DVD drive, (that is, when the DVD drive is empty) it's supposed to default to the second choice, and boot to the WBM. But it hangs.
<br />
<br />
It did this even when the only HD in the box was the system disk. To prove this, I unplugged the data disk, and it still behaves the same way.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned in my previous comment, the Microsoft Reserved Parition (MSR) is on the system disk.<br />
<br />
Acronis is not installed nor running on the system at boot time.<br />
<br />
It seems that somehow, it boots into Windows just find as long as WBM is the first choice in the sequence.&nbsp; But it's not able to default to WBM as the second choice.<br />

            As an experiment,&nbsp; I set the boot order as (1) DVD, (2) WBM and (3) disabled (none.)<br />
<br />
With the DVD drive empty,&nbsp; it gives a message:<br />
<br />
"Reboot and select proper boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key"<br />
<br />
When item (3) was HD, it just hung and gave no message.&nbsp; Would this suggest that it's been skipping (2) WBM, and going directly to the third option?&nbsp; The only thing I changed was (3).<br />

 someone confirm.

<h3> obliviate77  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am trying to connect to a wireless connection, but my home network isn&#39;t listed.</h2>
                    I am running windows vista on a dell studio 540 desktop connecting to a d-link DIR-615 wireless router. im using an updated dell wireless 1505 draft 802.11n WLAN mini-card which is "working properly" according to device manager.<br />
<br />
i have gone through windows troubleshooting with no results. out of 3 computers in my house mine is the only one which cannot connect to the wireless. the other two are a macbook and an old compaq laptop. the signal isnt a problem and i can connect to other
 wireless networks (including the neighbors). the connection type is a WPA with AES encryption but that isnt the problem, i simply cannot find the wireless network. im connected right now through a local connection.<br />
<br />
i have connected to it before and it was working but i think this all happened after a windows update but im not sure when. and when i go to "manually connect to a wireless network" and i enter the information including the network name it says that the network
 already exists and i click "use the existing network" and it redirects me to the list of wireless connections but it isnt listed.<br />
<br />
please help, if u need more information let me know<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you connect in Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot) with networking. If so use that or a wired<br />
connection to update the driver.<br />
<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution? And I would<br />
update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are you positioned from the router? Are there
<br />
obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write
<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

How to Install a Device Driver in Vista Device Manager<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The<br />
ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Vista loves<br />
updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests one just HIDE it as they<br />
are almost alway old and you can look for drivers manually as needed.<br />

<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Right Side click Customize - Set Network Locations page -<br />
on lower left click Merge or delete networks&nbsp;locations&nbsp;- DELETE ALL instances of your network&nbsp;(and any&nbsp;<br />
others you no longer use) - REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect To to logon on to Network.<br />

<h2>            Asus X401U - wireless adapter &#58; Atheros AR9485 -- DEVICE CANNOT START &#58; ERROR CODE 10 -- HELP ME &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>please help me to solve my notebook's problem:</p>
<p>- before using windows 8.1, I used windows 8 and the wireless is working well, but when I try to install newer driver, a problem has encountered (Error code : 10 - device cannot start).</p>
<p>- I have tried some advice from some forum, like : uninstall-install, update new driver, etc. but it's still doesn't work....</p>
<p>- then I think this problem will solved if I upgrade to windows 8.1, because windows will reset setting and drivers
</p>
<p>,</p>
<p>BUT IT'S STILL DOES'T WORK, </p>
<p>help me, please....!!!</p>

            <p>Hi Ainulibnu,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Code 10 error code for a specific device under Device, in spite of reinstalling or updating drivers, might occur device configuration issues. The Code 10 error is mainly related to hardware and device driver issues or to compatibility
 issues for the device with the operating system. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First of all, check if this is the driver that you are trying to install:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=X401U&amp;os=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=X401U&amp;os=8</a></p>
<p>Note: Make sure that you uninstall the current version and then install the latest versions of driver.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=X401U&amp;os=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a></p>
<p>If this is the version that you are trying to install and you receive the error code, refer to the link and refer to the section “<b>Common resolutions for Code 10 error</b>” and then “<b>Troubleshooting methods for Code 10 error</b>”</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/en-us</a><span>&nbsp;

<p><b>Note</b>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, you can refer to the following steps to back the registry files on

            Is it happen only to the CyberLink shortcut, or maybe to every shortcut where you changed a location?<br />
<br />
Can you check this: <strong>Start</strong> &gt; Right click on the <strong>All Programs</strong> &gt; you can select
<strong>Open</strong> and <strong>Open All User</strong> &gt; Can you check isn't listed in both location?<br />
<br />
Usually shortcuts appear in the previous location after some updates of the specified application.

************** JIT Debugging **************<br />
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this<br />
application or computer (machine.config) must have the<br />
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.<br />
The application must also be compiled with debugging<br />
enabled.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;<br />
<br />
When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception<br />
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer<br />
rather than be handled by this dialog box.<br />

<h2>            Latest Vista Update stuck in Stage 3&#47;restart loop</h2>
                    I have Vista Business system on a Toshiba notebook, latest Service Pack and with all updates.&nbsp; It was fully functional when i last shut it down.&nbsp; I just booted it up to&nbsp;find the Stage 3 page of a Windows update.&nbsp; 0% progress shown, then it restarts, and
 opens at the same page again.&nbsp; Stuck in this loop.&nbsp; Have tried using F8 to get last good installation, and to stop auto restart, without success, it just keeps returning to the Stage 3 page and reboots.&nbsp; Tried Systems Repair which offered a System Restore,
 but that wouldn't start.&nbsp; System Repair now just keeps showing progress (for 3/4 hour) without any HD activity.&nbsp; I shut it down and it still restarts at same Stage 3 page.

 version of Vista are you using (e.g., 32-bit Vista Business SP2)?&nbsp; What type of backup are you trying to do (full, incremental, complete image,...)?&nbsp;&nbsp;When does the error occur (when you start the backup, during the backup, or when it is about to finish or
 when announcing it is finished)?</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I need the above information before I can suggest any course of action.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            Hi Bryan.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's a Fake Virus scam which can emanate from a mistyped URL it occupies.  
<br />
<br />Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the WIndows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps, organize by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner.  You can turn off the MB trial version in it's Control Panel.

<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Its a tech support scam.
<br />
<br />Its a scam, Microsoft does not call anybody to provide support.
<br />
<br /> Warning: There are "Tech Support Scams" pretending to be Windows 10 Activation Technologies. Please be vigilant. Microsoft never calls users to inform them their license is expiring. Neither should you get an email. Learn more in the following article:

</p><p>Okay.&nbsp; I've installed Malwarebytes and ADW cleaner.&nbsp; Ran full scans for each and am only coming up with one element for Malwarebytes.&nbsp;

<p>Unfortunately, I did call the number today but did not offer financial account numbers or information to anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I changed the main vault password for my LastPass password manager.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD stop code&#58; SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 build can't boot lately without having the USB driver disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to boot. the boot process is already very slow. But seconds after I log in, the system hangs and gives me the error above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booting into safe mode has helped me somewhat. checking the dmp files says the error is related to AndroidAFDx64.sys (which is ASUS's AI charger driver), renaming this file to an .old file helps, but disables all usb drivers. After using remote desktop to
 get in without USB drivers, I uninstalled all of ASUS AI suite, after booting, I get the same BSOD with system thread exception. But after investigating this crashdump, it says it is because of verifierext.sys?</p>
<p>
</p><p>also, all minidumps give me the error that its the fault of the ntoskrnl.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no clue how to move forward with this?</p>

            <p>you can't because one of the requirements of upgrade windows 10 is you need currently running windows 7 or windows 8.1 as stated below :&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Sign-in options problem&#58; The command &#34;never&#34; doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I am generally satisfied with Windows 10. For some problems I found the solution, for some I got good advice... However, there is one detail, which I don't like. In the "Sign-options" under " Require sign-in" I answered to this question: "If you been away,
 when should Windows require you to sign in again?" by clicking "never". </p>
<p>However, when the computer goes to sleep [or screen saver appears (then I switched it off)] and I wake the machine up, it keeps requiring the password. So I am a little bit fed up with typing the password zillion times a day. What could be the problem?</p>

<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />

You will not be able to use Microsoft account without password. </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you have local user account without password you can login with a single click on the user account. However,
 it is it's a good idea to keep your PC more secure by using a strong password.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you want to create a local user account follow this step:<br />
