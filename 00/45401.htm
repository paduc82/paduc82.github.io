            <p>A lot of Canadian companies which deal internationally (At least North South) usually need to use a common setting and the US region is a defacto standard.&nbsp; There are better ways to determine my location, I will happily tell you where I am, but that doesn't
 mean I want pc to change it's behavior, esp with keyboard and formats.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Headset adapter problems&#40;Party Chat Volume&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got a headset adapter and I'am a little annoyed by it. You know how when you don't have a headset plugged in and you enter a party chat, it takes the game volume down to like 60%. Then you plug in your headset and it brings the game volume back
 up to 100%. Well with this new adapter it doesn't do the change from 60 to 100. Is this something that will be worked out in the future or is there a way to make it so the game volume is louder when in party chat with or without headset.</p>

    <title>How to reduce the internet traffic in Windows 8.1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> serrzh  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to reduce the internet traffic in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We are in coastal Spain, and we are traveling. I&nbsp;use&nbsp;my phone hot spot&nbsp;to connect to the internet (because my Surface doesn't&nbsp;allow any SIM card). All the local mobile providers only allow 1 GB a month&nbsp;with their best plans. I last traveled with&nbsp;a Windows
 7 laptop and it was fine. But Windows 8 seems&nbsp;very megabyte hungry. I have to keep it airplane mode all the time, and once I let it to the internet, it immediately eats 5 to 10 megabytes even if I do absolutely nothing. I turned on the metered connection mode,
 but I can't tell for sure whether it helped or not, because the Windows goes crazy immediately I let it to the internet anyway&nbsp;and the megs counter, which I enabled for this connection keeps running up and up until another 5+ megs are counted, then it becomes
 quiet for a&nbsp;few minutes, then begins eating megs again, all of&nbsp;it without opening a single webpage. It ate up all my monthly plan&nbsp;in two days before I noticed I had to keep it in airplane mode. I&nbsp;bought extra megs (at twice the base rate), but it seems, with
 all my efforts to reduce the data traffic it is only going to&nbsp;let me as much as&nbsp;extra five days of internet, and I pay just for nothing, for some crazy service not critical to any of my tasks, because I'm perfectly OK with using computer offline most of the
 time and only need to open&nbsp;the same few&nbsp;webpages&nbsp;three to five times a day. But I pay for traffic which is tens of times more than the amount of data the websites actually send to me.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have checked with the&nbsp;Resource Monitor, and there are some&nbsp;images I spotted to&nbsp;generate a lot of traffic</p>
<p><br />

<p>WWAhost.exe</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I turned off whatever I thought affecting the automatic downloads, including both SmartScreens, the internet and the apps,&nbsp;and changed email settings from get-as-arrive to 30 minutes. But it only helped a little.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A lot of mystery for me is in this list. Most of the IP's refer to Microsoft, and some to cloud services. Amazingly, there's Facebook&nbsp;in the list although I've never used Facebook on this computer.

Every "live" start screen tile uses bandwidth to stay "live".&nbsp; Turn off things like news, weather, etc, by right clicking them and "tun off live tile"<br />

Disconnect facebook (and all other 3rd party connections).<br />

            <p>Hi ZigZag,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. Could you be so kind as to add few detail to your advice? How do I disconnect any third party connections, provided I don't control them? I've never installed Facebook on this particular machine (while I did on some others under
 the same my MS ID). Secondly, I always believed that staying away from editing the registry is the healthiest thing because any update to the software can have unpredictable results combined with my manual interception, but you advise otherwise. Then it would
 be very kind of you if you describe step-by-step how exactly it is done in the way that the effect was persistent and ensured safety and stability for long period, at least until Windows 9 is out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And for the live tiles, I didn't mention in the starter post but of course they were&nbsp;things where I looked firsthand to reduce the consumption. I in fact was surprised they didn't turn off by themselves once the metered mode&nbsp;was turned on. It would be logical
 (wouldn't it) same as offering user a&nbsp;checklist with all the automatic connections, displaying their consumption estimate and letting user turn down any of them, BEFORE user discovered his/her account with a mobile provider&nbsp;was too low and no any useful service
 was&nbsp;received in exchange&nbsp;for the money spent&nbsp;with it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>OK, until either the system learns to behave logical enough or any connection in any&nbsp;part in the world becomes non-metered, is it possible to provide FULL CHECKLIST on how to tune up Windows 8.1 to become METERED-LINE-FRENDLY?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your help is highly appreciated.</p>

            What region are you in? Cortana isn't available in all regions for some reason. For example, it's not available in Canada, which I find odd. I had to switch my region to the United States to get it.<br />

            <p>I have the same problem. Cortana "was" there on both my Start Menu and as a "Tile" to the right. Now it is simply GONE in both places. I've spent three frustrating and fruitless hours trying to surf up a cause and a way to correct this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I once had Cortana working but didn't like the way it "required" me to log onto my Windows PC with my Microsoft login, so I reverted to a "Local" login.&nbsp; Perhaps this is what caused Cortana to "disappear"?&nbsp; I was going to play around with it again
 tonight, but it's simply gone missing from Start Menu and Tiles.&nbsp; It is still available in the Search Bar and is active in Task Manager though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; COME ON MICROSOFT.........let us know how to correct this.&nbsp; Cortana is "apparently" still on my recently upgraded PC, but I sure can't find it on the Start Menu or the Tiles.</p>

<p>The problem resolved itself with the next Windows update I got.</p>
<p>Cortana does seem to have a bad habit of crashing the whole start-up process, though.</p>

    <title>Skype video settings changed with Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> synthesoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype video settings changed with Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated my system to Windows 10 Creator. I think that at that time my Skype settings changed. When making a video call, I used to see a video of myself in the lower right hand corner as well as the person I am calling in the big screen. Now the
 video of me is not there and I cannot figure out how to get it back. I have updated to the latest version of Skype and this did not change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any info would be appreciated. Thanks. </p>

            I am attempting a Windows 10 update, version 1709 and at about 25% update, it says Trend Micro Internet Security 2009 and Trend Micro Internet Security 2008 needs to be uninstalled. Trend Micro does not appear on my list of programs to uninstall. I downloaded
 and ran the Trend Micro Uninstall Tool but that did not work either. I still have the same message and can't update Windows.

            Talked to someone in Tech dept. and they removed windows 10 software and then reinstalled windows 10.&nbsp; This took&nbsp; care of the problem.&nbsp; It seems to&nbsp; be working now.

<p>I worked with several microsoft tech support people, level one and level two.&nbsp; Finally told it require a clean install.&nbsp; Not knowing how to do all things required I drove 100 miles to a microsoft store and after 8 days and them not being able to find Trend
 Micro they ask permission to do a clean re-install of windows 10.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; Will wait and see what happens with the next windows update.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

            In other words wipe my hard drive and reinstall windows 10 from scratch and all of my applications?&nbsp; that is unacceptable.&nbsp; I guess I'll wait till there is a logical way to up grade.&nbsp;

            Thats what I finally consented to. Like you Im not happy. Please let me know if windows 10 does update for you again without clean install. By the way they charged me $149.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 8 Pro OEM CD not being recognised on Mac&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramen rat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Pro OEM CD not being recognised on Mac&#33;</h2>
                    I purchased a Windows 8 Pro OEM license DVD the other day to install via BootCamp on my iMac (27 inch, mid-2011). Unfortunately the slot drive whizzes for around 30 seconds and the DVD pops out. The DVD is being recognized by my Acer laptop running Windows
 7 though. It could very well be a problem with my Mac's drive, but what are my options? I tried creating an ISO image of the installation DVD and then reburning that onto a clean DVD, but the burn isn't succeeding (I tried burning it on both the Mac and the
 Acer laptop).<br />
<br />
What options do I have? Is there a way to get a download of the setup file for BootCamp? Can I get a replacement of my DVD?<br />
<br />
Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. The Mac recognizes most other DVDs and CDs, and that's why I'm not so sure the problem lies with my Mac's drive.</div>

            <p>Try using the same .ISO to create a bootable USB thumb drive and boot from that.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also make sure your firmware for your Mac along with running the latest version of OS 10.8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Setup process
<p>Because we haven't talked about this in a while, let's take a gander at the Boot Camp installation process as it stands in Mountain Lion. Here's what you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Mac that supports Mountain Lion and has at least 20GB of free disk space, though more is obviously preferable.</li><li>A valid Windows 8 or Windows 8 Pro license key. For the purposes of this article, we're going to assume you're working with the 64-bit version of Windows (and at this point, you probably should be anyway).</li><li>If you're using a Mac with an optical drive <em>or</em> a MacBook Air older than the 2011 model, you'll need a Windows 8 install DVD (and, for the older Airs, an external optical drive).</li><li>If you're using a 2011 or 2012 MacBook Air or any other Mac without an optical drive, you'll need either an external optical drive and a Windows 8 install DVD,
<em>or</em> a 4GB or larger USB stick and a Windows 8 ISO file. More on this in a bit.</li><li>A FAT-formatted external drive or blank CD or DVD on which to store the Windows driver files.</li></ul>
<p>Once you've gathered the necessary materials, launch the Boot Camp Assistant from Spotlight or by navigating to Applications and then to Utilities. It will walk you through partitioning your drive to install Windows, downloading the necessary driver files
 to your external drive, and (for newer MacBook Airs, Retina MacBook Pros, iMacs, and Mac Minis without optical drives), creating a USB installer for Windows from an ISO file.</p>
<a href="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/boot-camp-support.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn.arstechnica.net%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f11%2fboot-camp-support-640x448.jpg" /></a>

<span>/</span> Downloading Windows drivers with the Boot Camp Assistant.</div>
<p>Users of slightly older Macs, however, will notice that the installer still requires a Windows install DVD before it will start working, and the option to create a USB drive isn't even available—those with access to an optical drive cannot opt to use any
 other method. Strangely, this requirement applies even to 2010, 2009, and 2008-era MacBook Airs, all of which shipped without optical drives; people with those computers will have to find an external optical drive before continuing.</p>
<p>After formatting your drive, let the Boot Camp Assistant reboot your computer, and install Windows to your newly created Boot Camp partition as you would to any PC. When going through the installer, be sure to reformat the Boot Camp partition to NTFS, but
 don't delete it—this will break the partition and require you to start over again from the beginning.</p>
<p>These days, the Windows installer is dead simple to get through as long as you're not terrified of technology—enter your product key and create a user account and you've done most of the heavy lifting. Once you reach the Start screen, insert the external
 drive containing the Windows support files, navigate to it from the desktop, and run setup.exe.</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn.arstechnica.net%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f11%2f1.jpg" />
<div>Installing the Boot Camp support software in Windows 8.</div>
<p>The Boot Camp installer shouldn't throw up any red flags—accept all of the setup defaults, and sit back and wait while it installs all of Apple's driver software along with Apple Software Update, and reboot when it prompts you to.</p>

<h2>            Downloading Worlds From Owned Minecraft Realms</h2>
                    How do you download worlds from realms that you own? I've checked within the minecraftWorlds folder but found nothing. I'm running Windows 10 edition.

<h2>            Pictures and Desktop folder both named &#39;Documents&#39; and I can&#39;t change the name.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I thought I would get round to the task of moving my user files (documents, downloads, pictures etc) to my second hard drive. However, for some reason, my pictures and desktop folder have been renamed to 'documents' and I can't rename them. I have
 tried rebooting after moving them somewhere else, but no luck. Could someone please help? Thanks.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c1345c6-7a06-4d32-8c1c-5900fdfe6fd1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c1345c6-7a06-4d32-8c1c-5900fdfe6fd1?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi Michael,
<br />
<br />Did you forget to specify a destination folder on your other drive when moving those library folders?
<br />
<br />This will require a Registry Fix . . 
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Click View and make sure 'Address Bar' is turned on
<br />
<br />Paste this into the Address Bar at the top and hit Enter
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting Registry window . . .       
        </p>

            Hi michael
<br />
<br />If you closed the Registry Editor, open that back up, it will still be on the same page
<br />
<br />In the right pane, double click Personal and in the resulting dialog, set its value to:
<br />
<br />%USERPROFILE%\Documents
<br />
<br />Click OK close the Registry Editor and restart your PC
<br />
<br />That will have moved your Documents folder back to its original location in C:\Users\yourname\Document
<br />
<br />You will need to manually move any files that should be in that folder back from the Desktop folder on your F drive
<br />
<br />Then you need to do the same again, this time in the right hand pane, Double click My Pictures and set that to %USERPROFILE%\Pictures then restart your PC again
<br />
<br />You also need to reset these values at the top of the right hand pane . . .
<br />
<br />F42EE2D3-909F-4907-8871-4C22FC0BF756} to %USERPROFILE%\Documents
<br />
<br />{0DDD015D-B06C-45D5-8C4C-F59713854639} to %USERPROFILE%\Pictures<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/437ef22f-fdd8-4d25-9358-59f90430e16f?upload=true" />

<br />
<br />That looks like it has relocated correctly . . .
<br />
<br />Open 2 Windows File Explorer window ( Windows Key + E twice)
<br />
<br />In one navigate to that folder and in the other navigate to the F:\Desktop Folder
<br />
<br />Drag any files that should be in your Documents folder across, do you still get that error?

<p><strong>Win 7 Pro w/ 100mb hidden System Partition</strong></p>
<p>I am admittedly ignorant of much regarding Windows 7. &nbsp;My working drive has Windows 7 and all of what I use as drive C:, and a 100mb System Partition marked as Q which is inaccessible under normal startup or Safe Mode. &nbsp;Is this "normal"? &nbsp;I'm assuming the
 partition is on there for disaster/recovery reasons, but my question is: &nbsp;is it normal for that partition to be locked in such a way not even the ADMINISTRATOR can access it? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Techwest,</p>
<p>The 100MB partition is a system partition created automatically when Windows 7 is installed and contains boot files. I don't believe Disk Manager&nbsp;will allow you to remove this partition, because removing this partition could cause the system to not boot.&nbsp;
 With the&nbsp;size of hard drives these days, it doesn't seem like it should be an issue.</p>

                    <p>original title: DNS WIFI Network Connection Problems</p>
<p>Hello everyone, </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>this is my weirdest experience with WIFI connections so far. So let me explain.</div>
<div>I have multiple WIFI connection to my modem/router which work fine, 2 mobiles and 2 laptops work just great, all wireless.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I've got this new ASUS wireless adapter for in my PC, and it's giving me a headache, and the ASUS support... well, what support?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I turn on my pc, my pc connects to the router with full connection bars. But, there's no internet, I'm getting DNS SERVER NOT FOUND, this happens every time when booting the pc. But, when my pc has already booted, and I then reset the router, I will
 receive internet with correct working DNS and then everything works. But ofcourse, when then rebooting my pc again, it loses DNS and I can restart the router once again...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried everything I know, setting DNS manually doesn't work, renewing ip and flushing dns in CMD does not work either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My configuration</div>
<div>------</div>
<div>Windows 7 Professional x64</div>
<div>ASUS PCE-N15 11n Wireless card</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>DHCP Enabled<br />
Automatic dns and ip settings (ip4/ip6)</div>
<div>------</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really hope you guys can help me, it's driving me crazy and the problem keeps existing for already a month now.</div>
                </div>

    <title>Computer screen is tinted blue, display color calibration won&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melanne1322  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer screen is tinted blue, display color calibration won&#39;t work.... &#40;display issue&#41;</h2>
                    <p>After drawing some art in Photoshop, I transferred it to my phone (iPhone 6) to post on social media. That's when I noticed that what used to look periwinkle on my pc screen looked more lavender on my phone. After comparing the same color by its hex code
 between screens and consulting friends, I'm pretty much certain it's my computer that's having a color issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seemed like a simple fix when I looked it up the problem: display color calibration. However, whenever I try to do that I receive an error window saying "Display Color Calibration can't save the new calibration. Close other programs that are open and
 try again." Obviously, I've tried checking to make sure that no other programs are open. As far as my Task Manager can say, no other programs were open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried checking my drivers to make sure they're all updated, and I really just have no idea what to do now. I'm in no way an expert on how computers/drivers/etc. actually work, so would appreciate a noob's guide on how to solve this problem. Thanks ^_^;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here're some specs if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Dell System XPS L321X</p>
<p>-OS: Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Edition (64-bit) Service Pack 1</p>
<p>-CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2637M CPU @ 1.70GHz</p>
<p>
</p><p>Idk if it matters but I tried out Windows 10 during the free trial but didn't like it (the format was too wonky for me to navigate), so I reverted it back to Windows 7.</p>

<p>Hi Melanne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There may be several factors that can be attributed to this kind of issue. But focusing on the issue with the calibration not working properly, can you tell us if you are trying to do the native
<strong>Windows 7</strong> <strong>Calibrate Display Color</strong> <strong>Tool</strong>, or a different calibration tool from your PC's manufacturer? Please advise so we can provide further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, we suggest booting your PC in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong> via Advanced startup options, and then try
 the calibration again to see if it will work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

<p>Hello, I am pretty sure I am using the Windows one; I've tried from both:</p>
<p>1. Color Management &gt; Advanced &gt; Calibrate Color</p>
<p>2. Control Panel &gt; Appearance &amp; Personalization &gt; Display &gt; Calibrate Color</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried it in Safe Mode as you suggested, and came up with a different error message right at the start of Color Calibration:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Display Color Calibration can’t calibrate the selected display because it can’t determine if the display is “mirrored,” which means the desktop is duplicated and show on different displays. Display Color Calibration can’t calibrate a display that’s mirrored."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further suggestions?</p>

<p>Thanks for following up. Can you verify to us the setup of your display? On the desktop, hold the
<strong>Windows</strong> key and press <strong>P</strong> to launch the Project shortcut tab. If you are only using one monitor, it should be set to
<strong>PC screen</strong> only. Once done, try the calibration once again and see what goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, an error message like this can also be attributed to malwares or viruses. Taking that into consideration, we suggest scheduling a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026132/windows-schedule-a-scan-in-windows-defender-antivirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Defender</a></strong> scan, or any third party anti-virus programs that you may have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome of the scan.</p>

<p>Thanks again for following up, Melanne. We tried some tests on our end and the only reason that we could come up for the reason why the native Windows display calibration won't work is due to conflict with other graphics feature installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's check if you have the <strong>Intel HD Graphics Control Panel</strong>, shall we? Go to Cortana search bar, type "Graphics" and look for Intel HD Graphics Control Panel. Launch the Panel if it is available, and try to change the settings of your color
 display from there.</p>

<p>Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sticking with this as I try to figure it out. Did some changes through Intel Control Center as you recommended. I messed around with the RGB values under Color Enhancement for a while, trying to match plain blue (0,0,255) on my phone. In the end
 I couldn't quite make it match although it's pretty close. When comparing between red or green, my computer color in comparison to my phone or iPad just looks slightly faded/washed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you've got any further ideas, I guess I'll have to live with it until I get a new computer one day. ^^;</p>

<p>Hi Melanne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might need to restore the default settings in the <strong>Intel HD Graphics Control Panel
</strong>to achieve what you're aiming for. If restoring default settings doesn't help, we need to consider checking the hardware parts, especially the cable connector of the PC down to the monitor. In some cases, an old VGA adapter cable can cause poor and
 incorrect color calibration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us in the loop. </p>

<p>Aileen,</p>

</p><p>I'm not sure what you're talking about..I don't have any cable connector. I'm on a laptop, not a pc connected monitor, specs listed in the OP description. Before, it was already on default settings. If I were to change it back to default now, the wrong color
 would come back.</p>

<p>Hi Melanne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some incorrect display configuration options can result to several errors when saving your Display Color Calibration settings and issues with your screen display. Since the procedures above did not yield a positive outcome, we highly advise that you u<span><span>ninstall
 the display drivers, download the latest drivers from your manufacturer’s website, and then reinstall them. You may follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button and choose the</span></span><strong> Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System and Security</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>System</strong>, choose <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li><span><span>In the <strong>Device Manager</strong> window, expand <strong>Display adapters</strong> and select your display adapter.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Right-click on the display card and click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click <strong>OK.</strong></span></span></li><li><span><span>Download the display drivers from your manufacturer’s website.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Install the driver.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Restart the computer.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the steps above will rectify your concern.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
It seems like you want to change the color settings for the camera on the computer.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me gather some information:</p>
<p><br />
1) Is it a desktop or a laptop?<br />
2) If laptop, what is the Make and Model of the computer?<br />
3) Are you using Camera app to use the camera on the computer?</p>
<p>4) Have you installed any software application for the camera? If yes, did you change the settings with the software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
If you want to change the color settings for the camera which you have synced with the camera app, you can refer to the link to do so:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the section “<strong>How do I adjust my camera settings?”</strong></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/camera-app-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/camera-app-faq</a>
</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it’s the built-in or an external camera, on which you want to change the settings, you can refer to the manufacturer website to&nbsp;get the details.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do get back to us if you have any other Windows related issue.</p>

</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be assured that we would do our best to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>This issue could be due to driver conflict.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the methods below and check if issue persists:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Disable automatic restart on system failure.
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to disable automatic restart on system failure:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows key + R</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type in <strong>
Control</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
System and Security</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
System</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the task pane on the left, click on
<strong>advanced system settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Locate the <strong>

<strong>uncheck the check box next to automatically restart</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>
OK</strong> in the Startup and Recovery window.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Safe Mode</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed. Boot the computer
 in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps in the article to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=wi<span>ndows-7</span></span></span></span></a></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span>
<strong><span>Clean Boot</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Clean boot will help us identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the article below to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.c<span>o<span>m/kb/929135</span></span></span></span></span></a></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Please refer to the section:
<strong><span>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</span></strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
