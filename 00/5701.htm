<h2>            Stolen phone fraudulently removed from my device list</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my Nokia Lumia 1320 was stolen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I activated it on "Find my phone" so I was able to follow it for a couple of hours. I blocked it with a PIN but I did not erase data because I wanted to be able to keep on following it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple of hours the device become unreachable and then was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
removed from my device list without me being nor warned nor asked for authorization</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This is, in my opinion, a HUGE security hole.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;would like to know if exists a call center / security support center&nbsp;I can call to :</p>
<p>1. inform that a certain IMEI belongs to a stolen phone so that Microsoft can prevent from giving services to this phone (email, store, etc.)?</p>
<p>2. ask to know the name of the account and IP address that tries to register an account on a stolen device, so that I can inform the Police?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Nothing like that exists within Microsoft. Your phone gets automatically removed from your device list when it is reset with another account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should report your phone as lost/stolen to your network, which will then blacklist it based on IMEI. Usually the blacklisting works countrywide, i.e. the phone will not be able to work on any network in your country. The police don't care about a stolen
 phone, they get thousands of these reports every day. The only point of informing the police is that if by chance they find your phone along with other stolen goods or in possession of a criminal caught for something else they might return it to you. The problem
 is that after it has been blacklisted you cannot use it either.</p>

            <p>Hi and thank you for the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understood (and suspected) that I cannot do anything for my stolen phone. After all Microsoft is much more interested that I buy a new phone (which I did) than to help me to find my stolen phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would consider an act of fair behavior from Microsoft towards the honest consumer, is that the day in which my phone is removed from my device list, I am informed on the IP address from which this removal is being asked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Microsoft must be warned: this is another negative point I take note of, and&nbsp;I think there are a lot of uses that are doing the same.&nbsp;Last week my son had to decide if buying a Windows Phone or an Android. He bought an Android because Microsoft is not
 offering anything more than other mobile manufacturer: I do not know if Google tells me the IP address of who is resetting my phone, but for sure Microsoft doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p>Microsoft currently offer the only unhackable and 100% virus-proof mobile OS. Google will not tell you anything, but will gladly share everywhere you have been on the internet with anyone who will pay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said the removal is not requested from the phone - it happens automatically on the server after the phone is reset, which can be done without a connection from the phone to the Internet - so what IP address do you expect to learn and what exactly do
 you think you can do with it even if you know it ? Call in the SWAT team on a random cafe offering free wifi ? You may need to cut down on your Hollywood diet.</p>

<p>There is definitely a moment in which the telephone connects to Microsoft network to communicate it has been reset. That happens from a certain IP address and I think it is my right, as owner (and payer) of the phone, to know from which IP address the modification
 to my list of device has been requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then what I am able to do with this information (remember: this is a worldwide service, thus you cannot know how much the Police is efficient in my country) is not something Microsoft should worry about.</p>

            <p>Results from the Devices list and the Find My Phone feature seems to vary by user, and possibly location? - I had to manually remove a Lumia 720 a week after it was flashed with the recovery tool and gifted to a friend. The location of my Lumia 630 is last
 updated September 2015 despite being used occasionally during the winter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logins to the Microsoft account can be followed on<br />
<a href="https://account.live.com/Activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/Activity</a>
</p>
<p>Beware that the login location&nbsp;from both PC's and mobile devices in the list are based on public databases of IP-addresses, not the actual location(!)<br />
For me, the locations are, normally, in different cities in Denmark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Login from foreign countries to sensitive account information (e.g.&nbsp;if I use a&nbsp;proxy based browser on the phone) triggers a security alert to all the mail addresses and the phone number configured in my account security settings, pending approval.<br />
But again, this is an area where Your Mileage May Vary.</p>

<h2>            Nokia X6- Menu&#47;Call buttons not working</h2>
                    
<p>Well, my phone was fully functional, until I dropped it off my bed, then stood on it getting up to get it off the floor, anywhoo, the screen had broke and only the three buttons on the bottom were working. I sent the phone off to be fixed and hey presto,
 I got a new fully functioning screen, but now the three buttons along the bottom do not work. Does anybody have any solutions, before I send it off to be fixed AGAIN. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            D Link DWA 131 USB adapter issue - Unable to install correct drivers</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been at this for a few days now, I have the latest build update for the Windows 10 preview, however my D Link DWA 131 WiFi USB adapter will not work on the new OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried installing from disc, tried all previous OS backwards compatibility combinations, checked these forums and also tried downloading the drivers from D Link's website - with no success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This same adapter works perfect on Windows 8, 8.1 and 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manager consistently provides the usual invalid driver/unable to start message after any drivers say they have been installed for the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have this issue too at least something similar. I've tried to install the latest 10130 build with rufus gpt for uefi, but after the setup loads the files nothing happens, my screen stays black. After that when I did a restart the previously installed windows
 8.1 started with an error message from the windows 10 installer: 0xc1900101 - 0x20017 an error occured during boot.</p>
<p>I still couldn't install it. Can somebody help?</p>

<h2>            Exchange vs. IMAP Accounts</h2>
                    <p>One of my employers provided me with an Office 365 account. I use both the web based version and OWA app on my iPhone and they sync very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been so happy with it I decided to get a subscription to Office 365 and use it for my own company's email. My firm's email is currently run by my long time ISP (IMAP or POP account?) and I've been able to login and get my mail delivered into Outlook,
 but noticed that it does not sync with OWA. Is this because my employer has an Exchange / Office 365 account?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that what I have as an Office 365 subscriber and can cut out the need for ISP hosting my mail anymore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will moving from a hosted mail account to Office 365 fix the sync issue with OWA?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my own domain name, so if I move from my current host to Office 365 hosting, can I keep the addresses as is (I don't want to use onmicrosoft.com as part of my longtime email address)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance-</p>

<h2>            Email never arrives from my work email address...</h2>
                    i have an hotmail account that does not receive email from my work account. My work account is not blocked nor is it listed as a spam address in Hotmail. I am stumped. I also don't get replies to messages which I send from hotmail to my company email address
 and then reply to...if that makes sense. All other email to my Hotmail account seems to work fine.

<h3> krullen  say:</h3>
<h2>            How does Generating Location work without GPS&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Regarding the Location feature. I do not have a&nbsp;GPS phone, so coordinates would be generated by cell phone tower data.<br />
</span><span><br />
Are these coordinates&nbsp;obtained solely from the transmission of&nbsp;'special' text messages, or does EDGE/GPRS&nbsp;mobile internet&nbsp;data communications play a role in&nbsp;Location detection?<br />
</span><span><br />
I currently sync with MyPhone over Wi-Fi (WLAN) and do not have&nbsp;a mobile internet&nbsp;data service plan.&nbsp;Contemplating&nbsp;a&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Add-on Plan,&nbsp;but only if EDGE/GPRS Internet&nbsp;Data is a requirement for the MyPhone&nbsp;Location feature.

            My belief is that it registers location from tower locations ... I do not believe that it sends Text Mesages (but that is just a guess).&nbsp; I will try to verify that for you.&nbsp; It is the weekend so it may be a couple days to get back if I can get a response.

<p>Thank you for answering.&nbsp; My e-mail program is Hotmail and also Yahoo.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to do&nbsp;it through Hotmail (I also have Windows Live Messenger).&nbsp; I think that I've deleted Outlook Express and when I had it, it would not e-mail my webcam pictures and that's
 why I got rid of it.&nbsp; My webcam can also do audio and video recording and I'm worried that they won't e-mail, either.&nbsp; I just don't know why&nbsp;it still won't e-mail them, so any help that you can offer is very much appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you and hope that you can
 help.</p>

<h2>            Uninstall free version of Onenote 2013 without disturbing my existing one note 2007 files</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>I have been using onenote 2007 and love it. &nbsp;But I downloaded the free version of onenote 2013 from the web and since then have been facing a lot of problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sync I upgraded the existing 2007 notebook to 2013. &nbsp;I have many linked pages in onenote&nbsp;2007. &nbsp;These links DONT WORK in the 2013 version but worked well in the 2007 version, so I downgraded to 2007, the cache got corrupted, which I mistakenly deleted.
 &nbsp;Now I have my original 2007 files, with pages and sections which are double/triple the original and missing some info. &nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to uninstall 2013 without disrupting what I have left of my 2007 one note files. &nbsp;Can anyone help me here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

<p><span><span>Try following these steps to reset the further reset your location of your Favorites. It sounds like you may be missing your Favorites folder that should be in your
 %userprofile% location. Follow these steps to reset the functionality of your Favorites folder:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Computer</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>In
 the address bar, paste this location:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>%userprofile%</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong>
 on your keyboard</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Make
 sure you have a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Favorites</strong> folder listed in the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>%userprofile%</strong> folder</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>If
 there isn’t a Favorites folder listed, create a new folder and name it<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Favorites</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Right
 click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Favorites</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Properties</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click
 the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Location</strong> tab</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Restore

<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If that doesn’t help, please retry editing the registry to direct the Shell:Favorites location to the location of your Favorites folder. You can do
 this by:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>In
 the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Open: </strong>field, type <strong>
regedit</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Yes</strong>
 on the<span>&nbsp; </span><strong>User Account Control</strong> (if prompted)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Navigate
 to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Right
 click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Favorites</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Modify…</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>In
 the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Value data:</strong> field, paste<span>&nbsp;
</span><strong>%userprofile%\Favorites</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong></span></span></span></p>

 Editor</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Then test to see if you can add Favorites to your Internet Explorer again. If you can, but your old favorites aren’t listed in your favorites, you will need to manually
 move your old favorites from their current location to the %userprofile%\Favorites location.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Try searching your computer for a favorite or favorite folder name that you remember to see if you can find where they are being stored. Once you find them, copy the
 favorites and folders located there and paste them into the %userprofile%\favorites location.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that helps, look forward to hearing back from you.</span></span></p>

            Hello<br />
Since I upgraded my Lumia 730 to WP10 late 2016, the bluetooth connection got messed up. When I pair with my headset or laptop, after an hour or so, it loses connection with the other device. The only way to re-establish connection is to re-start the Lumia
 730 phone.&nbsp;<br />
This has happened even during calls or during maps navigation.<br />
I have done hard and soft resets; I even have the latest 10.0.14393.576 software. I have read thru the change-log of the Jan 2017 WP 10.0.14393.693 upgrade, and the bluetooth failed issue wasn't captured/corrected.<br />
If after updating to 10.0.14393.693 and the issue remains unresolved, I will downgrade to WP8.1.<br />

<h3> ml0310  say:</h3>
<h2>            2013 Excel filter doesn&#39;t work auto fit doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    I am a new user of Excel 2013 via Office 365. I've used Excel since it came out in 1985. So I am baffled by these ordinary functions not working. I can't get the auto-fit column and heigth to work. I can't get the filter function to install in the first
 row on the second sheet. The data is simple text of less than 100 characters in each cell occupying only four columns and 11,000 rows.

<p>I had avast pro 4.8,ad aware pro,spyhunter pro,installed on my pc and i &nbsp;deleted all three and then installed microsoft security essentials and was using it for about a week,did several quick scans and everything was fine,but when i did a full scan i got&nbsp;this
 warning saying&nbsp;<strong><span> </span></strong></p>

<p>i have checked the unlocker site and it states this is a false positive? i like this program and have reverted back to version 1.8.5 which seems to have no problem with mse as it don,t have the ebay shortcut option,even if you do not install the ebay shortcut
 option mse still gives the warning.</p>

<h2>            Living on a border.</h2>
                    Use to make canada and united states calls that was included in one subscription for 2.99, it was great because I live in washington and closest town is in white rock bc. It is price gouging of microsoft to make us pay two subscriptions of over 6.00 per
 plan, anyone in the same boat and your answer to this w/b appreciated.&nbsp;

</p><p>I understand that you have lost your legacy subscription of calls to US and Canada. This old subscription is no longer available and prices are subject to change. The alternative subscription closest to this is the North America Unlimited minutes, which
 is $6.99 per month, $19.92 every 3 months and $71.30 every 12 months. The Unlimited North America includes calls to Canada, US, Mexico, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands and US Virgin Islands.</p>

<h2>            I am trying to install Office 2013 - failed and corrupted Office 2010</h2>
                    I downloaded the demo copy of Office 2013 and tried to install it on my Windows 7 machine with Office 2010. It progresses for some time, creating folders and copying files, then it fails giving this message:<br />
<br />
Error 1402. Setup cannot open the registry key<br />
LINKNOWN\Components\57634D5732AA1D11A9CC0006794C4E25\46002109070000000( Verify that you have sufficient permissions to access the registry or contact Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) for assistance. For information about how to contact P55, see C:\UsersVim\AppData\Local\Temp\Setup000011d4\PSS10R.CHM.<br />
<br />
By that time, it has corrupted my Office 2010 installation. It removes the Office15 folder.<br />

            <p>1. Run the Office 2013 troubleshooter provided in the article below which removes the Office 2013 traces completely.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Regarding ‘This action is only valid for products that are currently installed error’, follow the steps mentioned in the article below:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2674519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2674519</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Once this issue is fixed, if you still face the problem in opening Outlook then try the following methods.
</p>
<p>Method 1: </p>
<p>Try to reset the navigation pane and verify the status. To do so Click on Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Run copy and paste the following command line in the open box and press Enter</p>
<p>Outlook /resetnavpane</p>
<p>Note: Note: There is space between Outlook and /</p>
<p>Method 2: </p>
<p>Check if Outlook is in a compatibility mode: </p>
<p>a&gt; Open My Computer&gt;Local Disk C&gt;Program Files&gt;Microsoft Office&gt;Office 14&gt;Outlook.exe.</p>
<p>(If you are using a 64 bit machine, go to C:\Program Files x86\Microsoft Office&gt;Office 14&gt;Outlook.exe)
</p>
<p>b&gt; Right click on Outlook.exe and click on Properties and then click on Compatibility tab. Check if you have any check mark in any of the compatibility mode options. Make sure you also click on the option "change settings for all users" tab at the bottom
 of the same screen and look for similar check boxes in the window.</p>
<p>c&gt; If you see any check boxes in the compatibility mode options, uncheck all the boxes and click on Apply and OK.
</p>
<p>d&gt; Try to open outlook again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Then restart the Computer in Clean Boot and try installing Office 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the article below on how to Clean boot:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting in clean boot, ensure you restart the computer in<span>&nbsp;</span>normal mode.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I detected an error in the Recycle Bin of the document libraries of some Sites in Sharepoint.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>When I delete files from a library of a Site, they appear in the Recycle Bin of other Sites.</p>

<p>Hi Jaume,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per my test, all the items in the recycle bin are from the same site collection. But items from different subsites of the same site collection will appear together in the recycle bin. Please check if these two sites are subsites within the same site collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they are two separate site collections, please check if this behavior could be reproduced in other site collections and see if it's related to the site settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if there is any update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>
