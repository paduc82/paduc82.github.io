    <title>Using Windows account instead of local account removed file write - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using Windows account instead of local account removed file write permissions - how to restore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I joined the Windows Insider Program to get Windows 10 insider preview build 10532 so that I could have coloured title bars to my windows. This required me to sign in to my PC with a "Microsoft account" instead of the local account that I had been using
 since upgrading from Windows 7. When Windows 10 build 10532 was downloaded and installed and the PC rebooted, I could change the colour of title bars, but I couldn't save any files, and I could only open saved documents as "read only".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the only user of this PC and it has only one user account that I can log into, which naturally has Administrator status. I found that if I examined folders and files using the context menu the "write" permissions for home users was not ticked. I could
 tick the box and gain access to the file or folder, but as I have hundreds of folders, and thousands of files, this was not an acceptable solution.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>I then found that if I went into Settings-&gt;Accounts and used the option "Sign in with a local account instead" to sign out of my Microsoft account and sign in with my local account, most (but not all) of the file write permissions problems have gone away
 and I can use the machine fairly normally again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that if I run netplwiz this dialogue appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df6df55f-7bb8-4a8f-9b57-0e5933a53a38" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>which shows two user accounts, although the Windows 10 start menu Settings-&gt;Accounts shows only one user account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because this is a one-user PC in my home office, and not on a network, I have never looked into Windows security aspects in detail. Why the change from logging in as a local account to logging in as a Microsoft account should result in me being deprived
 of write permissions on my own machine is rather a mystery to me and I would be grateful if someone could explain this to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally I would like to find some solution that enables me, as sole user and administrator of this PC, to grant myself write access to *all* files and folders in one go. I have Windows Home Premium so I don't have access to the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc).</p>

            <p><span>Hi David,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The other one is the default&nbsp;one which will be created&nbsp;when you setup Windows, so you do not worry, about it.</span></p>
<p><span>We are aware of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can fix this using these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the properties of the main user profile folder where the files are located (such as Documents, Pictures, etc.).
</span></li><li><span>Go to the Security tab and click Advanced.
</span></li><li><span>Check the box at the bottom of this window. It is labeled "Replace all child object permissions with inheritable permissions from this object" and then click Ok.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Kalpana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed back in with my Microsoft account, which is a bit of a pain because it required me to go through the verification process of receiving a code via email again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then followed the steps that you outlined. Unfortunately this does not seem to work, because I received an error message as shown in the picture below when I tried to apply it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc41cd6b-de78-4a74-8ce2-d58ec2d41829" /></p>
<p>
The error message is rather difficult to understand because the window behind the error message says that it is setting security information on a file in a different folder to the folder that the error message is complaining about.
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried pressing the "Continue" option and it did a few more files and then returned the same error, and then I pressed "Continue" again a few dozen times and the process eventually finished. I don't know why I should get the "Access is denied" message when
 I am signed in as Administrator. This is a very frustrating aspect of Windows security.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try using the PC now after going through this process and see if I have write access to my folders and files, still signed in with my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unhappy that the process did not run cleanly and reset the access permissions for *all* the files in my documents directory. Can this be corrected/resolved?<br />
<br />
Kind regards - David</p>

            It is now 5 October and I have been using my PC without any problems since my last message on 16 September, and the errors that were thrown up during the process haven't shown up as problems since, so I conclude that the procedure worked.<br />

            <p>I had the same problem today.&nbsp; Windows 10 Pro x64 kept repeatedly installing kb3119142.&nbsp; Without boring you with unnecessary details, here's what I did to fix the problem:</p>
<p>1. Went into Programs and Features list of installed programs.</p>
<p>2. Right clicked on Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable (x64) - 11.0.61030</p>
<p>.....then clicked on Change, then clicked on Repair.&nbsp; After repair was completed, I was instructed to Restart my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reboot, the problem was gone.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Colin,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is it the first time you are trying to connect it or it was working fine before?</span></li><li><span>If it was working fine before, did you make any recent changes (Hardware or Software) on your computer?</span></li><li><span>Have you tried to connect any other headset to this computer? Was the result same?</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>As you have mentioned that you are unable to install the drivers and getting error ‚Äú</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)</span><span><span>‚Äù. It means there might be a chance
 that some third party application/services or firewall is restricting it to be installed on your computer.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot</strong> and then try to
<strong>disable security software </strong>temporarily, if any installed on your computer and then try to install the driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Perform</strong> <strong>clean boot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

            <p>I was just about ready to send it back to Amazon, since there were no drivers on the Microsoft website, and all the experts just asked questions that didn't relate. If you get a new device, you just assume these days that it either comes with a disk, you
 can download, or it is plug and play. I hear your pain. I was so I was totally frustrated.
</p>
<p>When I finally saw that it was recognized under "devices" I was able to click on that, and under options was able to switch from the default "speakers" to the second option, which was the LX 6000 and it worked.</p>
<p>Then there was the hurdle that no one tells you: speech recognition. When I clicked on that, and did some training...it now works.

            Hi CemKolukƒ±sa, 
<br />
<br />Could you try the following:
<br />- Right-click the sound icon in the taskbar/system tray
<br />- Select Volume Mixer from the lists
<br />- Underneath the Applications heading, you should see the volume level for each application
<br />
<br />Check Skype and Skype for Business if their volume level is on mute, and if they are, drag the volume slider all the way to the top. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

<h2>            &#34;Installed&#34; font &#40;Segoe&#41; only shows in Word as printer font, &#34;regular&#34; version of font not installing at all</h2>
                    Hi. I am running Windows 7 Ultimate on an HP ProBook 4520s. I have Office 2010 installed. I have (legally) obtained the Segoe font for some work I am doing, and have tried repeatedly to install it. Some of the font faces (versions?) install -- bold, oblique
 -- but the "regular" just isn't "there." I've dragged the font files into the font folder, copied and pasted them, and still not all of the versions show up.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My most recent test involved deleting the folder which looked as though it contained Segoe, (as opposed to Segoe Black, for example), and then trying to reinstall it. After deleting the font, when I dragged the font files back into the Font folder, I got
 an error that the font already exists and would I like to replace it. I said yes. Now the folder isn't there at all (the icon with "Segoe" under it, in the Font folder -- don't know if technically that's called a folder, but that's what I'm talking about).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Word, Segoe appears as if it were bold even when it's not, and in the font menu, rather than having an O next to it (like the other Segoe variations), it only has a printer icon.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

help free up some hard drive space.

<h2>            Green Check Marks On Left of Some Icons</h2>
                    <p>I know a lot of people have asked this question on other posts. However, I have been unable to find an answer, so I figured I'd post to see if anyone could shed some light on this. I sat down at my PC a little while ago, and noticed green check marks in
 a green circle next to some of my icons. I do not have Norton installed on my PC. The only sort of back up I use is OneDrive, apart from my external HDD. I cannot figure out why they are there, more importantly, why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone shed some light on this, please? And how to get rid of the check marks.</p>
<p>

<h3> francobriones  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 10 license after the free upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently upgrading all our windows 7 machines to Windows 10 in order to avail the free upgrade that will last till next month which s July. The machines are HPs with Win 7 pre installed. What if after the free upgrade has past and for some reason one
 of the newly updated Windows 10 machines broke down, virus infected, etc and need a fresh install of&nbsp;Windows.&nbsp;Can we use the windows 10 installer we use to upgrade the machine? If so will it activate Windows? I'm a bit worried because if this happens and the
 only way I can get Windows is to install using the HP win7 installer but will not be able to upgrade to Windows 10 because the free upgrade to 10 has expired.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will we need to purchase a retail version of the windows 10 to be able to get to windows 10? I do hope I am making sense here.</p>

            <p>Franco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp;you have upgraded and activated the computers [by 29th July 2016], you can reinstall as many times as you like.&nbsp; You will be able to reinstall Windows 10 directly [you will not need to reinstall Windows 7 first].</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would&nbsp; not need to buy Windows 10.&nbsp; Your pre-29th July 2016 upgrade from Windows 7 will have entitled the computers to Windows 10 for the rest of their supported lifetimes i.e. for as long as fully-compatible hardware drivers continue to be written for
 them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the reinstallation procedure, you skip the product key dialog [there is a control on the page to allow you to do that] and then you just go online afterwards.&nbsp; The computer will interrogate the MS activation servers, identify the previous activation
 then activate the computer again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you first upgraded &amp; activated, the machine registered a unique hardware ID code on the MS activation servers.&nbsp; It is that code that allows the computer to find its activation record again after reinstallation.&nbsp; No product key is involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the initial upgrade &amp; for any reinstallation, you can use an installation USB/DVD made using the&nbsp;procedural&nbsp;guide &amp; links in

<h3> his baldness  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Explorer crashes when I right click on anything in the left-hand collumn</h2>
                    <p>Let me first say I have been searching and found this question asked a lot, but am having trouble finding people with a similar operating system situation (some people were on windows 8, others had just upgraded from 7 to 10, etc). The questions have also
 been asked a few years ago. I don't know if any of that makes a difference for the fix, but I want to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just built my first desktop this week and installed Windows 10 Home 64 bit on it. Whenever I right-click on anything in the list on the left of the file explorer window, the file explorer window locks up. Then, when I left-click on anything, (Not Responding)
 appears, the file explorer crashes, and my taskbar disappears and reappears (I think this is windows explorer restarting). Attached is an image of where I am right-clicking.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            How to share&#47;forward contact information from address book&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Please help. I must to be able to share/forward contact information from my address book via email with our consultants and coworkers. In Outlook Express I was able to open my address book, select a contact, copy, then paste into an email. How do I do something
 similar in Windows Live Mail without having to copy and paste each individual piece of information: Name, Address, Phone Number, etc.?</p>

<h2>            err_connection_refused on all browsers</h2>
                    <p>My son's computer has been having this issue for several weeks now, that he cannot access ANY website on any browser.<br />
We just get "err_connection_refused".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens in Chrome, Internet Explorer and Edge. So it is not an issue with any specific browser.</p>
<p>It is not a problem with the router or Internet connection as all other devices are working fine. Computers, laptops, tablets, phone, Fire TV etc.</p>
<p><br />
Here is what I have done so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have run the troubleshooter, it found no problem.</li><li>I have done a clean boot with antivirus software disabled, so that is not the cause.</li><li>I have done winsock reset, dns&nbsp;reset,&nbsp;flushdns etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Restart DNS service</li></ul>
<p>Sometimes if reboot several times, everything works for a while. But then it breaks again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run out of ideas.</p>

            Hi, Russ
<br />
<br />Ok I'll give you some tips.
<br />
<br />1.- Review the Ram Memory with (Memtest86)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.memtest86.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.memtest86.com/</a>
<br />
<br />2.- Check your SSD or HDD with (chkdsk)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee872425.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee8...</a>
<br />
<br />3.- Re-create the USB or DVD to install the Operating System, because sometimes it is damaged or corrupted.

<p>There is no issue with the disk, it gets scanned automatically.</p>
<p>I have not tested the&nbsp;memory, but corrupted memory usually comes with system crashes.</p>
<p>The operating system has been checked for corruption using sfc/scannow&nbsp;and I have also done&nbsp;dism</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Did you try to play a DVD using Windows Media Player?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If yes, what happens when you play the DVD?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you get any error message/error code?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a built in CD/DVD reader called
<strong>Windows Media Player</strong>. You can play and burn CD/DVD audio and video contents using<strong> Windows Media Player</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To open
<strong>Windows Media Player</strong> in your device, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard and type
<strong>Windows Media Player</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select the top most search result and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can download also
<strong>DVD player app</strong> for free from <strong>Windows Store</strong> if you have installed
<strong>KB3081704 </strong>update on your PC</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please be informed that,</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>The app <strong>is not available if you do a clean installation of Windows 10 instead of an upgrade</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you <strong>upgrade from an edition of Windows 7 or Windows 8 that does not include Media Centre, you may buy the Windows DVD player or another app that plays DVDs in the Windows Store</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link below on
<strong>DVD playback options for Windows</strong></span></p>

 and its just a good overall media player.</div>

            There are no missing drivers under the network adapters, these drivers are simply under other devices. I've tried googling the hardware ID but have no results.. :/

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am new to the community and your reply seemed so sweet and really helpful and was wondering if you could help me. &nbsp;My computer is running Windows 8.1. All of the sudden my network is not working and I'm having connection problems. The only error I've
 noticed is that when I turn my computer on, This box shows up with a clack screen and says system 32 and then it disappears on it's own. Also in my programs it show realtek as my ethernet yet HP is instructing me to download Qualcom. So confused. Any advise?
 Thank you so much in advance for anything you can recommend</p>

            <p>Hi AlexandruPenu,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the issue on the Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the issue description I understand that you receive error " mscorlib.dll (Win 32 error: 2). This program can no longer run and will now terminate" while working with the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For better understanding of the issue please reply with the following information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>When exactly do you receive this error message/code?</li><li>Have you made any recent changes to the computer?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mscorlib.dll is Microsoft Common Language Runtime Class Library, which is related to Microsoft .NET Framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the troubleshooting step to resolve the issue you may try uninstall and reinstall all the corrupted version of Microsoft .NET Framework which might be causing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer this link to do the same, this link provides you breif detail on How to uninstall and then reinstall all the .NET Framework on Windows XP Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people have resolved this issue by performing Check disk, I would also suggest that you perform Check disk on the drive where the operating system is installed and check if that helps in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer this step to provide Check disk</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span> </span></span></span><span>Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span> </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>‚ÄòCommand Prompt (Admin)‚Äô</b> to bring up elevated command prompt.<b>Note</b>: Click
<b>‚ÄòYes‚Äô</b> if it prompts for permission.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span> </span></span></span><span>In the command prompt, type<b>‚Äòchkdsk /r‚Äô</b> and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>Answer Y when <b>‚Äòchkdsk‚Äô</b> asks you if you want to check the drive next time computer boots (restarts</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>Keep us updated on the status of the issue.</p>

<h2>            Random BSOD&#39;s with Stop 0A and 50 error codes.</h2>
                    <p>I have been troubled with many BSOD's. I have rebuilt the system several times and end up at the same place. I have uploaded 2 mini dumps and one memory dump for you to check.&nbsp; I have run sfc with no errors. I have run memory diagnostics with no issues (for
 over 30+ hours). I have updated every driver to the most current I can find. I have also run chkdsk&nbsp; a dozen times with zero issues.&nbsp; The system is not overclocked.

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We have two bug checks:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)</strong></span><br />
<br />
<em>This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.</em><br />
<br />
This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high. The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.<br />

Bug check 0x50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).<br />
<br />
Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</em></strong><br />

<h2>            My credit</h2>
                    <p>I am an old customer of Skype and is not happy after the Microsoft takeover. I get messages from the "old Skype" that my credit will be inactivated within 7 days and that I should do this and that to keep it (i e make a one second call for instance). OK
 after some trouble with my password I'm finally able to sign in and try to make that call to be able to keep my credit. Then I don't have any credit at Microsoft. Where is my credit then?? And where are my contacts, etc, etc.</p>

<h2>            WMI Provider host CPU usage</h2>
                    My new HP laptop is extremely slow - when I look at the CPU usage, WMI Provider host is using from 25-65%. This can't be correct - a utility using more than half the processor power? I am unable to end the task in task manager. What can be done?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Passwords are hidden by default to protect your security and privacy. If you need to see the list of your credentials, you may go to
<strong>Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Credential Manager</strong>. You may click the dropdown arrow then click
<em><strong>Show </strong></em>on <em><strong>Password </strong></em>field. Please note that it will ask you to re-enter the password to verify your identity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were using a different browser other than Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer, you may not be able to see all your credentials.</p>
