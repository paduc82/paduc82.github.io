    <title>Office 365 Business and Access 2010 from Office 2010 install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 Business and Access 2010 from Office 2010 install</h2>
                    I currently use office 2010 pro. I have purchased 365 Business subscription but am worried that installing 365 may disrupt ability to continue using my Access 2010 database. Can they coexist.&nbsp;

            <p>Yes they can coexist, and will do so as installing 365 doesn't upgrade or overwrite 2010, but only the single version of MS Outlook can be used, I'd suggest modifying Office 2010 to make MS Outlook unavailable</p>
<p>Having said that I have an access db, written under Office 2007 that contained much vba and modules, that I then used in Office 2010, 2013 and 2016 - some minor modification of vba was required</p>

            You need to be careful. The Office 365 Business editions DO NOT include Access. If you purchase an Office 365 subscription that does not include Access, then you might not want to install the desktop suite.

            <p>As you can see, there is no consistent answer to your question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally when 2016 was released last September, it would force everyone to uninstall ALL earlier version Office applications, much to the chagrin of people who bought 365 and then were told they could no longer use there earlier versions of Visio and Project.&nbsp;
 That specific problem has been partially resolved, but your problem still remained.&nbsp; Installing 365/2016 would force uninstall of 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, lately there have been 2 other reported options.&nbsp; Some people have reported that they were able to keep older applications when installing 365.&nbsp; I have not personally seen that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I was able to install Office 2016 Pro Plus, and follow it by installing Office 2010.&nbsp; They mostly work together.&nbsp; You may be able to do that if 365 does force uninstall your 2010, ie do a custom install of just Access 2010.

<p>On my home PC i had uninstalled all previous office apps.</p>
<p>With Office 365 Business then installed, i did a selective install of off 2010 (Access only) and so far all works well.</p>
<p>So i guess i will repeat the process at work which is more critical.</p>
<p>Will create a restore point just in case all turns to custard.....</p>

<h2>            Build 10061 Blue Screen Of Death</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone I really need some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded a new game called Black Desert. &nbsp;When I try to launch the game I get a blue screen of death error that says System_Service_Exception. The first time I got the blue screen of death it said KMODE_Exception_Not_Handled but now it says System_Service_Exception
 every time. &nbsp;I have looked in my event logs and during the time that I get the blue screen of death I see errors saying I have applications failing to activate because the app manager is required to activate applications? &nbsp;I have no clue what this means but
 apparently it is what is causing the blue screen of death since it is the errors that I get during the time I'm getting the blue screen. &nbsp;The applications that are failing to activate is Cortana and Insider hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is another error it is showing:&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the moment it's because the battery charging isn't working correctly and in some cases the battery meter isn't correctly reporting the charge level. In other cases it can just be normal slow "trickle" charging that occurs towards the end of the charging
 procedure.<br />
<br />
Mine can carry on trickle charging for another 30 mins after the battery level in the battery saver says 99 or 100%. I've watched it in the diagnostics app and noticed it doesn't draw much current towards the end of the charge. That could explain why it takes
 ages to do that last 1% for you if it is reporting correctly on yours.<br />
<br />
With the new software due soon this shouldn't be an issue for much longer. The phone is supposed to effortlessly charge up to the correct level on that software.</p>

            <p>Hello Kevin:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; If you are getting this error on both the console and the website then there does look to be some conflict related to your account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this to work properly you would want to have a Xbox Live account set to a region that supports the Video marketplace and you will want to have your deive (Computer or Xbox) set to the same region.&nbsp; You will indeed also want to make sure your account
 has a billing address completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would suggest you do is sign into the following site with your Microsoft account,
<a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://commerce.microsoft.com</a> .&nbsp; Once you are signed in, please go to the billing section and select the "edit billing info." link.&nbsp; Here you should be able to update or add a billing address and other basic details.&nbsp;
 If this option is not showing on the site for you, you can add a credit card to the account and then immediately remove it.&nbsp; Before you move on, please review your account on this site.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next thing I would like you to try is to go to <a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a> .&nbsp; Sign into your account and click on MY ACCOUNT.&nbsp; From the next page click on payment &amp; billing and then go to edit billing information.&nbsp; Here you should see
 the same information from the previous site.&nbsp; If you see different details or if information is missing, please try to complete or update it here and let us know what you find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If everything you find indicates that the account is in the proper region and the same region you are currently in and that your devices are connected to, the final thing to try is to migrate the account to the proper region.&nbsp; You will find the link to migrate
 your account here, <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-account/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-account/change-region</a> . &nbsp; Even if the account says it is in the correct region this is worth trying.&nbsp; You will get an error if you try to migrate to a region the account is already in and this will not negatively
 impact your account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The final thing that could be happening is that the migration you did earlier simply has not fully completed.&nbsp; It can take as long as six weeks&nbsp;for the&nbsp;migration to fully impact the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us&nbsp;know if you have any other questions&nbsp;or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Synchronised the original document library in OneDrive to my local PC</li><li>Waited for all the documents to synchronise</li><li>Used robocopy to mirror the local copy in C:\Users\myaccount to a folder on my file server</li><li>Synchronised the new (empty) document library to my local PC</li><li>Used robocopy to mirror the copy from my file server back to the locally synchronised folder</li><li><span>Waited for all the documents to synchronise</span></li></ol>
<p>Now as this is a live document library, I'm going to be running robocopy again out of hours to pick up just the modifications. To check my scripts were working, I ran the robocopy commands again and to my surprised, robocopy reported that it was copying
 a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of files again and reporting them as "Changed". Robocopy classes a file as changed if the date &amp; time are the same but the file size is different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a highly unusual situation - files are rarely changed in file size without the timestamp also changing (newer files). So I dug deeper into the issue and focussed on one file that robocopy kept wanting to copy due to being changed. The source file
 is 1,996,810 bytes in size on my network file share (correct size) but it's&nbsp;<em>bigger</em> when it ends up in OneDrive at 1,997,141:</p>
<p>

<p>If I exit OneDrive and run the script, it copies this one file and on re-checking the file size, they are the same:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b3794a8-325f-4412-bb66-e22463573cbc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b3794a8-325f-4412-bb66-e22463573cbc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Launch OneDrive again and watch the status display very carefully and it first uploads the document to OneDrive but then immediately reports it's downloaded. And guess what - the file size is wrong again.</p>

<p>Rob,</p>
<p>
Yes, for reasons not openly published by Microsoft, the SharePoint service adds metadata to a
<em><strong>subset</strong></em> of Microsoft-centric files.&nbsp; For my clients, this includes .msg files (Outlook).&nbsp; I don't think this is happening in transport (i.e., the OneDrive sync agent isn't actually modifying the files).&nbsp; *I think* this is happening
 at rest in the SharePoint cloud datastores (via some indexing or transform process).&nbsp; In my files, the additional XML metadata indicates "MediaServiceMetadata" and other clear indications that the file transform was done by Microsoft.
</p><p>
</p><p>As mentioned, this is <em><strong>not </strong></em>happening to all Microsoft-centric files, just a subset.&nbsp; So far I have not been able to determine why
<em><strong>only a subset</strong></em> is transformed.</p>
<p>
I'm hoping my opening sentence encourages some SharePoint guru to respond with something like, "Yes they do openly publicize this behavior, and here is the link."&nbsp; ...I further hope the information will explain the 'only a subset' angle.
</p><p>
</p><p>Side note:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a software architecture perspective, I'm assuming the SharePoint developers are attempting to provide metadata that transcends a single SharePoint datastore.&nbsp; Nevertheless, like you Rob, I don't like this behavior, and they should provide a switch to
 disable this behavior (or change the design so that metadata is stored in a separate reference database...or allow the SharePoint administrator to select between the two metadata storage models).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line--many of my clients are looking to OneDrive/SharePoint as an alternative to Dropbox, Google Drive/FS, ShareFile, Box, etc.&nbsp; They are already paying for Office 365 subscriptions (primarily for Exchange-based e-mail and Office Desktop licensing),
 so why not use SharePoint as well for their organization's file sync?&nbsp; ...Well, this issue is a serious reason why not...<em><strong>especially
</strong></em>when the organization's file objects must still be used outside of the OneDrive/SharePoint ecosystem (with integrity).</p>

<h2>            MyNokia registration fails&#58; IMEI is already registered</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
By following a link in a blog without checking the web address, I registered to MyNokia in India (!!!!). I tried to completely remove my subscription to try again in France (where I am now) but still the registration fails since the IMEI is already used.<br />
<br />
How can I be able to register with the right IMEI?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

Thank you.<br />
<br />
I tried to contact Nokia.<br />
I opened a post just because I didn't find this question elsewhere in the forum.<br />
When (if?) I will find a solution I will also post it here.<br />
And if someone else got the same problem, maybe he/she can share the solution.

<p>Hi Avinaba,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post and welcome to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WhatsApp is not available for the C2-01 and from your post it seems you may be trying to install apps outside the Nokia Store. It is advised to use the
<a href="http://store.nokia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Store</a> to install apps as this way you will know f an app is actually available for and compatible with your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point it may be a good idea to do a fresh install of your C2-01 by doing a full reset and re-install of the system software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First create a backup of your phone's contents in <a href="http://nokia.com/nokiasuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Suite</a> (<em>Tools/Backup</em>). When asked de-select the option to backup settings.
</li><li>Reset the C2-01 by dialing *#7370# followed by the security code 12345 to reset. When complete go through the Device First Use setup to set date and time correctly.
</li><li>After the reset check for and install any updates available in Nokia Suite. It is advised to re-install the latest system software when offered to do so in the update screen which can be found by selecting the green icon with the arrow.
</li><li>When finished restore the backup in Nokia Suite (<em>Tools/Restore</em>) </li><li>You can now download your apps from <a href="http://store.nokia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Store</a>. Paid apps can be found in the <em><a href="http://store.ovi.com/mystuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MyStuff</a></em> section.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

            Well,thank you for your suggestion. But many apps downloaded from nokia store shows conflicting items message. For eg. The recent update of the ezreader doc pdf reader lite.( I dont know whether other users have faced such problem,but the problem may be
 genuine)<br />
And in the Whatsapp official site the minimum system req. Mentioned for s40 devices is<br />
"S40 OS" and "unlimited data plan". Nokia C2-01 meets system requirements but does not support it.

            Hi Mixy,<br />
<br />
In Outlook.com, we can edit and change settings of our Mailbox, or even the general settings of Outlook.com based on how you want to use it. Regarding your concern, we do not have the option to restore the settings to default in Outlook.com since it's a web
 based mail. But we still have a work around for your concern. If you want, you can create a temporary Outlook account on another browser and check its settings since everything is set to default on it. With that, you can use it as reference to change the settings
 of your own account.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

<h2>            Can&#39;t make or receive calls</h2>
                    <p>Hello, when I press the call button, the connection or dialing screen appears. After a second, a message appears with a emoticon saying"oops, something went wrong", and with it there's a line to communicate through text only. Also, the person trying to call
 me says that I am offline although my contact button says "active" so he can't call me either.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi SG5311
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>Hello Vijay, I found the Skype for Desktop file in microsoft folder and found the renaming option for the Skype for Desktop but it says "can't be done because folder or file is open in another program" although nothing else is running. So I still can't rename
 it due to that.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            :)<br />
<br />
Just use options and select delete to remove the apps or games. As I said, you can similarly remove Angry Birds trial version by deleting it directly using options menu. If it fails to be deleted, then obviously you cannot delete it.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can also backup everything on your phone to your memory card by using sync and backup option in settings.<br />
<br />
You can also move your apps and games especially downloaded from Nokia store application to your memory card to have some internal memory free.<br />
<br />
Hope this helped you. :)

<div>I am running explorer 8 with Windows XP. On most websites (particularly Google Maps) I get a red x and a space where&nbsp;an image&nbsp;should appear.&nbsp; It doesn't appear to to affect photos as these are still visible - only&nbsp;other images.&nbsp;
 When I access Google Maps, instead of seeing the maps I get numerous notes that say "We are sorry, but we don't have maps at this zoom level for this region" - this happens for evey address I enter as well as whatever level I am zooming in at.</div>

            <p>Hi Nick Collide,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the issue you are having with your album art.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One troubleshooting step would be to go to the Zune Software, select settings/software then Metadata and Ratings.&nbsp; Check which settings you have there and maybe alter the settings to suit you own preferences.&nbsp; For example if you use your own album art then
 maybe uncheck the Automatically retrieve option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Answers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jon M.</p>

            <p>Well,&nbsp;your answer had promise but no joy. Album Art just randomly disappears. I saw in one forum the idea that I needed to intall the Art that is Zune Approved. The problem is that I have no clue what "Zune Approved" album art is. When I rip some albums,
 Zune displays the cover art and many times does not, even though it recognises the tracks. Then I have to use Bing images to copy and paste the album art to the Zune.And that should be that, especially that I take pains to use the art at or near 400x400 (the
 Zune recommended size). </p>
<p>What to do, I had several weird problems with Ipod's too, so don't send me to them!!!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to tranfer 1 alias from my account1 &nbsp;to another account2. When i delete the alias from account1 it stops receiving emails, but i can't add it to the account2, while it still is in use on "another account". I do not want to lose this alias, so then
 i recreate it on account1 which give no "in use on another account". I tried to import an emailaccount into account2, this failed because OUTLOOK does not support importing from another outlook account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i transfer this alias to account2, without loosing it? The transferperiod could take up to 30 days, i can't wait that long while the alias could be taken by some-one else.</p>

</p><p>So within the 30 days, i can't receive mail on this alias because i have to delete it and wait 30 days to transfer it to another account, but so can anyone after 30 days.</p>

<p>Graphics device drivers are a lot more complex and highly optimized, they are bound to&nbsp;3rd. party graphics hardware for display and rendering. Graphic HW comes&nbsp;from many different manufacturers, different&nbsp;graphics chipsets &nbsp;may require a

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume that you have the Full Access permission of the room mailbox and it shows up under your mailbox in the Outlook client.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you mean that you try to view an email with a room request from the room mailbox inbox?
</li><li>Capture a screenshot of the “opening a scheduled request for a room Outlook”.</li><li>From my side, the latest Outlook version is 15.0.4841.1001. Please upgrade the Outlook client to the latest version.
</li><li>It is suggested that you create a new room mailbox and remove the Full Access permission of the old room mailbox. Then create a new Outlook profile and set up the account to check if the issue occurs with the new room mailbox.
</li><li>If the issue persist, please share with us all related Outlook logs via Private Message (<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list/">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list/</a> ) by referring to this article:

            <p>Hello Brook,</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are conference rooms with only a few people who have full access. The point was to have people request a scheduled time they want to use the conference room and then someone with full access grants or denies the scheduled time. The rooms were all setup
 as resources in Office 365 and come up under "rooms" in the Calendar not as a Mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the screenshot, nothing comes up on the screen. The Outlook application hangs immediately after clicking on either a request email that came in or by double clicking on a scheduled meeting in the calendar. I checked the event viewer and it states that
 the application hung with event id 1002.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont actually see a way to upgrade, my only option under "File" -&gt; "Office Account" is "About Outlook".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also sent you a private message with screenshots and logs.</p>

</p><p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on your description, you are using the Windows Installer-based (MSI) version of Office so you only see the

<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, have you tried the #4 point in Brook’s reply? If no, please try it and then let us know the result. If the issue is gone with the new room mailbox, we can identify the issue is related to the old room mailbox. Then we suggest you just
 use the new room mailbox.</span><span> If the issue persists after trying it, we will look into the logs to see whether the root cause can be found.</span></p>

            Yes I was able to manually push an update to Outlook so now I am running the most up to date version. The issue still persist though. As for step #4, yes I have tried it but with no success. I was able to do everything like his steps suggested but the
 issue still lingers.

            Hi Iartemow,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates and sorry for the delayed response. <br />
<br />
I have read through the post and understood you were having trouble viewing emails regarding booking requests or opening a scheduled meeting in the room calendar in the Outlook 2013 client. However, I’m a bit puzzled about ‘then someone with full access grants
 or denies the scheduled time’ in your second post. Generally, admins should additionally select some specific delegates so they can accept or decline booking requests for the room mailboxes. For more information, you can refer to
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj215781%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx#Delegates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj215781%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx#Delegates</a> (Navigate to
<strong>Change room mailbox properties</strong>&gt; <strong>Delegates</strong>.). I do understand you’ve been assigned the full access permission of the room mailboxes so you can view the room calendars, could you further check with your admin if you are added
 as delegates of the room mailbox like mentioned in the article? <br />
<br />
Moreover, when did you notice this issue? Was it working fine before? And since it persists with the new room mailbox, I will do some consulting with our related team with the logs collected and inform you in time once there are any updates.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sam

            <p>For your puzzled bit, I was just trying to explain how we wanted it to work. The point was to have one person be in control of all the room mailboxes who could accept or decline new meetings. All of the permissions are set correctly. The outlook functions
 properly in OWA but not in the Windows Outlook 2013 application as if the permissions are not being recognized. We recently just set up the mailboxes for the rooms so that's when it started.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this must be an issue with Outlook 2013 because I have had a couple of users update to 2016 and it seems to work correctly.</p>

            Hi Iartemow,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your clarification.<br />
<br />
I have done some tests from my side but eventually couldn’t reproduce the issue like you mentioned in the Outlook 2013 client. Therefore, to move forward with the issue, please further check these two points:<br />
1. Like mentioned above, the latest version of Outlook 2013 client is 15.0.4851.1001 now. Please reconfirm that your current version is the same as or later than this version.<br />
2. Since the issue persists even with a newly created room mailbox, if possible, could you create a new user mailbox and assign the corresponding new room mailbox permissions, then share it with us for further test?
<strong>NOTE: </strong>To ensure that the test result is accurate, please confirm the issue can be reproduced on the new user mailbox at first. For privacy concerns, please provide the test account via the private message below:<br />

<h2>            Why does Bing offer Bing points only to tell you, You broke some rule&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I did the Bing search for probable a year and had over 3000 points, only to be blocked from Bing search or cashing any in. This also happened to a friend. I can only guess it is common practice. I do not want them as my search engine. I tried to change
 it. It was a scheme to make the note takers think Bing was really so great and doing so well.&nbsp; Hey, look how man</p>
<p>y searches we have? Boooo!!!!</p>
