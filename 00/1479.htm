<h2>            build 10547, WinINet InternetErrorDlg changed &#47; odd behaviour</h2>
                    <p>My application, which uses the Wininet API, has started behaving oddly with this release.&nbsp; After a call to HttpSendRequest, the subsequent call to InternetErrorDlg returns ERROR_CANCELLED.&nbsp; No dialog is displayed, it comes straight back with this return
 value.&nbsp; There is a valid parent hwnd supplied and we do not pass &nbsp;FLAGS_ERROR_UI_FLAGS_NO_UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The preceding call to HttpSendRequest&nbsp; returns success, but since we need to check for HTTP status codes that might require action from the user (e.g. 407)&nbsp; we always call InternetErrorDlg.&nbsp; In every version of Windows from XP (possibly also 2000) to date,
 including the original w10 release, this has returned 0 if it didn't need to do anything, now it returns ERROR_CANCELLED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The application is written in C, although since it's a call to a documented API the programming language being used shouldn't be relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'd like to know is if this is by design, and if it's going to continue to behave in this way when TH2 is generally released.</p>

    <title>10586 on all devices&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffdvo  say:</h3>
<h2>            10586 on all devices&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Noticed I now have build 10586 on all my devices, inc Lumia 735. Not complaining but just wondering! I've been on the insider program for ages but as far as I know it was only for the Lumia 735 (UK) and my laptop. I've had 10586 on the lumia for a couple
 of weeks and that's ok and was delighted that linked email boxes was again available but that's gone again :-( I have a few email accounts and having to check each one is a pain :-( I got the 1511 (TH2) on the laptop maybe a week or so and again and all fine,
 love it. I got the 1511 on my wife's laptop and that's fine works lovely but it now has the 586 build. It still seems fine. I got the TH2 on my desktop and that created a few problems so did a much needed fresh install, as it started its days as Vista, then
 XP, then 8, then 8.1 and then 10. Today it updated but instead of TH2, it has gone to 10586! Everything seems to work fine so I'm not complaining :-) I'm just trying to make sense of it. My wife's laptop and my desktop were never in the Insider program, only
 my laptop and Lumia 735. I do log in to my laptop, desktop and Lumia 735 using my MS hotmail account but my wife uses her own MS account on her laptop and I only log on to hers using a local account so I'm a little perplexed and slightly miffed that todays
 update to my desktop has uninstalled CCleaner because it isn't compatible with this Insider build. As I say, the desktop was never part of the Insider program and still isn't. From what I can see everything is working fine so I'm not to bothered but just want
 to understand why this has happened. I can anticipate that logging into 2 PCs using same MS account and being an Insider might cause the 2 devices to be treated as both being on the Insider program but can't fathom why my wife's laptop has got the 10586 build
 too!</p>
<p>FWIW, I'm not a newbie! I'm an MCP on several counts, SCO Unix and Linux admin cert, Comptia A+ cert and worked in support for some 20 twenty years, laterly mainly at level 2 &amp; 3 but I'm now old :-( Anyone else have a similar situation or maybe a suggestion
 or 2?</p>

<p>Thanks Lawrence, yes I think I got myself confused but in my defence, I'd been at a funeral all day so perhaps wasn't very clear headed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-reading my post today, yes it was a ramble. I think what caused the confusion was that my Desktop had done the TH2 update while I was out ( I had done a fresh install a few days ago) and when I saw the message about CCleaner being uninstalled due to it
 "not being compatible with this INSIDER build" it sort of threw me! I should have know to never trust an error message :-) The desktop doesn't/shouldn't get Insider builds so I'm not sure why&nbsp; CCleaner was uninstalled automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have CCleaner on all my boxes and it was never disabled/uninstalled due to being incompatible. I've just put CCleaner back on the desktop and no problem so the auto uninstall must have been a glitch!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on 586.14 on all my boxes and 586.11 on the phone.</p>

<p>Really...like a <em>Paid version</em> of Norton?...hmmm glad I don't like Norton...we don't get along...I have a ADWCleaner which has saved me a couple times...I rarely used it maybe a couple times...but you never know what kind of garbage settles in....guess
 this is similar to the CCleaner eh?..*john<br />

    <title>ACCESS IS ADDING A DECIMAL AND ZEROS TO A TEXT FIELD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> starlyncrook  say:</h3>
<h2>            ACCESS IS ADDING A DECIMAL AND ZEROS TO A TEXT FIELD</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm importing an excel file, left aligned, &nbsp;all columns&nbsp;set for "general" formatting into ACCESS. When importing, I set each field to "Short text" to make it easier to import.&nbsp; I then export the file to text (required vendor formatting) with
 the SPECIFIC field widths that the vendor has requested. However, one of my fields, which is really considered a number ( but is not currency or for counting purposes-it is just a government assigned number) is converting those numbers from this 123456789
 to this 123456789.00 . My file must maintain the fixed width formatting the vendor has requested. At no point do I tell access that this is a number. It also does not have any zeros or number signs in the excel file as it is not currency or count. Help, I
 have tried so many things, but nothing works. </p>

<p>Hi starlyncrook,<br />
<br />
Is this issue still persists?<br />
<br />
When export tables in Access, the text data type will remain, you could see the outcome file in the preview, the text content will have quotation marks.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31d01ff6-64ff-4cce-beee-353b00ad3000?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31d01ff6-64ff-4cce-beee-353b00ad3000?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><br />
If the preview is not like text, you could also check the data type by changing the view, right-click the tab &gt; Design View<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4aa407d0-37f9-4dea-adfb-18587bb5d0c3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4aa407d0-37f9-4dea-adfb-18587bb5d0c3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you could see all the data type of all the field and change it to what you want.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b418220-e138-4290-9654-b8650a9f3106?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b418220-e138-4290-9654-b8650a9f3106?upload=true" /></a><br />

<p>If you mean highlight the current activecell as you you navigate, you will need VBA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do this by using selection change event code or by installing Chip Pearson's RowLiner Add-in which covers all open workbooks.</p>

<h2>            C6 stuck in offline mode</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have managed to update Nokia suite and upgrade to Maps 3.3 as well as download some offline maps into the bargain. I have always been able to access the web through the web browser, BUT...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Youtube cant play videos</p>
<p>Maps wont go online</p>
<p>phone wont connect to server</p>
<p>positionning via GPS will only locate the nearest tower and not get closer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that the phone is stuck in offline mode and I have tried to find how I get it to connect online.</p>
<p>Searched here for help and not found the exact solution.</p>
<p>will lose even more hair if I continue this way...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            Then go for a reset.. type *#7780# from the phone keypad.. provide security code (default 12345)... some times this will fix your device... If you are still facing the same problem.. go for a hard reset ( i recommend you to create a backup before doing
 this) type *#7370#... IF still problem not solved.. you have to reinstall your firmware (better wth pc) for that you can also contact to the nearest nokia centre..

<p>I apologize but what specific change would you like to achieve here? If you wish to change the primary domain, (for i.e, from "domainA.com" to "domainB.com), you must create a ticket at portal.microsoftonline.com so we can assist you with the procedure.

<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Recovery Key</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to find out how i can get the recovery key for my Nokia Lumia 830 which i recently hard reset without writing down the recovery&nbsp; key. In the first place i broke the LCD and had to replace it since the phone is worth it to me and i was worried about
 my information in the phone, i had to do a hard reset before sending for repair. The LCD was fixed and everything was intact.&nbsp;To my surprise the Challenge i am facing is that the phone is asking for the recovery key which i have tried to check in my mail box
 that maybe Microsoft sent me a mail regarding the Recovery key but still nothing. My
<em><strong>Lumia 830</strong></em> running <strong>windows 8.1</strong> is stuck on the reset protection. I have tried so my times to go to
<strong>account.microsoft.com/devices </strong>The phone is not listed i don't know why still nothing is helping me to pass through this reset protection most especially that the phone is not listed in device list. I had no idea that it will come to this but
 all i wanted is to get my phone back on track and start using it again. <strong>
In the first place, i didn't even know that the phone was set to rest protection</strong> it is running AT&amp;T but&nbsp; Unlocked to any carrier thus way i was even able to use the phone in my current location with the local carrier provider. (Zambia, MTN)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with the idea or any knowledge that can help me get through this <strong>
25 character key </strong>will help and i will be so Obliged. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If i check Reset protection status, it show that the device protection is <strong>
ON </strong>(Moreover, it is locked and stack on recovery key) the key which i have never even seen before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly help me solve this problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards </p>

<p>The RESET PROTECTION is a phone generated security feature which is designed to send RPRK by email (not Microsoft!) to the account holder who activated RESET PROTECTION) which appears not to be you, RESET PROTECTION is set to off being the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A situation like yours occurs when a pre-owned phone is reset by the previous owner who then ONLY ENTERS THE RPRK WITHOUT TURNING OFF RESET PROTECTION the phone afterwards then being sold</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an earlier <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdaccount/cant-get-recovery-key-cant-turn-off-or-reset/78812ebe-894b-4cc9-83f9-7c8014a13a49">
answer</a> in short <strong>only the </strong><strong>person who activated Reset Protection has received the email, there is ABSOLUTELY No way round</strong>, you need to contact the previous owner as their Outlook ID is the A/c for email notification</p>

<h2>            How to find closest date in a column with conditions on other columns...</h2>
                    <p>I have a excel sheet where each line have a product from different suppliers like following&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Col A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Col B &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Col S</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Serial Number &nbsp; Supplier &nbsp; Date&nbsp;</p>
<p>R2 &nbsp; &nbsp; XX &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;S1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D1</p>

<p>R4 &nbsp; &nbsp; XY &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;S3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D2</p>

<p>
</p><p>Each line have much more info but I dont think its relevant for question,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a construct like&nbsp;=IF(S2=MAX(INDEX(($A$2:$A$8=A2)*($B$2:$B$8=B2)*($S$2:$S$8),,)),"Yes","No") to find out what the newest price is for a certain product from a certain supplier. In above case I would have the formula in Column T giving No, Yes,
 Yes, Yes for Row 2 to 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works well :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question is, how do I do if I want to get a price closest to a date I decide? </p>
<p>Lets say I want the price in the list for a certain product from a certain supplier that is closest to 01-01-2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to keep same kind of construct if possible,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Enter your date of interest in cell T1, then in T2 use this array-entered formula (enter using Ctrl-Shift-Enter)</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(ABS(IF($A$2:$A$8=A2,IF($B$2:$B$8=B2,$T$1-S2)))=MIN(ABS(IF($A$2:$A$8=A2,IF($B$2:$B$8=B2,$T$1-$S$2:$S$8)))),"Yes","No")</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It will return two "Yes" values if the date of interest is exactly between two dates - you can fix that to select the earlier or later date by using a fractional day offset like so, for preference for earlier dates:</p>

    <title>Outlook Calendar on Android - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dawnvk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Calendar on Android</h2>
                    <p>I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but... I recently, reluctantly gave up my Windows phone for lack of apps... Very Sad... So I got an Android. I installed Outlook - the email works great but the calendar does NOT.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 requests, if they're not possible, they should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How do you change the view to see a month at a time? Or even a whole week?</p>
<p>2) How do you pin just the calendar to your desktop so you can see your day/week/month on your home screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I'm having to use Google calendar to accomplish this - BUT the google calendar won't show all my appointments/events. It doesn't sync correctly. I open Outlook, click the calendar and the event is there, but not on the Google calendar. This is
 very frustrating. I would love to dump the Google Calendar and just use Outlook, but I have to be able to see the calendar on my home screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dawn</p>

            The problem is not that we need a widget to open the calendar, a simple shortcut to the app will do that. We need a Month view or week view widget that can be pinned to a page for a quick glance. For example the native android calendar widget. So if there
 is one supplied with the native client, why not use that? More and more companies are moving to O365 and forcing the Outlook client for Android and locking out the native client.

<p>Can I ask a question about your reply? I am trying to put in custom placeholder text (Powerpoint 2010). The formatting (font size/family/color) of the placeholder text is being retained but the custom text "prompt" only stays in the master slide until I
 get out of the PPT file and go back in. I can close the master slides, save the file and create new slides based on that master and the custom placeholder text is exactly as I want it. But once I close out of the PPT file and go back in, the master slide has
 "Click here to add text" in all of the placeholder boxes. It's in the format and color that I changed it to - but the actual prompt text won't stay after closing. Because this is a very small placeholder text box that I've created the text is appearing 1 or
 2 characters wide all down the page. Help!</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; And that placeholder items have that bizarre "CLICK TO ADD TEXT" text that appears next to all 'placeholder' objects.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within, not next to, and I don't find that bizarre at all.&nbsp; It gives the user a bit of prompting as to what to do with the placeholder, and the text itself is editable on the slide master/layout.&nbsp; You could as easily have it say "Type your headline here"
 or whatever.</p>

<p>Can I ask a question about your reply? I am trying to put in custom placeholder text (Powerpoint 2010). The formatting (font size/family/color) of the placeholder text is being retained but the custom text "prompt" only stays in the master slide until I
 get out of the PPT file and go back in. I can close the master slides, save the file and create new slides based on that master and the custom placeholder text is exactly as I want it. But once I close out of the PPT file and go back in, the master slide has
 "Click here to add text" in all of the placeholder boxes. It's in the format and color that I changed it to - but the actual prompt text won't stay after closing. Because this is a very small placeholder text box that I've created the text is appearing 1 or
 2 characters wide all down the page. Help!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>That's truly odd.&nbsp; Louie may be correct, there might be something wrong wit the file that's causing this.&nbsp; To make sure, please give this a try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your computer</p>
<p>Start PowerPoint</p>
<p>Start a new presentation based on one of the Microsoft-supplied themes</p>
<p>Go into the slide master and modify one or more of the layouts to include your own customized "prompt" text.</p>
<p>Close Slide Master view, add a few new slides and verify that your customized prompt text is there.&nbsp; Add some text to those placeholders.<br />
Save the presentation, quit, restart and check to see if you still see your customized prompt text when you add new slides based on the same layouts.</p>

    <title>TDR Errors with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darran rb  say:</h3>
<h2>            TDR Errors with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASROCK 775 Dual 880 Pro (normally designed to work with just Windows XP, as the link states below) and a NVIDIA 8600 GS Graphics Card, earlier was the 7600 GS version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.asrock.com/mb/VIA/775Dual-880Pro/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 7, then Windows 8, then 8.1 and then finally now Windows 10 preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Over the past few years I have used the tips in association with the setting the TDR (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/ff570088%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the error is still there, not necessarily the TDR errors but the GPU hangs, as it tries to play catch up with whatever the display is doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the message comes saying that the display driver has stopped working, then other times I have to press the reboot button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I heard that the VIA chipset may need the driver updating, but VIA have stopped producing drivers for them now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also set the Performance settings to "Adjust for best performance", but its still the same, the GPU Hangs are still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What does the VIA Chipset do, and is there a third party driver I might be able to use?</p>
<p>2. If I change the Graphics Card to ATI or another sort, will the GPU Hangs still be apparent?</p>
<p>3. Is there a software that limits these GPU Hangs, or maybe a software that can reset the GPU while the PC is on, so I don't have to&nbsp;&nbsp; wait for the hang to fix itself, or press the reboot button (don't like "unclean shutdowns")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be most appreciated, I have contacted both ASRock and NVIDIA, and they just say to upgrade the hardware, but that costs money, and money nowadays does not go far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Darran</p>

<p><span>After the WebCall.dll file has been removed, the RunDLL error message will be generated by its orphaned startup entry.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><em><span>herdProtect</span></em><span> analysis indicates that the startup entry for the WebCall.dll malware is a scheduled task named&nbsp;Web
 Call</span><span>&nbsp;– so you should be able to clear the error message by simply deleting the&nbsp;Web Call</span><span>&nbsp;scheduled task (shades of the infamous
</span><span>BackgroundContainer.dll</span><span> malware):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Select "Delete”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you can’t find a scheduled task named Web Call</span><span>, then you’ll have to use

 and can't at this time upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; Have also had problem with OneDrive which has also been reinstalled which I thought might be connected.</p>

</p><p>Word and Excel are the programs used most and they both will crash usually shortly after I start to enter data.&nbsp; See example attached which show Need Repair.&nbsp; If I select Repair Now the program crashes.&nbsp; If I have gotten far enough that I have saved a copy

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few possibilities why you are getting this error message, like corrupted system file related to your Office applications, or a damaged user profile to name a few. That being said, we would like to know more about your concern to understand it
 better:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried a different User Profile to check if the issue persists on your Office applications?</li><li>Have you checked other applications if the issue is re-occurring? </li><li>Have you tested running your Office apps in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3140179/office-applications-don-t-start-when-windows-is-running-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong>?</li><li>Have you tried signing out and signing back in to your <strong>Office apps</strong> with your
<strong>Microsoft account</strong>?</li><li>Are there any updates or programs installed prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime aside from checking your apps if are they working fine on <strong>
safe mode</strong>, we suggest that you perform an <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif-sWH9ubWAhVLH5QKHdqsDAUQFgglMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.office.com%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2FRepair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b&amp;usg=AOvVaw2hLWKX8DYkPaZESbIbQT2-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online
 Repair</a></strong> on your <strong>Office</strong>, specially if you've already double checked everything on the list. This is to eliminate the possibility of a corrupted or missing system file that could cause errors as such on your PC.</p>

            The only programs I'm having problems with are Word and Excel.&nbsp; They do not work in Safe Mode.&nbsp; Not sure what you mean about signing out and back in to Office apps with Microsoft account.&nbsp; These programs are supposed to be on my computer and I do not sign
 into them individually.&nbsp; I have just selected Keep Me Logged In on my Microsoft account to see if that makes a difference.&nbsp; Not happy to do that and since it is my third year using Office 365 not sure if there has been a change that I'm not aware of or not.&nbsp;
 Auto updates are turned on for Microsoft and all other programs are working fine.

<p>It could be possible at this point that the current user profile is corrupted or the Office suite installed on your computer might be the ones at fault with a missing file causing this to happen. Just to clarify, have you already performed an
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Repair</a></strong> on your
<strong>Office 365</strong>? If so, it would be best to follow the steps indicated on the link indicated to be isolate further and ensure that the issue is not with your
<strong>Office apps</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've already performed these steps, we also suggest that you <strong>create
</strong>a<strong> <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
new user profile</a></strong> and name it as <strong>test</strong>. This is to make sure as well that you're current user profile is not at fault. In the event that it isn't reoccurring on the
<strong>test user profile</strong>, this would mean that the <strong>current user profile</strong> is already corrupted. This means that we would need to move your personal files to a

            Thanks for all your assistance.&nbsp; Problem seems to have gone away but nothing that I did to my knowledge.&nbsp; Maybe an update somewhere, Microsoft I suspect, but thankful to stop fighting the problem.

<blockquote>This fix does not apply to Windows 7.</blockquote>
<br />
How was anyone to know that was your OS or that, apparently, the version of IE you are having trouble with is IE8?&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise the related link on that KB article, for a problem with Internet Shortcuts icons with IE7 in Vista base could have been an appropriate
 response.<br />
<br />
W7?&nbsp; Then, perhaps you should&nbsp;try&nbsp;its troubleshooter&nbsp; for&nbsp; IE?&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<h2>            Lumia 920 wouldn&#39;t update to new versions and Windows Device Recovery doesnt connect to phone</h2>
                    <p>I had a problem where my Lumia 920 using 10.0.12562.84 could not update to later versions of the Windows Phone O/S.&nbsp; The Windows Insider app and the Phone Update App would not do anything.&nbsp; Just sit there with the dots running across the screen hanging the
 Phone, until the app eventually died.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I tried the Windows Phone Recovery Tool and the later Windows Device Recovery tool.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; The Phone would occasionally connect but the recovery tool even if it saw the phone would not do anything. Just spend time connecting.</p>
<p>Thought I'd bricked my phone!&nbsp; Ended up going to a new iPhone 6 (nicknamed "The Antique" :) ) as the 940 was never released and the 950 was still in the future.</p>
<p>But, I have just solved the problem on the 920 by resetting the phone (didn't restore from an earlier backup) and keeping it standard.</p>
<p>Then I installed the Windows Insider App and it was able to locate updates.&nbsp; Its downloading now.</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for showing interest on testing Windows 10 Insider Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We appreciate your time and effort for getting back to us.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 10 Insider preview 10240 operates very slowly while you restore files with File History. This issue may arise if the computer is affected with virus/ if the space on the drive
 where Windows is installed is too low for the Windows to operate effectively.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Kindly follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to run the system maintenance and check if it helps. Follow the below steps to run the system maintenance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click o <strong>Start</strong> menu and type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
in the search bar.</li><li>Click on <strong>Run maintenance tasks</strong> under <strong>System and security</strong>.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instruction to complete System maintenance troubleshooter.</li></ol>

            <p>How could I possibly have any virus when I first clean installed 10240? I have no programs installed. I have ample amounts of hard drive space so I know that's not the issue here. File History restoration ran smoothly in build 9926, but since 10041, it has
 ran like a snail and in the 10240 RTM version, it's still the same. </p>

    <title>How to repair pst file in Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to repair pst file in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    I have Windows 8 and Office 2013 with Outlook. Since upgrading I seem to be having a few problems syncing my&nbsp;calendars (some dates will sync and others will not. I sync to a Google calendar so it keeps my phone updated)&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as sometimes my mail will
 not appear (it says "no items&nbsp;to show") unless I close and open Outlook.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There used to be a "repair" command in Outlook, and searching for&nbsp;repair&nbsp;online it gives me several options of 3rd party add on programs. Microsoft says there is a "scanpst.exe file, but I can't find that in 2013. So how do I check and repair my pst file?
 It has been converted through a few Outlook updates and it is about 4 gig. I read that in older versions you should not go over 2 gig, but I have years of information so I can't see starting a new pst file and loosing&nbsp;everything. Suggestions??</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community and providing us an opportunity to assist you. As I understand, you’re facing issues with Outlook 2013 and you’re unable to locate the scanpst.exe file to repair the Outlook PST file.
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Even though Outlook can work with large PST files, it is always recommended to keep the PST size below 4 GB, so as to reduce the chances of data corruption. Using a new PST file does not mean that you’ll lose your old data. You
 can still keep the old PST file in Outlook and access the data in it, while Outlook uses the new PST file to send/receive the latest emails.
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">To repair the current PST file in Outlook 2013 using the Inbox Repair Tool (scanpst.exe), refer the article given below:</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">Note: Close Outlook and take a backup of the PST file before you run the SCANPST tool.</font></span></p>

                    <p>Original title: Word 2011</p>
<p>Why can't I use /,- symbols to save files anymore...I was able to before I upgraded from Office 2008 for Mac? I get no warning about invalid characters when I go to save?????
</p>
<div>I get an error message:</div>
<div>"Word cannot open this document. The document might be in use, the document might not be a valid Word document, or the file name might contain invalid characters (for example,\ / ). " And this is a document that I just created using Word???</div>

            Many years later, but in case you or anyone else is wondering Why?..there is a technical answer, and to some degree, it makes sense.&nbsp;<br />
There are 9 special characters MS and Word cannot use for saving files &lt; &gt; / \ ? . :&nbsp; | and one other that escape me now.&nbsp;<br />
But why? Because Dos used those (and a few others) for commands, (search, for example) which would confuse the process. Microsoft followed those rules.&nbsp;<br />
Apple (Mac) uses their own set of "limitations".&nbsp;<br />
But the "Why does Mac do this on Office for Mac NOW? when they never did before?&nbsp; Once again, there really is a logical answer. You're using a Mac, your job uses Windows, but one person decides to use Windows Vista, and another is using Windows 10 (I said the
 reason made sense, not the example). Apparently in earlier versions of Office for Mac there were compatibility issues. So to make crossing from one platform (Operating System -OS) easier, they decided to implement the same rules, in this case, because even
 today, most desk tops use Microsoft, they chose to use Microsoft rules. Had it been the other way around and Macs were more widely used, it would most likely have followed the Mac limitations. And instead of you asking why, it'd be me cussing out Mac.&nbsp;

            Bob is Correct.<br />
<br />
Office 2011 unlike previous versions that was ground up Macintosh Code base, is Port of the Window Office version (actually a combination of 2007 and 2010). It was so good a Port that it obeys rules for Naming file/Folders in the windows version. It's so embedded
 they can't get it out, without destroying the whole suite. So Office Mac now follows PC Office rules as far name files and Folders.
<br />
<br />
Since Mac OSX is based on BSD UNIX anyway the naming convention should have been this way from OSX.1,
<br />
But why Apple decided to do the other way, I guess to make it easier on Users.<br />
