<p>I appear to have resolved the problem,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I Uninstalled Skype</p>
<p>2. I restored Edge as default web browser ( I had changed to Chrome)</p>
<p>3, I reinstalled Skype using the oldest and presumably original skype.exe on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested the installation and made a successful call receiving clear sound.</p>

<h2>            Day &#38; Date wrong in Calendar tile</h2>
                    <p>Lumia 650 - Using the manually set date forward to get around the Account Settings Out of Date loop, then changing it back, both with &amp; without using Auto, the Start Screen Outlook Calendar tile shows the incorrect day and date. Opening Calendar, it correctly
 indicates the proper current date. I had also tried the delete and recreate account and the same problem exists. I really do not want to do a hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, both on this and the recurring Settings Out of Date debacle?</p>

            A hard reset and fresh install has resolved these issues. Thus far, I have nut run into the account settings out of date. I can only hope that it can remain as it now is.

    <title>Outlook account Exchange ActiveSync vs Microsoft Exchange - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guy.turner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook account Exchange ActiveSync vs Microsoft Exchange</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set up my Outlook 2016 email accounts. The first 2 set up just fine as "Exchange ActiveSync" and I have no problems with the program but when I try to put in a new secondary account it resets the program and boot shows "setting up outlook
 for first use" and it changes all of my settings. It also shows in account settings as "Microsoft Exchange" instead of "Exchange ActiveSync". Why is it doing this? How can this be changed? It also keeps asking for the password every time I open the program.
 And, yes I did check the box to keep the info. The new account I added is a "outlook.com" account instead of the other 2 "live.com" accounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Are you able to view the previously configured email account in File&gt; Account Settings&gt; Account Settings&gt; Email?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to login to the Outlook.com through webmail and check if Outlook preview is mentioned there. If it is mentioned as Outlook preview and you try to set the account with auto settings,

<p>
</p><p>I was able to fix the pass conflict, not really sure how, but it doesn't ask for the pass when opening Outlook anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mail seems to be working correctly now, it is just the difference between a "Microsoft Exchange" account and a "Exchange ActiveSync" account that seemed to cause the issue with it resetting the Outlook program when added. I changed the 'default' account
 back to the top account above and it works ok, just still confused about the two types of accounts and what the difference is.</p>

            <p>Yes I have the same issue. I have two MS accounts through outlook.com, one now connecting with Exchange ActiveSync and the other secondary account recently syncing through Microsoft Exchange. I access both in the same profile in Outlook 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the Ms Ex account would override the settings of the Ex As account, particularly in calendaring where it would reset the To-do bar so that I had mail from one account and an agenda from the other.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't matter how I tried to set the default data file in Control Panel\Mail...\Email Accounts and Data Files tab. It would only accept the Ms Ex data file as the default, which of course affected the To-do bar and agenda.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, I created a second profile through "show profiles", with one account in each profile, and have to alternate my Outlook 2016 between the two profiles, first opening one account, closing it and then opening the other. Not very satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the Microsoft Exchange account now allows me to create a rule in Outlook 2016 which is then replicated in the server (the web browser view), which is good, but it does not let me create or modify rules (go to&nbsp; 'sweep' in the ribbon of the browser \

            <p>I was researching the same question this morning and came across your post.&nbsp; I wanted to share with you&nbsp;that even though what you have done so far has fixed your current issues, we're all in for a lot more issues if we don't do what is in these two links.
</p>
<p>One is the link referred to in the above reply from Parth.&nbsp; However, I don't think there is seriously enough information there to alert us to what is also in the next link.</p>
<p>Basically, if I read this correctly, and I believe I do, if our mail server has been Exchange Active Sync (which I see yours has) we will have to set up a new profile and save all the old email because it is not going to transfer to the Office 365 server
 that all the accounts are being migrated to.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know about you, but I am very disappointed that Microsoft has not put this out to everyone as a huge alert.&nbsp; It is absurd that our mail is being handled as though it is not essential to our daily lives and that it will just go away if you miss the
 warning that you have to save it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to warn you about what is happening right now since your inquiry helped me find the other two links.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Wishes,</p>

            <p>Guy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook.com team is moving users mailboxes from the old Hotmail backend to the new Exchange backend.&nbsp; Most users mailboxes have been moved already.&nbsp; After your mailbox is moved you will need to reconnect your accounts so that they show as Microsoft Exchange.&nbsp;
 If you click File, Account Settings, Account Settings, look at the <strong>Type</strong> field.&nbsp; If it shows
<strong>ExchangeActiveSync </strong>then you will need to reconnect the account to make it connect as
<strong>Microsoft&nbsp;Exchange</strong>.&nbsp; Before you do that make sure your mailbox has been migrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the top of this document it explains how you can check if your mailbox has been migrated&nbsp;and also&nbsp;instructions for reconnecting,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Reconnect-Outlook-2016-or-Outlook-2013-to-Outlook-com-for-uninterrupted-email-access-cda1751d-9503-40bf-bf76-e79454ac5eb3?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Reconnect-Outlook-2016-or-Outlook-2013-to-Outlook-com-for-uninterrupted-email-access-cda1751d-9503-40bf-bf76-e79454ac5eb3?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason to move to Exchange is that it is a more robust experience compared to ExchangeActiveSync (EAS).&nbsp; EAS is a protocol better suited&nbsp;for devices like phones but even those are already moving to Exchange connectivity.&nbsp;

            Thanks for the information.&nbsp; At this point I don't think I want to start over setting up IE just to be able to view an occasional video that won't play.&nbsp; I will keep your suggestion in mind should I decide it is bothersome.&nbsp; Of course, if I buy a new laptop
 I will have to set it all up again anyway so I guess it is 6 of 1 and half a dozen of the other.&nbsp; Thanks for answering my question.

<p>Seems I need to force Access to ask to save the form. I needed to change the width of the column and then right click a column header and select 'Unhide Fields'. Even if I make no changes&nbsp;to the Unhide Fields, Access still asks me if I want to save the changes.
 Then the column width gets saved. Seems like a lot of messing around... but if it works.</p>

    <title>When I create a new Contact on my phone, it shows up in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            When I create a new Contact on my phone, it shows up in Outlook 2016 in &#34;Agent Registry Contacts&#34; instead of the normal Contacts associated with the account.</h2>
                    <p>When I create a new Contact on my phone, it shows up in Outlook 2016 in "Agent Registry Contacts" instead of the normal Contacts associated with the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account is a hotmail account, part of Outlook.com that has migrated over to the new Exchange servers late last year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create a new Contact for the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account on my phone, the new contact never shows up in Outlook.com People, and in Outlook 2016, it doesn't show up in the usual "Contacts- *** Email address is removed for privacy ***" folder, instead it appears in "Agent Registry Contacts".
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching all contact items in Outlook 2016 will find the new contact, but using "Check Names" when writing an email will not find the new contact.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Based on your description, I suggest you do the troubleshooting steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>I understand that your Hotmail account is related to an exchange account, am I correct? If yes, please
</span><span>create a new profile with the affected Outlook.com account only to see if it works.</span></li><li>I want to confirm whether the affected is an Outlook.com now and migrated from the Exchange server. Or, it is an Exchange account now and migrated from an Outlook.com.</li><li>If the Exchange server you referred to means outlook.com email server?</li></ol>
<p><span>Besides, please provide the following information:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The detailed steps on how you migrate your Hotmail account to Exchange server.</span></li><li><span>The detailed information about how you create the contact on your phone .</span></li><li><span><span>The OS of your phone. </span></span>such as Android 5.1.1 and iOS 10.2.1.</li></ol>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Troubleshooting steps</p>
<p>1) I created a new profile with only the Outlook.com account, and it encountered the same problem.</p>
<p>2) The account is still at Outlook.com. &nbsp;When I said it was migrated, I just meant that Outlook.com moved it to their new Exchange-based servers, from the previous servers Outlook.com was using.</p>
<p>3) Yes, the Exchange server I'm referring to is the Outlook.com server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional Info requested:</p>
<p>1) I followed the instructions Microsoft sent me so my Outlook.com account would begin using their new server</p>
<p>2) Detail on how I created the contact on the phone: &nbsp;I'm using the built in Contacts app (version 1.6.20). &nbsp;I have the app set so any new contacts I create are by default created in my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account. (The Outlook.com account). &nbsp;</p>
<p>3) My Nexus 6p phone is running Android 7.1.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, based on a suggestion I was given, I went to the settings of my Outlook.com account and "removed" the device ("Android"). &nbsp;(Settings=&gt;Options=&gt;General=&gt;Mobile Devices). &nbsp;I believe this resets the sync relationship. &nbsp;After the phone re-synced
 all the contacts, it seemed to fix the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So I went back to Outlook 2016 and copied all the contacts in "Agent Registry Contacts" into the correct "Contacts - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, then deleted the "Agent Registry Contacts" item (folder?).</p>
<p>However, now I'm back to a situation where new contacts created on my phone aren't showing up in Outlook.com or Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sidenote, I also tried 3 experiments with existing contacts:</p>
<p>1) Using Outlook 2016 to update an existing Contact. &nbsp;Result: &nbsp;The update flowed to Outlook.com, but not my phone.</p>
<p>2) Using Outlook.com/People to update an existing contact. &nbsp;Result: &nbsp;The update flowed to Outlook 2016 and to my phone.</p>
<p>3) Using my phone to update an existing contact. &nbsp;Result: The update didn't flow to Outlook 2016 or Outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a couple of contacts, when I made updates to the contact on my phone, the old version of the contact remained in Outlook.com, BUT I found the new, updated version of the contact in the "Recover deleted items" of contacts in Outlook.com. &nbsp;I haven't been
 able to recreate this, and I'm not sure how it happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone thinks it's syncing fine with my outlook.com account, reporting no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is quite frustrating that I can't access/create/edit a contact and have it flow through to Outlook.com, Outlook 2016, and my phone. &nbsp;I keep ending up with different information in different locations.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I have had the same issue with my Sony Z5 Compact since Nov 16 until this morning.<br />
<br />
SONY Xperia™ Z5 Compact<br />
Android 7.0<br />
IMEI: 352190070416824<br />
SOFTWARE: &nbsp;32.3.A.0.376 (Latest)<br />
Native App: Contacts version 1.4.17<br />
<br />
I created an alias *** Email address is removed for privacy *** for my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** last year when I had issues to sync between my SONY and OUTLOOK. My *** Email address is removed for privacy *** was configured with EAS on my SONY.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contacts added in my SONY were not synced to Outlook WEB or Outlook 2013 (OUTLOOK);&nbsp;New Contacts added in OUTLOOK sync with SONY but new Contacts added in SONY did not sync with OUTLOOK;&nbsp;Contacts added in Android were added to Agent Registry Contacts in OUTLOOK..<br />
<br />
<br />
Out of the blue. The issue is gone today after a system update from SONY. I guess the issue was either fixed by the update or MS has finally fixed whatever issues they had on their OUTLOOK Servers.<br />
<br />
My advice - you may want to check for new updates for your phone.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            watermark only showing when pageheader are selected</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a word file created in word 2010 with a custom watermark.</p>
<p>this word document displays perfectly in office 2016 for windows but for office 2016 for mac the watermark is gone, unless you double click the header then it displays the watermark just fine, but close the header the watermark disappers again</p>
<p>office 2011 no problem office 2010 no problem. office 2008 no watermark at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>what option can i set to make the watermark display in every office pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>best regards&nbsp;</p>
<p>Martin</p>

            <p>Even in a document already having a watermark, go to <strong>Insert&gt; Watermark
</strong>or click the <strong>Watermark</strong> button on the <strong>Design</strong> tab of the Ribbon. You can then adjust/replace/remove the existing watermark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a thought, but you might consider using a different means of identification, such as Page Color or Page Borders.</p>

<h2>            Cant share documents from office programs</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>There is a bug / problem with sharing FROM office desktop programs.</p>
<p>For example, in word, I make a new document OR edit an existing one.</p>
<p>The document is SAVED in my local ODFB folder. I amusing the new ODFB client. The documents are shared to&nbsp;personal ODFB site om office 365.</p>
<p>After saving AND waiting for ODFB to sync files, I then try to share document from word. Option is not available. Word believes the document is NOT on the cloud (when it is)</p>
<p>Tried saving many times. It gets stuck in a loop. Save &gt; choose folder &gt; SAVE &gt; back to save to cloud</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried also restarting word, and restarting PC, same issue.</p>
<p>I can only share by navigating to the ODFB site on line and sharing from browser. Sharing from desktop program doesn't work.</p>
<p>

<p><span>According to your description, I assume that you are saving the document to the synced folder on your computer not saving to OneDrive for Business directly.</span></p>
<p><span>Please try the following steps to see if it works.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Create a document then go to File -&gt; Share.</span></li><li><span>Click Save to Cloud.</span></li><li><span>Enter a file name then save to your OneDrive – Contoso folder.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To further investigate this issue, I’d like to confirm the Office version and OneDrive client version.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the article below stated, the OneDrive sync client for Windows supports co-authoring and in-app sharing when you use Office 2016 Click 2 Run (version 16.0.6741.2027 or higher). You must
 also have OneDrive (version 17.3.6386.0412 or higher).</span></p>

<p>Once a week I delete all the duplicates only for them to be back again a few minutes later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is getting annoying.</p>

<p>Please get a fix.</p>

<p>I recently disabled Apples icloud in startup and this appears to have stopped the annoying problem. It's only been three days so far and it may be a fluke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway if you've got icloud installed and running at start up try disabling it, and delete your duplicates restart your system and&nbsp;monitor it for a few days. You may be lucky and stop the problem.</p>

    <title>Problem aligning columns in combined Word tables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r. keith howard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem aligning columns in combined Word tables</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I had a document that had 5 tables that each had 2 columns. They were each separated by a paragraph of text outside of the paragraph. I wanted to combine all the tables into one table, so I deleted
 the text between the tables, so that the bottom line of table 1 appeared to be the same as the top line of table 2, and the bottom line of table 2 appeared to be the same as the top line of table 3, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is that the widths of each table, and the two columns within them, are all slightly different. I have tried repeatedly to adjust the widths via drag, shift drag, ctrl drag, and grasping-at-a-straw(!)
 drag of the various columns. It is a bit of a nightmare. When I do such dragging, before I let go of the mouse, I seem to be "almost there" in aligning the columns, but when I let go of the mouse, then column line of one or the other of the tables that I am
 aligning seems to jump out of alignment. It is very frustrating.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I feel like I am missing some key wisdom about table column alignment and combining tables that is preventing me from making progress. Due to very specific formatting within the tables, I really don’t
 want to go through the pain of recreating them from scratch. Does anyone have any clues??
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Many thanks in advance.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Keith,</p>
<p>I had the same problem. Let's say you started with three tables, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55ed3669-12f2-4124-9168-4483a672a942" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;Next you unite your tables by deleting the intervening text, like this: </p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a34363d-cee2-4182-bfe2-3dc656d45c48" /></p>
<p>Now hover your cursor over the first column until the black down-arrow appears; left-click to select the column.<br />
It should look something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea48111f-9d1c-40e6-a8b3-8d9839f79f8a" />To clean this mess up, proceed as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the contextual TABLE TOOLS | LAYOUT tab that appears when you click anywhere in the table.</li><li>In the "Cell Size" group, type in a value for "Width" (say, 2.00 for a width of 2 inches).</li><li>Press ENTER.&nbsp;</li><li>Repeat the process for each column.</li></ol>
<p>If the original columns are of different widths, it may appear that your selection crosses into an adjacent column, as shown by the gray shading above, but don't worry about it; your width setting will resize the original selected column, then you can move
 on to the remaining columns. Here's where you should end up:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26f5fd7c-204f-4aaf-9b20-5546a1d502ec" height="219" width="767" /></p>
<p>Pretty cool, huh? &nbsp;Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Mine was set to save on my device rather than SD card. I changed it to save on the SD card and opened Edge, went to Box.com and downloaded a picture.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expected to see it on my SD card but it was in main memory. Not sure why! </p>
<p>I was able to easy and quickly move it to the SD card as an aside but that does not explain why it did not do what I expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to msn.com and opened and article. I found a picture, opened it then saved it. It DID save on my SD card as I would expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll play around with it some more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you list just what you did to download. The&nbsp;url and what you were doing? I'll try that.</p>

<p>Hello Jack</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I did set all new downloads on a SD card, but after realizing that it was set to internal memory after doing the hard reset. That was set automatically and I had to change it as I said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All downloads are supposed to go to SD card, but downloading many pictures from the web, they are still saved to internal!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost forgot it. Without my consent, my Camera roll and Screenshots pictures were uploaded to OneDrive... Later I realized that the settings were set to do that, and I had to change it too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weird things, aren't they?</p>

<p>So I checked mine again this morning after I read your reply. It is still working as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might suggest that you change it to Device and click apply. Try to save a pic and make sure it is saved to the device. Then change it to SD card, click apply and try it.</p>

<p>Hello there...thanks for the reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still the same, no matter what I choose in storage, the downloads all go to Internal storage!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to gimp.org, and with storage set to "Internal" I downloaded a small .exe file. It was stored at Device memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changed the storage to SD Card, I downloaded another small .exe file, and it was stored at...Device memory again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wouldn't be a problem if I download small files only, but with CU the internal storage space was reduced to less than 1 GB and with a few big downloads (some entire music album in FLAC, etc) that narrow space will be f**** gone!</p>

            Hi Shane,<br />
<br />
There is no option to alter the zorder of series. Normally Lines and xy-scatters appear in front of column/bars which in turn appear in front of areas charts.<br />
<br />
Are you sure the line is provided via a Line chart? <br />
<br />
Can you post an example file.<br />

<h2>            Reinstall Windows and Keep Office</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop that shipped with Windows 10 and I promptly installed Microsoft Office 2016 Home &amp; Student on it. (I bought one of those little cards with the product key on the back.) I am planning to reinstall Windows 10 on the same PC (to get rid of bloatware).
 Since all of my programs will be discarded in this process, how do I get Office back after the reinstall? I still have the product key issued to me and I will be using the same Microsoft Account, if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>DoCmd.OpenReport Where clause issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoopes_az  say:</h3>
<h2>            DoCmd.OpenReport Where clause issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a very simple form where I'm capturing payment information for student registration fees.&nbsp; The page has a button which launches a very simple report to print out a receipt of the payment.&nbsp; The report should only print a single page.&nbsp; I'm using the
 following code to invoke the report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub btnPrintReceipt_Click()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Print current record using rptPaymentReceipt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strWhere As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsNull(Me!ID) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Please select a valid record", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vbOKOnly, "Error"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strWhere = "tblStudentPurchase.ID = " &amp; Me.ID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'following line is debug<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox strWhere, vbOKOnly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport "rptPaymentReceipt", acViewPreview, , strWhere<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "ID" field is a auto number field for the student payment table.&nbsp; Using the MsgBox debug statement I can see that the strWhere statement is correctly generated...it's binding the right value every time.&nbsp; While the report opens fine it doesn't filter.&nbsp;
 It produces of page for every transaction in the DB and never limits it to the ID being queried.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've read about everything I can find related to this but haven't found an answer yet.&nbsp; Seems so simple, but I can't figure out what it is.&nbsp; Help GREATLY appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Tom.&nbsp; Yes, the reports record source is a query joining tblStudent with tblStudentPurchase.&nbsp; It includes most of the fields from tblStudentPurchase (including the ID field) along with a single field (student's name) from the tblStudent
 record.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The query uses an inner join to join the two records where tblStudent.[ID] = tblStudentPurchase.[studentID].&nbsp; The primary key for tblStudentPurchase is simply the [ID] field.</p>

                    <p>Any information?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q1: I just bought Nokia 230 dual sim and shocked after using that there is NO <strong>
INSERT NUMBER</strong> OPTION IN WRITING TEXT MESSEGES, which is I think the most most important and basic feature of any phone in the era of year 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q2: In CONTACTS you can not <strong>add Additional numbe</strong>r to the existing contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q3: A very basic and useful feature of Text messages was <strong>(SEND LATER),
</strong>Unfotunately its missing in this phone.</p>

            The Nokia 230 Dual SIM is based on the operating system Series 30+ (MediaTek) which was
<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=5703&amp;idPhone3=7771&amp;idPhone2=6570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
introduced in October 2013</a>. Although several features were added in the past two years, the features you mention are still missing, when compared to earlier Nokia Series 40 or Symbian/S60 based phones. Therefore: Which phone model did you use before? That
 helps to recommend a proper replacement, for example the <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?&amp;idPhone1=7771&amp;idPhone2=5663&amp;idPhone3=2792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia 515 Dual SIM</a> (Nokia Series 40) or <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?&amp;idPhone1=7771&amp;idPhone2=5663&amp;idPhone3=2792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia E52</a> (Symbian/S60; no Dual SIM available).
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft[,] return these sets from the market and pay back to buyers!</p>
</blockquote>
Microsoft does not leverage Microsoft Answers as feedback channel. Why ever. Therefore here, your feedback drowns in the Internet swarm. Are you able to talk to your retailer and return that phone to him?
