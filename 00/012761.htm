<h2>            Activate Office 13 abroad</h2>
                    Purchased Microsoft Surface with Office 13 installed a few months ago.&nbsp; It worked fine while in the US but now in Greece it is impossible to access any of the applications.&nbsp; For example, if Word is selected, the system displays windows Explorer.&nbsp; Please
 advise.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description, you are not able to work with the Office 2013 applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you receive any error message?</li><li>Does it prompts you to activate the Office while accessing any of the Office applications?</li></ol>
<p>Provide us more information to help you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to this, once you have installed Office 2013/365, you do not require an internet connection to access the features and functionalities related to the respective Office applications. Only for certain features such as SkyDrive storage, social connector
 would require internet connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 2013 will be assigned to a particular account, if you login using other live account to My Account page then you won’t be able to view the information for Office 2013 purchase.</p>
<p>Log-off from all the accounts, login to the My Accounts page by using the email address used to purchase Office&nbsp;2013 and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer the following link to activate the Office suite:</p>

            sorry, you'll have to contact MS directly<br />

Which surface do you have, Surface RT or Pro?<br />
Which Office bundle did you get, Office Home and Student RT (Free with Surface RT) or 1-computer Office 2013 ???? on the Pro, or 5-computer Office 365 ???? on the Pro?<br />

            <p>OK, there are 2 possible problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has divided the world into several geographic sales regions.&nbsp; Product keys are specific to the sales region. So for example if you bought your product key from a store in the US, you could not activate it in the UK or Asia. You would be using the key
 in the wrong "region".&nbsp; The best fix for this is to get a refund and to buy they key for your local region.&nbsp; This could be a major PITA.&nbsp; Stores don't like to give refunds on product keys, and trying to find someone at MS Support online to do this for you
 is about as likely as finding a four-leaf clover.&nbsp; There are a few people in MS Support who can do this, but it is almost impossible to reach them ...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you get a "PC" grade Surface that runs on an Intell i3 / i5 or i7 chip or one the cheaper Surfaces that runs on ATOM chips.&nbsp; The PC Surface allows you to install Office and other PC programs. On the other hand, the Atom Surface requires only allows you
 to install (cr)applets you buy from the MS Store online.&nbsp; I don't think this is your problem, but it may be.</p>

    <title>Gadgets app update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gadgets app update</h2>
                    <p>Actually, although a couple of days has already passed since I had installed the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (officially, i.e., no Windows Insider ring), my Gadgets app version is stuck at 4.3.10820.0, like mentioned by other forum participants, whereas
 all other Store apps are, apparently, constantly updated to the most recent version. My Windows 10 Anniversary Update is also the stable release build 10.0.14393.67 (US language and region), but my Microsoft Lumia 950 XL&nbsp;firmware (released on July 1, 2016
 and branded TMO, as I am currently in the EU) is allegedly newer than that of most commentators: 01078.00053.16236.35022.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, such an unusual Gadgets app behavior prevents the users from updating the Microsoft Display Dock HD-500 firmware, etc., as the dock simply remains unrecognized (although a connection signal is always audible and the Continuum portion functions
 as predicted via HDMI screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Various Internet posts (in German) specify that the Gadgets app has indeed received an update to version 4.4.1607.11000 4.3.1607.5001 for some users automatically two days after the Windows 10 Anniversary Update installation; however, this is obviously not
 the case here... What is the problem, Microsoft, that the user experiences differ so drastically, even if the completely identical smartphone models and/or even the same language and region settings are concerned? As I would try to avoid joining the Windows
 Insider's rings (e.g., Fast) unnecessarily,&nbsp;somebody help! Any communal and/or Microsoft's assistance would be highly appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>the problem concerning the folders of my mail account has been fixed. I have used mail for exchange instead of hotmail. I hope this will work for my gmail account too. However my new problem is that the mail for exchange gave the default name of the mail
 "Hotmail" but i can't see any options to change this. Is this possible?</p>

            Hello
<br />
<br />A pleasure to help you as an independent collaborator.
<br />
<br />Regarding the incident, it would be ideal to validate pending Windows 10 updates and updates for Office 365.
<br />As an initial solution, open the sent folder in Outlook, and then delete all the messages that appear there. Exit Outlook. Restart Outlook, and then try to send or receive email.
<br />
<br />Would it be ideal to take a screenshot of the current version in your Office 365?
<br />
<br />I await your comments to continue supporting you.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            It is also advisable to carry out a complete repair of Office 365.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />Once the indications are finished and the error persists it would be better to create a new Outlook profile since it could be corrupt.
<br />I hope you succeed with the solution, let me know to continue supporting you.

</p><p>I have started using Office 365 since September. The two payments went with no issues. The past two payments for November and December are still "Pending".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still able to use Office 365 though, so this situation is somewhat confusing.</p>

<h2>            Take good enough close up pictures with full focus camera.</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />
<br /><b>Details</b><br />
<p><span>Here is a method</span>&nbsp;of taking close up pictures of your ID cards, Visiting cards, News papers etc with full focus camera phones like 701.<br />
<br />
Set your camera to 6MP, adjust sharpness to hard, turn the flash on (compulsory), and zoom in completely.<br />
<br />
Now you are ready to capture legible images of news paper, Identity cards, Visiting cards etc.<br />
<br />
Hold your phone camera to at least 30 to 40 centimeters away from the object you are taking and press capture button.<br />
<br />
Care must be taken to not to shake the camera and not to place finger near the camera lens.</p>

<h2>            Forgot login information to manage domain &#47; email accounts</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought I had written down the correct email / password that I used to register my domain, but upon logging in, it says I have no domains registered. I have access a few email accounts associated with it (just not the admin) and can successfully email
 with them so I know I'm just using the wrong login for the admin account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. How can I obtain my login info (I can provide any information necessary to prove my identity)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. If I'm forced to register a new domain account and re-add all the email accounts, then won't each email address lose its data?</div>
                </div>

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community! We understand that you forgot your domain's administrator account. Sorry for the inconvenience but we are not allowed to disclose that kind of&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want, you can add another account to become your domain's administrator account.
</p>
<p><span>To add another administrator account to your domain, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open your web browser</span></p>
<p><span>2. Go to http://domains.live.com</span></p>
<p><span>3. Sign in with the MSA you wish to make an administrator</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on get started
</span></p>
<p><span>5. Enter the domain name you wish to add to
</span></p>
<p><span>6. Choose whether to include
<span>hotmail</span> service or no mail</span></p>
<p><span>7. Click on I Accept</span></p>
<p><span>8. You will receive a new MX record</span></p>
<p><span>9. In WLAC copy the MX server under Mail setup (required).
</span><b><i><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&lt;MX token&gt;.pamx1.<u>hotmail</u>.com</span></i></b></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then paste this to the registrar of your domain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We're looking forward to your response.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Microsoft community. As I understood your concern, you're asking if data will be lost if you migrate your domain from other provider to Windows Live Admin Center. Is that correct? If so, please be guided that all e-mails will be lost when migrating,
 so I suggest that you back up your e-mails to prevent data loss.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have further questions.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            <p>You want to enable the loudspeaker. After placing the phone on a table, you should see six icons below the called number, one is the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, I guess, your display stays off and does not reveal those six icons. The Nokia 311 has a proximity sensor. That sensor tries to detect your ear and turns off the display while calling. That saves energy. That sensor is placed on the
 upper right corner of the display. When you place the phone against light, you see two round circles there. The left one is the proximity sensor. Please, make sure nothing does obstruct that sensor (like a screen protector or dirt). If everything is clean
 (try a bit&nbsp;<em>purified</em> water and <em>wool</em>&nbsp;cloth), the sensor might be broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, you have to press the key-lock button twice. Now, you should see those icons and the loudspeaker button.</p>

                    <p>I can set <em>Ligatures</em> to <em>Standard and Contextual</em> and on the screen everything is perfect. But, when I export file&nbsp;to PDF all ligatures disappear from the PDF file. This is happening when I use italic for Serbian language.

            <p>Hi Daniel!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your willing to help me about <em>ligature</em> problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem occurs when I use&nbsp;Serbian variant of the italic Cyrillic letters. I can access them when setting
<em>Ligatures</em> to&nbsp;<em>Standard and Contextual</em>&nbsp;in the <strong>Font/Advanced</strong> panel.&nbsp;Then Cyrillic letters&nbsp;(in Latin transcription):&nbsp;"p", "š", "t", "b" and "d" appears according to Serbian Cyrillic standard in
<em>MS Word 2013</em>. Here is the screen shot of this letters in a couple of fonts all represented correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd76f3ba-0dc2-4bd8-a935-364f2b0b0928" /></p>
<p>When I try to generate PDF file by <strong>Export/Create PDF/XPS Document</strong> in
<em>MS Word 2013</em> or by <em><strong>PrimoPDF</strong></em> printing the Serbian Cyrillic standard is replaced by Russian Cyrillic standard (default)&nbsp;. The difference you can se in the screen shot bellow.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a27f5b3a-7677-4cf3-95c3-7c0fab3fe1ef" /></p>
<p>Same happens when I use <strong><em>Microsoft XPS Document Writer</em></strong> and
<strong><em>Send To OneNote 2013</em></strong>.&nbsp;Contrariwise, when&nbsp;I print Latin ligatures, like
<em>"fi"</em> and <em>"ffi" </em>these are transferred correctly in PDF and other file formats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm completely aware this this sort of problem have only users of Serbian Language,&nbsp;but I will much appreciate if you can help me solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Stevan Kordić</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, more then two years passed, since I reported this bug,&nbsp;and it is still uncorrected by
<em>Microsoft</em>. It completely make&nbsp;useless Microsoft fonts, if you want to use
<em>italic</em> in your <em>Cyrillic</em> non <em>Russian</em> texts. I'm sorry to hear that the same situation is with
<em>Arabic</em> script.</p>

            <p>Saving to PDF should preserve the formatting of the original file (but I have no means of testing this myself with Cyrillic text). How are you saving to PDF? Using File | Save As in Word? Or by printing to PDF using a third-party converter?</p>

<p>
</p><p>After all update, after new version of MS Word situation is the same. Whenever and however&nbsp;I try to print Serbian Cyrillic italic letters the output is turned in Russian Cyrillic italic letters. In my particular case I have used Print by
<em>"Microsoft Print to PDF"</em> or <em>"Microsoft Print to Document Writer"</em>.</p>

            Unfortunately, that doesn't work either.<br />
<br />
I used to duplicate all my .docx files as a PDF, and that's how I initially discovered the problem. Printing either as PDF or to the printer makes no difference, margins are messed up and ligatures are hit or miss at best. I haven't found anywhere that Microsoft
 has addressed these issue at all.

            This is in Outlook.com on the web or in Outlook installed on your desktop? As far as I know, Outlook on the web always puts the folders in alphabetical order (after the default folders- they are always at the top of the folder list) but outlook desktop has an option to sort A-Z or arrange as desired. (Folder button) 
<br />
<br />This is the order outlook on the web should use, with user-created folders at the bottom, in alphabetical order.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82beb174-10f6-42ac-8d6a-64ea32df056c?upload=true" />

<p>Thaks, I'll go this this link. Since I posted my orginial comment, I did in fact import "Outlook Backup.pst" and it did copy it into my outlook tree. However, it was from like 6 months ago. So I am still in a big world of hurt.</p>
<p>This mdbvu32.exe program was introduced to me as a way to get rid of stuck emails. And it has work great, up to the point where I appearently was in the "child folders" column instead of the "folders" column when I hit delete.</p>
<p>Does anyone know or can dirrect me to someone who knows about mdbvu32.exe? And perhaps how to "recover" a deleted file there?</p>

            <p>If you mean that you have purchased/ or will, a version of MS Office you cannot custom install a click to run version, its all or nothing</p>
<p>You can buy the stand alone version of MS Outlook, you pay a premium compared to the Office suite price, and you wont get full integration with earlier Office versions/components

<h2>            Access 2013 background images smaller in Windows 10 vs Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have Access 2013 on both my Windows 7 and Windows 10 machines.&nbsp; On my Windows 10 laptop, I created a database menu.&nbsp; I try to use a jpg image as the background.&nbsp; The image appears very small and cannot be resized.&nbsp; So, I created a database menu with&nbsp;the
 same&nbsp;background image using my Windows 7 version.&nbsp; The image renders correctly.&nbsp; I take a backup of the database and open it using my Windows 10 laptop, the image is much smaller and cannot be resized.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if there is an update driver for the software?&nbsp; Is the solution something to do with the display drivers?</p>
<p>

            For the background images, I had to use the property sheet.&nbsp; Under Format, change the Picture Size Mode from Clip to Zoom.&nbsp; That seemed to fix it in one of my databases.&nbsp; I still have not figured out how to change the icon.

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion, but it doesn't solve it for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Microsoft template called Marketing Project, and the background image is set to be stretched horizontal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how it supposed to look like, which works on Windows 7:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f92df87a-0531-4567-881a-991352770935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f92df87a-0531-4567-881a-991352770935" /></a></p>
<p>...and this is how it looks on Windows 10:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bba79225-6097-4f15-875d-432bb6a87f96" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bba79225-6097-4f15-875d-432bb6a87f96" /></a></p>
<p>If I set the background image to zoom, the image "tool bar" get stretched out vertically.</p>
<p>I will try and perform a office repair, to see if that solves the problem...</p>

<h2>            Vlookup returns mailto link but will not work unless source data open</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first time on here and looking for some help with a vlookup issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not particularly experienced with Excel but have been able to write a vlookup formula which works when the source workbook is open, but doesn't when the workbook is closed. I have read on a few forums online that certain external links do not work in
 excel when the source workbook is closed, but I don't appear to have any of these in my formula below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=(Hyperlink("mailto:"vlookup($C$9,'[BrokerLog info.xlsx]Live Broker Log'!$A$2:$X$669,12,0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is to create a worksheet which can be used by the colleagues to select a broker name and information will be returned using vlookup formulas linked to a separate source workbook, without the source workbook being open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the vlookups work and the relevant information is being returned (even when the source workbook is closed); however, the one above does not. The formula above has been created so that the relevant email address is returned, and by clicking on the link,
 an email opens for them to update. However, whilst the formula works fine and returns the email address (when workbook is open or closed) the email will only open if the source work book is also open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this makes sense and I'm sure there is probably a simple fix. I just really dont want to have to accept defeat and allow both workbooks to be open for this to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Simon&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Just installed office 2010 and outlook messed up during setup of a exchange profile. Now every time I open Outlook 2010 I get an exchange account error message and then Outlook freezes (Not responding).</strong></p>

<p><strong>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Outlook and also tried "repair" from the install disc. The mail option is not available in the control panel since my last uninstall and reinstall.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I need to just start fresh, how can I get Outlook to act the way it did on first install when it had no info and ran a setup wizard?</span></strong></p>

<p>I did all this... but for some reason it won't let me delete the exchange account causing the error, it says it is copying info.</p>
<p>I also can no longer get into the Mail settings to add accounts unless I'm in outlook. The Mail option in control panel is gone.</p>

            If you haven't even found the Mail icon in Control Panel then you clearly have not configured a new Outlook profile, so I doubt&nbsp;your claim that you "did all this" is accurate.&nbsp;Read the link I posted again. The Mail icon in Control Panel is not gone. If
 you're using 64 bit it's still there if you use the Classic view. Post precise steps used and outcomes if you want help in a forum.

<h2>            OneNote for Mac Sidebar no longer hides when you resize window</h2>
                    Previous versions of OneNote hid the sidebar when you dragged the window size down below a certain threshold. This feature appears to be broken in the latest Mac version. Is this something that's coming back?

<p>Hi Russell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, this feature is available in version 15.41, but not in version 16.23 and 16.24. It seems that this change of behavior happened after a new side bar is added in the left. On newer versions, you may click the Hide Navigation button to hide
 the navigation section.</p>
<p>

<p>

</p><p>If you prefer the behavior on the previous versions, you may also click the smiley face on the top right side of the OneNote for Mac application to send your feature request to our OneNote development team.</p>

<h3> sirkr1stof  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office pro plus version number mismatch</h2>
                    <p>We are seeing a strange issue where Office applications are reporting an old version number, this is taken from 'File' &gt; 'Office Account' &gt;'About Outlook':</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7b3e7cf-3446-4cf3-bf9e-4baedcf59a93?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7b3e7cf-3446-4cf3-bf9e-4baedcf59a93?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>16.0.4738.1000</p>
<p>At first we thought our updates were borked but all the latest Office updates show as being installed, to make things weirder when we check the 'details' tab against the .exe we can see the latest version number is showing:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31491192-726a-4fe4-affa-f1075fd0793c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31491192-726a-4fe4-affa-f1075fd0793c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>16.0.4822.1000</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why the applications are showing as an old version number while the systems are showing up to date and new version numbers? Happening on a few hundred laptop/desktops?</p>
<p>just to be clear, no problem with installing the updates - seems to be just a problem with office reporting the correct version number from the application.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

                    I just spent about 2 hours with Excel for Mac help for Office for Mac 2011.&nbsp; Have learned that when editing in the formula bar or a cell, the "esc" key does not back you out of the edit.&nbsp; The red circle with the "x" does back you out if your cursor is
 in the formula box, but is entirely undocumented.&nbsp; I also learned that "control"- "esc' also backs you out, which is again undocumented.&nbsp; All the support Docs ref use of the "Esc".&nbsp; Am I the only one with this problem??
