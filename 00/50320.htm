    <title>Error Activating BitLocker Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> romec  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Activating BitLocker Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to enable bitlocker on my Surface Pro 3 with Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I keep getting the following notice:</p>
<p>"This PC doesn't support entering a BitLocker recovery password during startup. Ask your administrator to configure Windows Recovery Environment so that you can use BitLocker."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am the administrator. How do I configure Windows Recovery Environment to enable BitLocker? I initially could configure it but I cancelled before going through the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could someone please help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I was playing the game when I noticed when I use survival instincts it doesn't go to black and white and that anything highlighted is very blurry. Also I think the camera angles has been set further back because of the glitch. Anybody having this issue and
 is there anyway to fix it.</p>

<p>You mean those special save that you can use for Mass effect 2, if yes then there's no way. i some how got them all deleted from my console when the glitch that set every one gamescore to zero problem appear during the time that Mass Effect 3 came out. not
 sure if it well work but what i did was delete my gamertag, and all of the save from my console, then i recover it from xbox live. i swear that i was just going to delete my gamertag only, and i accidentally press the second option when deleting you gamertag
 which. after i recover my gamertag from xbox live i notice every save was gone, and no longer in my console. i feel so depressed even talking about it</p>

<p>Those are just the regular save which can just be delete at any time, the special save are the ones that can't be delete which is pain in the you know what. well if he is talking about the regular save then he didn't specify which type of save he wants to
 delete, so i just assume that his talking about the special save which are used to import into the next game.</p>

<p>You can delete them but it is a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>Get a USB stick which works with your 360 and format it for 360 storage. Then go into the memory section of your console and select Storage, highlight your hard drive press Y for Device Options and there pick Transfer content.</p>

<p>Now go to the option that says Publisher Data and move the Mass Effect career you want rid of to the USB stick.</p>

<p>Format the USB stick again and the career is gone.</p>

    <title>Factory Reset of Windows 8 Failing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Factory Reset of Windows 8 Failing</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to reset an older Windows 8 computer to wipe all of my data off of it before gifting it to a relative. I have created my installation media on USB, and changed the BIOS boot order to prioritize booting from USB. I navigate to the settings page
 with the reset option, with the USB in its port, and confirm that I want to reset. The machine reboots fine, get past terms and conditions, but a problem occurs on the "Where do you want to install Windows?" screen. The error says that "Windows can't be installed
 on drive 0 partition 2" with the details "Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed on GPT disks." The same detail message appears regardless of which drive is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it necessary to convert MBR disk to GPT disk in order to reset Windows 8? If so, what is the least intrusive way of accomplishing this?</p>

<p><span>Hi Amfun,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The best way to proceed if you’ve already backed up the data on Drive 0, is to delete the partitions and let Windows create new partitions for the install. Here are some steps beginning after the
 terms and conditions screen:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select <strong>Custom: Install Windows (advanced).</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select <strong>Drive options (advanced).</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Highlight each partition individually and select <strong>Delete</strong>. Eventually you will see Drive 0 as one entry and all
<strong>Unallocated Space</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select <strong>Next.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Installation should commence at this point.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any questions&nbsp;about the process, please let us know!</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Avery</span></p>

            Thank you. This was helpful. I actually wasn't able to create the USB installation media from the data on Drive 0. When I tried it wouldn't let me proceed. Instead I found a download for Windows 8.1 ISO. Will this still work with my original product key,
 even though the computer originally came with windows 8.0 installed? I just want to make sure I really have everything I need before I do something permanent like deleting partitions.

<p>Since you'll need to enter the key before proceeding to terms and conditions, it should not let you arrive at the drive options menu unless the key was accepted. As long as there were no major hardware changes since the previous install, you should be able
 to clean install and activate with no issues.</p>

<h2>            Unable to retrieve purchase history for Age of Empires 3 on GFWL client</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
I posted my problem here(http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_support/xbox_on_windows_support/f/5413/t/2068445.aspx) originally, but seeing as how this subsection is related to purchases as well
 as section 04, and is patrolled by at least one or two Microsoft moderators/team members, I wanted to post here as well.<br />
<br />
My problem is this:<br />
<br />
I downloaded the Games for Windows Live client. I can log in fine. But as soon as I do, the client attempts to contact whatever Microsoft server it normally does, but I get the following error in red text:<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">"There was an error retrieving your purchase history. Please sign out and try again later"</span><br />
<br />
This has been happening for the last week or so. Due to this problem, I cannot download my copy of Age of Empires 3 complete collection from the client. This morning I was given what I feel as a run around / hand off to several Microsoft departments and reps
 without any resolution to my problem. Here is my chronicle of yesterday morning.<br />
<br />
1) An online chat session with an Xbox.com support rep referred me to Steam and the support information provided by Steam. Despite the fact that I didn't purchase this product from Steam, I purchased it from Microsoft. Quoting the Xbox support rep and myself
 from our chat session:<br />

<span>Rep:</span><span>&nbsp;"Yep, it's still there on that link and it's still work however all issues will be needing a support from Steam. They're the one's who's handling all issues."</span>&nbsp;<br />

https://help.steampowered.com/#HelpWithGameIssue/?appid=105450&amp;issueid=106</a>&nbsp;Note:you have to be logged into a steam account to see all the support info.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3) E-mailing the address on the Steam page gave me the below automated reply:</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Age of Empires Support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For assistance with Age of Empires III, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows-games/age-of-empires-iii-complete-collection-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows-games/age-of-empires-iii-complete-collection-info</a></p>

<p>4)&nbsp;Following that link leads me back to Xbox support. Looking through the FAQ and other help provided here,&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows-games/age-of-empires-iii-complete-collection-rating-system-faq," target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows-games/age-of-empires-iii-complete-collection-rating-system-faq,</a>&nbsp;I
 was not able to resolve the problem. I clicked on the "contact us" link at bottom of the page which leads me back to step one, Xbox support.&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us?NavigationPath=/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows-games/age-of-empires-iii-complete-collection-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us?NavigationPath=/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows-games/age-of-empires-iii-complete-collection-info</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
5) At this point, I contacted the number listed on the Steam support page. 1-<span>800-537-8324. I hoped I would be able to get assistance if I talked to a person over the phone. the person I spoke to transferred me to Windows support. That person transferred
 me to Sales support. Sales thought 'I wanted a backup copy of the game, but after explaining my situation, sales transferred me technical support. Technical support tried transferring me to someone else, at which point I was put on hold and my call dropped
 / was hung up on after about 45 minutes of talking to several people, waiting on hold, and not getting a resolution of any kind.<br />
<br />
</span>This is an extremely frustrating process and I just want to talk to SOMEBODY who can give me either A: an answer as to why my GFWL client is not able to contact the microsoft server or B) Give me a Steam copy of Age of Empires complete collection. Clearly
 Games for Windows Marketplace is closed. However, I am not able to download my game despite that fact that the text on the Xbox page for the client download states:<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>&nbsp;"Although you will not be able to purchase new games, you
 can continue to enjoy previously purchased content by downloading them through the Games for Windows LIVE client software as usual."</strong></span><br />
<br />
My case has been anything but, "as usual".<br />

<h2>            Computer crashed, now it says windows is not genuine when it is.</h2>
                    <p>Hi i bought my pc around two years ago, the hdd failed a month ago so i reintalled windows 7 home sp1, and used my cd key that i got when i bought the pc, my pc crashed the other night, and it couldn't boot up properly i had to follow some on screen instructions
 to get the machine to work again, once it did boot up again it told me that my windows was not genuine, it was working fine until the crash. I tried to reactivate it with my cd key but it gives me this error.<br />
<br />
The machine was bought from a high street store and is 100% genuine, i was wondering if someone could help me out as i don't know what to do it won't verify online and everything i've tried just isn't working. Windows restore has not worked for it either.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! If you are experiencing issues playing your games, try to restart the console by performing a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hard Reset</a>. This can clear any issues with the connection on the console and hopefully allow the game to start properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can shut down the PC also. You can either hold the power button and it will shut down. Or you hit the start menu the bottom icon on the left select shut down. Once it goes off then turn back on and try the game. Also the service alert can be affecting
 some multiplayer games.</p>

<p>HI there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The service alert you are referencing has since been resolved and no longer should be affecting what is going on with the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you explain a little more what happens or what message you get when trying to enter the game? Are you able to sign into the Xbox app without any issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For testing purposes,&nbsp;can you install another game from Game Pass and see if it works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know this information and we'll see where to go next.</p>

    <title>Inability to Uninstall Windows.NET Framework 4.5 and Other Versions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> applesgonebloopie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inability to Uninstall Windows.NET Framework 4.5 and Other Versions</h2>
                    My current OS is Windows 8.1 64-bit.<br />
<br />
Recently I have been coming across a Windows error that states this: "The application was unable to start correctly (0cx0000135). Click OK to close the application." This error occurs for a variety of applications, such as GeForce Experience.<br />
<br />
Another error that has occured is the inability for any application to start up at all. While 0cx0000135 error wasn't happening too often, this error of a program telling me that it is about to start then not doing anything is popping up fairly often, like
 for XSplit. I have XSplit on my taskbar and I click it and it begins to start up, but then it suddenly just stops. And this has been going on for MANY applications.<br />
<br />
I'm not getting any errors with my system aside from those two, and everything that I have looked up about the application error leads me to believe that my Windows.NET is not functioning properly. Many sites recommend un-installing it and then re-installing
 it, which I have found myself incapable of doing because it doesn't appear in the "Programs and Features" part of my "Control Panel". I've tried deleting the files of c:/Windows/Microsoft.NET and that didn't work because many of those files could only be modified
 by the "TrustedInstaller", even after attempts to change the capabilities of the users.<br />
<br />
Also, I believe that I have version 4.0 or version 4.5 at the latest (even though I honestly can't tell), but when I attempt to download 4.5.1, it tells me that I can't, even though I believe that I do not have version 4.5.1.<br />
<br />
So I would like to know what I can do to uninstall the program safely and then re-install it.<br />

            <blockquote><br />
<p>After all this I am still running into issues even though I thought everything was fixed and I've tried most everything I have found, though not everything. All I can say is that I've pretty much come up with the fact that it is the .NET Framework that comes
 with my OS that is malfunctional. I ran the methods listed here as well: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982 on top of doing everything that was listed in this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am still left with the question if there is any definite way I can un-install my current Framework from my OS even though it came with Windows 8. Or perhaps there are some Windows 8.1 clean-up tools that are available or something like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed to get a few things working, though, and I made sure that I fixed that
<strong>CNBJ2530.DPB" of prncacla.inf </strong>issue because the sfc/ scannow command tells me that there are no issues, but I did not make another text document to see the results. One thing I got working was GeForce Experience all though it doesn't run as
 fast as it should. I start it up and it takes 20+ seconds to start, followed by a " unable to connect to nvidia try again later" message, followed by the program starting up. But I should be able to download drivers in the program and I can't because it keeps
 telling me to check internet connections, but I can download drivers from NVIDIA's site perfectly fine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is it a PC or a laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a laptop, you cannot uninstall 8.1 which would be the only way to remove .NET 4.5.1 since the latter is only installed when you upgrade to Microsoft's latest incarnation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I've just read that the<a href="http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57610729-285/how-to-uninstall-windows-8.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> 8.1 upgrade destroys the manufacturer's Recovery partition</a> so that you can no longer use it to revert to Windows 8.0
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a PC and you have an installation disc, then you can reinstall Windows 8.0 again , sort out your .NET problem&nbsp; and then upgrade to 8.1 again. The latter will include .NET 4.5.1 of course and might place you back in the same boat you find yourself
 in now.</p>

<h2>            Receiving &#34;error 0xc1900204&#34; when attempting to update Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am receiving an error message "error 0xc1900204" when attempting to update Windows 10 on my laptop. When I attempt to update, Windows states that updates are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;These are the updates:&nbsp;• Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3163017).</p>
<p>• Upgrade to Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I choose to install the updates, Windows will download and install the updates and then I'll choose to restart. When the computer restarts, I recieve the message that Windows is installing the updates, it restarts again and then says "We couldn't complete
 the updates. Undoing Changes." After this, it says the reason is "error 0xc1900204". My laptop keeps freezing on certain programs and this update is supposed to fix that but it just won't happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Home with an Nvidia GTX970M GPU, 16 GB of RAM, Intel Core i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz (64 bit) with a 120GB SSD and a 1TB HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thoughts?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The only options to purchase a app from Windows Store is using a Credit Card or PayPal. You cannot using a debit card for the purchase from Windows Store. You can refer to the following Microsoft
 article to buy games using PayPal account.</span></p>
<span>Edit payment method for the Windows Store and view billing history</span>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the<span>&nbsp;

<h2>            SFC Scan - currupted files - Windows 10 Pro on new Lenovo computer</h2>
                    <p>I have endured 6 months of computer issues (new computer) and finally Lenovo replaced my previous unit after a SFC scan reported loads of corrupted files &nbsp;immediately after their third repair.</p>
<p>I ran a SFC scan on the new Lenovo Yoga 260 right out of the box after installing updates, but before installing any programs. It reported hundreds of corrupt files and some that cannot be repaired. What's up with that?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I continued to install programs and recently it has had occasional issues with hanging up when shutting down and starting up. I worry that the nightmare is coming back.</p>

            <p>This is typical of a factory install which (like the Upgrade) is one of the worst installs of Windows one can suffer, the reason most tech enthusiasts would never run one in the first place.

            <p>I forgot to mention that I contacted BullGuard when the firewall would not turn on. Their technical support was super helpful. They scoured everything for the source of the erratic behavior. Finally they did an SFC scan and could not fix the corrupted files
 without the W-10 installation stick. That experience is what drove me to take it up with Lenovo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo sent a new SSHD and W-10 install stick for my Yoga 260. I installed the new drive, W-10 and updates being careful not to take on any bloatware. SFC scan results were still bad. So, I reinstalled the original SSHD (saved me from re-installing all my
 programs and settings) and contacted Microsoft technical support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their tech did her thing, which was to disable some start up items and other stuff that I did not take note of. She says it is normal to have some corrupted Windows files. It's been a few days and on one occasion I had a minor start up issue "...problem
 collecting information and needs to restart" and Outlook was not responding one time. Each time it restarted OK. I can live with those little glitches, but the previous new Yoga 12 started with little glitches and it got more serious over time.</p>

 not a child account, but the alternative account is a child account. Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Hey there CandieDie,</p>
<p>You're going to want to check a few things with this code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the region for the code matches the region for your Xbox Live account. If you need to change your region, see&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing/manage-payment-options/change-xbox-live-country-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change your Xbox Live country/region
 in your billing information</a>. </li><li>Check that the billing information for your Xbox Live account is correct. </li><li>The region in your Xbox Live billing information matches the country where you currently live.
</li><li>There's not an outstanding balance on your Xbox Live payment option. </li></ul>
<p>If you need to change the region for your Xbox Live account, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://account.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.xbox.com</a>&nbsp;and then click&nbsp;<b>Change my region</b>.</p>
<p>Also you need to make sure that you are in a supported Xbox Live region currently in order to redeem the code. The currency codes are region specific, so if you're not located in the region where the code was purchased, it may not work.</p>

    <title>How to make a formal complaint to Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to make a formal complaint to Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Here's my case. I pre-oredered the new surface pro on June 5th and if I'm correct the new one released on June 15th. Until June 19th I haven't received it yet(it keeps showing things are in process) and I contacted their expert. And then they said there's
 an error about my order in their end and they decided to escalate my order, and I need to wait for maximum 48 hours. Alright.... Then, my order even got canceled without any notification on June 21st and I contacted them again. And then, I got a similar answer
 and I was told to wait for the escalation team to deal with my case and I have to wait another 24~72 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is I paid already and my order got cancelled. I think it's simple that they just need to active my order again and make sure the shipping is fine. I feel like got played around and all the time I waiting for is unreasonable. How can I submit a
 formal complaint about this. I'm feeling really bad...</p>

<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be possible that the device is malfunctioning. <span>Generally, adapters emit some heat as a normal part of its operation. An internal temperature sensor will shut the device off if it becomes too hot.&nbsp;</span>

<h2>            default gateway keeps dropping</h2>
                    hello, My internet keeps randomly dropping. The troubleshooter says that my default Gateway is unavailable; So I checked my modem and all the lights are on so it's not the modem(additionally I also checked the wifi with my laptop and it works perfectly
 fine). I reset the modem but to no avail. The random Disconnects continue. I did a DNS flush hoping it would help but sadly it did not. Sometimes when the troubleshooter wants to reset my network adapter it is unable to and so am I when I try to do it manually,
 it goes through the steps no error message just says "Enabled" and then nothing happens. Additionally when the connection disconnects I have limited network access. Hopefully someone can help me or should I contact my ISP?

            Resolved this issue!<br />
<br />
- Probable cause? upgrading to Windows 8.1 corrupted(?) my network adapter's driver.<br />
<br />
Solution? Re installed my network adapters driver
<div>(uninstall the driver through device management and re install the driver that's all there is to it)<br />
<br />
After that this issue (and a lot of other issues resolved themselves).</div>

<p><br />
Consulting your User manual?&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW on my TouchSmart there is a physical switch above the Touch pad which disables it and then a light goes from white to orange.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some users apparently don't have a physical switch any more but do have a Function key which accomplishes the same toggle.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Another way of disabling the Touch pad of course is to use the Device Manager and do it there.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, that is what my physical switch is apparently tied to, so in effect it is just a convenient way of disabling the Touch pad without going into the Device
 Manager to do it.</p>

</p><p>I have recently been having several problems with my Surface 3, when i want to charge my surface 3. I connect it to the power source in the wall and then plug the cable into the surface and it says plugged in not charging. i have been online and seen there
 are many problems about this and have tried EVERYTHING they have recommended. I have also tried to Uninstall the

<p>

            I also have this same issue and none of the recommendations from Microsoft work. &nbsp;The battery is complete dead and needs to be replaced. &nbsp;What makes me mad is I broke my screen on my original pro 3 during the warranty period, so a refurb was sent to me.
 &nbsp;Within 90 days and of course after the warranty expired my battery failed and now Microsoft wants me to pay $599 to replace it for a known issue is pretty ridiculous. &nbsp;It’s basically a paper weight now and only works with AC power. &nbsp;Microsoft needs to get
 to the bottom of this issue. &nbsp;This issue is not firmware related.

            Hi, I have been having this issue ever since I bought my Surface 3. needless to say how frustrating and annoying it has been. It got to the point when it wouldn't charge whatsoever. It was still under warranty, but I bought the thing abroad so instead
 of returning I tried to figure out another way to make it work. One day I tried to charge it with my aunt's Lenovo tablet charger and to my surprise, it charged all right! It has been couple of months since I am using that Lenovo charger with my Surface 3
 and not once have I experienced the "plugged in, not charging" problem. So I suspect the problem has to do with the original charger. However, with 4 other chargers by different brands that I have tried, it will not work - it will not detect other chargers
 at all, so I was just lucky I suppose... I just cannot believe Microsoft could release this Surface line with such a serious bug. After i solved this, my Surface pen stopped working, and so far I have failed to find a solution.&nbsp; I am not b
