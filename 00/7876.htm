<h2>            HOW MANY EMAIL SCREEN CHOICES &#38; OPTIONS ARE THERE&#63;</h2>
                    <div>to answer this simple question you only need to say a single digit number. &nbsp;can anyone do that? &nbsp;will anyone try to give a number answer?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
this is the screen shot that i want to have... that i had last week
<div>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/make-changes-to-the-reading-preview-pane-HA010118503.aspx</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>it includes columns that lists my inbox, sent mail, trash, contacts. &nbsp;it allows me to change the font and color, size, bold and underline.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>if i type a single letter in the "to" box it will suggest which email addresses from the contacts and show their email addresses. &nbsp;now that i don't have that i can't email people that i don't have their address memorized any more.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>can someone contact the people who created outlook (or give me the contact information) and ask them how many email viewer screen options there are?</div>
<div>what they're called? &nbsp;ie: basic, classic, traditional, etc...</div>
<div>and how to select which screen we want to use?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>all i have now is just basic and simple and i can't do much. &nbsp;it's extremely frustrating. &nbsp;i need the creativity back.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>can anybody answer these questions without asking me what my screen looks like. &nbsp;i've described it over and over and over and over. &nbsp;it's NOT what the screen looks like in the link that i provided. &nbsp;i used to have that screen last week... and now it's
 gone. &nbsp;i did nothing to make this switch happen... nothing that i know of or understand, but i &nbsp;would like to know how to get THAT screen back.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>please somebody help me. &nbsp;i don't know how i can explain it any more clear.</div>
                </div>

            The screen shot in the link you provided has the reading pane on the right.&nbsp; Assuming you are using outlook 2010:<br />
<ol>
<li>Click the View ribbon</li><li>In the Layout group towards the right side:</li><li>Click Navigation pane - select "normal".&nbsp; That should bring the left most pane back showing your email inbox, trash etc.&nbsp; At the very bottom of the navigation pane, make sure you have "Mail" selected to see all of your mail folders.<br />
</li><li>Click Reading pane - select "right" to show the reading pane on the right side.&nbsp; This allow you to read your email without having to double click to open each email message.<br />
</li><li>Select To-do pane and select minimized to leave the to do pane as a small list.</li></ol>
<p>As a friendly word of advice - calling people who are asking for help from "stupid" is not likely to get you answers quickly.&nbsp; I understand you are frustrated, but the people who are helping you are volunteers who are answering questions such as yours without
 pay and frequently without thanks.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The "Notify" me requires that you provided a working email address when you set up your profile. Good luck.<br />

<h2>            IE 11, Microsoft Update Catalog showing blank screen - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hey hopefully someone may be able to help me with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have been trying to access the Microsoft Update Catalog website, but have been unable to access it properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I received a message saying that I need to use a more recent version of internet explorer than 6.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running windows 10 and it comes with IE 11 so not sure what the issue is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hear that Microsoft Update Catalog uses ActiveX, so there could be some compatibility issue going on but that's a stab in the dark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I might add that Internet Explorer seems to be pretty slow. Not necessarily in loading pages, but when typing into search bars, or here for example. I doubt that this is normal for regular users because its really irritating.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;happening&nbsp;on
 Chrome, Firefox or Edge.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Rory,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you are experiencing performance issues with Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to the issue with Microsoft Update Catalog, I would like to know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>1. Did you add the particular website to the <strong>Trusted Sites</strong> list, and see if it helps?</p>
<p>2. Did you check if the issue is with a particular website?</p>
<p>3. Did you check if the&nbsp;date and time settings on your PC is correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I would suggest you try to&nbsp;open the same using Internet Explorer in Compatibility view mode.</p>
<p>Ref: <span><span><strong>Fix site display problems with Compatibility View</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-11</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, also try to launch the website in a no add-on mode to check if some incompatible IE add-ons could be a reason.</p>
<p>Ref: <span><span><strong>Manage Add-ons in Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in order to fix issues with Internet Explorer performance, please follow the below recommended methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to run the Windows in built troubleshooter: </span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
tab<strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>view all</strong> option on the upper left corner.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the&nbsp;<strong>Internet Explorer performance&nbsp;</strong>option from the list.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to run the<strong> </strong>Troubleshooter.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Teams Your Call Has Dropped. Please try again.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to test Microsoft teams for a home-office environment, and I can't seem to be able to start a meeting, either scheduled or meet now. &nbsp;The meeting will come up, but then at about 18 seconds in, I get kicked out with the error "oh dear! Your call
 has dropped. Please try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I've added the teams executable as an open exception to my personal firewall (update.exe located in AppData/local/Microsoft/teams). &nbsp;I do have a router firewall, but I haven't found if there are any ports I need to forward for Teams to get through
 my router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype Business seems to be working just fine for me.</p>

<h2>            How to change header and footer text in multiple excel spreadsheet files at the same time.</h2>
                    <p>Occasionally I need to change the text in the header of multiple files from one thing to another.&nbsp; &nbsp; I know how to do this&nbsp;for multiple workSHEETs but I&nbsp;need to do this for multiple WorkBOOKs.&nbsp; When I need to do this, the value that&nbsp;I am changing to, is
 always the same for all of the files involved.&nbsp; I'm looking for something like you can do with the print command when you highlight several file3s in Windows explorer and then right click and select print only to change&nbsp;a header value.&nbsp;

            <p>It can be done, with a 1-liner in the Immediate pane of VBA. Have all the workbooks you want to "inherit" the page setup open, run this 1-liner:</p>
<p>application.Dialogs(xlDialogWorkgroup).Show</p>
<p>Pick the ones you want from this dialog, then activate the worksheet with the desired page setups, this visit Page Setup and just click OK.</p>
<p>Make sure you deselect the "group" when you're done.</p>

    <title>Unable to remove search criteria from advanced search fields - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to remove search criteria from advanced search fields</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've Office 2016 running on Windows 10. Since a few days ago, I've an issue where I cannot remove search criteria from the advanced search fields. Here is a screenshot of the Advanced search fields within my inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90e23bea-bb54-42ec-9a8d-30c26cc246d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90e23bea-bb54-42ec-9a8d-30c26cc246d2" /></a></p>
<p>When I add something to an advanced search field, I'm unable to delete the word (e.g. - the word "Test" in the screenshot above) if I want to search for something else. The only way I can delete the word is by clicking the x and adding the field again or
 by restarting Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p />

<h2>            Nokia 2100 OUTBOX not working.</h2>
                    If you all are wondering why am I using this phone, I got pickpocketed. My 2100 is pretty new bcuz I only use it as a backup phone. Today I realized that the Outbox in text messaging isn't recording my outgoing messages. How can I change that?

            Okay... have you tried running Font Book.app (its in your Applications folder) and using the File &gt; Validate Fonts function to see what it shows about any conflicts? If there are conflicts they must be resolved and then your system has to be shutdown and
 restarted for any changes you make to take effect.

            <p>Yeah. I've tried the following:</p>
<p>-font book/font conflicts</p>
<p>-deactivated and reactivated the font</p>
<p>-deleted and reinstalled the font</p>
<p>-reboot</p>
<p>-safe reboot</p>
<p>By the way, in PowerPoint, Excel (or Pages) there is not problem.<br />

<p>That was going to be my next suggestion, so I'm glad to see that you went ahead and did that. You've got to get that Thesis done! :-)</p>

</p><p>If you could stand it, I'd appreciate it if you sent a note into Microsoft about this issue and I'll do the same. Use the Smiley Face control on the ribbon, change it to a Frown and tell them about this problem with the 15.14.0 version.</p>

            This is a long-standing bug in Office 2016, I really don't get why it hasn't been fixed by now. Yes, third party fonts will confuse bold and regular, sometimes even italic and regular. It's a mess.

            That's true. And what was even confusing, that all the MS support persons that I was calling, were incredibly unfriendly and were acting like using third party fonts is the most uncommon and exotic thing that you can do in Word.

    <title>OneDrive Autodelete &#38; Conflicting Views - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donaldworthington  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive Autodelete &#38; Conflicting Views</h2>
                    <p>I have 1TB of OneDrive storage, but I've never used more than 15GB. &nbsp;I've got several devices and equipment types all accessing OneDrive, including tablets, notebooks, Android phones and devices and iPhones and iPads. &nbsp;My main deskside PC is running Windows10,
 and I've had the "Skydrive" client installed on it through various upgrades in software and hardware since 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is a re-occurrence of a problem I first encountered just over a year ago. &nbsp;At that time, I decided to upload to OneDrive a collection of digitized family heirloom photographs, for storage security and safety, but also for access from my various
 devices. &nbsp;After the files were uploaded and verified, and stable for a month or two, I ventured back in to the collection to access some of the files, only to discover they WERE ALL MISSING! &nbsp;I certainly didn't delete them, and what was strange about it was
 that the directory structure was still there - only the actual target files were gone. Frankly, I don't even know a Windows command that will do that, and can only imagine writing a script or program that might. &nbsp;I didn't report this, only fumed about it,
 as the photos were gone, and I do have another archive of the collection burred somewhere deep in offline storage, and I don't access them often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, at 10:00 AM PDT, the same thing happened again - but this time MUCH more disastrously, with very important and active business files. While I was in a meeting, OneDrive auto-deleted 1,146 files of various types. &nbsp;Again, just like the photos, most
 of these files had been placed in OneDrive over the past month or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's where it starts to get more and more strange. &nbsp;Yesterday, sometime after the fact, I got an email from "OneDrive" saying that a large number of files had been deleted, and that they would be retained in the Recycle Bin (RBin) for 30 days. &nbsp;When I
 looked at the RBin with the OneDrive Windows Client, it was empty. &nbsp;When I looked at it again, it was populated - not ONLY with the files that had been deleted, but ALSO with (most of?) the long-missing Photos. &nbsp;When I looked at OneDrive from the Website,
 I saw similar - but not identical - things. I spent several hours with both of these access methods, trying various ways to "restore" or undelete in some way, these many files. &nbsp;All the while, File Explorer, which I historically use most to manage my OneDrive
 storage and files, is stuck for hours somewhere in the midst of "syncing" files at "0 KB per sec", and showing that all these "restored" files are still missing. &nbsp;But now, the website shows some of them back in the locations and some still in RBin, the Windows
 client shows a different set in their locations and a different set in RBin, File Explorer is still just not reporting them at all. &nbsp;It takes an hour just to display all the files in the Windows client and another hour to select them, and trying to restore
 them results in the client closing (abend). &nbsp;The website fails, using 4 different browsers, to display them all (but it will display isolated small groups of them) and fails with band select to select much, and then just blanks out the contents, and says the
 RBin is empty. &nbsp;But if I go look at the non-deleted files, and then back to the RBin, its populated again, and nothing has been restored - except that sometimes, I get a few errors saying a file already exists, and so cannot be restored. In fact, one large
 PDF I have of a training manual has THREE copies of it in the RBin - but that's just one example from literally THOUSANDS, and it's easy to spot because of its doctype and size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm trying to download all this stuff off of OneDrive - you can bet I don't trust ANYTHING it's saying now. &nbsp;File Explorer still shows everything missing, the other devices more or less agree with either the website or the client - but I can't figure
 out what the truth is. &nbsp;The downloads of the files seem to have gone all right - if all the files are actually there to be downloaded at all, but the PHOTOS are throwing up all sorts of roadblocks - no way to select them all, downloads are "restricted to 100
 items," (I have several hundreds), etc. etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found OneDrive to be a great convenience, but this is NOT convenient, and if my files should be non-recoverable, I'm going to be even more incensed. Frankly at this point, I just want to get everything OFF OneDrive, and then maybe - MAYBE - I'll look
 into gingerly putting a few things back up there, after I blow away and de-install everything and re-install it. &nbsp;But I don't know what the truth is, and which access method is failing at what. &nbsp;Meanwhile, my 30 day RBin delete timer is ticking down - and
 I want and need these files.</p>

<p>Hi Dworthington,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, the files which are stored in OneDrive are missing after one or two months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to reset OneDrive to see if it helps:</p>
<p>1.<span style="font-weight: bold">Windows key + R</span>&nbsp;to open the Run Window.</p>
<p>2.enter:
<p>3.Click OK.&nbsp; The OneDrive system tray icon on the desktop should disappear and re-appear after a minute or two.</p>
<p>4.enter:<span style="font-weight: bold"> %localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe</span>&nbsp;and hit enter.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Here is an article for your reference:
</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-OneDrive-sync-problems-83ab0d8a-8400-45b0-8dcf-dc8aa8a6bcf8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix OneDrive sync problems</a></p>
<p>If above doesn't help, I'd like to confirm the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p><span>1.Where are the files
</span><span>stored online? OneDrive for Business in Office 365 or personal OneDrive?</span></p>
<p>2.The detailed version of OneDrive client. You can check it via right clicking OneDrive icon in the task bar&gt;Settings&gt;About</p>
<p>3.Where did you find the files were missing? Local OneDrive sync folder or OneDrive online?</p>
<p>4.For "I ventured back in to the collection to access some of the files, only to discover they WERE ALL MISSING! &nbsp;I certainly didn't delete them, and what was strange about it was that the directory
 structure was still there - only the actual target files were gone"</p>
<p>Please provide related screenshot to describe it.</p>

<h2>            Consolidating Office 365 accounts</h2>
                    <p>Ok, when I first got my Office 365 subscription it was a case of 4 people using 6 systems meaning with the 5 device limit my father needed an indivual subscription.&nbsp; And of course not checking the backend that often it's only now that I've noticed that Office
 365 has changed it's rules so there's no longer the total device limit, meaning it would make sense to cancel my father's subscription and cover his account with a now free share in my family subscription.</p>
<p>But I'm always cautions with any changes so what's the correct procedure and are the any possible snags I should keep in mind.</p>

            Hi BrendanKOD
<br />
<br />You are correct, since 2 October, the rules with Office 365 Home have changed, you can install on any amount of devices, Office will work on those devices as long as no more than 5 are active at the same time . . .
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Your father needs to close his subscription to Office:
<br />Go to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/services</a> and log in
<br />Find the subscription and select Payment &amp; billing - Cancel
<br />Select Confirm cancellation. Check your inbox for a confirmation email
<br />
<br />2. 
<br />Uninstall his current version of Office totally:
<br />Use this tool from Microsoft to remove all remnants of a previous Office Installation:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />Restart the PC
<br />
<br />3. 
<br />You can then send an invitation to your father via Email or a one-time installation link for him to share your Office licence
<br />
<br />Full details to share can be found here:

            <p>So I don't think there is a way to use one of the sms backup options and be able to restore them to a different device. I think it is something that you will have to try with some the programs in the store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>This program (<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/contacts-message-backup/9nblgggz57gm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contacts+message backup</a></strong>) does the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: To use this app, please go to Settings on your Windows Phone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This app will NOT appear in your list of installed apps. Contacts + Message Backup app is a Settings app that enables you to make backup of all your contacts (in VCF format) and messages (SMS &amp; MMS including attachments) to SD card (in XML format) for later
 restore to same or another Windows Phone. Backup is stored in 'backup+restore' folder on the SD card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Known Issue: Restoring a backup of messages from a dual SIM Windows Phone restores all messages to message store for the first SIM/slot.</p>

<p>Hi Wendysefert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was once an issue that users were not able to login to Skype for Business.

                    I finally made the once inconceivable jump from GMail to Outlook. So far I've been recommending it to everyone. There's one issue that will probably send me back to Gmail. I have setup several SMTP emails to send and receive from.<br />
<br />
BUT, everytime I send "From" an SMTP address, there's a "Reply-To" in the email that makes responses come back to the outlook email or an alternate. I dont want that. I want the response/"Reply-To" to come back to the same "From" email.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
outlook email is: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
smtp emails:&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
<br />
When I send an email from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, I want the response to come back to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
<br />
Pleas do not suggest that I make "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" the reply to address because then it won't work when I use the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** SMTP email.<br />
<br />
This seems like an ill-though requirement to force a reply to. It needs a "Use the From Address" as an additional option.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm happy to address your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that if you've used an SMTP address to send an email and&nbsp;if&nbsp;the recipient will reply,&nbsp;the recipient will be replying&nbsp;to your SMTP address not to your Outlook address if you're using your
<strong>Current email address</strong> on the <strong>Reply-to address</strong> settings of your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you've set up <strong>another&nbsp;email address</strong> in&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>Reply-to address</strong> settings and when you send an email using your SMTP address, the recipient will be replying to the
<strong>other&nbsp;email address</strong> instead of the SMTP address that you've used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have any other questions or concerns, please let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>By removing a single <strong>?</strong> from the regex,&nbsp;we can make it the last five-character string (described as above&nbsp; [xn]nnnn&nbsp;&nbsp; that is followed by a six-digit string (the date).&nbsp; And that should work well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a few other modifications so as to allow for better formatting.&nbsp; If there are any lines in the original data that do not parse properly, they will be omitted from the results and flagged by turning the font bold/red.&nbsp; This also assumes that the baseline
 font for the source data is black and not bold.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In doing some of that testing, I realized that if, for example, the Quantity was missing, the line would parse and be incorrect.&nbsp; So I altered the Price definition to require</p>
<ul>
<li>sequence of digits</li><li>single space</li><li>two more digits</li><li>word boundary</li></ul>
<p>If your pricing might not be&nbsp;&nbsp; in that format, let me know.</p>

<p><span>To clarify, you're able to play videos from other mobile websites aside from YouTube, is that right</span><span>? When did this issue actually start to happen? Are you using a downloaded YouTube&nbsp;player app, or the Internet Explorer&nbsp;mobile

            Poochini21, I had a similar problem, but mine included all videos. The YouTube website does not work, metrotube doesn't work, even if I downloaded the video, it still doesn't work. Also If I take a video on my phone, it will not play. Centro it any time
 that plays videos will not work. Please advise on this

            Hi. I bought a nokia lumia 520 about a month ago and it has refused to play over 90% of my videos (copied from my windows 8 laptop and those from my nokia 108 phone). I dont know why. Again, pictures get corrupted just a few minutes after taking them with
 the phone. Could it be with the memory card or a virus (though I read somewhere that lumias do not need antivirus. True?!). The pictures do replicate atimes. Thanks.<br />

 Are you getting any error messages? Does this happen regardless of the internet connection you are using? Btw, are you trying to play videos from the web browser or through a downloaded application from the Store? Make sure you have a stable connection, check
 if you'll be able to browse the web. Switch between data connection and WiFi to isolate what's causing the issue.</span></p>

            Hi M_ZERK, Windows 10 now contains a full and competent Security Suite . . .
<br />
<br />Windows Defender has, over the last few years become a fully featured Security solution 
<br />
<br />It is on a par with paid for Anti-virus software, the virus definitions are updated regularly, it will not slow our PC down, works well with Edge and it is Free 
<br />
<br />Honestly, you do not need more protection than Defender can supply . ..
<br />
<br />McAfee is a real annoyance, will slow down your PC and is even harder to remove, McAfee provide a special tool to remove their software from your PC - click the link below:

            Windows Defender has come a long way from the days of Microsoft Security Essentials. 
<br />
<br />It includes a decent Antivirus scanner thats more robust and uses heuristics and the cloud to detect and remove malicious code. 
<br />
<br />There is also a built in offline scanner you can use to scan Windows outside of the installation.
<br />
<br />Windows Defender also includes a Firewall, Network Security and protections again newer types of attacks such as Ransomware. 
<br />
<br />So, its pretty robust, especially when combined with other security features such as Windows Smart Screen Filter. I think when used with a Standard User Account, some common sense - don't just download software from suspicious websites or open strange emails with attachments. 
<br />
<br />Also, keep a regular backup of your computer, system restore points; you really can't go wrong. 
<br />
<br />You can also supplement it with third party solutions such as the ESET Sysrescue offline scanner and Malwarebytes. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/clean-virus-infected-windows-10-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/clean-virus-in...</a>
<br />
<br />You can remove McAfee by clicking Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down, select McAfee
<br />Click uninstall
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br /> Download and run the McAfee Consumer Product Removal tool (MCPR)
<br />You must only use the MCPR tool if the Windows removal methods shown above do not work.
<br />IMPORTANT:
<br />
<br />    Always download a new copy of MCPR before each use.  
<br />    This ensures that you have the latest version, and that newer McAfee products can be successfully recognized.
<br />    MCPR cleans up only the components needed for reinstallation. It is not designed to clean up 100% of components.
<br />    Completing this step requires a restart.
<br />
<br />Before you start:
<br />
<br />    Bookmark or favorite this article so that you can easily get back to it.
<br />    Save all open files.
<br />    Close all programs.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />    Download the MCPR tool.
<br /><a href="http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcpr.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcp...</a>
<br />
<br />    Double-click MCPR.exe.
<br />    If you see a security warning:
<br />
<br />    Click Yes, Continue, or Run (depending on your version of Windows):
<br />     
<br />    At the McAfee Software Removal screen:
<br />        Click Next. 
<br />        Click Agree to accept the End User License Agreement (EULA).
<br />         
<br />    At the Security Validation screen:
<br />        Type the characters exactly as shown on your screen. Validation is case-sensitive.
<br />        Click Next. This step prevents the accidental use of MCPR.
<br />
<br />        
<br />    When the process is complete, you see one of the following messages. Click the one that you see.

 phone? It's annoying as I can't use some of the apps I usually use as are not supported anymore by windows 8.1.</p>

<h2>            Cannot see drop down list or arrow</h2>
                    <p>Just started using Excel 2010 from 2003.&nbsp; I created a dropdown list using data validation.&nbsp; On one worksheet,&nbsp;I can create the list but&nbsp;I am unable to view the list when I click on the cell where the list is to appear.&nbsp; On other sheets I am able to create
 lists and view the drop down.&nbsp; Can't figure it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

</p><blockquote>hi joydeep sir still&nbsp; it didn't solve after running scans.
</blockquote>
<p>I suggest you to use Windows Defender Offline in Safe mode and remove the virus and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender Offline is a stand-alone tool that comes preloaded with the latest antimalware updates. It works outside of Windows, which means it can catch and clean infections that hide themselves when Windows is running.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go to another PC that isn‚Äôt infected and download <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows Defender Offline</span></a>.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>Insert a blank USB flash drive or CD into the PC, and then run the Windows Defender Offline file that you just downloaded.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You will be prompted to install Windows Defender Offline to the blank USB flash drive or CD.</p>
</li><li>
<p>After you‚Äôve installed Windows Defender Offline onto the USB flash drive or CD, insert it into your infected PC and
<strong>restart in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The following articles may help if you're having trouble getting the tool to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-defender-offline-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows Defender Offline: frequently asked questions</span></a></strong></p>
</li><li>
<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/security/archive/2012/09/19/microsoft-s-free-security-tools-windows-defender-offline.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Microsoft's Free Security Tools - Windows Defender Offline</span></a></strong></p>
</li></ul>
<p>After you've used Windows Defender Offline, you should make sure your security software is up to date and run a full scan:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/adl.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Get the latest updates</span></a></strong></p>
</li></ul>
<p>Even if we've already detected and removed this particular threat, running a full scan might find other malware that is hiding on your PC.

<p>"Your AutoCorrect file, \MSO2057.acl, could not be saved. The file may be read-only, or you may not have permission to modify the file." I tried to follow the earlier answer to this type of error for Office 2007

<p>Here I see only these tabs "Auto Correct, Math Autocorrect, AutoFormat As you type, AutoFormat and Action"</p>

            <p>Repeating my previous post:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the Office folder truly does not exist, try repairing Office as described at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>There I was referring to the Office folder&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">at "C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft". The one under the Local path is
<strong>not </strong>where the ACL files belong.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">There should also be a set of MSO.ACL files in one or more numbered folders (one per installed language) in one of these paths:</span></p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office 2013\Office15</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 2013\Office15</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office15</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which one of these is correct depends on whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows, and whether you have an Office 365 (Click-To-Run) version of Office 2013 or a local (MSI-based, probably Volume License) Office 2013. If you find that file, it's the one
 deposited on the drive by the installer; from there it should be copied by the installer to the folder under AppData\Roaming\Microsoft. When you add AutoCorrect entries, they're added only to the one&nbsp;under AppData\Roaming\Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
