    <title>Microsoft lifechat LX-6000 USB headset answer button doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashleycm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft lifechat LX-6000 USB headset answer button doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    Running XP Prof SP3 (hopefully soon taking WIN7 :-) )<br />
<br />
Lifechat LX-6000 works flawlessly, and has worked perfectly with Lync, however when using Cisco IP Communicator (8.6.1 or 8.6.1.4) the answer button on the headset doesn't work (works fine in Lync automatically).<br />
<br />
I guess there is some registry setting for this so that the answer button works from the CISCO IP Communicator??<br />
<br />
(at least according to <br />
http://www.techpowerup.com/forums/showthread.php?t=150345<br />
and similarly for the camera<br />
http://kyleabaker.com/2009/10/19/lifecam-vx-1000-live-call-button-hack/<br />
)<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yeah I read those CISCO pages already, and the FAQ.&nbsp; Those are written for hmmm how should I say this - regular users, and particularly don't provide any real detailed useful info.</p>
<p>I know that the headset is not "officially" supported by CISCO (not on their officially supported headsets list), but I really like the comfort, sound quality, and seriously no issues that I have with the headset in general.&nbsp; It just works well.</p>
<p>I've tried a lot of other different USB headsets, I won't name the manufacturers but around 10 different models and manufacturers and seriously the LX-6000 is great.</p>
<p>Only thing that I would like to solve is the answer button doesn't do anything.&nbsp; I've uninstalled Lync and now the button doesn't open any application at all.&nbsp; The answer button lights up when pressed but nothing happens with any application.</p>
<p>I'd like to point the activity of this button to a certain application (in this case CISCO IP Communicator).</p>
<p>I'm system admin for a small company (roughly 17,000 users globally) and if we decide to use this headset globally I need to know that this works.&nbsp; We have some hundred "pilot" users currently and this has been their only complaint.</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

                    Hello anyone who can help me.<br />
I have tried contacting the Twitter XboxSupport and I waited 4 days for "MatrixGlitch" to tell me to "request callback" after I observed and pointed out they were way more ready to help anyone with Halo 4 problems.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that link didn't bring me to a "request a callback" option anywhere. I did find this community option. Here is the twitter DM I sent to XboxSupport. Please, if anyone can help me, I need it. Thank you<br />

<p>Running two browsers simultaneously might not make much sense but having two browsers installed is a good idea because some web pages work well with one browser and poorly with another browser.</p>

<p>Now you mention, I do recall some sites requiring IE in the past (had to re-enable IE several times), but I thought that was... in the past.<br />
And there was/is the Flash player issue too. Firefox was very stroppy about Adobe's security a year or more ago.</p>

    <title>AC2 possible game-killing glitch &#40;possible spoilers&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benseac  say:</h3>
<h2>            AC2 possible game-killing glitch &#40;possible spoilers&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>No AC2 forum yet so forgive me for posting this in this forum. In AC2 I started sequence 14, where you go to Rome, kill the pope, etc. However, I seem to have run into a glitch that has effectively killed my game and was wondering if anyone else has heard
 of this.</p>
<p>I start off sequence 14 on the little dock area and begin my ascent up a building. On the landing this path leads to, there should be some guards that need dispatching and a lever with needs to be activated. This lever then opens the door next to it, allowing
 you to continue on. However, when I get to the landing, there are no guards whatsoever and the lever I need to flip to get through the door cannot be interacted with. No music is playing, either. In other words, I can't continue on because there's no way past
 the first door.</p>
<p>I got all of the codex pages, did the thing where I looked at the via eagle vision and arranged them to create the map of the earth. I then put the apple of eden into the pedestal thing, which shot the assassin's creed logo on the map. I then talked to Mario
 and arranged the trip to Rome. I also completed the first DLC (sequence 12) and about half of the seconds DLC (sequence 13). Collection-wise, the only things I was missing were 60-ish feathers and two weapons. So, I don't think I was really missing anything,
 unless it doesn't like the fact that I didn't finish the second DLC and, if that's the case, it should either give a warning or not let you continue on to Rome.</p>
<p>Anyone else heard of this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nope, didn't get that far into AC2 before I got my own game-killing glitch. As soon as I got to Forli it gave me the error that my storage device was removed, and the next time I went into the game my save file was gone. Tried to restart from scratch, got
 the same error around memory sequence 3 and that was all she wrote, I traded the game in and watched the rest of the game I missed on YouTube.</p>
<p>Hoping I don't get the same issue in AC:B</p>

    <title>I cannot set up cortana - stuck at voice language setting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I cannot set up cortana - stuck at voice language setting</h2>
                    I cannot set up cortana after installing windows 10. It says that I need to go to settings and change the language to one it can speak, but when I press the settings button I find that it is set to US English - which is the only option, so I can't change
 it. Anyone have any idea what's going on?

<li><span>What happens when you type in something &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the search box instead of using voice commands on Cortana?</span></li><li><span>Have you tried setting up a test &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reminder and check if Cortana responds back to you?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; As a suggestion you can change the installed Windows Display Language by switching back to the original language installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hello Anup,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can type requests to Cortana OK - it is just the speech part that I cannot complete the setup for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I have no problem setting the other language settings. It is only the speech setting that there appears to only be one valid setting for (US English). I don't mind using this value - the problem is that this is where my Cortana setup stalls (as described
 before)</p>

            <p>I got it working shortly before Trevor Stephen's first post by essentially following the steps suggested by RichardJW:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The non-obvious solution seems to be</em></p>
<p><em>- Go to Settings: Region &amp; langage</em></p>
<p><em>- Under languages "English (United Kingdom)" is shown</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;click on it</em></p>
<p><em>- 3 boxes then become visible, click on Options</em></p>
<p><em>- select download</em></p>
<p><em>after a longish time English (United Kingdom) will be installed and Cortana will work</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed every optional component. Each one seems to take forever, with no indication it was still doing anything, so I rebooted a couple of times, and this seemed to refresh the status.

    <title>Open File Location doesn&#39;t work from any shortcut .lnk file - gets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philnickell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open File Location doesn&#39;t work from any shortcut .lnk file - gets no associated program error. Win 7 pro x64</h2>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold">The problem:</span><br />
<br />
I right-click any shortcut icon on the desktop, choose "open file location" from the context menu, and receive an error dialog from windows explorer:<br />
<br />
"This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel."<br />
<br />
The error also happens if I choose "properties" from the shortcut's context menu, then click the "open file location" button on the properties window.<br />
<br />
After dismissing the error dialog, I get a "blue swirly busy" for about 10 seconds, and If I click "cancel" on the properties windows it won't close until that 10 seconds is elapsed. This doesn't seem to take much in the way of cpu cycles, and the machine stays
 responsive otherwise.<br />
<br />
The error happens on any shortcut, in any folder, whether or not is is on the desktop. Usually, however, if the shortcut is in a non-desktop folder, the error does not occur from the shortcut context menu but still occurs from the shortcuts propery window.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">What I've done so far:</span><br />
<br />
Users are administrators.<br />
The error happens in <span style="font-weight: bold">SAFE MODE</span> with no networking.<br />
The error occurs when logged on as a different user.<br />
Created a new user, logged on as that user, and the still error occurs as described.<br />
The error occurs if I launch windows explorer elevated as admin, browse to a shortcut and open the shortcut's property windows and click the "open file location" button.<br />
<br />
Ran system file checker "SFC /verifyonly" and it reported no issues.<br />
<br />
Visited the WinHelpOnline blog, downloaded the Win-7 registry fix file for .LNK files and applied it.<br />
result: not fixed<br />
<br />
Examined, in great detail, the registry entries for the hkey_classes_root ".lnk" and "lnkfile" keys, including the shellex context menu handlers and property sheet handlers, and even compared them to another machine running Win-7-home premium, and all seems
 correct. <br />
<br />
No other programs seem to have co-opted, grabbed or set an association for .lnk or lnkfile, and control-panel/default-programs concurs, showing nothing associated with .lnk (as it should be).<br />
<br />
I have used the NirSoft SHEXVIEW.exe utility program to view system shell extensions for lnkfile, shortcuts and such, and all seems OK. For testing purposes I used that same utility to temporarily disable non-microsoft shell extensions, and the problem still
 occurs.<br />
<br />
I have run the Microsoft "fix-it" tools to clear and rebuild ShellIcon Cache, and the Bags/BagMRU folder customizations. All seems well there.<br />
<br />
Software environment includes Adobe Photoshop CS3, the latest versions of OpenOffice.org, VLC media player, Firefox, IE-9, Roxio Creator Starter, Adobe Reader X, and Mcafee Security center. Bonjour service was installed with CS3, but is now configured to not
 start. The machine is a Dell, and most of the Dell installed "extras" (Dell Stage, for example) have been uninstalled. Not running bitlocker, not using encrypted file system, not running 'XP' mode.<br />
<br />
I CAN go to a library folder, click "open folder location" from the context menu and it works ok.<br />
I CAN go to a search results item, click "open file location from the context menu and it works ok.<br />
&nbsp;(those two things are similar shell "open location" extensions, but for other file types, so it seems that shell32.dll is functioning correctly).<br />
<br />
The machine is up to date with all MS patches and updates.<br />
Everything else on the machine seems to be working flawlessly, and I don't intend to reload windows or restore an image to fix this one thing - especially since I don't know exactly when it started.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">COLOR ME MYSTIFIED</span>. I guess I'm looking in the wrong area, or missing something obvious. Suggestions for other things to peek at, or test? I'm all ears.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            OK! Found it! Fixed it.<br />
The problem turned out to be one simple item in the "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell" key definition within the Folder progid.<br />
<br />
The bad entry had a default value of "none" set for the Folder\shell key, and a working entry has either an empty (unset) default value or a null string default value. All of the other keys and values under the "Folder" progid remain the same and work correctly.
 I have proven the problem by setting and testing that default value back and forth. It's repeatable.<br />
<br />
BAD...<br />
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell]<br />
@="none"<br />
<br />
GOOD...<br />
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell]<br />
<br />
I thank all who replied and suggested fixes. The suggested fixes led me to the correct area(s) of the registry to examine. It would be nice to claim elegant troubleshooting methods, but it's not true - it was just looking, testing and poking until finally stumbled
 upon.<br />

            Hi, JerryCee 
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />When installing Windows 10, the digital license associates itself with your device's hardware. So, if you make significant changes, such as replacing your motherboard, Windows will no longer find a license that matches your computer.
<br />
<br />Here’s how to prepare Windows 10 for activation before you make any significant hardware changes. If you didn't prepare before the hardware change, we also provide the steps to help you reactivate Windows 10.
<br />Check these links, I hope it helps.

            Ah thanks, to do that you can press on a word to highlight it. &nbsp;Then some handles will appear under it so you can extend outward the selection to include more (sort of like smart phones).

            <p>Another question, about Outlook on windows 10. &nbsp;I can send emails from Outlook, but no emails can be received. &nbsp;When I configured the account, the following message was received "an encrypted connection to your mail server is not available". &nbsp;However, the
 configuration was completed with the microsoft email being sent. &nbsp;It was received on my old computer, but not the new surface where I was trying to set up Outlook.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The app might have removed accidently or due to some other issues. When you visit the Windows store app and search for the app, it will show that
 the app is already installed in the app description page, and will not show the ‘Install’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to click on install option it could mean that the app was removed from you PC. If it shows pending when you tried to install, it
 could be due to some corrupt app files that were left over by that app that could be causing the issue. It could also be due to a connection issue.</span></p>

 please let me know "yesterday"!&nbsp; I need these photos for my work and the alternative is not pretty.

            <p>Sure thing.&nbsp; I'm sure all of the ones you transferred are in the same spot, so here's what I'd do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Right-click any one of the pictures and choose "Open file Location" from the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you'll be looking at the picture where it really is, not a search result.&nbsp; So when/if you decide to drag it somewhere else it won't restart the search or anything on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>--</p>
<p>PS. Remember that computer hard drives do wear out over time, doing a Google or Bing search says that 80% of drives last about 4 years.&nbsp; So I would recommend always make sure you have a backup copy of any files you really care about, because you're (on average)
 just 4 or 5 years from having a drive die and need to be replaced.&nbsp;I simply store the files I care about inside "OneDrive" so they're online. If my house burned down and lost my computer, I could get all my files back at onedrive.com.&nbsp; But there's many options
 (and technically OneDrive isn't a 'backup' solution, but it's better than nothing.</p>

            I was unable to find one, I haven't looked for new drivers or anything recently but I've just been unplugging the receiver also. I couldn't find a good path for support either, using the link above just takes me in circles and I was never able to contact
 anyone.

<h2>            windows 8.1 vs windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 8.1 system in my computer.&nbsp; I am trying to instal the Windows Media ,Player 11.0.5721.5262 and by you created blockage, my computer system is responding that a newer application of Windows Media Player 12.0.9600.16384 is already installed.
 The older version cannot overwrite the newer one which is from WINDOWS 10.&nbsp; I am looking for this separate program of Windows 10 and I cannot find anywhere to be able to uninstall it.
</p>
<p>It looks like was programmed as a part of other software. </p>
<p>What is the solution to resolve this problem. </p>

                    I have been using Windows 10 for approx. a year with no issues re email compatibility between Windows and Thunderbird re email, however recently I am unable to send or forward any email using Thunderbird. There is no problem with incoming, just an outgoing
 issue. Any suggestions?<br />

<p>I can't tell you how enraged I'm becoming waiting for the Crimson Alliance download code. I purchased every title in the summer arcade promo the wed. they dropped. Now that crimson Alliance has dropped I am still sitting here twiddling my damn thumbs. This
 is the kind of experence microsoft provides? We X-box&nbsp;consumers pay for our online experence. Having to wait for a game we are already entitled to while the general public is free to buy and play said game is a slap in the face.</p>

<p>Same here, I literally bought every summer of arcade title within 24hrs of their release and i too am checking my inbox and junk folder night and day, but to no avail. &nbsp;I knew it would be like this, so i'm not so upset, it took a while for the points to
 be added to my account last summer, if Microsoft didn't have such unique and fun games for download i would never purchase anything through live. &nbsp;I'm waiting till Monday, but then i'm gonna start getting upset. &nbsp;You think the ppl that bought them first would
 get their codes first? &nbsp;i think it's backwards and we must be at the back of the line, which is enraging.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I understand how important your accounts are for you. However, there's no other verification option aside from the account recovery form if you cannot reset your account's password using the recovery page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's top priority is the privacy and security of your respective account. And we do not have that kind of access to your account for privacy and security reasons.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important note: </strong>The secret to get a positive result on this form is ACCURACY. QUANTITY of information is good but ACCURACY will get you there.</p>
