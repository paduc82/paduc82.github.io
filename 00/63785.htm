<h2>            Skype for business doesn&#39;t show profile picture, however it&#39;s configured in settings.</h2>
                    <p>Dear Support Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using MS office 2016 on our PCs and office365 accounts. Today one of the users faced with very strange issue. She had a photo set in her profile in S4B and outlook, but somehow it dissappeared and everyone see her profile in skype
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">without photo</span>. However it's still shown up in outlook, webapps and in the settings in S4B. Please see the screenshots below. Here are steps which I used to troubleshoot, I tried to login from another PC but got
 the same result. I&nbsp; tried to upload new photo but it didn't help. Tried to hide photo - and then to show phot - no result. I can still see photo in settings but not where it should be. Please advise. Seems it's not the only one case so far...</p>

<p>Hi Anton,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Business picture is the same as your Office 365 profile picture, which appears in other Office programs you use, such as Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change it, you need to follow the instructions in the article below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-or-update-your-picture-in-Skype-for-Business-2a09cc64-85f1-48f7-af4f-e26e1a763618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-or-update-your-picture-in-Skype-for-Business-2a09cc64-85f1-48f7-af4f-e26e1a763618</a></strong></p>
<p>Please pay attention to this option as below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe4c7746-2166-4f6a-9c89-94e28caa7a1d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe4c7746-2166-4f6a-9c89-94e28caa7a1d" /></a></p>
<p>If you clear this option, it will remove your picture and everyone else’s from your view, but it doesn’t remove your picture from the view of other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can take a look&nbsp;at the following post to check if it helps you.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways you can reinstall Windows 10 on the new SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1: If you don't want to go through the chore of reinstalling applications and drivers; you can backup your current installation to an external drive then restore it to the new SSD.</p>

Depending on how large your Windows 10 installation is, it can use a lot of space, so you should invest in an external USB hard disk with a lot of space.

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key
</span></span><span><span>you already own</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you can't boot to a Windows disk then either the disk you have is not valid or<br />
the CD/DVD drive has a hardware issue. Could be as simple as&nbsp;a loose cable<br />
or as complex as a failed drive or motherboard issue. Try another Windows<br />
disk.<br />
<br />
DId you set it back to try to boot to the hard drive? (Set hard drive first in the boot<br />
order).<br />
<br />
You need to provide more details about what you are doing and the results. Saying<br />
something did not work when there are many methods does not help us help you.<br />

<h2>            Undoing  rd &#47;s &#47;q C&#58;&#92;&#36;Recycle.bin</h2>
                    So I thought I had a problem with my deleted file not showing up in my recycle bin, but I followed someone's post to use this command and it completely deleted half of my systems documents which are pretty important to me.<br />
<br />
I've done a system restore to a few days ago, ran CHKDSK, and that's about it so far.<br />
<br />
I'm now using Recuva to try and restore all the files deleted on that day and forward (this was last night).<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to undo this action and get my files back?

<h2>            Windows Pro 8.1 RTM install freeze at &#34;Next you&#39;ll set up your account&#34; fix</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have just installed 8.1 on my Surface Pro. The 8.1 installer froze at&nbsp;"Next you'll set up your account". I left it for an hour with no change.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then rebooted and the installer restored my 8.0 version of windows. I tried again with the same result.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Fix:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At the "Next you'll set up your account" screen go back a few screens and disable your network connection. Now continue and the install will complete.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think I know what is happening. I don't have an online Microsoft account, just a local account. The installer is assuming I have an online account and freezes. By turning off the network connection it forces it to use the local account and it then completes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers</div>
<div><br />

<div>UPDATE</div>
<div>I had the same problem on two of my other PC's. Easiest solution is to pull out the network cable or disable your Wi-Fi if you don't have a Microsoft Account setup on the machine.</div>

            I'm saying that I turned off network connections as you suggested by cancelling, going back a few screens, and selecting the networking item that this was a public network. I did not see anything else about networking. That did not work for me - still
 froze.
<div><br />
<div>I was asking whether you also set all the other items in manual settings that had to do with sending info to Microsoft. What exactly did you do?</div>

            I confirm that disconnecting from the internet such as disabling your router, WIFI or disconnecting your network cable prior to going to the final user input stage occurs (where "Next you'll set up your account" infite loop occurs) works on the final release
 for me :)

            I was having the same issue - my account was a Microsoft Account. Clicking back and selecting custom settings did not give me the option to disable my network adapter. I was working on a laptop without a physical WiFi ON/OFF button so disabling physically
 was not an option either.
<div><br />
<div>So... I turned my router off, and then clicked on express settings. The setup threw back an error within 10 seconds, something about not being able to validate the account and asking if I wanted to continue with existing accounts. I said Yes and PRESTO
 - I am in. Hope this helps.</div>

                    <p>Witam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Mam problem ze zmianą swojego starego konta doroslego na konto dziecka. Zależy mi na tym, bo syn zaczął grać w grę na moim koncie i nie chciał bym żeby to wszystko utracił, jak stworze nowe.&nbsp; Ja dla siebie stworzyłem nowe konto i teraz oba są konta doroslego
 . Chciałbym to jedno zmienic na dziecko bo chce ustawić dziecku limity korzystania z urządzenia . A nie mogę zrobić tego na koncie doroslego. Zmiana dostępności treści nic nie pomogła.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Przeszulalem już całe menu xbox one i nigdzie nie znalazłem info o zmianie konta&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pozdrawiam&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Translation: [Hello.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;I'm having trouble changing my old adult account to a child account. I care about this, because the son began to play the game on my account and did not want me to lose it all, as a new creature.&nbsp; I created a new account for myself and now both are adult accounts.
 I would like this one to change the child because he wants to set the child limits on the use of the device. And I can't do that in my adult account. Changing content availability has helped.
<br />
I've gone through the whole menu Xbox One and nowhere found info about changing your account

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to go to the computer manufacturer’s website to download and install all&nbsp;the updated drivers for the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to check and install all the latest Windows updates.</p>
<p><br />
Follow these steps.<br />
a. Press <strong>Windows key + W</strong> and type <strong>Windows Updates</strong>.<br />
b. Select <strong>Check for Updates </strong>which will show the list of all recent updates those need to be installed on the computer and then you can install them.<br />
c. Press <strong>Windows key + W</strong> and type <strong>Windows Updates</strong>.<br />
d. Select <strong>Install optional updates </strong>and then select <strong>Check for updates.<br />
</strong>e. Now wait for a while when Windows looks for the latest updates for your PC.<br />
f. If updates are found, tap or click <strong>Install updates</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if the issue persists. We would be happy to help you further.<br />

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the exact same problem. I'm using Win XP Pro + IE 8.0. I've been using my IBM for over 10 years and reinstalling Windows arround every year. It's been working each time except this time. In addition, I've been over dozen of "solutions" founded on
 forums but none of them works...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm completly STUCK and need support just like you. Keep me posted if you have any feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ulrich Prévôt</p>

            I finally overcame the problem by simply letting the computer run like that for 2 hours. It finally finished ok.<br />

            <p>Somebody just gave me a solution, and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look for <strong>KB2879017 Cumulative Update for Windows </strong>and download it.&nbsp; Once it installs, your WinXP should be able to access the Microsoft server and start the process of searching for updates, and a yellow shield should appear at the lower
 right-hand corner, while updates download.&nbsp; Before long, those updates should be ready to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expect KB898461 to be among the first set of updates.&nbsp; Install that one.&nbsp; You will not yet be able to check for updates in IE7, because once the green line disappears, it will expect you to download and install updates...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...But there is only one file that will download; namely, <strong>KB892130 Windows Genuine Advantage Validation Tool.&nbsp;
</strong>The installation will fail (as far as I know), until you do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download and install <strong>Internet Explorer 8.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download and install <strong>KB905474 Windows Genuine Advantage Notification.&nbsp;
</strong>Once you have installed both (a restart may be required), you can download and install KB892130.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following another restart, a window for Windows Genuine Advantage Notification should appear, asking you to complete the installation.&nbsp; It could take 10 minutes for the installation to complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once that is done, automatic updates <em>and</em> Windows Update&nbsp;should run normally.</p>

            <p>I too had one Windows XP SP3 + IE8 where October 2013 Microsoft Update Custom Check for Updates ran for a couple of hours . Mine was set to "Download" (not "Automatic") and when&nbsp;I finally got around to&nbsp;installing the updates list, they were already downloaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were other issues with the updates themselves.</p>

                    <p>How do I remove-uninstall Quick Assist from my laptop. It is a program that allows another person to take control of your screen to assist in repairs etc. This is not a program I want...any hacker can break into your laptop...</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I remove it. It does not give an option when you right click on it...nor is it showing up in the settings application folder where you uninstall it.</p>

            <p>The above reply is not much help; typical of this forum, sadly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the '1607' update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Settings / System, Apps &amp; Features (that part is at least correct)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then at the top of that section, 'Manage optional features'. <em>Here</em> is where you can remove Quick Assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the 'Creators Update':</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Settings / Apps and 'Manage optional features' is found on the section that appears.</p>

                    <p>A spurned lover is somehow modded or hacked into my 360.. specifically the affect is that under certain actions will cause controller severance EVEN WITH a corded controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is critical to note I DO NOT HAVE ANY NET CONNECTION to the actual console nor have I even owned a Live account.&nbsp; I figure I am being ransomed or something, but i am confirmibly being stalked by an entitled wannabe lover.&nbsp; I can produce video proof of

<p>
</p><p>My best guess as to how.. is I suspect the standard wireless controller port is being utilized somehow but who knows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the Xbox 360 console can't be hacked or modded remotely.</p>
<p>The thing you can try to do is the following:</p>
<p>1. check if the console is set up to allow being controlled by other devices like a Phone or media remote, there is a setting some where for that</p>
<p>2. Power the console down.</p>
<p>3. Wait 30 seconds</p>
<p>4. Disconnect the console from power for at least 2 minutes</p>
<p>5. Reconnect the console to power</p>
<p>6. Power on the console and see if the problems still occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the stalking part, the thing you can try is to contact the local authorities, it's not something people at Xbox/Microsoft can assist with since it's not happening via Xbox Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't quite understand what exactly is happening with your console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you say the controller "disconnects", even if you use a wired controller?</p>
<p>When you say the controller is wired, is that a controller with a fixed cord that you can NOT remove, or are you using the Play&amp;Charge cord to connect the controller to the console?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be aware, that the Play &amp; Charge Kit cable ONLY provides power to charge the battery. NO controller signals are transferred through that cable!</p>
<p>So if the controller disconnects with the Play&amp;Charge cable, it might be the same reason the controller disconnects wirelessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you suspect this could be a stalker, they might be around your house using a wireless jammer to send "garbage" radio signals on the 2.4GHz frequency, disturbing the wireless signal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might contact the police for advice, and depending on where you live, there might be a regulatory agency that deals with radio interference, so they can try to detect the jammer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you might try to update your console by connecting it online (even temporarily), to see if an update on the console improves controller connectivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            No hardware can be hacked remotely while you do not have an internet or network connection.&nbsp; There are also no known hacks for Xbox 360 that would cause your issues.&nbsp; What you're facing is most likely a hardware failure either with the console itself or
 your controller.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a proper fully wired controller to try on your Xbox 360 console?&nbsp; Like others have said, it's not possible to hack or modify another Xbox 360 console remotely.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for wireless controllers, their signals can be interrupted by other everyday objects in your home such as wireless telephone handsets or other wireless devices that use a similar frequency.&nbsp; And as the Xbox 360 controllers are always wireless, a Play
 &amp; Charge won't help with controller connection issues. This is why I suggest testing a true wired controller.

<h2>            An error capturing your PIN.  Please try again later.</h2>
                    <p>I continue to have this problem.&nbsp; I run five different machines with Windows 8.1 and four of the five (using the same Microsoft account) work just fine.&nbsp; The fifth did for a while and then just stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried all the proposed remedies including
 the Services.msc change to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amazingly frustrated.&nbsp; Totally surprised Microsoft has not responded to all the complaints with a remedy.&nbsp; I guess that is there issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?&nbsp; Any new ideas?&nbsp; Anything from Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<h3> odeath metalo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problema escuchar musica desde un disco duro externo</h2>
                    Buen Día.. Bien mi problema es el siguiente, quiero escuchar musica desde un disco duro externo conectado por medio de USB, al momento de picar boton central, multimedia, seleccionar musica no aparece mi dispositivo conectado, si hago el mismo procedimiento
 desde la interfaz tampoco sucede nada no lo reconoce. El xbox lo reconoce, por que por que cuando voy a guardar un juego me aparece el dispositivo conectado, y igual si voy a Almacenamiento se muestra mi dispositivo conectado. Ahora pense que era por la marca
 del HD, el que le conectaba era marca ADATA asi que le conecte un WD, y nada ambos discos son de 500gb. Dentro de los discos no ahy nada mas que una carpeta con la musica nada mas alguna solucion?

</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you will be able to upgrade from the Windows Insider Preview to the RTM build for free.</p>
<p>Company officials have noted though if you join the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso-update?os=win10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest confirmation:</p>
<span>
<p>When asked if there would be a cut off date for Insiders before Windows 10 reached RTM, Microsoft's Gabriel Aul stated that preview builds would continue being delivered up until the final release.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"We expect to keep flighting builds to Insiders all the way up to RTM. More details to come, but no cutoff planned."</em></p>

            I too have a clean install of windows 10 insider preview. i actually removed the hard drive with windows 7 Home premium 32 bit and installed an SSD to put windows 10 on it. I also have a spare windows 8 pro licence I havent used yet. Will I simply be able
 to keep using windows 10, or will I have to quote one of the licences I have? The windows 7 is 32 bit, and I dont want 32 bit windows 10 as I now have 8 GB of RAM ( althopugh I havent seen if windows 10 is coming in a 32 bit version), the windows 8 licence
 I have is for 32 or 64 bit, but I would rather not have to uninstall the preview to install wondows 8, then 8.1&nbsp; then windows 10. What will happen?

<p>Thanks&nbsp;<span>for replying, does that depend on insider hub quest's, feedbacks? And so you think I will be given a retail key for ISO installation or will I upgrade directly from Insider Preview?</span></p>

<p>1 - there are app icons with @(+some numbers and letters) and no icon image. when pressing on it, it does nothing.</p>
<p>2 - skype cant update. seas Cans uninstall current versin. There is no skyp listed in program remover. Skype is workink. If I delete it from program files. and try installing current version of skype. It is the same. when I open skype shortcut on desctop
 it installs it self again (seams to me like a virus, had this 2 years ago)</p>
<p>3 - my PC is a lot slower then before. so I think it has some wiruses.</p>
<p>So I want to make a clean installation of windows 10 Pro. Do not want to install IP 1040 and go over all updates. So I tryed upgrading it to windows 10 Pro. it sead it is activated. then I tryed Clean instalatio (Found in internet that if you upgrade to
 win 10 it will be tied to your PC and then you can do clean Instalation and it will not ask for a key.&nbsp;So made clean instalation. it ask for key. tryed the on I got when applying to insiders and downloading 1040. but is seas wrong key. skiped it... finished
 installing it (do not know why it askd to connect to internet 2tvice - connected. pressed use Express settings ant it rebooted and ascing the same). Made loccal acount. loged in and it seas cant activate with this KEY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do? Any sugestions?</p>

<h2>            Accidentally deleted photos</h2>
                    Hello! I use a Windows Surface RT. Today I was going through photos and I accidentally deleted a file with 500 pictures in it! Is there anyway at all to get them back? I have been freaking out about the whole thing because those photos were very important.
 I use my surface to transfer all of my pictures from my camera onto it. That is the file I deleted, the one that had those pictures in it. Is there a way to get them back? Please let me know, anything will help! Thanks for your time!

<h3> bluestragler  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get back my HP 1015 laser Printer after windows 10 update &#63;</h2>
                    <p>The recent "major windows 10 update" unceremoniously removed my HP 1015 laser jet printer setup.</p>
<p>Where do I find the .inf file Microsoft requires to re-install?</p>
<p>The printer is old and I can't find the install disk.</p>
<p>Such a .inf file is not available on the HP web site listing their printer drivers.</p>
<p>So for me the "upgrade" is actually a downgrade.</p>
<p>Very annoying and frustrating. </p>
<p>I would think Microsoft would ask if I want my drivers removed before inflicting damage to my working system!</p>
<p>Any assistance will be appreciated.</p>

            Unfortunately MS "doesn't care", they do what they feel like to "improve" Windows.  Windows is killing lots of "old" hardware.  Not too long ago MS killed off 4 ATOM type CPUs with a Windows "update" that the chip maker "refused to support". Those chips had only been released for 2 years.

<p>Thanks. I don't see why I should not keep this perfectly good laser printer even if it is over a decade old!</p>
<p>If you are not a full on geek these things are an unnecessary headache to sort out.</p>
<p>I would love to just refuse all updates but I think that makes one vulnerable.</p>

</p><blockquote>Unfortunately MS "doesn't care", they do what they feel like to "improve" Windows. Windows is killing lots of "old" hardware. Not too long ago MS killed off 4 ATOM type CPUs with a Windows "update" that the chip maker "refused to support". Those
 chips had only been released for 2 years. </blockquote>
<p>That's really a shocking thing to say, particularly for someone with 'MVP' after their name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware manufacturers choose whether or not to support changes to an operating system. Microsoft doesn't choose whether or not to support hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the first place, Microsoft can't possibly know about the hundreds of thousands of hardware devices in use throughout the world. But let's say they did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft can't possibly write drivers for all those hundreds of thousands of hardware devices every time Windows changes, because Microsoft didn't build those devices and doesn't have access to the manufacturers' proprietary knowledge of how they were built
 and how they work. But let's say they did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has no right to benefit from or modify that proprietary knowledge because&nbsp; it's the manufacturer's legally protected intellectual property.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft publishes details of upcoming changes to Windows so hardware manufacturers can update and test their drivers. It's the hardware manufacturers who decide whether they'll keep on supporting their devices, and which models will and won't any longer
 be supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is nothing new - it's always been that way. What's different today is that only 6 months, more or less, pass between new versions of Windows, whereas in the past, years would go by.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The quicker cadence is a challenge to hardware manufacturers (and software developers) but Microsoft didn't choose that cadence. If they don't keep up with the pace of technology, their competitors (notably Google and Apple) will eat their lunch. In some
 ways they already have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've lost track of how many updates to ChromeOS my Chromebook has received this year; it's been at least 3 or 4. Of course, Chromebook manufacturers have to build them to Google's specifications, so updating ChromeOS is much easier than updating Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating drivers, testing them, documenting them, and bringing support staff up to speed costs money. When a hardware manufacturer decides that a particular model is no longer bringing in money, it's likely to lose support.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any trace of the working HP 2015 driver.</p>
<p>It is no longer listed under "Printers and Scanners". Thankfully MS didn't mess-up all my devices so other are still available to me.</p>
<p>Is there a particular directory where Microsoft could have "hidden" the working driver after "disabling" it or will they have effectively uninstalled it?</p>
<p>grrrr...</p>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>I downloaded the file HP1015Dit4x64.msi from your link.</p>
<p>I double click the file to install it.</p>
<p>I go to Settings - Devices - Printers and scanners (Hp 1015 is no longer listed)</p>
<p>I click Add a printer or scanner</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; response The printer that I want isn't listed. I click that.</p>
<p>a) Find a printer by other options screen is displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My printer is a little older. Help me find it option. Next. Searching for printers .... Nothing. Cancel.</p>
<p>b) The other options are not helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is *.msi the right file type to be recognized by MS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which directory are the MS drivers saved in?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer before the issue occurred?
</span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> </span>I would suggest you to set your computer in
</span><span>Clean Boot state and check if the same issue occurs.</span></div>
<div><span>By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></div>
<div><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows XP:</span></div>
<div><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>Note:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state” in the provided link to return your computer to
<span>Normal startup mode</span>.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span><strong>Method 2: </strong></span><strong>Also</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below, which would help us to uninstall and reinstall the video driver automatically.</div>
<div><span>a. Click <b>Start.</b></span></div>
<div><span>b. Right-Click <b>Computer.</b></span></div>
<div><span>c. Click <b>Properties.</b></span></div>
<div><span>d. Click <b>Device Manager</b> on the left hand side. </span></div>
<div><span>e. Click <b>imaging devices.</b></span></div>
<div><span>f. Right-click on the <b>video driver.</b></span></div>
<div><span>g. Click <b>Uninstall.</b></span></div>
<div><span>h. Follow the prompts to continue to uninstall the Driver. </span></div>
<div><span>Once uninstall restart the computer, after restarting by default the driver will install it successfully, if not try to update drivers<span>&nbsp;
</span>from manufacturer’s website.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. </span></p>
</span></div>
