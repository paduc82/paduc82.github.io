<hr />
<div>I successfully installed Windows 7 on my computer this week, but the computer sometimes loses contact with my Western Digital Mirror 2 terabyte hard drive. When this happens, I restart the computer, and the drive usually reappears. I just bought this hard
 drive two weeks ago. Instead of simply failing to recognize it, I sometimes get "not responding" errors when trying to open files.<br />
<br />
My hard drive (model WD20000H2U-00) does not appear in the compatibility list at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Browse.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;category=Storage%20Devices&amp;subcategory=Hard%20Drives%2c%20External -- just my luck!<br />
<br />
I contacted Western Digital support, and they said this drive had not yet been tested with Windows 7. They suggested that it might be a power issue, and that I should plug the unit directly into a wall socket instead of a power strip. They also suggested I
 try switching the USB cable. I tried both these fixes, but the intermittent problem still remains.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas about what I can do? Are there any downloads on the Microsoft site? Or will I have to bring the drive back to Best Buy and hope they'll take it back?<br />
<br />
(I also keep getting a message at start-up that Windows can't find my two network drives. But as soon as I open the explorer window and click on the two drive icons, they're there every time. Is this just a start up timing issue?)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<p>Finally I found some promising information on the USB drive connection problems. Seems that MSFT is fully aware of the issue, has a fix and is currently regression testing it (see links below). This problem seems to be occuring with any USB device attached
 to a Windows 7 64-bit system with a Nvidia nForce chipset motherboard. The problem is related to addressing memory 4GB and above with 64-bit memory addressing. Seems that MSFT is going to disable 64-bit memory (not CPU) addressing over a certain threshold.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, MSFT has posted some workarounds until they can get the fix out to us (who knows when that will be). I am going to try the workarounds and run some tests this weekend and then report back with my findings. But I wanted to share this information because
 I know how frustrating this can be!<br />

<br />
Well, I am excited to report back that the proposed workaround worked for me!!! I now have 5 USB drives attached and I tested over 60GB of simultaneous data transfers between all 5 drives. I have also tested restarting my system a number of times and my drives
 are recognized consistently. Obviously I need to burn this in longer, but initial results are very promising. Also, seems that the USB connectivity issue is not only related to Nvidia chipsets, so if you have another chipset that is exhibiting similar symptoms,
 I would try this workaround. I am currently running a test with 3 media extenders running at the same time and so far everything is stable. Here is the workaround from the other thread (just so that you don't have to go searching for it). It effectively truncates
 your available memory to below the 4GB threshold. I used HEX 0xCFFFFFFF for 3.2GB of available RAM. I'll live with this until Microsoft releases the fix. This is a very simple workaround and is entirely reversible.<br />

<br />
<p><strong><span>Temporary Workaround</span></strong></p>
<p><br />
<br />
For those of you hitting issues with a hang or a failure to transfer data, please try the following...<br />
<br />
From an elevated command prompt (right click on the command prompt shortcut, run as administrator):<br />
1) Type "bcdedit /set truncatememory 0x80000000" (no quotes)<br />
2) Reboot<br />
3) Go to control panel -&gt; System and Security -&gt; view amount of RAM and processor speed.<br />
&nbsp; - It should report 4GB (2GB available)<br />
<br />
<br />
To undo this, open an elevated command prompt again:<br />
1) Type "bcdedit /deletevalue truncatememory" (no quotes)<br />
2) Reboot<br />
3) Go to control panel -&gt; System and Security -&gt; view amount of RAM and processor speed.<br />
&nbsp; - It should report 4GB<br />

<p>Hi SoniaCruzel1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! I understand you're attempting to connect a controller to your Windows 10 PC, to do so, check out this in-depth guide on setting up an Xbox One controller:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/connect-xbox-one-controller-to-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to connect an Xbox One Wireless Controller to a Windows PC</a>. If the controller you are using is not Xbox branded, then you must refer to the manufacturer's instruction for setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how this goes!</p>

            You need Windows 7 Ultimate or Enterprise edition. Those editions include multilingual user interfaces (Language Packs). You can do an Anytime Upgrade to Ultimate from Home Premium and install the English Language Pack.

<h2>            Why is Window Store Listed in TaskManager when it does not seem to run&#63;</h2>
                    <p>U see What i mean from the picture, its listed but it seems that its not running</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9e63725-2a5c-4bb0-8e7e-a3d1c6b3635f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>under processes it makes u think its running, but under detail it shows that it is suspended that's strange, what is going on with store? i did EndTask with Task manager, i edit post if it opens up automatically, i mean when it reappears&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i was searching info about Maps APP (i wanted to know what APP it is &amp; what it is for) &amp; when i opened Maps APP page Store opened, i closed it, it was gone from TaskManager, But it later reappeared &amp; in a way u see on the picture
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK Store reappeared i TaskManager, WTH? all is like u see in the picture again</p>
<p>to bad i can't uninstall it, cause i remember it from Win 8, it can be annoying at time</p>
<p>new store started to take 47MB Memory, is it searching for updates for APP'S?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All APP'S need Fix, cause when i exit them they continue to work at background, they will remain in TaskManager Until i do EndTask from TaskManager, By fix i mean option to close the AAP'S totally so it would not run on background until i End Task, when
 i close my WaterFox its no longer seen in TaskManager, that's how all programs should work, well Except Anti-Virus programs &amp; Anti-Spyware &amp; Anti-Malware programs, APP like Music &amp; Videos should not remain in background, same issue is with PC settings, it
 remains on background to</p>
<p>
</p><p>this video tells me to use close button what looks like X, i have always done it like in the video</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/how-close-app</p>
i use the close button all the time, that's one reason i like Win7 more, no unnecessary components, its just when i got this PC it had Win 8.1 already installed, not gonna reinstall windows cause of that, but i am thinking of disabling Store from service, is
 disabling store bad in any way? like unable to update windows with out it? <br />
<p>
</p><p>BDW store has been running for few hours by new.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are using a <strong>Mouse and Keyboard</strong>, the best way to <strong>

<p>Store reappears when closed, after 5min&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>it also reappeared today when i booted PC first time, i opened store &amp; then closed it by dragging store down like in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=6nhaQta3Reo</p>
<p>
</p><p>if the issue does not stop by next time i boot PC, then i post again, &amp; if i can't stop it i am considering disabling it from service (no idea does it has bad
<span><span>consequences to or not</span></span>), my personal opinion, store needs patching
</p>
<p>
</p><p>seems that opening any APP activates Store again, i mean it makes it reappear, after closing Music APP Store was running again, maybe its a
<span><span>coincidence? who knows, but </span></span>we will see tomorrow if Store does not start again automatically
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Store started running again :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>maybe its connected to this</p>

<p>
</p><p>firs wsappx appears in task manger, then Store Broker &amp; then Store, maybe its a
<span><span>coincidence</span></span>, either way i can't seem to stop Store background process, wsappx runs short time, i have not taken time, but not over 1H, it can be even 15Min</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>also i have local acc, not Microsoft acc (mentioned it just in case it matters), firs log on was with Microsoft acc, there was just so meany things that got me bit disoriented &amp; so i made Microsoft acc Instead of load from the start, maybe that part of the
 issue, &amp; maybe it was caused by uninstalling some APP'S?</p>
<p>
</p><p>but the store process seems to be frozen it has 48.8MB &amp; that number never changes (even after hours), store is still running, its been running hole day</p>

            <p><span>its Next Day &amp; Store is Running again, started when i started my PC, but its not listed on StartUp</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>don't tell it does not stop until i log in my PC with Microsoft ACC, its Just Harassment like what YouTube does, u need to connect with Google+ Acc to be able to comment!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>what i have against logging on with Microsoft ACC? well i like automatic log on like i have with Local ACC, no Password needed or can i log in Store to Microsoft ACC separately so PC remains on Local ACC?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>should i download Reg file that disables Store from here?</p>
<p>http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/5804-store-enable-disable-windows-8-a.html</p>
<p>&amp; does it work for Win 8.1?</p>

<br />
<div>On my notebook desktop, I have created several icons that are shortcuts to files stored on an external hard drive used for storage only.</div>
<div>When I travel with the notebook, I do not take the external storage drive with me.</div>
<div>After rebooting the computer (turning it on) for the first time without the external hard drive, the icons (shortcuts) for files on the external hard drive are still there.</div>
<div>When I turn on the computer the second time, the icons (shortcuts) have disappeared.</div>
<div>Wen I return home and plug in the external (storage) hard drive, it always comes back as the same drive letter.</div>
<div>The icons do not come back. I have to remake them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there some setting I can change to stop the computer from doing this automatically?</div>

                    <p>I've been getting a BSOD about once a day for the past week.&nbsp; Every time it sites tcpip.sys.&nbsp; I've search the internet for potential solutions and have tried such things as update my bios, update my network driver, uninstall daemon tools and install magiciso,
 etc.&nbsp; Unfortunately none of these have resolved the issue.&nbsp; Any help?&nbsp; Here are the details from windbg:</p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Unfortunately your system is configured to produce complete memory dumps rather than more manageable kernel memory dumps. They take over 9 minutes to

 are not hardware related. You may need the odd updated driver but probably little more. You need to remove problematic and undesirable software. Of course undesirable is how I view the software. You may see things differently, even after I explain why I think
 it undesirable.</font></font></font></p>

<div><br />
<div>I configured crash dumps to use the mini dump size. &nbsp;The next time my system crashes with a BSOD, I will upload that smaller file to SkyDrive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've uploaded the report from Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor:</div>
<div>https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=17503DEB99FDC441!349&amp;authkey=!ANBl3dw_TfEoQMA</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've been using Norton for several years now and haven't run into any problems with it before.</div>
<div>I've been using TuneUp Utilities products for several years, 2012 for a year-and-a-half, and haven't run into any problems before.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I installed Acronis because I purchase an older copy of it several years ago. &nbsp;However, I do not use it, so I uninstalled it.</div>
<div>I've been using Norton Ghost for about a half-a-year and haven;t run into any problems with it before.</div>
<div>As far as Windows BackUp goes, I don't use that, but it comes with Windows no matter what, so I'm not sure what what I can do to disable/remove that.</div>
<div><br />

<p><font color="#000000">It would seem that as well as installing Symantec you have also installed Vipre. It is generally accepted that it is not good practice to install two anti-virus products on the same computer because of the risk of conflicts. This note
 regarding what you should do before installing Vipre gives information:<br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I haven't installed Vipre. &nbsp;When I did a search for vipre, I found a left-over program files directory for StopZilla, which I briefly installed for it's anti-malware, but uninstalled because it also has anti-virus and I already have a program for that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've updated all motherboard drivers/software from the Asus website. &nbsp;The USB3 controller is still not working properly. &nbsp;However, it has been this way I believe since I installed the motherboard, so I do not believe it to be the cause of the BSOD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've also attempted to update the software that you've mentioned. &nbsp;However, I've had these programs installed for quite a while before the BSOD started happening, so I do not think that these are the cause either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I can tell you that recently I ran DriverMax to auto update my drivers, I installed and uninstalled some software that I was trying out, I installed Malwarebytes and decided to keep it, and I installed windows updates. &nbsp;As I mentioned previously in
 this email, I installed all of the latest drivers and software for my motherboard from ASUS, so any incorrect drivers in those areas should be resolved.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you have any other suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
<div>thanks,</div>
<div>Chris</div>

<p>You are making claims about uninstalling that, whilst they should be true, are unfortunately often not true. Uninstall tools are frequently&nbsp;&nbsp;imperfect &nbsp;and can leave components behind to create problems until they are removed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many security providers now provide removal tools and, whilst these may do a better job, you can still find bits of the software present after their use. If removal was complete I would not be able to read reports from your computer &nbsp;referring to the software
 you had removed. Your latest dump file showed that gfibto.sys, a Vipre driver, had loaded. It is not readily apparent what it was doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you say about the timing of installations is&nbsp;true but the environment in which&nbsp;the software operates changes.&nbsp; An existing problem with software may not become apparent until the environment changes. The problem can be with the original software and
 not what caused the change of environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It helps when troubleshooting to resolve ongoing problems not related to the the problem you are trying to fix.&nbsp;This is valid&nbsp;whether&nbsp;the problem is minor or significant as all problems generating error create unstable situations which can result in system
 failure. Unrelated minor errors can occur at critical times causing procedures to time out with far reaching consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you examine startup entries and look for references to software, which should no longer be there. It may also reveal items&nbsp;like browser add ons,&nbsp;like unwanted search engines and toolbars&nbsp;which interfere with system performance.</p>

<h2>            Where is inverse function in Windows 7 paint program&#63;</h2>
                    In the new paint program in windows 7 how do you inverse the image? ctrl+i does not work anymore and I cannot find the function. This is a feature I extensively use to create complex abstract pictures and I am wondering where this feature is?

            Your not wrong -- they forgot to put it in.<br />
<br />
The new windows paint is actually a .net program -- the old bitmap paint is completely gone... and that includes the actual executable for it ...<br />
<br />
mspaint.exe is now definetly a completly different program - so even if you try and copy the old mspaint.exe into the system32 folder it will overwrite the new one which is named the same.<br />
<br />
I don't know what dependancies the old mspaint.exe had (some dll somewhere - but I don't think so - it was a simple program like notepad, made all the way back in win3, modified over time.<br />
<br />
If you have a copy of XP or similar copy the c:\windows\system32\mspaint.exe file to your PC and rename it to something like XpMSpaint.exe , place it where ever you like(my preference is for the system32 folder)&nbsp;and create a shortcut to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT....<br />
<br />
I would reccomend going for a better bitmap editor...<br />
Their is actually a .net base adobe like app that is totally free and made specifically for windows
<a href="http://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.getpaint.net/</a><br />
or Inkscape is also very good and very easy to use. If you want even more professional free alternatives Gimp is another one (but it's hardish to use if your used to the 'common' way of doing things)<br />
<br />
...but again the best option is Corel Paint -- you can either buyit bundled for about $50 US with corelDraw! (highly reccomended) or on it's own for as little as $19.95 (which is a riduculous price considering CorelDraw is the leading Vector arts program on
 the planet. (adobe users will say otherwise - but thyre all artists aren't they)<br />

    <title>Start menu word jumbled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gogoluba  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start menu word jumbled</h2>
                    On a fresh restart the words in my start menu are fine, the setting option says settings, power says power, etc. &nbsp;but after a few hours of use and i decide to try to shut down my computer, i go back to the start menu to power it down and the words for
 each option are all jumbled with the names of some apps and random signs, etc. &nbsp;This stops me from being able to select any of the options and forces me to have to do a hard shutdown by holding the power button on my pc. &nbsp;Is there any fix to this or is this
 a common bug with the current version of windows 10? If so, how do i fix it?

<h2>            xbox live user is stalking and abusing me.</h2>
                    
<p>a user by the name of <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> has been harassing my profile with slanderous messages. this user has also notified his friends to send slanderous messages also. i have a 7 year old that plays games on my profile as well and i don't
 want her to read these abusive messages that appear on a daily bases. i have been trying diligently to block all the messages but its hard to block all his friends and then their friends and so on.</p>
<p>i would like this user to be banned for starting a war i cant seem to win. i have privacy setting set to only receive messages from friends but now i cant receive any messages from possible friends that i meet on xbox live without turning it off. once i
 turn it off soon after i start getting abusive messages again. i did not provoke him in any way he then sends me a message saying that he has reported me. i do not have anything that violates the terms of service in any way, no mods, no lag switches, no modded
 controllers, etc.</p>
<p>he has also threatened to kill us both in our sleep and or by putting a bullet in my 7 year old's head after he rapes her in front of me and then kill me as well. i would like something done about this user as soon as possible. please contact me at this
 email as soon as possible <strong>[Mod Removed].</strong></p>

<p>First, please do not list other peoples gamertags on the forums as it is against the rules. The best you can do is file a complaint against these users via your console. Then as you have already been doing, block communications. I would also avoid them.
 The Policy Enforcement Team will check into your complaint and determine punishment as needed, but you must file the complaint using your console as this is the only way to have the PET look into things.</p>

<p>Hi Capitain, Outsider is correct. &nbsp; Simply file a complaint through the console features then block communications of the offending member. No need to recieve unwanted messages or play with unwanted members.</p>
<p>"i would like this user to be banned for starting a war i cant seem to win"</p>
<p>That's not going to happen..! &nbsp; &nbsp; Why would your child view messages instead of play games??? &nbsp; At 7 years old a parent should monitor usage IMO. &nbsp; Or, &nbsp;you could create a child account to avoid such things. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You may want to refresh your friends
 list and appear off-line before you log in to help, &nbsp; GOOD LUCK!!!!</p>

<p>At 7 years old a legal guardian has to contractually monitor the child at all times when connected to Xbox LIVE. &nbsp;Failing to do so is actually a Terms of Use agreement violation and could lead to penalties.</p>

<p>Hello Captain. Also, if you are concerned about death threats you may consider contacting your local law enforcement officials and filing a report with them as well. But please file a complaint through your console with Xbox and block communications with
 the person immediately. Also submit "Avoid Player" review and I would also suggest very closely monitoring your childs on-line play. The offending player should eventually go away once they realize they can no longer get to you.</p>

<p>thank you everyone for the advice. i have set up a child account for my daughter after the day i posted my first post (1/23/14 is the day i set it up). i have always had parental settings on to where it only allows rated E games. any other games needed a
 code entered. also i do watch my daughter when she plays on my account until the hour time limit stops her. when i am not home i have a baby sitter watch her and she isn't allowed to play my xbox when im not home. the baby sitter does not have the code.</p>
<p>I fear my daughter would read the messages if i went to go get something to drink, go to the bathroom while she was playing with her friends from school or skim over the messages when im playing online. i never thought this would happen. i also never thought
 that there were this many people who find enjoyment from tormenting someone who didn't do anything besides play a video game. the messages have slowed down but i still get them on a daily bases.</p>
<p>i have re-read the terms of service agreement and have taken the appropriate measures to ensure my daughter doesn't log into my account and that im not in violation of anything. i understand that i did break rules when i posted my first post but i wasn't
 thinking about it at the time because the event had me in such disarray. i hope all of you will forgive me and that if i do decide to post again i will make sure i don't violate any rules.</p>
<p>i know what to do now.</p>

<p>No problem captain. Glad we could help and hope you feel better about things. Don't worry--things like this with these kinds of people tend to blow over rather quickly. Take care</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, custom outgoing voice messages are no longer supported. Instead, Skype will use the default message for your app language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your contacts can't leave you a VM, try to <a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Sign in</a>&nbsp;to your account. In the Manage features section, select&nbsp;<strong>Call forwarding</strong>. Check that the status is
<strong>Enabled</strong>. If it’s not, select the button to enable it.&nbsp;Next, try signing out of Skype and signing back in again: in the menu bar, click
<strong>Skype</strong> &gt; <strong>Sign Out</strong> (<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>
Sign out</strong> on a Mac), and then sign back in. Voice messaging should now&nbsp;be enabled and working.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 is breaking my Hard Drives</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>So I've been using my pc for a long time now but since I've updated to windows 10 my old WD hdd 1 tb drive just broke. I thought was a case of old HDD so i replaced it with a seagate one. Two months later the same thing happends to the drive, well I thougt
 was a malfunctioning drive so I replace it in the shop (was on warranty) but two months later the drive is broken again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read it in the web that it could be because of the way windows 10 manages the startups of the drives. And that with UEFI bios (mine is uefi with an i7 3rd gen cpu) doesn't work well with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question here is, is this posible? that windows 10 is stressing my drives till the point it breaks?
</p>
<p>Is it a problem of my motherboard? </p>
<p>Do I downrade to windows 7 or change some hardware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could help me that would be great </p>

<p>Hi [SeeS],</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be other factors depending on how your drive is actually broken. It could be due to your Power Supply Unit (PSU). See if replacing your power supply will make any difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you provide your observations as to how your Windows 10 device used to function? Like having a high disk usage for an instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

    <title>I think my PSU&#38;&#35;39&#59;s fuse is blown. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I think my PSU&#38;&#35;39&#59;s fuse is blown.</h2>
                    
<p>I reside in the USA and purchased an Xbox one last month. I came back home to India for the winter and assuming that the Xbox PSU is an international version, I plugged it in. Immediately, I got a slight foul smell so I turned off the switch. I then realized
 that the PSU was made for use in USA only. The MCB in my house tripped. I am guessing that the fuse inside the PSU is gone and replacing it should be fine. The Orange light was still on for 5-10 minutes after I had pulled the plug from the socket.<br />
<br />
I want to know what my options are. I will be back in the USA in January but I want to play during the winter! Is it possible to get a replacement PSU in India or do I have to do it only when I get back to the USA? Or will the PSU work just fine if I use a
 220v-110v step-down transformer?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Best thing is to wait until you get back to the U.S. &amp; getting a replacement power brick.</p>
<p>If you got one in India it would be no good to use in the U.S.</p>
<p>You should never use any type of step-down transformer/voltage converters with your console as they can cause all sorts of issues &amp; would void any warranty you have.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Eric,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are experiencing. I will definitely assist you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please try the below steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> You need 10-13 GB of free space to install Windows 10. Even this might be the reason you are getting the error.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the <strong>Windows Update troubleshooter</strong> it will automatically fix some common problems installing updates and check if it helps to resolve the issue. Click the below link
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still occur try the below method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to reset the windows update component manually. Resetting Windows Update Components will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates quickly. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> on the keyboard and then select “<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)”</strong> from the menu.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Stop the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic</strong>, <strong>MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “<strong>ENTER</strong>” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>3. Now rename the <strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong> and <strong>Catroot2</strong> folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “<strong>ENTER</strong>” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>4. Now, let’s restart the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start bits </span>
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>5. Type<strong> Exit</strong> in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> to close it and then restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Disable anti-</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">virus program while installing Windows updates, if might detect some files as bug and the updates files might get corrupt during installation.</span></p>

<p>As I understand it, Microsoft 10 created a phantom F drive which prompts so many messages about drive space.</p>
<p>Surely, one would think that Microsoft 10 would repair this problem rather than require its users to repair the problem individually.</p>

    <title>Converting .OXPS to .TXT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> myselfthehairstylist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting .OXPS to .TXT</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to import a client list from an old salon computer with an older salon software to a new computer with a different salon program.&nbsp; According to the tech support website for the new salon program (Salon Iris) says that you can import a client
 list if it is in a .txt format.&nbsp; The exported list from the old computer is in a .oxps format, and I'm not 100% sure if Millenium is the name of the old program, but there is a logo on the client list with that name.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is a reliable way to format the file to .txt?&nbsp; The list has over 9,000 contacts on it, so I'm hoping to not have to manually enter it into the new program.&nbsp; We're using Windows 10 here in the salon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any questions and I'll answer them to the best of my ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Maria</p>

            Hi myselfthehairstylist ... first create a copy of the exported file just in case.
<br />Then right click the file and select Rename.
<br />Change it to a name you want and make sure to put .txt at the end so overwrite the oxps.
<br />See if that works.

            Hi Maria
<br />
<br />.oxps is an XML file format, the best application to open that in would be Excel and from there you can save that as a Text file or a comma separated text file . .. 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar)
<br />
<br />On the view Ribbon, temporarily turn on 'File Name Extensions' so you can see the file extension
<br />
<br />Create a copy of that file and change the .oxps file extension to .xml
<br />
<br />Then try opening that file in Excel, if you do not have Excel installed,try Excel online:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://office.live.com/start/Excel.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.live.com/start/Excel.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />If you still cannot open that file, copy that file to the Cloud (Onedrive, DrpBox . . .etc.) then provide a link here and i will convert that to text for you . . .

            <p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information below:</p>
<p>1. Are you able to access you phone?</p>
<p>2. When you state reboot again and again, do you mean that you phone is stuck in a restart loop?</p>
<p>3. How did you install Win 10 on your phone?</p>
<p>4. Did you install it after installing the Upgrade Advisor app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC is stuck in a restart loop, I suggest that you perform Soft Reset and check if you are able to&nbsp;access your phone. To learn how to do so, click on the link below</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10769/windows-10-mobile-restart-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10769/windows-10-mobile-restart-my-phone</a>&nbsp;

            <p>are you wanting to prevent windows 7 or 8 upgrading to windows 10? as the free offer has ended it should not be trying anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or are you trying to prevent windows 10 from getting updates?</p>
<p>stopping all updates would mean that you wont get the new features as they are rolled out, you wont get security updates (potentially leaving you vulnerable), you wont get defender updates meaning you wont get protection against the latest malware/viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is your windows 10 home or professional?</p>

<h2>            Changing my privacy &#38;amp&#59; online safety settings</h2>
                    
<p>Ever since I received my xbox one, I have been dealing with not being able to buy or download DLC unless it is free. I have tried to change my online privacy and online safety settings but every time I go there it seems to say the same thing "<span>your
 privacy settings are in effect but can't be changed until we connect to the service" I know that the issue is not that I am classified as a child because I have made other accounts and added them to my family to check if I can change my own settings through
 the new accounts but however it did not let me since I was listed as an adult, therefore I can do it myself. Is there a solution to this yet?</span></p>

<p>The solution should be indeed going to <a href="http://account.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.xbox.com</a> and fix your settings there once. After having them fixed there, your One should be connected to the service and you can change the settings then on the One again to your needs.

<p>Yeah it's like the xbox doesn't know what the privacy settings are &nbsp;so it's just restricting &nbsp;it until it gets &nbsp;like confirmation from the account that the settings allow us to buy things etc. so there's a problem with the xbox connecting to the account

<p>Ultrabook keyboards are small and the only way you can click on CTRL is your little finger, if the other button is too close (e.g. Z) it's not comfortable for the hands to click. Alt would have been much better.</p>

            <p>In early computers the Ctrl key was a modifier not a key in its own right but changed the output of the other keys when used in conjunction with it. This meant that the Control key on its own could not be detected.&nbsp;Although not now the case the process is
 emulated at a core level which would make it virtually impossible to assign that role to another key</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Alt key on its own does have a function (for example it will switch the Window focus to the Menu bar), the Ctrl key does not.</p>

                    I purchased my&nbsp;Surface Pro 4 in January 2017.&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the last 3 months, the device shuts down randomly.&nbsp; &nbsp;I recognize that this has been a problem for these laptops but mine does this with a good battery report, when plugged into the charger, when the
 battery is greater than 90% charged and with up-to-date updates (at least as of 3/1/2018).&nbsp; &nbsp;It does seem to be related to an update and a driver issue associated with the device itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;It could be related to the device not properly detecting that has power
 and a battery.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have noticed the charging icon stops moving and if I unplug the power cable and re-attach it, the icon starts moving and then again stops.&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot correlate the icon movement with the shut down.&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, I need to wait at least an hour
