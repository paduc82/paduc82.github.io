<h2>            Microsoft Planner avatars</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to change the color of the "avatar" for plans in planner?&nbsp; Several of the plans we've created are the same color but we would prefer each plan have a different color.&nbsp; Thanks!

<h2>            Linux users, avoid upgrading to 8.13.76.4</h2>
                    <p>Hello all</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I would like to share my experience to try to avoid&nbsp; waste of time and frustration to some of you.</p>
<p>I have been using Skype 8.10.0.4 on Linux Mint 18.3 Cinnamon, kernel 4.10.0-42 without any trouble.</p>
<p>After upgrading to 8.13.76.4, my webcam (logitech C525) is not found anymore by Skype ("no device found" error).</p>
<p>Getting back to 8.10.0.4 on exactly the same system allows me to recover all functionalities.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Actually, I made a mistake I corrected after my initial posting, upgrading to 8.11.0.4 works fine as well. It is the 8.13.76.4 that Mint offers as Preview which is an issue.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, @Microsoft support : at your disposal for any additional information if you would like some tests to be performed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Season Greetings!</p>

</p><p>You cannot really install a fresh copy of IE on Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try this (sort of) reinstall.</p>
<p>Turn&nbsp;off IE from Control Panel&gt; (Programs)&gt; Programs and Features&gt; turn Windows features on or off. Restart then turn IE&nbsp;back on.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In W7?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Uninstall the update that brought you IE11.&nbsp; That will return you to whatever level of browser functionality that you had when you first installed it.&nbsp; So, then you would be offered the update for your OS which includes IE11 again.&nbsp; However,
 be aware that you would also be uninstalling a lot of maintenance that you had accumulated in the interim and be forced to download and install any equivalent maintenance for that different version of the OS.&nbsp; I suspect it is a bad idea but it is a possibility
 if you really wanted to try it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For an alternative it would be useful to examine one of your "problems" in detail to see what is causing it.&nbsp; Then possibly you could fix that and then decide if you still really wanted to try to "re-install IE11".</p>

<h3> stick1000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there any way to create a self-destructing PowerPoint show&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using macro and&nbsp;form fields&nbsp;and&nbsp;I'm planning to let&nbsp;people fill the form, and will automatically save as pdf after form completion.&nbsp;However, I found out that using the same .ppsm file over and over will
<strong>retain</strong> the data entered by the previous person, causing different pdf saves having the
<strong>same</strong> data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the solutions I could think of to prevent this&nbsp;is&nbsp;to create a .ppsm that gets deleted after viewing. After deletion, a
<strong>new copy</strong> of the file will be made. Is there any way to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible solution is a <strong>VBA code </strong>that deletes every data entered in form fields after exiting the show, but I have a relatively weak grasp of VBA coding. Are there any VBA codes that could do this?</p>

            <p>Assuming that the user will fill out the form then click some kind of Submit button that'll trigger your code to create the PDF, you could add a call to this subroutine at the end of the code:</p>

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim oSh As Shape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim oSl As Slide<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each oSh In oSl.Shapes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If oSh.Type = msoOLEControlObject Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oSh.OLEFormat.Object.Text = ""<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next</p>
<p>
</p><p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the only developer controls you're using is text boxes, that should do it.&nbsp; If you've got other types of controls that don't have a .Text property or that you don't want to delete the text from, it'll take a bit more logic or errorhandling.&nbsp; But this'll
 get you started.</p>

            Hi Tina,
<br />You are using Outlook installed on your desktop, correct? What type of email account do you have configured in Outlook? POP, IMAP, Outlook.com, or Microsoft Exchange?  
<br />
<br />Whether mail is sent immediately or held for a bit depends on your settings. Go to File, Options, Advanced - is send immediately enabled? 
<br />
<br />If you look in the outbox do the messages have an envelope icon or a draft icon (looks like an open envelope &amp; paper)  
<br />
<br />I have other causes for mail not sending at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/problems/common-problems-that-cause-email-to-stay-in-the-outbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/problems/common-probl...</a>

            hi i am an independent adivisor at Microsoft would like to help u resolve your issue 
<br />
<br />An outbox is where outgoing e-mail messages are temporarily stored. While you are composing a message, most mail programs automatically save a draft of your message in the outbox. The message is then stored in the outbox until it is successfully sent to the recipient. Once the message has been sent, most e-mail programs move the message to the "Sent" or "Sent Messages" folder. While the terms "Outbox" and "Sent Messages" are often used synonymously, technically they have different meanings.  if mail is in outbox it means mail has not been sent..there may be different reason for it like interconnection or incorrect receiver address

            Hello TinaJones, <br />
<br />
I am sorry to hear that you are unable to send e-mails as they are stuck in your Outbox. I know how frustrating this can be, fret not, I am committed to help you to resolve this issue.
<br />
<br />
I am an Independent Advisor for MS Community and I am sorry to inform you that you have posted this thread in the wrong forum. The correct forum is
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum">
<em><strong>Office</strong></em></a><strong><em>&gt; <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook">
Outlook</a>.</em></strong> <em>(You don't have to create a new thread, simply edit it!)</em>
<br />
<br />
It is important for you to post your thread in the correct forum so that users equipped with the right expertise can better serve you. Nonetheless, I can try my best to help you with this issue.
<br />
<br />
In order for me to properly assist you, I need additional information from you: <br />
<br />
1. What is the <strong>account type</strong> did you setup your email as? (IMAP, POP3, Exchange ActiveSync)
<br />
2. What is your <strong>email service provider</strong>? <br />
3. Are you able to send e-mails from its <strong>web version</strong>? <br />
4. How long has this been an issue? <br />
5. Do you recall making any recent changes that could possibly result in this? <br />
6. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far? <br />
<br />
Unless you are using <strong>POP3</strong>, I suggest you to save the e-mails in your Outbox somewhere else then remove&amp;re-add your email account in Outlook and then try to send again.
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you may like to <strong>repair your Outlook Data Files</strong> (<code><strong>.pst</strong></code> and
<code><strong>.ost</strong></code> with <code>scanpst.exe</code> <br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>In older versions the root folder would bold making it clear i have something i need to scroll to see. Now there's no indication so if you miss the initial indication you may not find you have missed email easily.</p>

<br />
<br />Lately  Office 16.xxx version has been released and some features not working, you can try to rollback Office version to a previous one version that was working fine, take a look to the following link: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to-go-back-to-office-2016-for-mac-15-xx-versions-from-16-xx-e88ed6c8-6fb4-40a1-9540-529000d3d20f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to...</a>

<h2>            Nokia 5233 touch screen problems</h2>
                    
<p>Sometimes when someone calls me and I try to receive the call by pressing the touch screen button on my 5233, the button does not respond and I have to pick up the call by pressing the green button. Other times it works fine.</p>
<p>Since the &nbsp;problem is not regular when I visited the nokia service center they could not provide any solution.</p>
<p>Would you please suggest something.</p>

            I'd suggest trying a couple of steps to see if that corrects the problem for you.
<br />
<br />1) First, an add-in or extension may be causing the problem. Start the application in Office Safe Mode. 
<br />
<br />The instructions to start Office in safe mode are here:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-O...</a>
<br />
<br />2) If that doesn't correct the problem, try repairing the installation.
<br />
<br />The instructions to follow to do this are here:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />3) Create a new user profile in Windows and see if it works correctly for the new profile

    <title>Apply Conditional Formatting to a column based on column A value - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Apply Conditional Formatting to a column based on column A value</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am struggling with a Conditional Formatting rule that I want to apply to a excel sheet. Basically I have a dropdown list in column A and depending on what activity is selected from this dropdown I want to grey out some of the columns as not all columns
 are required to be filled in for each activity. I can create this rule with no issues for the first row using the 'Use a formula to determine which cells to format' rule directing it to the lookup table but when I try and format paint to the rest of the column
 it won't apply. I either get nothing or the entire column greys out when I select an activity from the first row.</p>
<p>Any suggestions greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intention understood but expected result not quite clear. When you select an activity from the drop down in column A some columns should be colored, OK. But is this the entire columns that should be colored OR only the cells at the intersection of those
 columns and the row of the drop down list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm under the impression you expect something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d78aeb2-8e6d-4a7d-9cff-62566b882d6e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d78aeb2-8e6d-4a7d-9cff-62566b882d6e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li>if I select <strong>A</strong> in drop down list in&nbsp;<strong>A2</strong> activities Act1, Act 3, Act5, Act6 and Act 10 must be colored</li><li>if I select <strong>B</strong> <span>in drop down list in&nbsp;</span><strong>A3</strong>,
<span>activities Act 2, Act 4, Act 7, Act 8 and Act 9 must be colored</span></li><li><span>…</span></li></ul>
<p><span>If not at all what you want please upload a screenshot with a couple of expected result &amp; explain the corresponding logic</span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. Essentially if I make a selection from the dropdown in column A i need certain cells along that row to be coloured but not the entire column as different selections will be made in each row. I have attached a screenshot so hope this
 helps.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar to what I posted but always the same color so there's an opportunity for only 1 Cond Format rule:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In a seperate sheet (can be hidden later) setup a Table where the headers will be the same as all your activity types (Service, Revalidation…)</li><li>Below each activity type list all column names (according to your main Table headers) that matches what you want to color/highlight, example</li></ul>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/72495256-4ec9-423e-8175-af536a06ba46?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/72495256-4ec9-423e-8175-af536a06ba46?upload=true" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming the above Table is named <em><strong>ActivityLists</strong></em>, your main Table sits in&nbsp;<strong><em>Sheet1</em></strong> and your 1st Actitity drop down is in
<strong>A2</strong>, create a Defined name, ie. <em><strong>SwithActivityList</strong></em>, with formula<br />
</li><li>=OFFSET(ActivityLists[[#Headers],[Service]],1,MATCH(<strong><em>Sheet1</em></strong><em><strong>!$A2</strong></em>,ActivityLists[#Headers],0)-1,ROWS(ActivityLists))</li><li>In your main Table select all cells from B2 to <strong>L6</strong> (adjust L6 to your last column + last row</li><li>Cond. Format &gt; New rule &gt; Use a formula to determine…:<br />
</li><li>=COUNTIF(SwithActivityList,B$1)</li><li>Select the desired higlighting format</li><li>…</li></ul>

<p><span>Not sure. at all. Only thing I'm sure is each time you'll use the painter you'll create an addition Cond. Format rule ==&gt; More CF rules you have, more difficult it is to maintain them + Overall performances might decrease</span></p>

<h2>            Helvetica font issue</h2>
                    <p>I am creating WORD 2016 documents using Helvetica Fonts. They look and print fine from my computer. But, when they are uploaded to Box.com, the font changes. What is the issue here? I upgraded to Windows 10 late in the summer of 2016 and that is when the
 problem started. Prior to that, the integrity of the document was fine. The same think is happening on my laptop so I know its an issue with Windows 10.</p>

            I am doing both. I create the document in WORD. Then I convert it to a pdf format. And finally, I upload them both to Box.com.&nbsp; The pdf always uploads perfectly. However, the WORD document often has converted the font that looks like script but when you
 upload it back into WORD, the correct font is present. I am so confused about why this is happening.<br />

            Helvetica is not a standard Microsoft font and may not be available at Box.com. You will have to embed the font in the Word document (<strong>File | Options | Save: Embed fonts in the file</strong>). This will make the file much larger. Another approach
 is to use Arial instead; it is not the same but has the same font metrics, so the document should render the same.

            Tried this but it did not work. Still have the same problem. I would change the font if I could but it is a corporate regulation that I have to follow. It doesn't happen with every WORD file. That is why it is so bizarre.&nbsp;

            If the typeface on the screen is cut on the top, it suggests that your paragraphs are formatted with an exact line spacing that is too small. &nbsp;Change the line spacing to Single, or to a value that is at least 120% of the font size.

<p>Helvetica is not a standard Windows font. Word versions after 2010 reportedly do not support Adobe Type 1 fonts - see for example
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_windows8/pfmpfb-fonts-dont-work-in-word-2013/6ebd7ffe-0bf1-4663-b2af-21cb2e81187c">

</p>
<p>You may be able to download a TTF version of Helvetica to correct the problem - or change to a different font.</p>

<h2>            Office Pro 2016&#58; Getting rid of Let&#39;s Get Started screen on startup</h2>
                    <p>Got a new HP laptop and purchased and installed Office Pro 2106. It works fine, but every single time I open any of the applications, I get the "Let's Get Started : Try Buy Activate" screen. The first time I used Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, I entered my
 activation key. But the screen still appears. I then saw that Office 365 had been pre-installed, so I uninstalled it. It no longer appears in the list of programs in the Control Panel. But I still get the Let's Get Started screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get rid of this?<br />

<p>You can back up the registry by creating a System Restore Point , or you can back it up manually:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. From the Start menu, in the search box, type regedit.exe , and then press <strong>
Enter</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
2. In <strong>Registry Editor</strong>, locate and click the registry key or subkey that you want to back up.<br />
3. Click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Export</strong>.<br />
4. In the <strong>Export Registry File</strong> dialog box, select the location where you want to save the backup copy to, and then type a name for the backup file in the
<strong>File name</strong> field.<br />
5. Click <strong>Save</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This should help you with your concern.</p>

            I for one am so excited to try them out. my mind turns towards games for uses and was kinda blown away at how they are the opposite of what oculus if going for. a true full dive expieriance is still a ways ahead, but bringing the world out to you seems
 like an obtainable really fun scenario. I have not looked up any prices for the hololens's yet, but they do seem like they will be pricey.&nbsp; I am kind of hoping for a version that can be tethered to a pc somehow. i wouldn't mind a usb version to be more cost
 effective :D

<h2>            publisher not responding message</h2>
                    While I'm working in Publisher, I keep getting "publisher not responding" and I have to wait til it starts responding before I can do anything. &nbsp;It does this about every 30 seconds. &nbsp;It's taking forever for me to get anything done. &nbsp;I have tried everything
 I have seen on other posts to do and nothing seems to make it better. &nbsp;What should take 10 minutes is taking about an hour. &nbsp;I'll even switch to another program if there is one that can allow me to do what I do in Publisher. &nbsp; &nbsp;Any suggestions?

            <p>It is difficult to help when someone says "I have tried everything I have seen..." without listing what you have tried. I am always tempted to pass on these type of questions as I don't want to waste my time suggesting fixes you have already tried. Next
 time help us help you by actually listing what steps you have taken to troubleshoot and fix your problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>With that said I will make two suggestions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First compress all your images to no more than 300 dpi and 220 would be even better.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second go to View &gt; check Graphics Manager &gt; click <em>Change picture display...
</em>at the bottom of the Graphic Manager pane &gt; Check Fast resize and zoom option.</p>

    <title>Why do pages reformat when I save or print&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

                    <div><i>WHY DO PAGES REFORMAT WHEN I SAVE OR PRINT?</i></div>
Just about on my last nerve with Word 2010! I always work in print layout, assuming this means that the format is as will be on my installed default printer, but apparently not because when I click print (or save), it reformats the pages layout and I have to
 manually switch back and forth from print preview to home and fix all the gaps and tabs, very frustrating and time consuming on a 30+ page document. What is the problem here?

<div><b>Method 1:</b></div>
<div>Try opening Word in safe mode and to save the file and check the result:</div>

<div>Also, try to change your default printer and check if everything works fine. If yes then you need to update the print driver, or contact your printer manufacturer to uninstall and reinstall the print driver

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This Problem Usually happens only for Windows XP and Vista where you have upgrade to Higher version of Browsers.<br />
You need to Uninstall the Internet Explorer and Reinstall it back again.<br />
<br />
Thats the Fix for the Issue.<br />
&nbsp;It will work perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
<br />

</p><p>The small globe icon used to be found in the classic version (<em>7.xx</em>) of Skype, but it is no longer available for that version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start a translated chat or call, you need to use the new versions of Skype. For more information, please refer to this article:

            Seems your are not using Exchange account or Office 365 or Outlook.com. This feature is available only for Exchange account and Office 365 and Outlook.com not for POP3, IMAP etc..
<br />
<br />Please confirm on this. However, simulation of this is possible. Use the below link for the help on this -

            What type of account are you using, POP, IMAP, or Exchange? I'm assuming you're using a Windows PC. What version of Windows (although I doubt that's a factor)?
