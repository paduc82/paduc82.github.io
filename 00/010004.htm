<h2>            build 14332 - start, notification, edge don&#39;t work</h2>
                    After the new build installed, Start no longer responds.&nbsp; Can right-click, but not regular click.&nbsp; Same for notifications, and Edge.&nbsp; Tried all the answers in the forums including Powershell, new accounts, even tried new MediaCreation tool which also failed.

<p>Thanks for the quick suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run all the commands you suggested.&nbsp; Each one completed correctly with no errors found.&nbsp; I have restarted, but unfortunately, nothing is working yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing an editor, and found that I am getting an installation error saying that "another installation is in progress".&nbsp; I checked under Task Manager, and indeed, Windows Installer is shown as running.&nbsp; I killed that process, restarted, but no
 change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the last build install did not complete some component and the system is hung in that state.&nbsp; OTOH, all the check programs report no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the ISO install next.</p>
<p>

            <p>OK, I tried the System Restore.&nbsp; There was only one restore point offered, and it was for an Intel Management Engine update.&nbsp; The restore worked, but no change in the loss of Start menu et. al.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned that the Media Creation Tool failed to work with an error.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded an Insider Preview ISO (build 14295) and tried running that.&nbsp; In the options, I chose "keep all files, apps and settings".&nbsp; This was rejected saying that I could not install unless everything was wiped as "the Windows installation may be in
 an unsupported directory"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never changed any defaults, so don't understand where the problem is coming from.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was happy with Win10 and so had gone ahead and installed a lot of stuff.&nbsp; I really don't want to erase everything and start over.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas on how to rescue this situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everybody for taking the time to help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi...how can a restore point work when the issue started after the new build was installed?...can't happen...you&nbsp; could 'Go back to previous build' if that choice is available and try to upgrade from there....</p>
<p>Can you copy the 'install.esd' file and make an ISO of 14332?...save it to a USB stick and THEN 'go back to previous build'... THEN use the ISO to upgrade...or try to download 14332 again but we would probably have to tweek the registry to start the download
 again.</p>
<p>I know this losing the Start menu is a pain in the ....but why it happened?...don't know...is it the first time?...I've never lost the start menu...</p>
<p>My brothers system did and I had to do 'Clean install' {last week}...it is working just fine....but he is not on an Insider program.</p>

            <p>First establish that you have what is needed to reinstall Office 2010--your installation discs or installation file and your product key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then be sure to backup your docs and data, just in case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, uninstall Office 2010 (and any other Office editions/versions&nbsp;or Activation Assistants for Office) &nbsp;from your computer using the FixIt uninstaller(s) here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now do a clean installation of Office 2010 on your computer.&nbsp; Be sure to log onto the computer with an Administrator-level account to do the installation.&nbsp; Complete the installation, activate and restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now go to Windows/Microsoft update to get any available Office updates.&nbsp; Restart as necssary.</p>

            Hi William, sorry, I was offline
<br />
<br />Of that is stuck, your best option is to restart your PC, then uninstall and re-install Office . . .
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, select Install Office - Install

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to confrim whether they request an App password/2 factor authentication or other settings for the security. If yes and you are using IMAP method to connect to this account in the Outlook client, try removing this account and then re-add it again
 with the app password to see if it works.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Proving non receipt of an email</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone has stated they sent me an important email back in April which has cost me a lot of money (a debt repayment) because I didn't act on it. &nbsp;However my inbox and spam folder shows no such email was ever received. (this was an ovi.com email address used
 by nokia that was due to close, however I followed the instruction they gave for importing all messages received inot outlook and received other emails on the same day without a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked the sender, who had a financial incentive to claim an email was sent, to prove it was sent by forwarding the email again to me with all of the headers open so I could see where it hit the various servers etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However suspiciously they have refused to do this simply sending a screenshot of the email stating sent, which I don't believe. The only other information they are prepared to give is the name of their smtp mail server stating I can use this to check with
 my provider if it was received.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Question is can I check with just this information and to whom would I ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help gratefully received &nbsp;</p>

 because of an error in the Microsoft PowerPoint previewer" If you need any other info please let me know and thanks for the help.

<p>Unfortunately the preview pane from the open document window will not show the preview. As a work around you can preview the files by opening the files from explorer.</p>

<p>This is not a very useful answer.&nbsp; Opening and closing every Powerpoint file is time consuming.</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 with Office 2010 on a Dell 600M laptop.&nbsp; In Windows Explorer, the document previewer works for Word and Excel but not for Powerpoint.&nbsp; I get the&nbsp;"File can't be previewed because of an error in the Microsoft Powerpoint previewer" message.&nbsp;
 However, if I start Powerpoint Previewer, it does preview the files. Further, someone else in my office who is running Windows 7 &amp; Office 2010 is able to preview the files in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; I uninstalled and reinstalled the previewer with no change.&nbsp; I
 ran the system scan.</p>
<p>What else can I do?</p>
<p>P.S. I also have trouble linking to .mpg files in Powerpoint 2010 files (.pptx) getting the messager codec not installed.&nbsp; After saving the files as .ppt files, I have no trouble inserting and playing them.&nbsp;</p>

I am running the same confirguration and having the same problem. Ironically, it works fine on my laptop, but not my desktop system. It was working after fresh install, however, it appears software I've installed along the way may have somehow interfered with
 it. I have checked the associations in the registry, and they are the correct ones - which is what is baffling me. Any one find a solution to this hopefully - doesn't appear to be a top priority on MS list since folsk have been having these problems since
 Office 2007 came out.

            <p>I'm sorry, but this is not an answer and is not helpful. </p>
<p>Obviously the window is supposed to show the preview, otherwise we wouldn't get an error message: "This file can't be previewed because of an error in the Microsoft PowerPoint previewer".

            I have this problem and have just ignored it for the past year. But, what I see here in "Answers" is really pathetic on the part of Microsoft.&nbsp; I "repaired" my Office 2010 thinking that would solve the problem, but it didn't. This is the kind of shoddy
 software practice and design&nbsp;that reflects poorly on the "Microsoft Brand"--ignoring the small things that impact the user experience and communicates that no one really cares at Microsoft.

<p>Hi Kfreas,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There are many
</span><span>factor</span><span>s may cause the messages fail to deliverable. Such as the email is reject by the server of the
</span><span>recipient</span><span>, the email address is unavailable and so on. To clarify the specified reason of the undeliverable messages you encountered, I''d like to know more detailed information. According to your description,
 you received the non-delivery report messages when failing to send the emails out. Would you please send us the non-delivery report messages via private message as a attachment? You can send us the private message by clicking the following link. We need it
 to further investigation. Thanks.</span></p>

<h3> andrewgarza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Embedded Attachments in Calendar Invites won&#39;t open&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In our environment we use Windows 7 and Microsoft Office Professional 2010 and we are currently experiencing an issue with Outlook where attachments embedded in the body of a calendar invite will not open. The following error message is received:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"The program used to create this object is Outlook. That program is either not installed on your computer or it is not responding. To edit this object, install Outlook or ensure that any dialog boxes in Outlook are closed."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter what type of file is attached or who the sender is. If it is an ordinary email with attachments, they work. It only happens with calendar invites. This just started happening which makes me wonder whether or not Microsoft released a corrupt
 update last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our current workaround is to Copy and Paste the attachment onto the Desktop and open it from there but now some users are reporting that the workaround is not working for them. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Another workaround this problem is to first save your theme as a custom theme:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to the Design Tab</li><li>Click the down arrow on the main themes gallery</li><li>Click "Save Current Theme"</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This action&nbsp;will dissociate the theme from any in-box theme that you may have started with to create your custom theme.&nbsp; Next, apply your custom theme to your current presentation:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to Design Tab</li><li>Click the down arrow on the main themes gallery</li><li>Select the theme you just saved, or if it's not showing up click "Browse for Themes..."</li></ol>
<p>Now, when you switch between 16:9 and 4:3 (or any other slide size), your custom formatting will be preserved.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile&#58; This page is having a problem loading</h2>
                    <p>Tried to search via google.com ... (to put this in other words: <strong>EDGE is not able to display a web page</strong>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search result is displayed for a while (2-3 seconds)</li><li>Then EDGE swithces to a url ms-apps://.... (for 0,5 seconds)</li><li>Displaying This page is having a problem loading message</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Full message (step 3):</p>
<p>This page is having a problem loading</p>
<p>We tried to load this page for you a few times, but there is still a problem with this site. We know you have better things to do than to watch this page reload over and over again so try coming back to this page later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this</p>
<span>Open a new tab</span>
<span>Open a new tab</span>
<p>
</p><p>The message is right in "We know you have better things to do than to watch this page" ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Closing/starting EDGE does not help, which is odd for me since Windows 10 Mobile is a "sand-boxed" OS ... Only soft-reset helps. But do not like to soft-reset each time the EDGE does not work ...</p>

    <title>Deleted subfolders from Inbox reappear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sashaver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleted subfolders from Inbox reappear</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook 2010. I have several email accounts, but in this IMAP account I accidentally created a subfolder in the Inbox that I want to delete. Every time I delete (with or without Shift) it reappears. As well I don't know why the inbox has subfolders
 called "Deleted Items, Drafts, Junk Email and Sent Items" when all of these folders are located elsewhere as well.</p>
<p>Is it because of the iPhone access to the IMAP account as well?</p>
<p>If I rename the folder to something else it renames itself back to the original folder name once I close and reopen Outlook.</p>
<p>Picture attached</p>

 Keyboard, Mouse and Controller. I have an HP Laptop running Windows 10 that is not part of the Insider Preview and the controllers work just fine on that machine. I have 2 controllers that I've tested. A XBOX 360 wired Controller and a Logitech F710 Wireless
 controller. Both Controllers work fine on the NON-Insider PC but neither work on the 10565 Insider Preview Build. I've read on other sites that some people have fixed this problem by rolling back the driver. Since I did a Clean Install of Build 10565 I'm not
 able to roll back. The Driver on my 10565 Build is 10.0.10565.0 dated 10.6.2015.&nbsp; The Driver on my NON-Insider Laptop is 10.0.10240.16384 dated 7.9.15 I tried to roll back the Controller Driver but it would not roll back. I thought then I would just copy the
 Driver (xusb33.sys) from the other PC but was told that I didn't have authority to rename that file so I could replace it with the file from my other Windows 10 PC. Does anyone have a solution?</p>

<p>This procedure did not help at all. In fact I had already tried this solution. I tried it again but it did not help at all.&nbsp;As I&nbsp;stated in my first post, I use both&nbsp;the XBOX 360 Wired Controller and the Logitech F710 Wireless Controller on my&nbsp;Windows 10
 RTM HP Laptop with no problems. So there is no problem with these 2 devices. In fact I used both these devices on this machine with no problem when it was running Windows 7. The I did a Clean Install of Windows 10 Insider Preview 10565 Build and that when
 the problem appeared. The problem occurs only on the Insider Preview 10565 Build machine. If I move the Controller to the Windows 10 RTM machine no problems there. On other Websites people are reporting this problem. Somehow they are able to roll back to an
 older Driver to solve the problem. However, I've been unable to roll back the XBOX 360 Controller Driver probably because I did a Clean Install of Windows 10 so there are no older drivers on this machine. I&nbsp;thinking of copying the XBOX 360 Controller Driver
 from the other machine&nbsp;and using it to replace the Driver on this 10565 machine. However when I try that I'm unable&nbsp;to complete that procedure. I intended to rename XUSB22.SYS to XUSB22.SAV and then replace&nbsp; the&nbsp;Driver with the one from the other machine.
 When I tried to rename the Driver I didn't have authority to complete the rename. So I just&nbsp;held off on that idea.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to update the driver using the driver from the other computer but that process ended with the message that the best driver was already being used. So right now I'm not sure what to try next. Please advise me if you have anything else that may
 resolve this problem. Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>I also uninstalled the Driver, rebooted and then tried an XBOX ONE Controller using a Mini-USB Cable. It acted just like the XBOX 360 Controller. These controllers start out looking like they are working. The buttons and Joy Sticks seem to work but it appears
 that as soon as I pull the Right Trigger control passes over to the mouse and keyboard but the controller buttons still seem to work. So then the game starts using a combination of Controller, Keyboard &amp; Mouse.&nbsp;I own 2 XBOX ONE's and 2 XBOX 360's and 2 other
 PC running the RTM Windows 10. The controllers&nbsp;work with the XBOXs and other Windows 10 RTM PCs. They also worked with this HP Desktop when it was running Windows 7. The problem appeared with the Clean install of the 10565 Insider Preview of Windows 10.

<h2>            Has anyone been able to embed video in Word 2013&#63;</h2>
                    Has anyone been able to get the Online Video feature to work?<br />
<br />
I've tried:<br />
<ul>
<li>Searching Bing and clicking a video</li><li>Searching YouTube and clicking a video</li><li>Using YouTube's embed code (standard and old-style)</li><li>Using YouTube's URLs (long and short)</li><li>Using Vimeo's embed code</li><li>Using Vimeo's URLs</li></ul>
Sometimes the inserted object showed a poster frame, and sometimes not. <b>In all cases</b>, when I clicked the Play button of the inserted object, Word displayed a large, black box with no picture and no sound.<br />
<br />
But I have no trouble using this feature in PowerPoint 2013. The videos play right off the bat when running a presentation.<br />
<br />
Running the x64 version of Word 15.0.4420.1017 (Office Pro 15.0.4433.15.6) and Win 8 version 6.2.9200.

            I see the same behavior in Word (32-bit) on Windows 8 (64-bit). Like you, I also see it working properly in PowerPoint.<br />
<br />
Embedded video also works properly in the same edition of Word on Windows 7 (64-bit).<br />
<br />
I'll try to report this to the Word developers. The bug might be in their area or in Windows 8.<br />

            The fix for this issue was released today as part of a security update to the Adobe Flash Player in Internet Explorer 10, KB2805940. It should be offered to all supported editions of Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT through Windows Update
 (yep, this is Patch Tuesday). If you don't get automatic updates, you can download the specific update from

            I'm having this same problem, except I'm on Windows 7. <br />
<br />
It won't work if I search for a video or use an embed code using the Insert Online Video feature. It says the browser I'm using is unsupported, but I'm using the latest release of Firefox.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice!<br />

            The browser you use to find a video or an embed code has nothing to do with the problem, because Word internally calls the Internet Explorer code to display the video in Word.<br />
<br />
Microsoft has been pushing out Internet Explorer 10 through Windows Update to users of Windows 7 (it's part of Windows 8 by default). Since you use Firefox, you may not have noticed the update. Open Internet Explorer and press Alt+H and then A to get the About
 dialog. If it's version 10, use Windows Update to look for a patch.<br />

            Yes, some people have reported problems installing Visio 365 and or Project 365 along with an Office 365 bundle.&nbsp; I do not remember a specific fix.<br />

</b></span>
<p>I recently used online chat support myself. I found it had several advantages over phone support, even though you still contact the same outsourced, support personnel:</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No ESL accent issues</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Provides instant time stamped transcript</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When you get transferred to the “right” person, they can review the history</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If they don’t read history, you can copy / paste the past conversation to them, saving you having to repeat yourself</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>They are more likely to go off line to ask other people for help (good for you)</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You don’t have to listen to “elevator muzak” then they are off line</p>
<p>
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You have 2 hands free to surf the web then they are not talking to you</p>
<p>that waiting for online chat responses less frustrating than listening to elevator music.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And when I was handed off to someone else who asked redundant questions, I simply copy and pasted the earlier replies I had given.
</p>
<p>Plus it immediately gives you a timestamped transcript which you can share with the world ... &lt;grin&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
<b><span>Get a “Bigger Stick” working for you – The Media</span></b>
<p>If all else fails, “shout louder”. </p>
<p>As an alternate approach, “get a bigger stick”. As single individuals we are pretty powerless. But there are various “media personalities” that can help ie radio/TV/Newspaper/Internet “ombudsmen”. They have large audiences and
 companies want to avoid bad press. When a well-known (loud mouth) media personality exposes bad customer service it can have a big, negative, long term effect on the company. So it is easier and cheaper, and better PR, to simply give the customer anything
 to get them to go away.</p>
<p>So, try to get one or more “reporters” to help you.

<h3> byte99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Migrating to OLDER Outlook for Mac &#40;Office 365 -&#62; Office 2016&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm interested in migrating Outlook (FOR MAC) in the opposite of the usual direction, from Office 365 to Office 2016 (15.21.1). &nbsp;The reason is that I have to temporarily use an older MacBook Pro (while I send my current one for repair), and it's a 2008 Core
 2 Duo (8 GB RAM) with El Capitan (10.11.6), so I've been advised not to try to run 365 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I have this loaner, I want to continue to use Outlook as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing the usual (exporting my Outlook 365 database as a *.olm file, and then importing it into Outlook 2016), but the result was unsatisfactory. My IMAP account emails showed up, but under an Archive folder rather than in the normal place, and my
 POP account email (i.e., the one in the "On My Computer" folder) didn't show up at all. In addition, the process didn't import my various email account configurations (passwords, incoming and outgoing servers, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to just copy-paste the Outlook 365 database from ~/Library/Group Containers, but got a warning message that I need the latest version of Outlook to use that database, and I can't install the latest version because my computer is too old (the
 most recent version of Office 2016 it lets me install is 15.21.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what should I do? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PLEASE NOTE THIS IS OUTLOOK FOR MAC; OUTLOOK FOR WINDOWS DIRECTIONS WON'T APPLY!</p>

            Hi Byte,
<br />So you have a POP and an IMAP?  
<br />
<br />For the IMAP you just need to set the account up on the new computer.
<br />For POP (and calendar/contacts): export the 'on my computer' folders to an olm and import it. 
<br />
<br />If you just want to move the data, it is stored at  ~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook
<br />Copy it to the other system, replacing the folders on the new computer.

</p><p>Yes, both POP and IMAP. &nbsp;My principal email account runs on an older server that's fast and reliable (better on both counts than gmail), but that works best with POP</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did manually configure all the accounts, so the system has imported everything that was on their respective servers, so I've got working email going forward. &nbsp;But:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the export/import as olm, but it stuck the old emails in an Archive folder, and didn't import any of my POP account Drafts. &nbsp;I suppose I can live with that temporarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try moving the data (I moved the entire&nbsp;<span>~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office</span>), and got an error message saying that database requires the latest version of Outlook (as I mentioned in my OP)</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Byte99,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Based on your description, when you manually configured your accounts into Outlook for Mac, the system has imported everything in the servers. This indicates the Outlook 2016 for Mac on
 your old machine is working and your accounts are Ok too.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For imported emails in the Outlook for Mac, I'd like to share something about it with you. When you imported emails from olm files in the Outlook for Mac, there would
 be some new folders created under On My Computer folder in the Outlook for Mac, and the imported emails would be saved into the new folder under On My Computer folder. These folders are separated from your POP or IMAP accounts, they are pure-local folders
 &nbsp; ( data). So when you imported emails into the Outlook for Mac 2016， the old emails didn't appears in your POP draft folder. &nbsp;For more details, you can refer to</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import-email-messages-contacts-and-other-items-into-outlook-for-mac-6cc48404-a65c-4b8c-a12a-95a905249414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import-email-messages-contacts-and-other-items-into-outlook-for-mac-6cc48404-a65c-4b8c-a12a-95a905249414</span></a><span>.

<p>Hi Oliver,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my current (Office 365) Outlook, all the emails from my POP account go into the "On My Computer" folder. &nbsp;I.e., the "On My Computer" folder is actually my POP account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the same thing in the Office 2016 Outlook I just created, except that, in addition, I have a separate "On My Computer" folder that contains the imported emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that, in looking more closely, the import feature didn't import any of my POP account email folders (neither Inbox, nor Sent Items, nor Drafts). &nbsp; &nbsp;But since this is temporary, I can live with it.</p>
<p>

<br />I did the export/import as olm, but it stuck the old emails in an Archive folder, and didn't import my Drafts 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />When you import, it always goes into the same folder in the 'On My Computer' folders. You can't change where it imports to but you should be able to move the mail to other folders. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />I did try moving the data (I moved the entire~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office), and got an error message saying that database requires the latest version of Outlook (as I indicated in my OP).
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Do you have all updates for 2016 installed?  If so, and if you still get the error, you'll need to import. 2016 and 365 are essentially the same but some builds have an updated database.

<p>Yes, I have all the 2016 updates installed, but it will only update to&nbsp;<span>15.21.1. &nbsp;That system is apparently too old to update further. &nbsp; So it would seem I don't&nbsp;have the updated database.</span></p>

<p>Hi Byte99,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply and patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you said&nbsp; you have a separated "On My Computer" folder that contains the imported emails, this indicates you have successfully imported emails into the Outlook 2016 for Mac. &nbsp;Just as Diane said, the imported emails woul be saved into On My Computer folder,
 and we cannot change which folders to be imported, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, if you concerned about the POP accounts folders not being imported or other information about the errors when you tried to copy the data from Library/Group/Containers folder. We have a dedicated support channel for Outlook for Mac, it is recommended
 that please contact the dedicated support channel for Outlook for Mac via clicking
 to your problem, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your understanding and patience will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>

            Hi Bonnie, <br />
<br />
<strong>Chances are good that there was a preinstalled trial version that is being triggered.
</strong><br />
<br />
<em>Unless a license for Office 365 was included with your purchase, you need to actually subscribe. Many new computers include a trial version of Office 365 but not an actual permanent license.
</em><br />
<br />
If it is a trial version on your computer and you want features other than those in the trial version, you need to uninstall the trial version and then install the one you want.
<br />
<br />
For online purchases product keys are not provided. To download and install Office 365 or 2016, you may login to the My Account page on Office.com with the Microsoft account you used to register or purchase.
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />
If you have purchased Office 365 or 2019 from a retail store (Product Key Package), then you may register the purchased product key with the Microsoft Account and then download and install Office. Refer to the following link to sign in or create a Microsoft
 account to download and install Office 365. <br />

<strong>Can't find Microsoft Office in your list to uninstall? </strong><br />
<em>You may have pre-installed Microsoft Office StoreDesktop Apps (Centenial Version). This version doesn't appear in the Control Panel (nor is there a Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app for Outlook in this release)

            Hi BonnieMay
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in
<br />
<br />On that page under your info, check that you can see your Office 2019 licence listed under your account
<br />
<br />If that checks out, click this link and run through the Office activation troubleshooter:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlicensed-product-and-activation-errors-in-office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlice...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you, follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation, including activation . . .
