                    Hi, I heard that creators update has been rolled out globally. But I also read that it's device specific and this time Microsoft 540 would not get the creators update. Is it true and why?

<p>Don't you think its a big mistake by MS. Already the number of Windows phone users are handful in the world. Instead of making the current devices or OS come up to the expectations of users and match up to the competitors OS, they are rolling out updates
 that can be used in new devices Windows phone only. I have never seen anyone interested in buying a Windows Phone in recent times, and its a very known fact. Then why would MS go and roll out updates for new hardware. I am really disappointed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However i like my 540 since it never slowed down since the time I bought it. I hope MS will concentrate on bringing up the current devices and OS and not just simply stop their support to older ones .</p>

    <title>Microsoft word keeps crashing with large files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rachelosolen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft word keeps crashing with large files</h2>
                    <p>I work for a small company that edits the layout of ebooks in Microsoft Word to be transferred to DAISY readers. The team is using 2017, 2011, and 2010 versions of Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We often work with very large files. &nbsp;We use the <strong>navigation pane</strong>, and the
<strong>style pane</strong> to do all our edits. &nbsp;We also insert photo captions, and end/footnotes when needed. Some of our larger files will crash on us when we are editing. &nbsp;It often happens when we go to
<strong>reveal styles in use</strong> on the <strong>style pane</strong>. This is a function we need in order to reformat the book properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our main work around is to clear all formatting at the beginning of the editing process, and then build up the formatting as we move forward. &nbsp;We also sometimes re save any images as .jpeg and re enter the images to see if that will help the issue. &nbsp;This
 is a short term fit at the beginning of the editing process. &nbsp;Once we are close to completion the file inevitably gets bigger and word crashes again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a work around for this? &nbsp;If you need more details about our editing process I am willing to share if that helps.</p>

<p>Even though officially you can open Word files in different versions than they were created, to play it safe, you should try to use the same version as the file was created in.&nbsp; LONG ago, I was able to consistently&nbsp; corrupt my document when editing it on
 2 different machines using different versions.&nbsp; I have not heard of that being a current issue, but you never know.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How "large" are these files, in kb or mb?&nbsp; I regularly (daily) work in a file that is currently around 38GB and has approached 50GB at times.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the "limits" for Word, do you think you are approaching any of them?</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/211489/operating-parameter-limitations-and-specifications-in-word" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/211489/operating-parameter-limitations-and-specifications-in-word</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the hardware specs on the computers that are having problems.&nbsp; Specifically how much RAM do they have.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you already try to start with a "clean" document, how about going a step farther.&nbsp; Do a SAVE AS to TXT format.&nbsp; This will STRIP ALL formatting from the file, leaving text only.&nbsp; Then Save As to DOCX format and apply normal style as a starting point.&nbsp;
 You will have to re-insert all images etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option is if you suspect you are approaching the point of a failure, split the file. Work on the sections, then when you are finished working merge the files again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well, you should be keeping frequent backup copies. If you can get it to work, Win 8/10 "File History" is a good option.&nbsp; Or you can use the versioning provided by Onedrive.&nbsp; Apparently Mac also has some sort of version history.&nbsp; Or you can simply do
 it manually.&nbsp; Periodically make a copy with a new file name.&nbsp; You can do it through Save AS or by closing the file in Word and making the copy in File Explorer.&nbsp; I like to add a suffix to the file ie Ver 001, VER 002 Ver 003&nbsp; or a date time&nbsp; 2017-07-17 14-00-00.
 That way they sort "correctly" in file explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on how serious the problem is, ie how frequently it happens, AND how close to completion the project is determines how frequently I make these backups.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As well, you should take a look at this free ebook for Book Editors. you may find some useful macros in it</p>

    <title>Access vs. Excel - Managing data from survey results - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phill_r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access vs. Excel - Managing data from survey results</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I'm doing a survey out to 1300 people, expecting around 600 responses. It's a survey consisting of multiple choice as well as open-ended questions (e.g. comments on our service). This is the first time I've ever done a survey and needed to report
 back on the results, so it's a little bit daunting :).</p>
<p>My two concerns are"<br />
1) How to manage the data results.<br />
2) How to manipulate the data and extract interesting information for my report.</p>
<p>I have intermediate experience with Excel (e.g. just started teaching myself Pivot Tables), very basic with Access (only from a user-standpoint / never made queries).</p>
<p>I'm generally a fast learner so don't mind learning new skills for either software.</p>
<p>I'm wondering what other people think I should use, or what would be the better software for this purpose. If they could provide any resources (e.g. online tutorials/examples) to help guide me, that'd be muchly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Regarding which one to use.&nbsp; Generally Access people prefer Access and Excel people prefer Excel.&nbsp; So I will stick my neck out and make some tentative observations:</p>
<p>1. Depending on how many question and what type of data - numerical or verbal (text) Access can store larger volumes of data.&nbsp; But it doesn't sound like there is a lot of data, so size won't&nbsp;dictate the use of one application over the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Without knowing the types of questions and types of data you will be collecting its hard to lock down one app or the other.&nbsp; Keep an open mind - you can actually store the data in Access and analyze it in Excel through a refreshable connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Access gives you relational database capability, which is limited at best in Excel.&nbsp; This means you have such things as primary key fields, control of data types&nbsp;and the ability to use multiple tables.&nbsp; (With PowerPivot Excel has gained some genuine
 relational database capabilities - but few people know this new tool).</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Excel probably has more analytical tools (analysis toolpak and functions) and a better charting engine.&nbsp; But technically you could write just about any function you need in either program, of course its easier if they are built in.&nbsp; I believe that Access
 has about 200 built in functions and Excel about 350, don't hold me to those numbers.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Access' report writing capability would be judged by most to be superior to Excel's.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Both programs provide a Pivot Table tool to analyze your data, unfortunately knowing one doesn't mean you know the other, because they aren't identical.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I haven't seen your data but I would be tempted to input and store the data in Access and connect to it from Excel via pivot tables, data table connections and/or powerpivot for my analysis.</p>
<p>As you can see its not clear cut.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Karl, I had contacted Reagan.com and their people were very helpful. I did follow their instructions, but I had several problems, not with their data, but with my system. I simply the problem sit over night, and approached it with a new day. My system underwent

            I think you misunderstand the article (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970020</a>). That registry entry doesn't exist -- for any of the Office programs -- until you save a document in ODF, check the "don't
 show this again" box in the warning, and click Yes or No. Then the program creates the entry in the Options hive with the value 1 (meaning "disable the warning").<br />
<br />
If you do that, the warning won't appear again, so you can't see the box to uncheck it. The information in the article is about how to change the registry value to 0, so the warning will appear again.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you want to prevent the warning from appearing even the first time, you can do that by manually creating the
<span><span><font><font color="#000000">DisableSaveAsLossWarningOpenDocumentText entry in each of the three Options hives (right-click &gt; New &gt; DWORD) and setting its value to 1.<br />

                    <p>I had to have&nbsp;my operating system reset and lost my programs in the process. I had Office Enterprise 2007 installed before and want to get it back. I have the product key but the CD is corrupted and I need to download it. I cannot figure out how to do this.
 I tried using instructions I found on ehow starting with activating the trial version of office 2007 home and student then entering the product key when it asked for it but it&nbsp;said it was the wrong key&nbsp;and would not accept it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone give me directions how to down this software using my product key?

            You have to download the right installer. The product keys are specific to the bundles. That is why your Enterprise key did not work on Home and Student.<br />
<br />
MS really wants you to <span><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">$$$ SPEND

            <p>I logged into a different computer with my work credentials and, as the SharePoint Admin, logged into O365 and&nbsp;acquired a SP app from the store using my work credentials, NOT my personal credentials....and it worked fine, as before. It didn't even ask me
 to log in....which makes sense since I'd already done that. (Also, your link, above, required that I sign in with my personal account...which is not appropriate since the task I am doing is related to my employer, not me.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of my experience, I cannot agree with your statement. It appears, to me, a problem with my computer (which, by the way is malfunctioning a bit due to a cracked screen and is in need of replacement). Simply stated, on a different computer, everything
 worked as expected; as it did the last time I acquired an app.</p>

            <p>I don't know how, but on one computer it insisted on my personal Outlook account, even though I was logged in to the computer and O365 with my work account but on another computer, I was able to use my work account, as I'd always been able to do on the previous
 computer in the past. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only change that had occurred is that I had synced my personal One Drive to my work computer. Wouldn't think that would have done it but it's the only change made that even remotely relates to the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, I had dropped my Surface (which now had the problem) and had to replace it. Starting fresh with a new computer eliminated the problem and I avoided syncing my personal One Drive, just in case.</p>

<p>I think now that maybe I have misunderstood and you are referring to opening multiple instances of Excel rather than opening workbooks in separate windows. If so, see the answers at the following link. I personally avoid this because I would rather have
 just the one set of ribbons.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_other/open-each-spreadsheet-in-a-new-instance-of-excel/8683864f-de1b-45ee-a519-c23a0e3a314b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_other/open-each-spreadsheet-in-a-new-instance-of-excel/8683864f-de1b-45ee-a519-c23a0e3a314b</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also on the issue of opening 2 windows with same file when using View -&gt; New window. That is simply the default that it opens with a new workbook. You should be able to still open another workbook in either window. There are some circumstances where you
 finish up with additional windows (and I think that this is a bug) but try adding the "Close window" icon to your QAT (Quick Access Toolbar) and just select the window that is not required (via Switch windows on the View ribbon) and close it.

    <title>Tabbing from Excel worksheet cells to form controls and back to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dlp-online  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tabbing from Excel worksheet cells to form controls and back to worksheet cells</h2>
                    <p>I created a form in Excel 2010 that spans 2 pages and has 80 cells that require tabbing to/from and 2 form control radio buttons that need to also be tabbed to/from along with the 80 cells.&nbsp; The worksheet is protected when distributed to users, but the cells
 and radio buttons that require setting values and tabbing are not locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the article <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/establishing-enter-order-on-a-protected-sheet/e7a223f3-2dae-4c7b-a37f-1819c68be5dc">

 radio buttons.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it's not as easy as just adding "Option Button 1" and "Option Button 2" to the TabOrder array mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I include the radio buttons?&nbsp; Tabbing will need to work going forward and backward and, if possible, use all the "tabbing" keys used in the article above.</p>

            <p>I came up with a solution. It requires using ActiveX controls instead of regular form controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get tabbing to work correctly between cells and controls, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use ActiveX controls instead of form controls.</li><li>Change the TabOrder array to be an array of arrays. What you need to end up with is a two dimensional array where the first item in each subarray is a designator for the type of information in the second item in that subarray. For example, I used "a" to
 indicate that a subarray specifies and ActiveX control and "c" to indicate that a subarray specifies a regular cell. For the second item in each subarray, I specified either the control name, such as "combo1," or the cell reference, such as "C1."</li><li>Then modify the rest of the code to check the designator and then do what is appropriate for cells for ActiveX controls. For example, you may want to get rid of merged cells for regular cells but you don't need to do that for ActiveX controls. In the end,
 the tabbing occurs by calling the Activate member for the control or the cell.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I can't easily get to the code right now to post it, so I'll do that another time. I did want to post, though, that it is possible to get a user-specified tab order between cells and controls in a worksheet.</p>

            Unless you are on deferred, you should actually be on 1810 now. No need to be on insider to get 1809, unless your org has it set to be on deferred, where you'd be around 1804 or something right now.

    <title>Disable douple tab to zoom in IE11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s2user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable douple tab to zoom in IE11</h2>
                    Hi <br />
<br />
i use a surface 2. Some web applications like the Synology web interface require double clicks on certain links to work. But if I douple tab the links the browser zooms in. Is there a way to disable the zoom?<br />
<br />
btw if I use a mouse it works as expected. Only the case with touch.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
K<br />

<p>Have you tried using the Magnifier?&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when I use my (capacitive) pen on the RT I often have to use the Magnifier to get a big enough area to make sure that it knows where I am tapping.&nbsp; Another factor is Double-Tap&nbsp;settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. is your "Spatial
 tolerance" set high enough for the RT?&nbsp; The Pro doesn't have that problem, at least when using its pen (electronic stylus).</p>
<p>
</p><p>LCRT's tip to make your double-tap into a multi-step procedure makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; An alternative procedure might be a, hopefully more precise, Press and hold (Right-click).&nbsp;&nbsp;Does your app have a right-click menu you could use instead of a double-click?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>Try using ReportingEvents.log to get clues and timestamps.&nbsp; Sounds like the download phase is done though so better logs may be available.&nbsp; setuperr.log?&nbsp; FWIW I would search for changed files ASAP after failure for others.</p>

<h2>            V.R.&#40;Virtual reality headset&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I want to buy a V.R.(Virtual reality headset).<br />
I came to know this device requires a inbuilt "Gyroscope" in my phone.<br />
Well,I have a Lumia 640XL and I am not sure if this "Gyroscope" is present in it or not.<br />
Please someone help me to clear my doubts:-<br />
Does my phone supports V.R.????<br />
Does my phone have this feature -"Gyroscope"???<br />
If my phone doesn't have "Gyroscope",will it be hampering my visuals in any way???<br />
V.R.&nbsp;&nbsp; gives 360 degree&nbsp; view,is that feature available for my phone.<br />
Can I play games with the 360 degree facility (if my phone have it).<br />
<br />
Plz answer soon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

</p><p>I've seen a response from a community manager on your thread. Are you still experiencing the same issues like before?

Full HD video call</a>, your feedback was already raised to our engineering team and there is at present a technical limitation which prevents us from supporting full 1080 video for some webcams.</p>

<p>Thanks for you reply </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the issue still there with Skype ver: 7.37.0.103</p>
<p>&nbsp;everything is like before.&nbsp; (btw some features don't work with techfreaks workaround, group video, system sound sharing.. . and I get the nagging screen when I log. those are minor&nbsp;problem for me since I don't use them. and&nbsp; to be expected since you need
 NGC&nbsp; to get them to work,&nbsp; just thought I mention it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>it would be great if you could explain what the limitation is (if there might be some other workaround then techfreaks) and more important give a clue about what time frame we are talking about to get it solved, days weeks, months, year.....?</p>

<p>Read this article which contains a fix. I have been using the fix since May 2017, a month now, and it works fine and I now get 1080p during Skype calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>FIX here :­&nbsp;<br />
OK found the issue for this problem and will add a fix here to help others with webcams with built in hardware encoding. The new skype is using the NGC codec (next generation codec) which ignores if your high end camera has hardware encoding so uses your graphics
 card as the encoding device and in turn turns your graphics card to full base clocks and wastes electricity and heats up your GPU for no good reason or benefit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if you have a camera with hardware encoder built in you can simply rename a file in skype to turn off the NGC codec and go back to the Silk codec that uses your hardware encoder in the camera and allows your GPU to idle at normal speeds again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In C:\Program Files (x86)\Skype\Phone or wherever you installed skype there is a file called RtmCodecs.dll all you need to do is rename it to something like RtmCodecs.dll.NOTUSED. Restart skype and it will say there is an error with skype and says to download
 again or cancel, click cancel and use skype as normal. All will be fine apart from this error message on start up that can be ignored.<br />

<p>Update July&nbsp;03 2017:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried&nbsp; the latest ver 7.38.xxx.101 still no&nbsp;HW encoded H264 full HD with&nbsp;Logitech&nbsp;C 920</p>
<p>
</p><p>even tho techfreaks solution:</p>
<p>Getting Silk_v3 back </p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Reinstalling the latest version of Skype. (you don't really need to, my remark)<br />
2.&nbsp; Browsing to the Skype folder which is usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Skype\Phone<br />
3.&nbsp; renaming RtmCodec.dlls&nbsp; (i.e. RtmCodecs.old)<br />
4.&nbsp; Relaunch Skype and place a video call.&nbsp; If you performed the rename while Skype was running, you would have to complete quit Skype and restart it for the changes to take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The list of dravback to that solution growing (group video, system sound sharing.. nagging screen (get the lates Skype....&nbsp;) I'm ok with that
</p>
<p>BUT! now it is Impossibly to make a video&nbsp;call, with someone that run the&nbsp;new Skype for Android (8.x.x.x)</p>
<p>get a message: you have to old Skype version or something like that </p>
<p>&nbsp;(ok I can quit Skype rename RtmCodecs.old to RtmCodecs.dll to get it to work .....)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now your stuck with lousy &nbsp;video quality or not being able to make a video call at all with someone that running ver 8.xxx on Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is now well over six mounts since I made the suggestion on the old Skype Forum, and a few mounts since Allen S.&nbsp;sad the engendering team start working on the issue
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty Please fix this ASAP</p>

            I can still&nbsp;send &nbsp;1080P with Tecfreaks solution (in all honesty I don't know if I would be able to receive 1080P with it since haven't tested&nbsp; with some one that got a 1080P cam lately) but since I'm able to send and get 720P from my Android phone (after
 downgraded to 7.xxx)&nbsp;&nbsp;send 1080P and&nbsp; receive &nbsp;720P from my laptop with is impossibly with NGC I would be&nbsp;surprised if it wouldn't work!!! btw you can check&nbsp;&nbsp;what you send and receive during a call. go to:&nbsp;Call, Call Technical info. (the&nbsp;&nbsp;Silk_v3 gives some
 useful information&nbsp; unlike NGC) or se how much bandwidth your using 720P around 3Mb/s&nbsp; and 1080P around 6 Mb/s

<p>For those who want to get the best out of there Logitech&nbsp; C 920 I would suggest to take a look at this video, even tho I owned the Cam for years, I learned some new stuff, when I first saw it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ARlhuv5HTc</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing he forgot to mention is that the Exposure setting (except for the obvious how dark or bright the video is) &nbsp;it &nbsp;is also controlling the F/S, if you run the NGC codec you need to get 20-30 F/s to even get 720P but with&nbsp;Silk_v3 you only need
 10-15 to get 1080P..... </p>

<p>I am well pleased with the Logitech C920. I purchased the unit in February of 2013. Last month was the first time I managed to get 1080p on Skype thanks to the fix. Previously, the video was sharp and well illuminated, but 1080p was never achievable in Skype
 despite having 100/40 bandwidth and so say a 1080p web cam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The on board video processing works great in SILK_3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why the later versions of Skype moved away from utilising the on board hardware is beyond me.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><em>"Why the later versions of Skype moved away from utilising the on board hardware is beyond me. I think I read that NGC allows more than one application to use the web cam at the same time. I may have that wrong."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what you might be referring to is the Win 10&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span>anniversary
</span></span>update , that was supposed to make it possibly to use the webcam in many apps at the same time (but in realty made the C 920 useless, they had to withdraw&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of the update)</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/windows-10-anniversary-update-breaks-most-webcams/</p>
<p>
</p><p>The NGC is supposed to have better sound and&nbsp;support &nbsp;some new features like group video, system sound sharing.</p>
<p>but the video quality is not anywhere near as good as the Silk_V3, not to mention that the Silk_V3 enables 720P from any old laptop, Android phone ETC ETC&nbsp; with a whole lot less CPU usage!!

    <title>Too many decimal places - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kitty8979  say:</h3>
<h2>            Too many decimal places</h2>
                    
<p>I wrote a query to sum results and count the # of time the questions was asked then I divided the result by the # of times the question was asked.</p>
<p>Q1_Sum: Score Question&nbsp; 1 - as a (Sum)</p>
<p>Q1_Cnt: Count(IIf([Score Question&nbsp; 1]&lt;&gt;0,0)) - as an (Expression)</p>
<p>Q1_Results: IIf([Q1_Cnt]=0,"NA",([Q1_Sum]/[Q1_Cnt])) - as an (Expression)</p>
<p>So for Example:</p>
<p>Q1_Sum = 46</p>
<p>Q1_Cnt = 6</p>
<p>Q1_Results = 7.666666666666</p>
<p>Now in my report, it displays the 7.66666666666 and I only want to display 7.67</p>
<p>How can I fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on Properties, Format, it is blank.&nbsp; I can set decimal places to 2, but it does not limit it to 2.</p>

<p>That's my oversight, I do apologize.</p>
<p>After looking at this a little closer, the reason your control isn't offering format options is because you are evaluating the field to a&nbsp;variant(text) value using the IIF statement and the condition:&nbsp;"NA".&nbsp; You can't format the text: "NA" to a "Fixed" value.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;as an alternative to what you've been shown so far, you could simply use the format function as follows.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
SELECT ..., IIf([Q1_Cnt]=0, "NA", <strong>Format(([Q1_Sum]/[Q1_Cnt]), "FIXED")</strong>)&nbsp;As Q1_Results FROM ...</p>

<p>Ok, so here is what I did.&nbsp; In the query, I changed, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Q1_Cnt: Count(IIf([Score Question&nbsp; 1]&lt;&gt;0,0))</span> - as an (Expression) to</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Q1_Cnt: (Count(IIf([Score Question&nbsp; 1]&lt;&gt;0,0))*10)</span></p>
<p>Then in the report I did this</p>
<p>=IIf(([Q1_Cnt])=0,"N/A",([Q1_Sum]/[Q1_Cnt])*10)</p>
<p>AND set Format to Fixed and Decimal Places to 2.</p>
<p>Why does this work and the other way does not?</p>

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suppose you are using OneNote for Windows 10. The "Dock to Desktop" feature is not available in OneNote for Windows 10. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand it is a great and useful feature, I recommend you vote for the related UserVoice below and let the OneNote team know your requirements and comments. This is the best way to make the product
 better for you and others.</p>

<h2>            Question about RPC over HTTP deprecated in Office 365 on Oct 2017</h2>
                    <p>There is a message in the Office 365 Admin Portal notifying that in Oct 2017 RPC over HTTP will be discontinued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply want to verify that because my users are using the latest Office 2016 (they use desktop Outlook as primary email) and we allow automatic updates, that we will experience no problems with our users accessing &amp; using their email via Outlook 2016/Office
 365? I read the article and don't find a registry entry exists even to check to make sure MapiHttp feature is disabled (which would cause an issue). Thank you.</p>

            <p>LA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what you described you will not run into any issues when RPC/HTTP is deprecated.&nbsp; You confirmed in the registry that MAPI/HTTP is not disabled so you are all set.&nbsp; The main concern is for older clients like Outlook 2010 and 2013.&nbsp; They need to be
 updated to the latest version to ensure they can connect via MAPI/HTTP.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way you can check if you want is to use the Connection Status dialog.&nbsp; If you see you are connecting via protocol HTTP then you can be sure there will be no issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><div>To view the Outlook connection status&nbsp;properties, follow these steps:&nbsp;</div>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold CTRL, and then click the&nbsp;Microsoft Outlook icon in the systray&nbsp;notification area.</li><li>Click&nbsp;Connection Status.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Note By default in Windows 7, the Outlook icon is hidden from view in the notification area.</p>

<p>I have been trying to make the new msn my homepage today with no luck.</p>
<p>I am running win 8.1 with IE11</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 randomly freezes completely &#40;Hard Reset required&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have the problem that my new Windows 10 sometimes just freezes completely. With completely I mean that I am unable to access the Task Manager or even move my mouse. It's stuck in place. The sound is stuck aswell if I happened to play a game or a video
 at the time of the freeze. To reset my PC I have to press the power button until the PC forces a shut down as a simple press on it won't trigger the shut down.&nbsp;The
<strong>Windows installation is clean </strong><strong>and only a week old, installed via an USB</strong>. Freezes can occur between minutes (rarely, unless I watch&nbsp;videos or play a game)&nbsp;to a hour.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>[EDIT:] Demanding Games (for example Saints Row: The Third) seem to freeze after about 20 minutes of playing&nbsp;everytime. Especially when there is some sort of explosion happening. I already increased my virtual memory from 1851MB to 6144MB, to no avail...
 I'm about to double it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to stop the freezes and how to find out what is causing them?</p>

            <p>I reset the PC and I haven't experienced a freeze yet. But I've just&nbsp;been&nbsp;using it for about 20 minutes now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I don't have a Preview version. There is no indication that I have one on the Activation page.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1st EDIT:</strong> The PC just froze again after about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Just earlier my video driver was automatically installed by Windows 10.</p>
<p>Also my Windows 10 version is: <strong>Version&nbsp;10.0.10586 Build 10586</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2nd EDIT: </strong>So ever since that last freeze mentioned above my PC hasn't frozen. It's been hours now. I've also played a game for several hours without it crashing. However, the game is a strategy game and didn't have many explosions in it
 and I still don't know whether a game that has more going on it it will work.</p>
<p>On top of that I'm still interested in what froze my PC in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to watch videos or play a game that&nbsp;should be&nbsp;more memory consuming and see if the PC freezes then, as it usually froze when doing those things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it also be that the freezes were connected to an app/program?</p>
<p>I always had Skype, Steam and Lightshot opening when my PC started before the reset. It cannot be Steam since I've installed it to play that game mentioned above.</p>

</p><p>Since you Reset the PC, Event Viewer Logs would not be available.&nbsp; You can try using
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processmonitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ProcMan</a> to monitor the system and next time it hangs, open Event Viewer and look through Application and System Logs for errors related to the freeze.</p>

            <p>Freezes persist. It seems to be the case in SR3 (about 20 minutes into a scene, where many explosions and NPCs are present at the same time), which is&nbsp;the most demanding game I have installed. Every other game seems to work fine and the PC only seems to
 freeze when idle, when too many videos have been watched or when I play a demanding game. I'm guessing it's a graphics card issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, I have no idea on how ProcMan works and how to view the event viewer. I tried to find out but whatever I see confuses me. Had it running when the PC froze though. Can somebody explain it to me so I can&nbsp;return a full report?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've noticed is that after the PC froze the wind blow coming out of the backside of my PC seemed to be warmer than usual. If I were to guess the temperature of it I'd say 40°C - 60°C.</p>
<p>After restarting the temperature dropped back down to room temperature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it have something to do with my graphics card?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Graphics card: </strong>512MB ATI AMD Radeon HD 6550D (ASUStek Computer Inc)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T17-2 (1280x1024@60Hz)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Side note: Graphics card is the only thing that is barely above the minimum for SR3, which is 320MB Video RAM GPU.)</p>

            <p>Have you cleaned the heat sinks as over time dirt builds up on the fins and reduces the air flow.
</p>
<p>As for the Graphics that is an onboard graphic&nbsp; and I just looked at the specs and it is on the lower end of the scale and being 512MB you are pushing it pretty hard, I would check for any dust/dirt build up, also if it is a PC you could add a separate graphic
 card and free up some of the work that the CPU has to do which will mean less heat.</p>

            The question is pertains to the default size which in previous version could be set under File/Options/Notes &amp; Journal.&nbsp;This option&nbsp;is not available or for some reason not showing in Outlook 2016. By default, when you create a new note it creates a tiny
 square in the upper left hand corning. I would like to change this behavior so that it creates a much larger square or better yet just create a new entry in the notes list view with a large open pane on the right side.

    <title>MS Access 2010 - one specific report cannot be opened in Layout View, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg in austin  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2010 - one specific report cannot be opened in Layout View, while others can be</h2>
                    <p>I'm working to update an undocumented legacy MS Access 2010 system.</p>
<p>While I'm able to open all other reports (so far) in Layout View to make changes, there is one specific report in our list, that states "Layout View is unavailable for this report".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the report's Property Sheet, and the&nbsp; Allow Layout View property was previously = No.&nbsp; I have set it = Yes.&nbsp; But still getting error message. Also closed, reopened my mdb file, and Allow Layout View property is now = YES.&nbsp; But still getting
 the error message.</p>
<p>It's like the system is not recognizing the change to the property setting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the Options&nbsp; -Current Database - Enable Layout View is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the next setting that could be over-riding that, and the change that was made to the Allow Layout View?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA for your help</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, please see the revised original question, about the Allow Layout View setitng that was found, changed, but the change not being recognized.&nbsp; Even after saving, and after closing/opening the mdb.</p>
<p>
