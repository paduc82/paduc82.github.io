<p>
</p><p>If the account on the phone is an account that you own, then you should be able to reset the password using the link that I posted in my first message for account.live.com. &nbsp;As you as you have registered a secondary email address or phone number, you should
 be able to reset the password.</p>

    <title>Desktop Themes Background Picture Change Locks Up Build 10041 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ipellant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop Themes Background Picture Change Locks Up Build 10041</h2>
                    <p>Build 10041 has been causing me grief by occasionally locking the screen and the cursor starts a beeping and refuse to register on any controls... have to force a shutdown and reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I formatted the drive and installed from a 1041 DVD. Problems persist. Built up a desktop system with different displays. Problem occurred... but caught it in action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that a Theme with picture backgrounds will change to next background at a time it chooses. If you are moving the cursor or have a process running that is doing fast screen updates, the swap background seems to trap the cursor in limbo such
 that it no longer responds to button pressing and raises an error beep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed a Theme to have a solid color background instead of pictures and that seems to have fixed the problem... LOL: whilst in personalization, changing the background caused a lock out.... I am convinced it is the causes of problems on my two computers.
 Note: both of then are running less than FHD (1920x1080) monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one having screen lockouts that can be seen to be caused by Themes?</p>

<h2>            Creat sub-folders in Outlook 2010 but nothing shows up</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. It's Outlook 2010 installed on Windows XP. An additional mailbox was added. After I tried to add a sub-folder (under Inbox or other places) I cannot see any new subfolder show up. When I do it a second time with the same folder name, it says "A
 folder with this name already exists. Use another name." I tried to remove the mailbox and add it back, but the situation remained the same. When I check the folder size, I cannot see the newly added folders in Local Data. However, I can find them in Server
 Data. I also tried to Update Folder but nothing changed. Please kindly help, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything is fine for my own mailbox, namely I can add a subfoler without that problem.</p>

<h2>            E63-2 battery died 12 hours after charging&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just purchased an E63-2 (By the way, how is E63-2 different from E63?) a few days ago. I just charged my phone to full battery yesterday evening (and unplugged it from the AC), but when I woke up this morning, my Nokia was dead! When I pressed the red
 hang-up button, the middle rectangular arrow thing would light up, but there was nothing on the screen. I also could not power it up. Finally, when I plugged it on, the device turned on. So then I unplugged it, because I thought the problem was solved. But
 then it said LOW BATTERY. How is that possible? Has anyone had this problem before?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise,</p>
<p>Ilych</p>

            I would charge it a couple more times and see how long it last,&nbsp; It could be a bad battery and depends where you bought they should exhange it.&nbsp; the E63-2 I think the only difference is it is for the US market maybe they fine tuned it for like ATT and
 TMOBILE.

<p>I am having the same problem. I charged it overnight and it worked fine. At the end of the day the battery was dead. Last night I charged it for a couple of hours, then left it on overnight. Still had a full charge this morning. My first thought was that
 it might be draining the battery looking for connections that I don't generally need such as WLAN scanning, etc. I have them turned off. But since it remained fully charged overnoght I am thinking the problem might be that when my wife has it on in a case
 in her purse, perhaps the case is causing enough pressure on multiple keys that might be discharging the battery. Anyone hear of this happening?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I told her to turn off the phone while it is in the case (She doesn't need it during work.) and when she leaves and turns it on to keep it out of the case. I had disabled the auto keylock to make it easier for her, but if she wants to keep in on while in
 the case I may need to re-enable it.</p>

<p>could be several things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>could be the battery. exchange it with another battery if ou have access to one just to rule out if the one you had was faulty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>could be the charger. try charging with another charger. I've had a similar experience, but it turned out I plugged it in and it didn't charge. it was the charger's fault. when I got home and charged it again, it was fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>could be the hardware. it's been known to happen. have it checked by nokia care, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>could be software. before you go to sleep, press and hold the home (menu) key. this should display all the running apps in the upperleft hand side. some of your apps may still be running in the background, hence the battery drain.</p>

            Did CenturyLink provide you with an MSN address or is it one you had outside of CenturyLink?&nbsp; CenturyLink's help pages indicate they run their own mail servers, so if you want to use an MSN mailbox, download and install the Outlook Hotmail Connector and
 configure your MSN account in Outlook after installing it.&nbsp; Use the automatic account configuration and Outlook should set it up without any problems.&nbsp; You will not be sending your messages through the CenturyLink mail servers, though, you'll be using MSN
 directly.

<h2>            Filter Rows to Display Only Records Having More Than One Entry</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Recently, I copied and pasted a list of doctors from the Blue Shield website, based on different search criterion (area of expertise). Each record includes the name of the doctor, contact info, and only ONE area of expertise. Because I conducted several
 searches, there are a handful of doctors that appear more than once.&nbsp;I would like to look through this extensive list to determine which doctors are best-suited for my needs. If a doctor appears, say, four or more times, I would like to highlight that doctor.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to have only unique records, but additional columns with either some sort of a check mark or highlighting that indicates whether or not this doctor has indicated they are an expert in a particular area (ie. Rx management, sleep disorder,
 OCD, etc.)</p>
<p>What is the best way to do this?</p>

<h2>            How to hide Video from O365 portal&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using O365 Video to store some video files, and I don't want end users know it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to hide Video from O365 portal for some users, but they still have permission to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can hide SharePoint and OneDrive from my Portal, but how can I do the same thing for Video?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologize for my terrible English. Any advice would be very grateful.</p>
<p><br />

            <p><span>Hi Oliver,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is not workable to achieve your goal. We can only disable or enable the video service on the tenant level via going to SharePoint admin center -&gt; settings-&gt; steaming video service, while we can’t hide the Video tile and still give the
 user ability to use it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given this situation, I would suggest you share the same with our related team through

<p>Maybe what you might do is setup a Channel where only you have permission. Once your video is ready you move it to a Channel where everyone (or a goup) has access to see the Video.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am happy to say that we have another option to update our software without WiFi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>goto the nearest NOKIA CARE CENTER and tell them to update. It's completely free of cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to find nearest by your home, please follow the below </p>

<p>
</p><p>Or else, goto KFC and ask them WiFi password. They will give it , then connect to WiFi and install the update.</p>

<h2>            Mac Excel 2008 gets broken by Excel update</h2>
                    Just an alert, have been using Mac Office 2008 for years with no issue. Today I received a note to do an update for Excel (I check once a week or so). After I did the update, it removed the old Excel and tried to force me to use Office 365 version. Not
 sure who else may run into this issue with this deceiving update, but just a heads up. Support can't help you unless you have the 2008 software and key handy to completely uninstall office and reinstall.

<p>I've seen several reports of this in the past few days. I suspect this is an attack and is not legitimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2008 has been discontinued for years. There haven't been any updates for a long, long time. There are no recent updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All 2008 licenses were perpetual and do not expire. You can continue using Office 2008 forever as long as you or Apple don't change hardware or Mac OS in a way that breaks it. So far, Apple has broken only the installer, which no longer runs in current versions
 of Mac OS X.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that anyone using Office 2008 turn off AutoUpdate. To do this, open Microsoft Word 2008, go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates. This launches AutoUpdate app. Set AutoUpdate to Manual and then close AutoUpdate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, make sure your suite is up to version 12.3.6 by going to the Word menu and choosing About Word. If you're not up to 12.3.6 you can download the updater here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36897</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, if you received the pop-up informing you that you must update, don't fall for it. You don't have to update, and I suspect they are taking you to an illegitimate site for getting Office 2106 for Mac. If you do want to update, buy Office 2016 as either
 a permanent license or via an Office 365 subscription (my personal recommendation because Office 2016 is nearing the end of its life) from a legitimate vendor such as Amazon.com, BestBuy.com, Walmart.com or any of thousands of other legitimate vendors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Report the scam here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/reportascam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/reportascam/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before purchasing Office 2016, be sure your Mac meets the system requirements:</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback on 12.3.6 being the last update, but one note. If you're reinstalling from the original media like I was, users will also need the Office 2008 Service Pack 2 first, then the 12.3.6 update. You can't install right from the core to
 12.3.6, you have to do (or I did at least) the service pack first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The service pack can be found here</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17575</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck everyone.</p>

            Unfortunately, there was a bug introduced in MAU 3.14 that causes this problem (2008 apps are inadvertently recognized as 2016, and an update occurs). Please see https://support.office.com/article/a898022e-e80a-4c8d-9aa4-01cff9983037 for more details.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, there is yammer basic and Yammer enterprise network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;may continue to use yammer basic or you may upgrade to Yammer enterprise.</p>
<p>To upgrade to Yammer enterprise&nbsp;you need&nbsp;have Office 365 subscription.</p>
<p>Once you have the office 365&nbsp;subscription, you&nbsp;may add your domain to Office 365.</p>
<p>To upgrade Yammer service, it is not necessary that you use other services available in Office 365 to use Yammer.</p>

            <p>Yammer Basic does not offer administrative features. For that, you need Yammer Enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to 2017, you can subscribe to Yammer Enterprise as a standalone service. However in 2017 this has been discontinued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still like to upgrade to Yammer Enterprise the lowest cost of Entry is the Office365 K1 plan, that comes with Exchange Kiosk, Sharepoint Kiosk and Yammer Enterprise. It costs USD$4 Retail. You can deploy it while disabling Exchange Kiosk and Sharepoint
 Kiosk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, not sure if you want to "clean out" Yammer, as this can be a form of knowledge management (if used properly). For example lets say a team of people used Yammer to plan the hosting of a conference 4 years ago and setup a Yammer group to collaborate.
 &nbsp;Of course this would then become an old group with no active participation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, say, this year an entirely new team is hosting a similar conference - you can go to that old group and read through the discussions to understand what they went through, and perhaps the basis of some decisions made during the planning of the conference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yammer does not restrict you on storage space, so that should not be a reason to delete old posts.</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;VincentChoy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to&nbsp;"clean out" Yammer of posts, I do want to remove members and tidy up the groups that we have going at the moment. &nbsp;It seems that we would have to go for the Office365 K1 plan, but I
<strong>don't</strong>&nbsp;want to move the company's domain across to Microsoft - I merely want access to the admin controls in Yammer and leave the rest of our IT systems the same. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that possible?</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are moving to office 365 subscription for yammer enterprise network than without adding the domain in the office 365 you cannot enable the same yammer network as a enterprise version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the below steps to move from yammer basic to yammer enterprise network.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>If you are moving an free yammer basic network to office 365 tenant then I would like to inform you
</span><span>All data, content, and users are preserved when you upgrade your Yammer Basic Network as mentioned in the below article as well:-</span></li></ul>

<li><span>Moving basic free version to enterprise level that time data associated with old yammer network also migrated to enterprise network.</span></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><span>I would request you to please follow below steps to move yammer basic to enterprise subscription.
</span>
<ol>
<li>
<span>You need to activate Yammer if you paid for Yammer Enterprise.
</span></li><li>
<span>Yammer requires a company domain, such as
</span><span style="font-style: italic">contoso.com</span><span> to activate the network
</span></li><li>
<span>Log into your </span><a href="https://portal.microsoftonline.com/admin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Office 365 Admin Center</span></span></a><span>
 and go to Domains &gt; Add a domain </span></li><li>
<span>If this domain is your organization's primary domain, change your default Office 365 domain from
</span><span style="font-style: italic">onmicrosoft.com</span><span> to the company domain you just added. Go to&nbsp;Admin&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Office 365, click your organization name in the upper-right
 corner, and then choose&nbsp;Default domain. </span></li><li>
<span>Now if you wish you can activate the yammer home network as a enterprise by visiting the below link and select the domain of that network as enterprise network:-</span></li></ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Office 365 Admin Site &gt; Dashboard &gt; Included Services &gt; Yes, activate Yammer Enterprise for my network
</span></li><li>
<span>You are in "Global Admin" role in Office 365 admin site, so you are automatically a Yammer Administrator.</span></li></ol>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;Sushil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chatted (via liveperson) to a colleague of yours (MK) who told me that I did not have to move/change any domain level settings in order to move our yammer network across to an enterprise version. &nbsp;Is that fact?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I add my company's domain (futureconsiderations.com) to my Office365, will it disrupt existing email services that we have serviced via GSuite?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 35 users (including myself) on our free Yammer network. It is my intention to migrate our Yammer network to an Enterprise account (ie. the one that I am using). &nbsp;Once I have migrated, will the existing 34 yammer users migrate with the Yammer network
 and will be able to continue using Yammer as they always have <strong>for free</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have said with everyone at Microsoft, my aim is that I can pay for one user on Enterprise, gain yammer enterprise controls, leave everyone else as free yammer users and
<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;move our domain settings to Office 365. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I have been told (prior to paying) that it can be done. Now that I have paid, that suggestion is changing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Pete</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 phone, reading text messages aloud</h2>
                    <p>Dear All, With the new law and more recent publicity meaning you cannot touch your phone while driving, I am trying to restore the excellent text read out loud facility that used to work on Microsoft phones so well but seems to have been switched off by
 Microsoft themselves during 2017. I have now given up with settings that all seem fine and taken the time to do a full system wipe and reload but it still does not work despite checking all the obvious stuff, any one got any ideas before I escalate the issue.</p>

<p>Thank you for responding, language is correctly set and the cortana feature is set to always read text messages also, location rights for cortana is on but curiously greyed out which the phone itself tells me is
 required for cortana to work. Can you indicate if your lumia reads text messages and if so which model do you have. When these phones came out I liked them so much I bought them for all my family members, point is, reading text messages aloud on all our phones
 seems have stopped and certainly in my case the only thing that has changed are official updates and no settings changed by me: if it works leave it alone is my motto in relation to most Microsoft products! It would be good to know if your phone still supports
 reading texts aloud. Many thanks. </p>

<p>Cortana use of location is determined by how&nbsp;it was setup and allowed to access. This can not be turned off and on with a switch, this is why it is greyed out. The location settings just show if location history use by Cortana is off or on.</p>
<p>We are using the Lumia 830 on the retail update path with build 1607, no insider builds.

<h2>            Bluetooth in Lumia devices &#40;1520, 640 XL&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is about the 1520 and 640 XL. Neither one of them automatically connect to my car bluetooth.&nbsp; This is a big pain to manually pair EVERYTIME I DRIVE MY CAR. Why can't the phone just store the pair code?</p>
<p>The Bluetooth shows paired and when I click on it to connect, it asks me to repair. Also in device hubs it will show connected even when it is not connected.</p>
<p>I thought it was a 1520 issue but its a WP8 issue.</p>
<p>640XL behaves the same way. So fix it please. My Car is a 2006 land rover, i think it has a nokia module in it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>log (migration report) shows that mailboxes "Stage: IncrementalSync. Percent complete: 95.", mailboxes syned every few minutes without any failure info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried stop and resume it again, use "complete-migrationbatch" to finish it, but all these steps are not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can I just stop and remove this migration batch and then create a new batch again or we have other way to fix this problem? thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi York-,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can stop the current migration batch and start a new one to see if it helps. Moreover, you can even try exporting from the source mailboxes and importing the files into the cloud mailboxes since you have only 3 mailboxes to be moved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further concern on the current migration, you can try the following PowerShell cmdlet to view the detailed information and you can deliver it in the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/new">
Private Messaage (PM)</a> so that we can help check it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Get-MoveRequest -Identity </strong>u<em>ser@contoso.com |</em><strong> fl &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><strong>Get-MigrationBatch -Identity </strong><em>ABC |</em><strong> fl</strong></p>
<p>Please be noted that user@contoso.com stands for your source mailbox and ABC stands for the uncompleted migration batch.</p>

<h2>            Controlled Folder Access in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Win 10 and the Controlled Folder Access is enabled by DEFAULT. Issue I have is that if it is ENABLED I get problems sending emails in Outlook and an error message in Windows defender saying Outlook is blocked......&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I disable Controlled folder
 access then the emails go no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pointless having a feature if you cant have it enabled- not seen it in previous builds so not sure why it is here now - I am cautious of disabling it but have no choice. Windows 10 email works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft have looked at PC remotely and couldnt help - I guess the Controlled folder access will have to be disabled unless I can get Outlook to work through it being enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

            Hi Steve, this is a new feature in Windows 10 1803.
<br />
<br />While Controlled Folder Access is going to be a great addition to Windows 10 Security, it is currently a bit buggy. Until Microsoft fix these bugs, it is best to turn that feature off . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 phone - email setup asking for pin&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased a new windows 10 phone, moving up from a windows 8.1 phone. I have set up the new email accounts on the phone and one of my email accounts (Outlook) has asked for a pin to verify the account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched on my computer the email account and can't find anywhere a place where it gives you a pin for the email account and all I get from search when I type in "Windows 10 mobile email outlook pin" is references for an actual phone unlock pin??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed that since Microsoft have moved all of their operating systems to Windows 10, that trying to find information on a Windows 10 phone can be difficult as the results come back with windows 10 for a PC answers. I think that the mobile version
 of windows 10 should of been called something else that differentiates the 2 operating systems. Even the Microsoft help pages refer you to the PC version of the help results.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
Your question is not clear, but I'll try.<br />
</p>
<p>First, you have used a Worksheet Change event (Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)) so presumably you want the code to run whenever any cell on the worksheet containing the code is changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have this code in Sheet1 in sample1.xlsm and you want the total to appear in sample2.xlsm then you could try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rng As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Target.Cells.Count &gt; 1 Or IsEmpty Then Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsNumeric(Target) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rng = Workbooks("sample2.xlsm").Worksheets("sheet1").Range("B1")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rng.Value = rng.Value + Target.Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you paste the code above in the Sheet Module of Sheet1 in sample1.xlsm, then each time a cell in that sheet is selected, if its value is numeric that value will be added to the value in cell B1 in sheet1 in sample2.xlsm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is that what you want to happen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, please try explaining what you want to happen in English rather than in code.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.<br />
Cheers<br />
Rich</p>

<h3> mazuren  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 windows defender not turning on, no other anti-virus installed</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to windows 10. previously i was running windows 7 and using MSE (microsoft security essentials) but after the update it no longer appeared in my program files or the uninstall list. So I looked online and found that it doesn't work with
 windows 10 and window defender comes naturally with 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to turn it on using various methods and get messages ranging from not having permissions, to "windows can't access specified device or file", to "this app has been turned off and isn't monitoring your computer" when i try to turn it on in security
 and maintenance nothing pops up but also nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked online again I've yet to see anyone else having this particular problem most of the topics are from windows 8. but a few said "Windows defender won't come on while another anti-virus is on. I thought of security essentials back from windows 7 and
 found the old files are still here just relegaded to windows.old after the upgrade.<strong> I didn't touch them.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>finally i was able to get it turned on using the command prompt but after installing updates and restarting the computer it's once more offline and i'm once more unable to turn it on by normal means. what's going on and
<strong>how do i turn it on so it stays on?</strong></p>

<p>I have problems with this. I've done everything that you said, but got stuck when I came to steps 10 and 11.</p>
<p>Apparently, when I'm supposed to do sStep 10 - I can only find DisableAntiSpyware, there is no DisableAntiVirus value, and steps 11, 12 - There is no Windows Defender in services.msc</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help???</p>

<p>I've already tried it all, and nothing helped! I've been trying for a week, I think, doing everything I've found on forums, that people say it could help, including this that you've sent, and the suggestions from above, by @Sangeta but real time protection
 is still of, defender is off and it says it cannot be turned on, if I try to find it in services.msc it doesn't exist, if I try to download defender it says I already got one, so download is not necessary, and it doesn't start downloading it. I really don't
 know what else can I do, my computer is not protected. I've tried to do it with avast, which was constantly saying - you are protected, and that there are no viruses etc. But when I started boot time scan it found a lot of viruses, some of them in Windows
 folder, C partition, and moved it all to chest. After that I've uninstalled avast, and tried everything again and again to get Windows defender running, but nothing happened, still not protected.&nbsp;</p>
