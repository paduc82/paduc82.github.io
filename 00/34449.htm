            <p>Hey, FEAR!</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm sorry to see any issues downloading your game!&nbsp;I'm a little confused by your statement, so please bear with me. It appears you are having issues downloading Saints Row: The Third onto your Xbox 360, however you mention that it won't let you play The Third in Saints Row 2. Is that correct? If so, are you able to elaborate more on that?</p><p><br /></p><p>Additionally, if you could post back with the exact error you are receiving, this will help us determine where to start helping you out. We look forward to your next post!&nbsp;:)</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

<h2>            &#91;Xbox 360 S&#93; No sound, but only when playing DVDs</h2>
                    
<p>My 360 S has suddenly stopped providing audio when I watch a DVD. </p>
<p>There's sound for all other operations (dashboard, Netflix, games) but as soon as I try to play a DVD, the console stops producing sound. The Xbox Guide menu doesn't produce the usual beeps and boops as I move through the menus, and the movie certainly doesn't
 give any sound. When I select "Play DVD" I can hear the confirmation sound cut off before the sound finishes as the DVD app fires up.</p>
<p>My console is connected to the TV with an HDMI cable. I've tried three different cables on two different ports on my television. I've tried three different DVDs. This whole thing was working fine as recently as yesterday. Please don't tell me to check for
 dust on my HDMI cable connectors or to try different inputs on my TV. We're way past that.

<p>G'day Bob! Sorry to hear about the DVD frustrations and thanks for coming to the forum. Let's see about bringing back that audio.<br />
<br />
Just to make sure I comprehend, so far you've tried multiple DVDs, cables, and tv ports. Yes?<br />
<br />
<strong>Here are some more tricks to try:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear the cache</a> and restart the console.
</li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/image-on-your-tv-is-unclear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset the console display settings.</a>
</li><li>Turn off the console, <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/accessories/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
remove the hard drive</a> (if you have one), and try playing the DVD without the hard drive attached.
</li><li>Try connecting your console to a different TV. </li></ul>
<p><br />
Let us know the results from trying these! If they don't fully solve the audio issue, then they'll help us get on the right track toward finding the root cause and a working solution.</p>

    <title>Live Mail Photo Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottkroger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live Mail Photo Problem</h2>
                    I was wondering. &nbsp;In 2011 I sent photos to friends with the Microsoft Live Mail program. &nbsp;The photos were sent as SkyDrive Photo Albums which were available on the internet through SkyDrive for about a month. &nbsp;Now, I would like to look at the photos in
 those old e-mails, but the pictures are too small to be of much value. &nbsp;The size of the e-mails is relatively large, though (over 1MB for several pictures) -- which leads me to believe that the "larger," higher resolution pictures are still on my computer
 or in the Live Mail program servers somewhere somehow. &nbsp;Can anybody tell me how I could view those pictures again.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you want to view the photos from your old emails on Windows Live Mail. Let me help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that Windows Live Mail doesn't have a temporary folder on your computer that would store those photos that you received.&nbsp;Just to verify, how exactly are you trying to view these pictures that appears to be "<em>too small to be of much value</em>"?
 Have you tried viewing them via OneDrive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hello, yes, thank you.<br />
<br />
For the most part, what I've tried is to just click on the pictures.<br />
<br />
A window opens that takes me to OneDrive -- but the pictures have long past the expiry date to be posted there.<br />
<br />
But, for example, when I look at an e-mail for 8/30/2011, I'm told that its size is 1300 KB, and it has an attachment. &nbsp;I don't know why the letter would be so large when it's just a few thumbnail sized pictures, so I thought maybe larger versions of the pictures
 still existed somewhere.

<p>
</p><p>The thumbnail images are attached to the mail message, so for several pictures, it's quite possible that they add up to a lot. One I just sent with four not very big pictures amounted to almost 0.5MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The full-size images must have been available on your computer when you first sent the photo email - are you sure they're still not there somewhere? Or do you remember deleting them? I have pictures dating back to 1994 on this machine ...</p>

            The size of one thumbnail is about 30kb -- far too small, I think. &nbsp;But you might be right.

            <p>OK. I learnt something today! I sent a photo email just to see how big the thumbnail image attachments were. They added up to almost 0.5MB, as I said earlier. However, the message size in the
<em>Sent items</em> folder is given as 9805KB, which is three times the total size of the image files
<em>before</em> they were reduced for uploading to OneDrive. It's also 24 times the actual size of the message file, so I don't know where that number is coming from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, you're not going to be able to extract useful pictures from that .eml file.

 we don't have any way to extract the photos directly form the EML file.</p>

            <p>Hi Divya,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. The upgrade to Windows 10 was done following the instructions received from MSC when the Windows 10 download was posted to my PC in early August. Since than I have had nothing but problems with all the other upgrades. The most serious
 matter was the loss of my Documents folder om my PC drive and also on One Drive.</p>
<p>I have followed the link you have suggested but without any success. The real serious and critical problems is the fact that I had all my important files which I need for running my small home business on those files. Could you please suggest any other way
 to find the files. Thanks</p>
<p>Your help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are you having a problem with the .exe file running and maybe showing Open With?<br />
<br />
Just in case there are any lingering pieces of the malware here is the complete removal method.<br />
.exe issue fix in the next message.<br />
<br />
Try Safe Mode with networking - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot up.<br />
<br />
The top two methods allow the scanners to run and/or get AV.exe out of the way or removal.<br />
<br />
1.<br />
CTRL SHIFT ESC&nbsp; - Task Manager&nbsp; OR Right Click the TaskBar - Task Manager<br />
<br />
Processes tab - End Process on AV.EXE and then proceed with the Uninstall Guide.<br />
<br />
If needed use Start - Computer&nbsp; OR&nbsp; Windows Explorer&nbsp; to navigate to<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware\mbam.exe&nbsp; or where ever it is installed at - if<br />
needed Right Click the Malwarebytes - Properties - Shortcut tab -&nbsp;target line to see where it<br />
is installed.<br />
<br />
Right Click on it and Rename it to ZZMbam.COM (or anything different than it is now) and<br />
then double click on it and run it that way. You can rename it back later. Do similar with<br />
other programs as needed. Use this method for others as needed - DO NOT ASSUME any<br />
one program removes it all or that there&nbsp;is not other malware involved.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
2.<br />
Another method is to use these :<br />
<br />
Use Process Explorer to "Suspend" not Stop&nbsp;the Processes <br />
<br />
Then use AutoRuns to&nbsp;remove the malware startup items.<br />
<br />
Now use UnLocker to delete the files in the malware.<br />
<br />
You may have to do this one file at a time.<br />
<br />
Process Explorer - Free<br />

AV.exe<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
<strong>The AV.exe malware goes under many names :<br />
</strong><br />
XP Internet Security 2010, Antivirus Vista 2010, and Win 7 Antispyware 2010 are rogue<br />
antivirus,&nbsp;scams to force you to pay for them&nbsp;while&nbsp;they have no benefits at all.<br />

<br />
<strong>RENAME these as needed to allow them to run : (use another name with the .COM extension instead of .exe)<br />
</strong><br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also<br />
run&nbsp;them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />
(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />

    <title>Surface Pro bricked during update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roscoe james  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro bricked during update</h2>
                    <p>I have a first gen Surface Pro 64 bit running W 8.1. I've always kept it up to date and, in the past, did the firmware updates. Machine was working fine. Yesterday it tried to install an update. The screen locked up and I was unable to complete the update.
 That's a guess because the screen locked up. I have no idea what it was doing. After about 45 minutes I had to reset the machine holding the power button down. The system booted through the Surface logo into the UEFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After an hour of research and trying the hold power and vol up switch for fifteen seconds, wait ten seconds, then re-start to try and get a Windows boot, I created a recovery USB from a different machine (my Dell). That takes me to Choose your keyboard &gt;
 Troubleshoot &gt; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset your PC gives me &gt; No, keep the existing partitions &gt; unable to reset your PC. A required drive partition is missing.</p>
<p>or Reset your PC takes me to &gt; Yes, repartition the drives &gt; unable to reset your PC. The system drive cannot be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refresh your PC gives me &gt; The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting System Restore and System Image Recovery no system is found to recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now my thinking is my HD (SSD) either has stopped working (hardware failure) which might explain what happened during the update (frozen screen) or it has simply become misconfigured and I need to set it up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go advanced&gt;Command prompt&gt;&nbsp;navigating through find the image file or find a drive I see two places. One is My PC &gt; Drive C: which&nbsp;from size and content appears to be my USB.&nbsp;I also see a grayed out&nbsp;Drive X: Something like&nbsp;550 megs.&nbsp;I can't seem to
 do much with this other than see properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this&nbsp;point I feel I need a way to 'discover' my&nbsp;original SSD. But I'm finding nothing on the UEFI or working through Troubleshoot. I can't find anything that takes me to something similar to the standard BIOS screen where you can see devices, boot drives,
 and other hardware preferences. Is there a way to get&nbsp;that on the Surface?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>RJ&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            C&#43;&#43;. Get info from General tab of event from Event Viewer.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm writing code that get event information about MSE scan results. There are good examples (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa385650(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">one
</a>and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa385768(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
two</a>) on MSDN how to get event information, but I've found that for MSE scan results events there is no event data name:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff0ad35c-cac3-465a-a179-8fe7b06be705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff0ad35c-cac3-465a-a179-8fe7b06be705" /></a></p>
<p>Actually, I need to get scan type index field value, but there is no name of this field (although on Windows 10 machine for Windows defender I can find these names).</p>
<p>But I found that in General tab this info is present under &nbsp;Scan Parameters:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f0e0453-bb11-4102-b36b-844a8166269e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f0e0453-bb11-4102-b36b-844a8166269e" /></a></p>
<p>So the question is: is it a bug of MSE, that it doesn't write Event Data names or is it a way to get Scan Parameters value from General tab using Win API?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will appreciate any help regarding my question.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I found that registry HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Antimalware\Scan contains LastFullScanID value. Is there any way to get scan information having this ID? The way with event viewer is not suitable for me. The same for scan logs from %programdata% folder.</p>

<p><span><span>To troubleshoot the issue, I performed the following steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Stopped the Automatic updates service, renamed the Software Distribution folders in C:\WINDOWS and C:\WINDOWS\system32, then re-started the automatic updates service
 again. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The same issue occurred (updates will download but not install with system error event ID 20), and so I performed the same steps again, and additionally re-registered
 the WUAU services:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Run "gpupdate /force"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Run "wuauclt /detectnow "</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>And yet again, the updates downloaded but would not install and the same errors were logged.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What else can I try to get these updates to install?</span></span></p>

                    After transferring files to my new computer, I am unble to open .sig files that I had made in a Broderbund Scrapbook. My new OS System is&nbsp;Windows 7. Can you tell me how to open this type of file without purchasing a new Broderbund Program?

            <p>The .sig file has nothing to do with your operating system or Microsoft.&nbsp; You know what created it - you likely should have that same program in order to open it.</p>
<p>Printshop made it - you'll need printshop to decode it properly. ;-)&nbsp; You don't still have the application?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge Randomly Closing and Jumping Pages</h2>
                    I just bought a band new computer with Windows 10. While using Microsoft Edge it will randomly close/crash while I am working on sorting my favorites or just reading a page. It also will randomly jump to the bottom to the page I'm currently on. I just
 got my computer two days ago, I don't think its anything I did.

<p><strong><span>Hi nachoman93,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to refer to the Microsoft article provided below and use the “FIX IT” provided in the link on your computer for resolution -<br />

<p><span><span>If the issue persists, then the default program setting for the “.exe” to open must have got changed. So I would suggest you to reset the setting
 for default program.<br />
You may refer to the below mentioned link to set the default program to open with a particular file type -<br />

<h2>            Unable to rip CDs - &#34;Windows Media Player cannot find the file. ...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>original title: Media player rip problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My media player will not let me rip cd's to my library. When I try to it gives me a box that says "Windows Media Player cannot find the file. If you are trying to play, burn, or sync an item that is in your library, the item might point to a file that has
 been moved, renamed, or deleted."&nbsp; I was thinking the solution may have something to do with me going to rip settings&gt;more options&gt; and hitting "change" under "rip music to this location" because the box under where I'm assuming the location goes doesn't have
 anything in it, but when I click on it it doesn't do anything.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>During the ripping process, the Media Player makes a copy of each song, stores it on your hard disk as a compressed Windows Media Audio (WMA) or MP3
 file, and then adds it to your library. Check in the library if the files are present there.</p>

    <title>XBox Controller Driver Won&#39;t Show in Device Manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dimas anindito  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox Controller Driver Won&#39;t Show in Device Manager</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">I have installed and played with a wireless Xbox 360 controller in my computer before, in fact, it was working this morning. For some reason though, I plugged it in a while back and it won't connect to my laptop despite having
 the receiver plugged in. Earlier on I tried re-installing the Wireless 360 controller driver I downloaded from&nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/downloads to start fresh. When I went to Device Manager to manually assign the driver to the receiver, it
 wasn't there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Since I've used the controller here before, there was an Xbox Peripherals in the Device Manager, but as Device Manager auto-scans and updates at launch, I saw it for a split second but then it disappeared. Even as I went to Unknown
 USB Device &gt; Update Driver &gt; Let me pick from a list of device drivers, there was no option for an Xbox 360 wireless controller, not even in the Microsoft category.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">According to Control Panel, I already have the driver installed, but it doesn't show in Device Manager so I can't assign it to the receiver. I've tried switching ports, re-re-installing the driver, disconnecting all other devices
 and restarting my laptop, but the problem persists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>My activities since it last worked (this morning) have been:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">- Running CCleaner to fix my registry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">- Creating and running a batch file that contains:</p>
<div><em>del C:\Windows\Prefetch\*.* /Q</em><br />
<em>Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks</em></div>
<p style="text-align: justify">- Opening <em>Regedit &gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SYSTEM &gt;CurrentControlSet &gt; Control &gt; Session Manager &gt; Memory Management &gt; PrefetchParameters &gt; EnablePreFetcher</em> and changing value data from 3 to 2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Although I doubt they have anything to do with it. I just need the certificate to appear for me to update the driver for my wireless receiver.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Thank you in advance.</p>

<h2>            Skate 3 Servers ...Come on EA..</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 1)">So does anyone know if they plan to fix all the horrible server problems on Skate 3 the games been out for a year now, over a year and the servers are still terrible. Every time someone joins the session everything freezes for
 up to 5 minutes either that or freezes up forever and you just have to go back to the dashboard. It happens every single time I try playing it online still.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 1)">They really need to get to fixing these problems it would be a fantastic game if it just worked properly.</span></p>

<h2>            Videos shot on DSC HX60 not transferring to Windows explorer folder</h2>
                    <blockquote>I have taken few videos by my Sony cybershot camera DSC HX7V. I can see those video when I play through camera. But when I connect the camera to the PC I can see only the pictures. No video files are visible on the screen , so I am unable
 to copy them to my PC. I have tried to connect the memory card directly to the PC to access the videos, but I failed to see. Also I tried to connect the camera through USB to access the video and again I failed. Please help as I want to save them on my HDD
 for future.</blockquote>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have recently purchased a Sony cybershot DSC HX60 and have the same problem, that when I try to transfer photos and videos to my laptop windows explorer file, &nbsp;it will transfer the photos
 but not the videos. &nbsp;I can view them on the camera but nothing on the laptop. &nbsp;I have tried the methods you suggest re hidden files, always connect with USB etc. but no success. &nbsp;My last Sony transferred no problem, so is it something with the complicated
 settings of the HX60. &nbsp;I can see that the videos on camera, show &nbsp;50iFH &nbsp;AVCHD?? &nbsp;Please help this is most frustrating.</span>

<p>Hi Ashish. &nbsp;Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>In answer to your queries, &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see the Cyber shot in the Computer folder and have no problem transferring the photographs to my Windows folder. &nbsp; &nbsp;The Auto-player is enabled and does open automatically when clicked. &nbsp; The video format of the DSC HX60 seems to be AVCHD (and thereby
 I suspect is the problem) &nbsp; &nbsp;I have no problems with any other devices in transferring files, only my new Sony DSC HX60.</p>
<p>I guess the problem is that AVCHD is not compatible with Windows folders or Media player. &nbsp;I transfer many other videos from other equipment and save or convert them to &nbsp; wmv. &nbsp;but in this case I cannot even transfer them to my laptop.</p>
<p>If a Codec is required, then please advise &nbsp;"which one is it?" &nbsp;as there appears thousands without any guidance as to what is likely to be successful. &nbsp;Your link to the FAQ doesn't really help.</p>
<p>Hope I have answered the queries OK.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Norden PCYB</p>
