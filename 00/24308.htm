<h2>            MS Excel The application failed to start because it&#39;s side by side configuration is incorrect. Please tell me I have not just lost 6 hours worth of work&#63;</h2>
                    I left my computer for 10 minutes, came back and there was some type of critical error / memory dump msg on my display.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I let Windows attempted to fix the problem and it went through 2 repairs before it finally loaded properly.
<br />
<br />
I then went to open Excel and continue working on my spreadsheet when I received the error, "The application failed to start because it's side by side configuration is incorrect.&nbsp; Please see the application even log or use the command line sxstrace.exe for
 more detail."&nbsp; So, I went to run it and the screen just barely pops open then closes again...
<br />
<br />
Please tell me there is a way to get Excel back up and running and potentially be able to retrieve what I was working on?<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 7 64bit and using office 07<br />

<h2>            How to Create a New User-Defined E-Mail Header Field to Sort and Select By</h2>
                    
<p>I have Outlook 2007</p>
<p>I have a lot of email traffic between me and a software company with well over 100 messages in the current folder. Each problem I report is assigned an 8-digit case#, which I enter into the Subject line so I can search on it. I may have up to 15 messages
 back and forth on any one case. And I have about 15 open cases.</p>
<p>I would like to create a new field in the message header (or eslewhere in the message)&nbsp;that would allow me to enter the case# there, and to add this new field as a display column, and to be able to sort on this field as I can now do on the default column
 fields. This would allow me to group and see all my messages by case#,&nbsp;(and by Category which I also enter for each message). Currently I search for the case# in the subject line, and this groups them together, but only for that one case#.</p>
<p>Can this be done in Outlook 2007, or 2010, and if so, how? I have tried, and could only find user-defined fields for Contacts, but that does me no good. I need them by message.</p>
<p>PS: if this can (only) be done using Visual Basic, I am not familiar with VB, and would need a complete Visual Basic program that I could just copy into the editor.</p>

<div>Custom headers (x-headers) will not translate into user properties without writing code to get the message headers as one long string and parse them looking for your x-header. Code to add those headers or preserve incoming headers
 would have to be running not only on your machine but with every one of your correspondents. Then the code would need to get the parsed x-headers and create user properties for each one.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So you need code that would be a COM addin (for deployment), every one needs to run it, and you need custom views to show the user properties created from the x-headers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are samples of creating x-headers using the Redemption library that you could search for on the Web, those could provide a starting point for your code. You'd also need Visual Studio to create the addin.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All that can be done but don't expect anyone to create this for you for fun. You would need to be willing to learn what you need to do to create and deploy such an addin or you would need to be prepared to pay someone to do
 that for you.</div>

<h2>            Disappearing Quick Access Toolbar items in Word</h2>
                    My customized Quick Access Toolbar keeps disappearing - mainly after a computer restart. The buttons that are disappearing are related to an add-in program called SDL Trados which however has it's own ribbon menu item (not under Add-Ins). How can I prevent
 this from happening?

<p>Hi Red</p>
<p>Hmmm. I can think of a couple of reasons this could happen:</p>
<p>1. Are you certain you've saved the changes to the QAT as "general" and not "in this document"? You can check this through the Word Options/Customize tab, the dropdown at the top right</p>
<p>2. Is it possible that this Add-in is being specifically unloaded or loaded during the Word sessions? If the Add-in isn't loaded, Word loses the link to the customization and the button disappears. It could be that the add-in is "load on demand" or that
 it isn't loaded when Word needs it to be in order to maintain the link to the button.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's no way that the Add-in could add a button to the QAT for you without destroying your own customizations. But if you have good contact to the manufacturer, perhaps they'd put a group with the "best buttons" onto the Tab you use most
 frequently during your work. Another possibility would be to ask them to add commands to a Custom Task Pane (that you could keep visible) or the right-click menu.</p>

            RESOLVED!!!
<div><br />
<div>After speaking to Microsoft at length, including sharing multiple log files with the MS support team, we concluded that the issue is definately with Xfinity/Comcast.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A call to Xfinity Internet support, and a quick escalation (free of charge) to the premium Signature support resulted in a conversation with a very helpful engineer called Brian. Brian had seen similar issues for SSL based sites that could not be accessed,
 but his previous experience had been banking sites not Office365.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Brian suggested we check if the Arris Gateway was the issue. He sent an update to my gateway to remove routing/firewall functionality and dumb the gateway down to a dumb modem (this meant I could only have ONE DIRECT&nbsp;Ethernet&nbsp;connection to test with).
 I removed all&nbsp;Ethernet&nbsp;cables, with the exception of one that I plugged into my laptop. I was then able to access all of the Microsoft SSL sites that had previously been mysteriously blocked/unable to connect to!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, the issue seems to be a bug in the firmware/software/hardware of the Arris Gateway. Xfinity are swapping out my gateway for a regular modem, and I'm going to NewEgg to purchase a router/firewall/wireless device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click the above link and&nbsp;select</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><b>Download now</b>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click run if you want to install automatically after downloading, or save if you want to put the file in a folder to manually install it.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span>Note</span></strong>: Please be sure that it will meet the system requirements of your computer, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>view system requirements</span></strong><span><b>&nbsp;</b></span>under<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Download now</span></strong><span><b>&nbsp;</b></span>in

<h3> old mate  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project 2010 view changes autosaving</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using MS Project 2010 and I find after creating a view and saving it as a unique name, any view changes I make whilst in that view are automatically saved as an "update current view".</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I customise a view and save it as "Status Update"</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I then have a temporary need to add or remove a column, and so I add or remove that column</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I wish to recover my "Status Update" view so pick it from the drop down list and there's no change - my "Status Update" view has been updated with the column changes I made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is how can I configure Project to discard unsaved view changes, or rather not auto-save view changes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your response however please consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>No I did not save or save as after making the column changes</li><li>Yes I realise a work-around would be to save-as "Status Update1" before making any changes to preserve my original "Status Update" view but why would I do that?</li><li>Perhaps my expectation of the software's behaviour is misguided - I would expect to save my view, then make changes, then without saving again re-select the view from the views list and have it restored, that is, changes would be&nbsp;discarded.</li></ul>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>After creating the view, copy it to the Global.mpt file through File &gt; Info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can restore the view to its original settings through View ribbon, Gantt chart drop-down, Reset to default.</p>

<h2>            nokia n90 and pc suite 6.70.22</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
another question.<br />
<br />
I am trying to connect my n90 to my pc to get some images off it and send sms.<br />
<br />
i can install pc suite 6.70.22 with no problems but i get a message saying the connected phone is not recognised. i have tried this with a 6680 and an n70 and this works fine on the machine i installed pc suite to.<br />
<br />
i have also tried this on a seperate machine, again i get the message from pc suite saying that the phone is not recognised - but the 6680 works fine.<br />
<br />
both machines run windows xp home with sp2 and pc suite 6.70.22. i am connecting with a ca-53, one machine has laspersky antivirus and the other has no antivirus or security software.<br />
<br />
i am able to use the get connected wizard but it does not complete untill i disconnect the phone from the pc.<br />
<br />
the firmware on my phone is: 3.0545.5.1 and has previously worked with pc suite 6.6 and pc suite 6.70.21<br />
<br />
has anyone else seen this problem, or been able to fix it?<br />
<br />
thanks

            If you have uninstalled and installed different PC Suite versions a lot, it is recommended that you run register cleaner from:<br />
<br />
http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,8764,84592,00.html<br />
<br />
First uninstall PC Suite, then run reg.cleaner and then install again.

            unfortunately no i dont.<br />
<br />
strangely enough pc suite gives me a message saying that the connected phone is not recognised then the icon in the system tray gives me an n90 connected balloon.<br />
<br />
i have reset factory settings and tried a full format but i still get this error message.

            Ups, I mixed this phone with 6230i, which has the mode selection, sorry to confuse you, the phone screen should not ask any questions. Anyways, there should be at least an indicator that USB is connected.<br />
<br />
I reread the post once again and if I understand right, your 6680 and N70 work OK, but with N90 you donät even get the USB drivers installed ? What does it say in device manager/hardware when you connect the phone and follow up from there what happens ?

            everything seems fine in device manager, i get all the icons i would expect to see there. i also get the usb symbol on the phone when it is connected. pc suite even goes as far as telling me that an n90 is connected - but i always get the message that
 the connected phone is not supported and no part of pc suite works.<br />
<br />
things where fine untill i updated my firmware on the n90

            YOu have to take the phone to firmware update again, something is missing from the phone. If you try to make a backup from the phone, do you get an error mesaage like" PC Suite support file is missing from the phone?) If that is the case it is clear thing,
 something went wrong in the firmware update.

            hi manta,<br />
<br />
i did as you suggested and got the phone re-flashed. however the problem still persists.<br />
<br />
i asked the engineer what hapend during the flash, he showed me the output at the end, it showed a screen describing what parts had been skipped. in the list it mentioned SOS PC Connectivity. i presume this is the part of the software that is needed for a connection?<br />
<br />
the version of software he is using to flash is 2005.20.7.98

            No Idea what the SOS PC Connectivity might be...<br />
I tried looking around in web but could not find the exact post, so I just write what I remember: YOu could use Symbian file manager to locate better the hidden files in your phone and make sure you can find the PC Suite support file in it. It shold be somewhere
 in C:

            <p>Hi Francis S.&nbsp; I ended up googling the answer to my question "where is the contact customer support" button on MS outlook.com.&nbsp; In an answer to someone else (who got the same rote answer to check their deleted files) you had used hypertext in the words "contact
 customer service" -- so that made a lot more sense.&nbsp; I've clicked it and we will see how Microsoft replies.&nbsp; There's a lot I'd like to say, but for now will just bite my tongue and hope that the emails from the past 16 or so years of my life have not been
 deleted by MS.&nbsp; I'm hopeful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, John </p>

<p>I know that this sort of thing is best kept under the covers by MicroSoft, and the whole Outlook/Hotmail dot com thing.&nbsp; But it has now been over a month (the destruction of my emails happened August 31) and I have had no good news, nor much response from
 them.&nbsp; They did ask some questions a few weeks ago, but I've heard nothing.&nbsp; I think it is Better Business Bureau and Federal Communications Commission time.&nbsp; Good thing I have my receipts for payment to them for the many years I paid for my Hotmail service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see some of those folks -- send them my way, I still don't have my email back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regs!&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Formatting of emails dissappearing upon reply from external email address</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Not sure if this is the correct forum however I would like some help.</p>
<p>I have a user who is sending out emails with numbering and bullet points</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a test</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a reply</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what will happen is when the external recipient responds the numbering and bullet points will dissappear? I am in the process of trying to recreate this issue but I would appreciate if someone could offer a reason to why this could be happening? Would it
 be something to do with the formatting i.e html/ rich text etc?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>many thanks</p>
<p>Matt</p>

            Hi <br />
<br />
1) This is an exchange email account, these issues were happening prior to an exchange upgrade.
<br />
<br />
2) The format of the email is html, I have created an external account to try and recreate the problem.
<br />
<br />
3) From what my understanding is it seems to happen with some external recipients. I am currently trying to establish a pattern with this (if any)
<br />
<br />
4) I did discover on some emails that despite the bullet points/numbering was missing in outlook it was viewable on an ipad and blackberry?
<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<p>Try to send an email from pop account if possible and ask the recipient to reply to that email and check if it works fine.</p>
<p>Also send an email from outlook web access and check if it’s the same issue.

            <p>Are the messages converting to plain text? Should still see the #, but not pretty formatting - unless the CSS is using icons for #.
</p>
<p>If the message is still HTML, it's possible something is happening to the CSS so that it&nbsp;is not rendered in the email client. What client does the recipient use? Have you looked at the HTML source and compared it to the source of the original?

<p>You';ll know it when you see it. :) </p>
<p>I'd first make sure both numbered lists have the correct html tags - it should look something like this:</p>
<p>&lt;ol&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;whatever &lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;more stuff &lt;/li&gt;</p>

<p>Is the folder a trusted location?&nbsp; (Office Button&gt;Word Options&gt;Trust Center&gt;Trusted Locations?</p>
<p>If you use File&gt;Open to open the template and then add some text and delete it (so that Word will think that the template has changed and really save it) and then save the template, can you then use it?</p>

            Usually if you are seeing the error 85010014 (a general error) then uninstalling and reinstalling&nbsp;Outlook will fix the issue.&nbsp; Try that and get back to us.

            The usual reason for this type of behaviour is that the combo box's bound column, the hidden first column in your case, does not contain distinct values.&nbsp; If whatever is selected from the visible column maps to the same value in the hidden bound column
 the first item in the list will be selected whatever value is selected in the control.&nbsp; You said earlier that
<em>'RowSource is determined by an earlier choice (by code) as one of two queries'</em>, but you have not given us the SQL statements for those queries.&nbsp; The fact that you are briefly seeing the selected item may be a timing phenomenon.

<h3> &#625;&#625;d  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have got the solution fix for KB3122947 update failure, no command prompt or anything, a solution for normal install via Windows update...</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi guys.</p>
<p>No need for any command prompt!! an easy and harmless fix, download Media Creation Tool, run it and just close it without doing anything inside of it, now try the update again. It will install fine. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason: the update installs fine if you have "$Windows.~WS" and "$WINDOWS.~BT" folders on "C:" drive, and possibly you have removed them before by running the disk cleanup tool, however by just running the Media Creation Tool it creates those folders. After
 the update installs you can safely remove these 2 folders. (make sure you have the Show Hidden Files option enabled to see them.) The reason (I think) that the KB3122947 update fails if they are not present is that it tries to look for them searching for older
 settings inside them to migrate those settings from your old Windows build (which should be inside those folders along with Windows.old) after the November update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. :)</p>

            Try doing a restore point.
<br />Go to search and type "create a restore point".
<br />Click system restore and run a restore point from before this happened.
<br />This will not wipe data but will remove any apps you installed after the restore point.
<br />
<br />If that does not work then you will need to reset your PC and keep your files.
<br />This will remove applications.
<br />To do this go to start - settings - update and security  - recovery - click Get Started to reset this PC.
<br />From there make sure to select the option that does NOT remove your files.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you make out.

<h2>            VBA automating Excel data-&#62; Visio org chart wizard -&#62; paste org chart back into Excel</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is possible (to get it to the point it looks nice), or worth the effort to do so, but figured folks here might have some advice and maybe someone here has already tried this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a workbook used by various individuals for HR purposes, which includes (today) a pasted .jpeg of that team's org chart that was originally created in Visio. I've got the source HR data already in the workbook from a server feed, but currently the
 process to update the org charts is manual, performed in each area (so there is also some inconsistencies in format).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used the Visio org chart wizard (and hate the newer default formats &lt;sigh&gt;), and was wondering from an automation perspective whether this could /all/ be automated with VBA. The Visio wizard requires the source file be closed, so I can save the relevant
 data in a temporary file and delete it after. I can open Visio with Excel VBA, but would need to trigger the wizard, identify the top member of the org chart, tell it to put the whole chart on one page, etc. Then save as a jpeg to bring back into Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone here done something similar? Any pointers or potential "gotchas"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: alternative would be to use the SmartArt org chart, copy/paste special/image... but being able to save the source Visio file would be of added value in my environment, since that is what is already being used and would allow within-month revisions
 to the org chart for other purposes. The org chart in the workbook has to be fixed/ non-editable.</p>

<p>Hi Rey- thank you for your reply. It appears that the forum headers no longer automatically include all the 'demographic' info collected during the posting process... I am using Office 2016 x32 on Win7 x64, and Visio 2016 Professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My data will include the employee ID and manager ID to create the hierarchy in Visio; the fields that will be included visually are the name and job title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per your request, here is a sample of source data and possible output (I couldn't figure out where the zeros are coming from or how to get rid of them, but that is secondary to determining if my larger goal is attainable).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could use SmartArt (e.g. adapt something like <a href="http://xlmix.blogspot.com/2010/04/generate-organization-chart-in-excel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://xlmix.blogspot.com/2010/04/generate-organization-chart-in-excel.html</a>), but that would leave the individual users without a current visio copy that they could edit as needed outside of this workbook, so Smartart is a last resort. Also, I don't think
 there are as many edit options with smartart in terms of layout options (e.g. force the first layer to always be center horizontal and second layers to always be right vertical, regardless of how many people are in each part of the reporting tree).</p>

<p>This project has increased in size to monthly recreation of 100's of charts- does anyone have suggestions/solutions for Excel VBA code to perform the automated creation?</p>
<p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Besides what David said we really need the error code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Music on an SD card will play as is on your phone.&nbsp; However, there may be limitations in the DRM of that music</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, music from XBOX Music or previously owned, NON DRM music will play.&nbsp; Ripped CD music should play.&nbsp; Zune DRM music, MAY play, though many people have had problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found the following play with little problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ripped CDs</li><li>Purchased music from Google lay</li><li>Purchased Music from Amazon</li><li>Purchased Zune Music (MP3)</li><li>Converted Purchased iTune music</li></ul>
<p>What I found won't play </p>
<ul>
<li>Zune Subscription Music</li><li>Older iTune Music</li><li>Music containing a license of any kind other than XBOX Music Pass</li></ul>
<p>I would wager the error code indicates your music is in one of the won't play area.</p>

<h2>            C2-03&#58; Internet and store apps not working&#47;gone</h2>
                    
<p>So a few days ago I tried to access the store to look for some apps via the store app that came with the phone. I got a message saying that there was a new version to download. So I did that, but I couldn't access the store as I kept getting a message saying
 that the app wasn't ready. I thought that maybe this was something like those computer programs that needed the machine to be restarted to properly take effect, so I turned the phone off. But when I turned it on again, the store button had vanished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now a similar thing has happened with the internet app (i.e. it wanted to update). It hasn't vanished, but it just doesn't start at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do to get these up and running again?</p>

<p>To sove this issue reinstall/update the phone firmware using nokia suite. On how to reinstall follow instructions given below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connect your phone to a computer &amp; select Nokia Suite mode. If you do not have Nokia Suite on your pc you can download it from
<a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_Suite_webinstaller_ALL.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Now open the Nokia Suite &amp; click on the “green icon of arrow pointing downwards”.</p>
<p>If any updates are available they will be shown in ‘green’. If not you may reinstall the current version. Reinstall option is shown in ‘blue’. If no option to reinstall is shown, please wait for sometime it will become visible. &nbsp;Then the Nokia Suite will
 download the new software version of the phone. After it you will be prompted to take a complete back up of the device content. Please
<strong><u>do not skip</u></strong> this step as reinstallation will erase all the personal data from the phone like contacts, messages, calendar entries etc.</p>
<p>Please note that if you have set a memory card password &amp; you have forgotten its code then take a backup of the card data also as the card will be locked after update and can only be unlocked if you enter the correct code or by ways mentioned in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Wiki/8585FFB1-9990-4929-B9ED-0FAFE0367E6D">
this thread</a>.</p>
<p>Also note that while updating the device ensure the following things-</p>
<ol>
<li>The device is full charged.</li><li>The internet connection Is of good speed &amp; has a backup in case of power loss.</li><li>The PC should also be connected to back up power source as if the process is interrupted the phone may go dead. More on update failure &amp; its remedies
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Wiki/CBAC00CC-7651-4DCF-8B11-8A6E5DC30D4E">
here</a>.</li><li>Please do not run any resource intensive programs in the background while updating as it may freeze the PC which in turn will lead to a dead device.</li><li>Ignore all the windows pop-up notifications about device being disconnected.</li></ol>
<p><strong><u>DO NOT DISCONNECT THE PHONE UNTIL UPDATE IS COMPLETED.</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It will be better if you disable security keyguard &amp; PIN code request before proceeding with Update/Reinstallation.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any problem persists please visit the nearest authorised Nokia Care Centre.</p>
