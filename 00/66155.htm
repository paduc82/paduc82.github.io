<h2>            I&#38;&#35;39&#59;am being electrocuted by my Xbox controller&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the past few days (4 days to be exact) I have been getting electrocuted by my wired Xbox 360 controller. The first time I just passed it off as static charge, I mean I know in the winter the air is dryer so static builds up much easier. The second
 time I was shocked was while playing online only this time the shock came through my headset. The headset I was using was a wired Xbox 360 headset. I have a wireless one but when it dies I use the wired while it charges. Both my controller and mica are in
 great condition, the controller is 2 years old and the mic 3. The controller and mic are both official Xbox accessories nether are aftermarket or third party. The mic does not have the foam cover over the speaker as it was sinnged by the shock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now that you are aware of my issue let me explain what I tried to do to fix said issue. I was told by friends online and some loved ones that it could be something to look into legally about because I was being shocked and so on. Well I'm not
 one to want to run off and sue over just anything so I would rather let the company make it right. So I contacted Xbox.com support via chat to try and get this issue fixed. So I'm going to post the transcription from the chat and let you decide if I should
 just do what they suggest or if I should take this further cause honestly if this is how they handle an issue like this I' am highly disappointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Hello Denna</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>\\** I know I spelled her name wrong and I did apologize for it before I logged off**\\</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:01:37<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Xbox Chat Support. I am Deanna. Please give me a moment to review your concern.<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:01:39<br />
<br />
ok<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:02:52<br />
<br />
Thanks for waiting.<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:03:10<br />
<br />
I understand that you are having an issue with your contoller, is that correct?<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:04:15<br />
<br />
Yes but i could not fully describe the issues in the description box cause there is a word limit i could finish if you would like but yes I am having an issue with my controller and wired microphone<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:05:56<br />
<br />
I see. For me to further assist you, can you please be specific with your issue Joshua?<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:07:26<br />
<br />
Yes , my wired controller has electrocuted via the mic port. Another issue is if I plug in my wired mic i get electrocuted through the speaker in my ear. It only happens with this controller and headset.<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:08:53<br />
<br />
Considering the mic is a analog receiver i don't believe it should be receive enough power to shock me and injure my er.<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:09:37<br />
<br />
I see. Can you please try to use the controller without the microphone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>\\**Yes that’s right you just read that , they really suggest stop using it. Well we know you paid for this mic but hey stop using it cause you got money to just *** away**\\</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:09:56<br />
<br />
Also, may I know what type of microphone are you using?<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:10:12<br />
<br />
The microsoft xbox 360 wired headset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>\\** This was the third time I needed to state what equipment I was using that’s including the description of the problem before I got connected to chat.**\\</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:11:22<br />
<br />
I see.<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:11:30<br />
<br />
and even if i don't use the headset the controller should still not shock me.The only answer you can give me is dont use it. Why not try to fix the issue i bought the equipment it should work and not hurt me.<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:12:04<br />
<br />
I also know its not your fault its just a frustrating situation<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:13:23<br />
<br />
I really understand where you are coming from and you want that your concern will be fixed. I just want to do some troubleshooting before we consider some options here.<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:14:03<br />
<br />
I am sorry for the inconvenience Joshua and I am here to help you find a resolution to your concern.<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:16:11<br />
<br />
Can you please try to use other usb ports Joshua?<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:17:17<br />
<br />
I have had this issue on more than one Xbox I currently have 4 in my house all hooked up to different tvs this happens at all of them with this controller and headset and only this controller and headset.<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:21:04<br />
<br />
I understand that and just to make sure, have you tried other usb ports on the console that you have and if it does the same thing?<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:23:08<br />
<br />
Im very sorry if this comes off as mean or rude but considering I use it in 4 different Xbox's yes I have used it at least in 4 different Usb ports differing from the front Usb ports to the rear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>\\** This is the point where I got annoyed she really just asked me a question twice in a row after I already answered it. Given I did not give a easy yes or no but she could have got my answer had she read what I said. But I digress**\\</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:27:36<br />
<br />
I see. Joshua, I perfectly understand that. Based on the information that you have provided, the last option that we have is to replace the controller Joshua since it will not be fixed through the troubleshooting steps.<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:28:10<br />
<br />
Okay what steps do i need to take to get it replaced<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:29:10<br />
<br />
Alright. Please go to myservice.xbox.com to be able to get it replaced.<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:30:18<br />
<br />
so i just go to this website and they know to replace my controller? Or do you provide a ticket or query number to inform them of this replacement or will i need to go through all with them?<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:32:18<br />
<br />
Joshua, On the website, sign in your account and you will be getting an options there. Just choose Replace an accessory.<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:32:54<br />
<br />
Then you just have to follow until the replacement request will be submitted. You will then get your order number.<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:33:32<br />
<br />
okay and last question when I get the replacement order number do they provide shipping of the defective controller to them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>\\** At this point I was sure that this issue would be fixed and taken care of. **\\</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:34:48<br />
<br />
After processing the request, you should receive an email within 24 hours with the instructions on how to ship the controller.</p>
<p>\\** Well that just seemed like she sidestepped the question and made me retract my previous hope.**\\</p>
<p><br />
Joshua: at 14:35:33<br />
<br />
But that doesn't exactly answer my question. Do i need to pay for the shipping or do they provide shipping.<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:37:43<br />
<br />
I am sorry for that, if it is under warranty, its for free but if its out-of-warranty, there will be a shipping fee for the new controller to be shipped to you.</p>
<p>\\** At this point this is what they are telling me .So basically I need to pay them because their product is shocking me**\\<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:40:15<br />
<br />
So i just want to get a clear yes or no on this so i can make my decision on what to do. I purchased equipment made my Microsoft for the Xbox 360 this equipment had become defective and has thus electrocuted me multiple times with no fault of damage or modification
 and the companies policy is to request that I pay a shipping fee to get this fix if my warranty is up? Is that all correct?<br />
<br />
Deanna: at 14:42:33<br />
<br />
Yes, that is correct, if the warranty is up, there will be a shipping fee.</p>
<p>\\** Yes it is now confirmed I will need to pay Microsoft because their product is shocking yup that is what they are telling me.**\\<br />
<br />
Joshua: at 14:44:41<br />
<br />
Okay I would like to just state that no threat of leagal action will be made here. What I will be doing though is taking my issue and the transcription this chat conversation and placing into a public form to see how the owners of Microsoft products would like
 to see how an issue like this would be resolved. If anyone from the company needs to reach me for any reason my cell phone # is ###-###-####</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I didn’t&nbsp; log off at that point I did apologize for spelling her name wrong and assured her I wasn’t upset with her personally just the situation. I only added the quotes proceeded by \\** and followed by **\\ &nbsp;and removed my cell # I didn’t even correct
 my spelling errors. So what I want to know is what would you do in this situation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.)&nbsp; File a lawsuit because their product is shocking me and I have reported it and their not concerned with getting it fixed and only with getting their fees.</p>
<p>B.)&nbsp; Shut my mouth and just pay the fee and throw good money after bad money.</p>
<p>C.)&nbsp; Keep using it cause if they don’t see any danger here I shouldn’t ether.</p>
<p>I would like to hear everyone’s opinions on this and see how you would handle this issue. Me however I’m going with C and if something happens maybe then they will look into it.</p>

<p>So, You have quite a few consoles in your home and only use the defective controller????? &nbsp; YOU are paying for shipping--- a separate cost from the replacement. &nbsp; Please talk to a lawyer!!!!! &nbsp;I am interested to hear how fast they decline your false claim
 for shipping fees as MS did indeed offer a solution, &nbsp; YOU refused. &nbsp;Option D-- &nbsp; &nbsp;Use a different Controller--- You should have at least 4. Option E--- trade it in at a game shop. &nbsp; &nbsp; What do your parents think??? &nbsp; GOOD LUCK!!!</p>

<p>@BongKaos </p>
<p>Firstly i chose to continue to use equipment and not to file any legal action. Secondly yes 4 Xboxes and this is my controller this is the one i use all the time sense I got my 360 so yes I will continue to use it it works great other than the fact that
 it is shocking me. Third the lawsuit wouldn't be over shipping cost it would be over a defective product shocking a customer and them not taking care of the situation (i.e taking the product form the consumer to ensure it doesn't further cause them harm).
 It's not about money yes i could just as easily buy a new one but why should i have to nothing has been done to the original equipment to cause this issue so they should be able to take care of it . They could send me a shipping label to have it in for repairs
 and that would be fine but no they want me to spend more money and yes the money for the fee is paid to them not Fedex of UPS because the fee is for the replacement not the shipping as she stated. I'm sure at some point during your high and mighty post you
 thought you were really on to something there but you clearly paraphrased the post and formed your opinion but hey i guess that's what i get for saying I wanted to hear everyone opinion. Lastly I'm not really sure what my parents would think because i bought
 all of it myself so I'm not really sure how they come into play here. I guess your thinking I'm a child well there you go assuming again.</p>
<p>@THEOWENKILLER</p>
<p>Its not a matter of free its a matter of them letting their equipment harm someone and before they will fix it they want your money again. No its a full on wired controller not a plug and play.</p>

<p>That`s the whole point of a warranty.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Any electrical current that made it to you would first have to pass through that controller,if that current was enough to do you any harm it would certainly have fried the controller,making it unusable.</p>
<p>Is the controller still working?</p>

<p>The controller is now dead and I have a fried Xbox. While playing today another surge came through this time frying the xbox and controller while also tripping my fuse breaker. The only silver lining is nothing else is damaged and the Xbox is still under
 warranty and its coming with a new controller. The only issue was they did not see the fact that it was sending and electrical current through the headset and into my ear as a concern. But yeah all is fixed now, well will be soon. 10 days or so thanks for
 the convo enjoy 2014 all.</p>

            My bad. I thought they uploaded in a specific category since I had to tick several boxes defining the program and the issue. I am using Windows 10, and I mistakenly clicked the Windows 10 Desktop right click functionality called "Undo New".&nbsp;

    <title>Corrupted slideshow files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimberliel.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted slideshow files</h2>
                    <p>I've been working on sideshows for a few days for the family on christmas eve. I got everything all set, but when I try to save it it's corrupted almost every time. I tried different set ups with horizontal pics only, vertical pics only, with and without
 music, themes, and movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31386abe-79d0-4e05-99f1-518613df2606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31386abe-79d0-4e05-99f1-518613df2606" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the result, full screen pink and purple corrupted video. The music is ok but that's all. I got it to save correctly twice using only vertical smart phone pics, but then my lucky magic left and that won't even work now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've restarted, reset the app and my system is up to date. Any ideas? I need to have this done tomorrow or it's a bust. I can't find any other slideshow making apps that can correctly handle the vertical smart phone pics, which I have a large number of.
 Thanks for any help!</p>

            <p>You can sort by the date the file was created and/or last modified. &nbsp;To do that, right-click a blank space, choose "Sort by" and then pick "Date" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to sort by file name, it will sort alphabetically. &nbsp;Luckily, since the dates are at the front of the file name, you can sort that way and it will sort in order, which still works out to be in date order, thanks to the ascending or descending
 order of the numbers. &nbsp;This works best if you use Year-Month-Day order.</p>

<h2>            Headset adapter echo</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Hey, so I just picked up the xbox one stereo headset (comes with the adapter).&nbsp; I have been loving it for the most part, comfortable, good sound, etc.</p>

<p>However when I am playing in a party with friend's, they can hear an echo of themselves talking from my headset.&nbsp; Also if I use the skype on the xbox one, another friend said the same thing.</p>

<p>Now I am not too sure if it's the headset, or the adapter causing this issue, but echoes are pretty annoying lol..
</p>

<p>Also, the audio cord from the headset, while it's plugged in, if it rotates, or moves a little, I get a bit of static in the headset.&nbsp; I assume that's not good, and could possibly be shipping damage?</p>

<p>I am having the same issue. Although I bought two of them. One for myself, and one for my brother. My friends say that we both sound like we are whispering and they are hearing echo. If I mute my Mic the echo stops. The sound pops and crackles and the same
 issue with the plug, if it's touched there's a loud popping. Very upset because these are brand new, made by Microsoft, and they cost me $80 a piece.</p>

<p>Same with Me. Turtle Beach X32 headset with the stereo adapter for the XBONE controller.. My game audio doubles up and echoes a bit, and my party members hear themselves echo back. It's Frustrating seeing as how I paid $90 for this headset with my XB360,
 and $350 for a console and now they won't talk. </p>

<p>You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a></p>
<p>Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable</p>
<p>Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If needed up load the minidump to SkyDrive so we can analyze them.<br />
<br />

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Check for BIOS and driver updates.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<strong>1.</strong> Run DriverVerifier as indicated in the next message.<br />
<br />
--------------</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, diagnostics, and ask in their forums<br />
about known issue. Check for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the other major on-board<br />
drivers. Also update the major separate device drivers - run DriverView and set VIEW to Hide Microsoft<br />
drivers - update those without Dump in their name. See the methods in the next message.<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = 5.05&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
BiosReleaseDate = 06/04/2009 &lt;-- check for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the other<br />
major on-board and separate device drivers.<br />

===========================================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 39&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000039&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</strong>The most common cause of this Bug_Check is a driver. If there is nothing referenced by the ln command<br />
run DriverVerifier as indicated in the next message.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Bug Check 0x39: SYSTEM_EXIT_OWNED_MUTEX</strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p>The SYSTEM_EXIT_OWNED_MUTEX bug check has a value of 0x00000039. This indicates that the worker routine returned without releasing the mutex object that it owned.</p>
Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code
<p>If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact information for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>The following actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
SYSTEM_EXIT_OWNED_MUTEX Parameters
<p>The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.<br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The worker routine returned while it still owned a mutex object. The current worker thread will proceed to run other unrelated work items, and the mutex will never be released.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution</strong></p>
<p>A debugger is required to analyze this problem. To find the driver that caused the error, use the
<strong>ln</strong> (List Nearest Symbols) debugger command:</p>
<p>kd&gt; ln address</p>
<p>Where address is the worker routine given in Parameter 1.</p>

Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error<br />
information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />

<h2>            Says Windows license key is expired, can&#39;t use original BIOS OEM key</h2>
                    <p>My problems first arrived with the Fall Creators update, which somehow made my computer switch to Windows 10 Pro (it came with Home). It lead to the OS rejecting the OEM key in the UEFI firmware, and for a while I kept getting "Activate Windows" messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some time, it reverted back to Home (after another bug fix update maybe :| ), but instead of using the OEM key, it used a key which I recognize as a default no-key-provided key. This activated it using "your organization's activation server" so I just
 adopted a 'ain't broke, ain't fixing' attitude.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently however, Windows has started showing me "Your windows license is about to expire messages", understandably because the key is kinda sorta wrong. I tried to activate by reading the BIOS key and using that, but it gave me a 0xC004F050 error, presumably
 because HP uses there own activation server at assembly plants before shipping them off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS : I prefer not talking to someone on the phone</p>

<p>You should use the OEM key in your bios. If you have that licence key then that is your legitimate licence. Activation is via MS servers and not HP.</p>
<p>

<p>You should use the OEM key in your bios. If you have that licence key then that is your legitimate licence. Activation is via MS servers and not HP.</p>

<p>(A) I have stated that I tried to use the OEM key, but the computer didn't accept it and defaulted to a generic key.</p>
<p>(B)Well I had Home Single Language initially, but the Fall Creators Update switched it to Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel that since this problem was caused by Microsoft's update, it is their job to fix it and that I am not liable to wipe my drive for a Windows activated by OEM key.</p>

            <p>My computer is an HP Stream7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send files 1 by 1 via bluetooth. &nbsp;The devices are paired. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to send the files to the WIN-10 machine. &nbsp;If I queue up the files on the sending device &nbsp;and send then I can click receive but it only gets one file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is the option so windows10 will automatically receive all the files I send to my PC from this paired-device?</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 UPDATE CAUSING COMPUTER TO BECOME VERY SLOW. ANY KNOWN FIXES &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello , like many others my computer has become very slow since upgrading to Windows 10 .Opening files ,folders ,apps ,web browsing , everything i do is so slow to respond , at times making the computer almost unusable . I have&nbsp; cleaned caches ,run full
 anti virus and malware scans several times , defragged the hard drive ,cleared junk files , scanned for disk errors and rebooted again several times but the result is still the same , a very slow computer . This appears to be quite a common problem but to
 date no real solutions have come to light . Any body have any sensible , viable ideas ? . Might be a good idea to revert back to previous O/S and maybe come back to Windows 10 in a few weeks or months time . Maybe just maybe some of these issues will have
 been resolved .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle&nbsp; Zeb<br />

            POP T2T was released in '05, a bad year for DRM conflicts.<br />
Using a noCD crack is most often the only way to fix a DRM conflict. This conflict most often has<br />
to do with 64bit OS's ( A result of short sighted programming by the developers of the DRM
<br />
system, and Monopoly$oft charging a fee to 'sign' drivers for Win7 ).<br />
<br />
<i>"and some patch thing "</i><br />
Maybe the driver signing, but without the exact text we can only guess.<br />
<br />
There is a 64bit update for Tages copy protection. I know this update helps with The Witcher, but don't know if it helps all games that use Tages.<br />
<a href="http://www.tagesprotection.com/main.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TAGES, the AAA Copy Protection System</a>
<br />
<br />
SecureROM may also have an update, but I have not bothered looking (I use&nbsp; noCD cracks).<br />

<h2>            Problem z XBox Live</h2>
                    
<p>Witam wszystkich . Mam duży problem z usługą xbox live . Przy włączeniu konsoli wyświetla mi się błąd 807b0194. Myślałem że wyczyszczenie pamięci podrecznej coś pomoże. Jak się okazało tylko pogorszyło sprawę , nie mogę ściagnąć łatki do gier bo wyskakuje
 mi błąd . Czy ktoś może miał taki problem ??? . Proszę o pomoc</p>

<p>jak dla mnie próbuje wyświetlić Ci stronę dostawcy usługi (tak się dzieje np. przy zmianie komputera, kiedy masz możliwość podłączenia tylko jednego - przy nowym na komputerze wyświetla się strona z informację że np. ten komputera chcesz dodać jako nowy),
 jak podłączasz konsolę, masz dhcp? jaki dostawca netu?</p>

<p>No i miałeś rację :-) . Wina stała po stronie usługodawcy . Administrator wysłał mi informację na kompa i &nbsp;po odczytaniu klikam aby odblokować strony ale konsola mi się nie odblokowała . A żeby podłaczyć konsolę musiałem zgłosić bo inaczej nie widzi mi neta

<p>A lot of those type of&nbsp;free Programs just try to scam you.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Restore Point:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />

Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer to put it back
 to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash, when you are up and running
 correctly&nbsp;again..</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 BSOD&#39;S when PC is idle critical_process_died - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josiplovrei  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD&#39;S when PC is idle critical_process_died</h2>
                    <p><span>So after upgrading to W10, and after clean reinstall of W10 I've had a lot of bsod's.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I already posted a question because I thought they were connected as it stands one issue is resolved, and one still remains. First issue you can find in link below. Basically the problem was that my Kaspesrky wasn't playing nice with some video
 recording software, after I uninstalled that software that bsod stopped.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-bsod-it-says-irql-gt-zero-at-system/c7cd1fc3-3671-418b-aacf-8d3e29df38ef">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-bsod-it-says-irql-gt-zero-at-system/c7cd1fc3-3671-418b-aacf-8d3e29df38ef</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But one still remained, if you can call it bsod. What happens is that every time when my pc is idle it is like my OS HDD just shuts down. I get the bsod image (see below) but it is not generated in even viewer and there is no mem dump. I once left
 it overnight and it stayed it 0% as in image below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79707c20-c7bc-40f0-bcaf-20e1b2ef0147" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So when this happens if I push restart button on my case PC boots, but my OS HDD is missing (others are detected normally) and it is not spinning (there are not any vibrations coming from him). So what I need to do is hold power button to completely
 shut down PC, and when I power it back on OS HDD is spinning and OS is booting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is like OS HDD is not getting power or something. And I can’t figure it out if it is software (W10) or hardware problem. And I think it is not hardware because I tried changing HDD power lines from my PSU, and SATA ports for HDD’s. And problem still
 remains. </span></p>
<p><span>And when it happens if I restart PC I can’t see OS HDD but when I power PC down and back on, after that OS HDD is back on and working nice. And it only happens when PC is idle I am using it quite heavily over the weekends 10+ hours and it never crushes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thx in advance for any help.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>The official forum has been nothing but useless solving this issue. In the end, the MVPs just echo the "update driver, send us log" cycle. And when that doesn't work, they just ignore it.&nbsp;</p>

 a fax modem or server." Dialer.exe in Windows/System32 worked without any errors. It will dial and connect to phone called. Program worked prior to update. No other hardware was added. Only change was the Windows 10 update in June.&nbsp;</span></p>
