<p>Hi to the both of you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post and welcome to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for the Contacts transfer app on the Lumia to work the other device needs to support Bluetooth 2.1 with the Phone Book Access Profile. As far as the&nbsp;N95 goes that model does not support this profile in Bluetooth so the app does not work. I can't
 say about the Samsung models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this forum there are a number of threads which cover this question like <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/466F0BA5-C794-45A6-AA3B-6B46BC4C73E3">

<h2>            LONG existing alias has changed to send ONLY status, how to change back to send and receive emails&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    My pitmaster@**********.com alias has been in use since 2011, it is the primary addy for our business. Since early October it has been unable to receive emails except ONE that was sent from Microsoft. Some how/some
 way it has changed to a send only alias with my *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;&nbsp;address remaining the primary (thank God that one still works fine so far). How do I change it back&nbsp;to a send/receive alias?? A tad hesitant since
 I'm not sure why it was changed to&nbsp;send only status to begin with. Do I need to delete it then re-add it? There doesn't seem to be a function to change it to send/receive unless I'm&nbsp;missing something. Thanking you in advance, I cross my fingers and remain
 mildly optimistic that this can be resolved. P'raps a bit more than mildly optimistic, maybe extremely hopeful is more accurate.&nbsp;

Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
1. Are you using any email client?<br />
2. Do you get any error message?<br />
<br />
<br />
This issue might occur if the send/receive settings are corrupted.<br />
<br />
I didn’t receive an email someone sent me<br />

            <p>No error msgs whatsoever. When I send to it from our regular Hotmail addy it gives all the illusion of going thru, it shows up in our Sent folder but it's never received by the alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as an email client?? The alias that's having problems was set up 3 years ago thru/in Hotmail and has functioned flawlessly both sending and receiving e-mails up until 3 weeks ago. PLEASE bear in mind that the
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** alias is/has been our primary business email address. It has NOT been receiving msgs from our accountant, customers, vendors, business contacts, anyone whatsoever except ONE e-mail
 from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The alias details now show it having been changed to a SEND ONLY alias, which it NEVER was. We've looked at deleting it and setting it back up as a send &amp; receive alias (as it has been for over three years) but it starts asking about POP, etc.. which means&nbsp;nothing
 to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had been using it as a send/receive alias for over three years, we've made no changes on our end, we DESPERATELY need the problem with it corrected. It's costing us time, money and customers.</p>

            <p>Send only or Send/receive addresses (accounts) are not aliases.&nbsp; You cannot login to your Microsoft account with a Send only or Send/receive address.&nbsp; It is not listed as an alias, so it cannot be made into the primary alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you add the address (account) to outlook.com,&nbsp;you enter the password for that address.</p>
<p>You can also add the smtp settings for the address so that sent emails will use the server for that address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All emails for that address go to the server for that address.&nbsp; For send/receive accounts, outlook.com connects with that server ever 30 minutes to check for new messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access the emails on the server using an email program or you may be able to use webmail.</p>

            <p>The secondary ? e-mail addresses are referred to under OPTIONS as Aliases which is why I've been referring them as such. OPTIONS also shows Send Only aliases (their wording, not mine) and has capability to create a send and receive alias (again, Microsoft
 wording not mine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the alias was created in Hotmail&nbsp;3 years ago, no settings smtp or otherwise was entered, it merely asked what address for the alias (secondary) and that was that. Again, everything has worked fine for 3 years. 3 weeks ago it stopped working fine. We'd
 like it fixed/to fix it. It is a business address. It is costing us money and customers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I thank you Ron for your reply, it doesn't seem to address the problem. We added and have been using a business e-mail addy alias (secondary, etc.) for 3 years. It's not working now. We've made no changes on our end which would perhaps indicate the
 resolution may not be on our end.</p>

<p>No, I'm not saying my Hotmail address is showing as an alias. I'm saying again that my 3 year existing fully functional end/receive Hotmail alias is now a Send only addy. I received continuos msgs. to the
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** address up to and including 9/20. Since then the only RECEIVED e-mail to
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** was from Microsoft. The secondary addy is, as stated before, now showing as a Send only address rather than send and receive as it had been for 3 years. AGAIN, we want to know how
 to have the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** address as a send/receive address as it had been.&nbsp;Again, as far as POP settings whatever, we never&nbsp;did anything along those lines when the addy was created, we merely
 want the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** address to send AND receive as it had for 3 years. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>how to change default reminder for birthdays &#40;Social Connector and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> .cosmo.  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to change default reminder for birthdays &#40;Social Connector and Outlook contact card&#41;</h2>
                    I'm using Outlook Social Connector on Outlook 2013 x64.<br />
<br />
I'd like to know if there a possibility to change the default reminder of imported contact's birthdays. Now the default reminder is 15 minutes. That means, if someone has birthday on Tuesday, it will remind me on Monday 23:45 at night. This is very annoying
 as I need to have my PDA close to my bed.<br />
Birthday calendar in Outlook is read-only. I do not want to recreate all birthday events into my main calendar.<br />
<br />
This question also applies for changing default reminder when a birthday is specified directly on a contact card in Outlook. AFAIK, there is a reminder set to 24 hours ahead of that event. So it will popup precisely at midnight.<br />
<br />
Thanks for answering. <br />
<br />
PS: I don't know if I put this in right forum. In case I don't please forward it to the right one.<br />
<br />

            <p>You need to use VBA code to set it for some, but not all, birthdays.&nbsp; i have code samples here:

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>not knowing what&nbsp;you mean by reminders with the social connector (it shows only info from&nbsp;social networks, it doesn't set reminders), VBA may not affect these. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Help_928,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if the attendees of the meeting have Skype for Business license. If all of them have the license and make sure the sign in credentials in Skype for Business is &nbsp;the same credentials on Outlook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if the normal Skype meetings or other recurring meetings are affected.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the issue still occurs, please follow the steps and provide the following information to further troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p>1. If you are using the Outlook client to join the meeting, try to copy the link (right-click “Join Meeting”, and paste on the browser address box with a &nbsp;(<strong>?sl=1</strong>) on the end. For example:
<a href="https://join.contoso.com/meet/patrick/ABCDEFGH?sl=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://join.contoso.com/meet/patrick/ABCDEFGH?sl=1</a>&nbsp; if not, please user In-private browsing or incognitio/private window browsing to access the link.</p>
<p>2. Check if you can join the meeting on another computer.</p>
<p>3. The screenshot of the error.</p>
<p>4. If you are using Outlook client try to join the meeting in Outlook on the Web (OWA) and vice versa.</p>
<p>5. The detailed version for your Skype for Business client (Gear &gt; Help &gt; About Skype for Business). Example is “Skype for Business 2015 (15.0.4893.1000) 32-bit”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to your updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Ruel</p>

Now there's some new information. State your mail account type, how your migrated your data, how you reset your rules to a new installation, and why yout left this information out from your first post.

            <p>I would try using one of the correct methods for transferring Outlook data that we post here daily and then resetting rules to the new location. Nothing you did would work.

</p>
<p>Note that some of the information on the Microsoft page is outdated and contains errors, particularly when applied to Outlook 2003, 2007 or 2010. Specifically:<br />
1. Ignore any advice to copy your PST file to Outlook's default location to connect it to your profile. Doing so will often corrupt your Outlook profile. Copy it anywhere BUT the default location and then open it within your Outlook profile.<br />
2. Ignore any advice that tells you to use export or import to transfer an entire Outlook data file. That has never been sound advice, but the process has become too deeply flawed to be trusted.
</p>
<p>Also, when you use manual configuration for your mail accounts in Outlook 2010 (always preferable) it has a nice new option that lets you connect to a pre-existing data file when creating a new profile instead of having to jump through all the hoops of creating
 a new file, connecting to the pre-existing file, then disconnecting the new file.

<p>Hi Shab786,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not feasible to do so (adding a checkbox next to each of inbox emails). The only solution for selecting several emails at once is the method (holding CTRL key to select them) provided by Vasil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

&nbsp; I was having the same problem, and none of the things in this thread were fixing it - super frustrating. &nbsp;I found another answer that worked for me though:&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/word/thread/0374e7ed-0c01-4317-bf75-689bb988079f/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/word/thread/0374e7ed-0c01-4317-bf75-689bb988079f/</a>.
 &nbsp;Apparently add-ins can be an issue. &nbsp;Hope this helps you guys!

<p>Further update.&nbsp; Upon examination, I have discovered that "mail" seems to work only on Microsoft accounts.&nbsp; As to other email carriers, only the fact that the email was sent is available. I can not get the message proper to download.&nbsp; However, if I use Outlook
 2016, it will download the messages from all of my email carriers once they are set up.&nbsp; Why can't I get the "mail" portion of Windows 10 to download the messages from my accounts other than Microsoft accounts.. (I checked the settings in "Mail"&nbsp;and they seem
 to be correct.)&nbsp; With the other emails I receive an error code of:&nbsp; 0x80c805e2.&nbsp; even though it appears the settings are the same.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi,</span> </strong></p>
<p><strong><span>My first newbie question for OneNote, just trying to see what things were possible so I don't know if what I've done is the best way:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>In a page, I want&nbsp; display of links from a folder in my Firefox bookmarks so I simply dragged the folder onto the page and hey presto!</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>My question is though will they sync each other such as adding a bookmark in Firefox and or deleting a link in OneNote? If not, is there an alternative way of achieving this?</span></strong></p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Outlook in Office 365 and Apple iCloud</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a new laptop running under Windows 10 64 bit, and which has Office 365 installed.&nbsp; I have managed to install the Apple iCloud application, but when I click the
<span>checkbox "Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and Tasks With Outlook", I get the following error message:</span></p>
<span>checkbox "Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and Tasks With Outlook", I get the following error message:</span></p>
<p><span><em>"Setup can't continue because outlook isn't configured to have a default profile. Check you outlook setting and try again."</em></span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>I have already re-installed both iCloud and Office 365, but to no avail.&nbsp; I have ensured that a default profile exists in Outlook (it does exist and you can see it in the control panel, as well as in the Windows' registry).</p>
<p>I also have contacted the Apple support, who said this is a Microsoft issue, and that I should contact Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my prior laptop, which was also running Windows 10 64 bit and Office 365, all was fine.&nbsp; Any ideas on what might be going on this time?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled Outlook using the Microsoft special utility to do a complete uninstall.&nbsp; I have then uninstalled iCloud.&nbsp; Then I have rebooted.&nbsp; Next, I have re installed Outlook, and set it as the default application for managing emails.&nbsp; Then I have
 re-installed icloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, every time I launch icloud, I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfil the messaging request.&nbsp; Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client."</em></p>

<p>Kindly check if the Outlook is properly installed on your device. Go to your <strong>
Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Programs</strong> &gt; <strong>Programs and Features</strong> &gt; look for the Office suite or Outlook if you installed a standalone program. If you are not able to see any Microsoft Office Program, we would suggest that you
 it properly using your Microsoft account associated with the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the following workarounds that can also help resolve your issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set Outlook as Default: Go to your device <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; make sure that
<strong>Outlook 2016</strong> is the one that you have selected under <strong>Email</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start up Options: Open Outlook application &gt; go to <strong>File</strong> tab &gt;
<strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; make sure that <strong>Make Outlook the default program for E-mail, Contacts, and Calendar</strong> is enable &gt; click
<strong>OK</strong> to save changes.<br />

<p>I am also having the same problem. I have installed both the 32 bit and 64 bit version of office and icloud will not communicate with either of them. I have reinstalled both programs multiple times and even tried a multi step install along with older versions
 of icloude. I get the following error each time. I see post all over the internet about this problem. Certainly Microsoft has come up with a fix. How do I correct this? I have a brand new computer that I cannot sync with.</p>

            I have exactly this problem. I can not sync my Apple calendars to Outlook 2016 via iCloud for Windows. I continually get the error message telling me that Outlook is not configured to have a default profile. Everywhere I can check, Outlook is the default.
 I've tried all of the suggestions here to no avail. This appears to be a very common issue for users of Windows 10 laptops and Apple devices.

<h2>            I cannot use my outlook e-mail from my home country, any attempt to send a message will block my account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I create my account in Austria when I bought a new computer.</p>
<p>After that I came to my home country (Romania) and I tried to send a message from outlook.de where my account is created.</p>
<p>I was blocked for suspicious activity.</p>
<p>I used the option to receive an SMS to unblock my account but at the next attempt to send a mail resulted in a blocked account again.</p>
<p>I repeated the procedure but this time I receive the bellow message while&nbsp; was trying to send the SMS verification code:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(232, 17, 35, 1)">There's
 a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I jump to the conclusion that as I am in Romania I will not be able to do something because I am
<em>suspicious</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow next week I will be back in Austria but I expected more opening toward the people that are based in more then one country.</p>

    <title>Good cross-platform GPS tracker for Windows 10 phones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blinchik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Good cross-platform GPS tracker for Windows 10 phones</h2>
                    <p>As you know, in April of 2016 Life360 start-up decided to drop support for Windows 10 or any Windows operating system for that matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Life360 app was a good cross-platform (iOS, Android &amp; Microsoft) GPS tracker software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of May 2017, i tried at least two alternative software apps, but none were as good as Life360.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any developers out there? There are users who are willing to pay for the good app</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same story for Overdrive app - not working anymore with Windows 10. Overdrive at least saying for now that they're working on bringing their app back for Windows 10 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like Microsoft does not care if app providers are no longer want to develop and maintain support for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a business point perspective it does not make any sense. Why Microsoft still says it has plans to develop mobile platform for Windows users when it does not care for the lack of app support??</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, Microsoft mobile team is big enough to code cross-plaform GPS tracker and get it better than Life360..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Redmond's product and marketing VPs are clueless and here we have a result of them selling phones w/out thinking application strategy.</p>

            Not helping at all, 85% of your answers are to use the Feedback hub where you guys from Microsoft are getting what you want, but the developers are not getting anything back.

</p><p>I'm glad to assist. If the new Outlook account is already active, you can use it to sign in to Skype already and directly. If you already used this Microsoft account to sign in to Skype, you cannot use this same account and link
 this to an existing Skype account. For additional information regarding updating Skype and Microsoft accounts, you can refer to these links.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Zoe,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are not receiving the password reset email, it's possible that the email is going to your email's spam filter. To find your password reset email, please try the following:<br />
<br />
1. Check the spam or junk mail folder on your email account.<br />
<br />
2. Change the Yammer password again to see if a new email arrives. If the message does not arrive, please get in touch with their support to check if they have received a bounce message notification.<br />
<br />
3. Double check if you have provided the correct email address.<br />
<br />
4. Check your email rules. Email rules can help keep your Inbox tidy by deleting, moving, categorizing, or flagging messages based on the sender, subject, or other criteria. There might be a rule in place that's preventing you from seeing certain email in your
 Inbox.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please access this <strong><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and let us know if this is the site you used in resetting your password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out for you.<br />

<p>

</p><p>Thank you.<br />

<div>It is now a trial of Outlook 2010.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Not if you do the install correctly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Home and Student has a trial of Office Professional built into the installation media.&nbsp; It is by default installed and that will overwrite your older Outlook program.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>SO, to keep that from happening you need to read every screen that comes up during the H &amp; S install.&nbsp; On the screen that says "Choose the installation you want" and Upgrade and Customize buttons, below that area is a checkbox (already
 filled in of course) to install the trial of Professional (Microsoft's better idea I guess.)&nbsp; YOU MUST uncheck the box otherwise Outlook will be overwritten no matter what you said on the Customize screen if Customize is selected or if you click Upgrade.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To fix your system, start Word 2010 (must be activated) and click File, Help.&nbsp; On the screen that opens you will see Licensing Operations.&nbsp; Click the box.&nbsp; Click Remove Trial.&nbsp; Allow it to remove the trial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once totally uninstalled, reboot the computer.&nbsp; Install your previous version of Outlook (using a custom install) to install Outlook ONLY!&nbsp; If everything works do a Office update to bring Outlook up to latest service pack.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If Outlook still fails to run OK then you need to uninstall all references to all Office and Outlook in Add/Remove Programs or Programs and Features in Control Panel (depending on operating system.) Reboot the computer.&nbsp; Install only Outlook again and
 update to latest service pack.&nbsp; Install H &amp; S using the information above to prevent the trial from installing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let us know the outcome as this is becoming a great problem and I need to know to correct parts of the instructions if Outlook won't work upon reinstall without uninstalling H &amp; S 2010.</div>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 behave differently depending on Operating System&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Our company does testing in various browser versions and on various operating systems.&nbsp; Up until this past week, we have always found that a browser behaves the same regardless of which version of Windows it was running on.&nbsp; However, now we are seeing some
 behavior discrepancies between Internet Explorer 11 running on Windows 7 and running on Windows 8.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone noticed the same version of Internet Explorer operating differently depending on the Operating System?&nbsp; Should that be expected?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm working on an application for my team using MS-Access 2010. The Data will be on a SharePoint&nbsp; list which is linked to MS -Access table. All users have read and write permission on the SharePoint table. ( SharePoint 2010)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I need : </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. VBA that will sync the SharePoint list to MS- Access table and not the other way ( Access to SharePoint)======== Access &lt;-- SharePoint Only and not Access ---&gt; SharePoint</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp; tried searching the internet, most of the forums say just to make IE offline to disconnect the table from SharePoint but not what I need</p>

<h3> tessturbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of Office&#59; account suspended, college folded, no administrator&#33;</h2>
                    Last year, I bought an academic license for Office using my school ID. My college went under -- lock, stock, and barrel -- along with my old email address. I recently repaired Office, and it now demands either the sign-in with my old email (that I'm locked
 out of, and there is no more administrator who can reinstate it) or a product key (that was most likely emailed to my old, dead account). I still have the receipt from my original Office license purchase, plus an academic email at my new school. Is there any
 way to get my Office license back, or have the product code sent to my new address? Thank you.

<p>I dont' think that link will help.&nbsp; It is for MS email accounts. There is nothing they can do about your defunct school account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I think a better approach is contacting MS Support. But I basically I think they are going to tell you you are out of luck.&nbsp; 365 University requires a working school email account, which you no longer have.&nbsp; Have you enrolled in a different
 school.&nbsp; In that case there is a tiny chance you may be able to convince them to assign an alias pointing to the new account.&nbsp; If you are lucky, they may allow you to use a non EDU account for the alias.</p>

<li><span>You changed email service providers.</span></li><li><span>You changed your name or how you want to be addressed.</span></li><li><span>You want to use an email address that you'll remember more easily.</span></li><li><span>You prefer to use your phone number to sign in (available for use on Xbox One, Xbox.com, or account.microsoft.com).</span></li></ul>

</span></p>
<p><span>When your old email address doesn’t suit you anymore, but you want to save your contacts, online storage, subscriptions, and settings, then add an alias to your existing Microsoft account. An alias is another email address that works with
 the same account. </span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>You can change the way you sign in and show up by adding aliases to your Microsoft account. An alias is an additional account name that can be an email address, phone number, or Skype&nbsp;name.&nbsp;It uses the same inbox, contact list, and account settings
 as the primary alias. You can sign in to your account with any alias—they all use the same password.
</span></p>
<p><span>Some reasons to use aliases on your account include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You’re ready for a new email address, but don’t want to lose all your settings and data. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>You&nbsp;want the flexibility of having&nbsp;several aliases that share the same subscriptions and&nbsp;inbox.
</span></li></ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You cannot add an alias that is already associated with another Microsoft account. Aliases cannot be used to share information between two existing Microsoft accounts.

<p>An alias is an additional email address for your Microsoft account. It uses the same inbox, contact list, and account settings as the primary alias. You can sign in to your account with any alias—they all use the same password. You can send email
 from an alias whether you’re using a mail app like Outlook or a device such as a phone.</p>
<p>An alias is also the best way to change your email, but keep all your mail. Add an alias, then make the new alias primary. Then you can keep or remove the original alias. If you have a @hotmail.com, @live.com, or @MSN.com email address and would
 like to add a new email address, the best way is to add an alias.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt; When activating Office 2013 home and business I had a typo in my email address domain name.&nbsp; Now I am stuck because the verification email isn’t going to an actual email box, so I can’t verify.&nbsp; If I try to start over the product
 key is rejected as it is already in use!</span></p>
<p><span>HELP!!</span></p>
<p><span>Update, after waiting 90min on hold MS the fix is to install the product (I happened to have the download) and then click “I want to activate with product key”, then put a bogus code in so it will switch to give you a ‘I want to activate
 by telephone”.&nbsp; Call the number on the screen and explain everything, then they will activate your OFFICE 2013!&nbsp; The last step is to start a new live account and switch accounts.&nbsp; What a pain MS! &lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>Answer</span></p>
<p><em><span>“Now why would anyone ever want to do something like that”</span></em><span>&nbsp; &lt;heavy sarcasm&gt;<br />
<br />
Sorry, but apparently MS did not think that anyone would ever want to do that when it designed the Office 365 activation system.&nbsp; There is no easy fix for your question</span></p>
<p>Move Office 365 University to a New Email Account - barely possible </p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Well after nearly 2 hours of hold time, someone finally picked up. &nbsp;I&nbsp;explained&nbsp;my situation and he said he’s been getting a flood of phone calls in the past week regarding the issue. &nbsp;He explained that many people have registered for
 Office 365 with incorrect or&nbsp;misspelled&nbsp;email addresses/accounts and they currently have no power to change this. &nbsp;He only offered to escalate the issue to the next level and take down my contact information.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>For anyone with the same issue, you should keep calling and make some noise over this because it’s insane that MS locks in your account, giving you no ability to change it. &nbsp;If I get no reply back on this in a few days, I will try and
 cancel my Office 365 University subscription.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, I am </span><span>now running into a roadblock because they require me to re-verify my university status. &nbsp;When I go enter my .edu address, they tell me it has already been used for verification of the 365&nbsp;subscription&nbsp;that
 customer support just cancelled. &nbsp;I’ve emailed them back about it and hopefully they can correct this.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you contact MS Support, immediately ask for a trouble ticket number. Getting a fix for your problem is guaranteed to be a long drawn out painful process.&nbsp; With lots of "accidental" hangups and unreturned phone calls.&nbsp; Your problem with MS Support is
 that your problem is not "standard". You will have to be put in contact with an exceptional support person. But they are as rare as hens teeth.

    <title>Laptop power issue&#39;s after installing build 9962 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nissmo33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop power issue&#39;s after installing build 9962</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP DV6000 notebook that rolled out with Vista. I bought it dirt cheap and decided to throw Windows 10 at it.</p>
<p>So I download latest Build (9962) installed and looks great on the Notebook. All except the pc runs fine while power adapter is plugged in</p>
<p>but as soon as I unplug it the pc shuts down. Not abruptly though! More like you give it the command to Shutdown.</p>
<p>First thought was that the Battery was bad but it was working fine in Vista. Next test I preform is power the pc on With power adapter unplugged.</p>
<p>Well, well, wouldn't you know it runs fine and shows the battery is 100%. So it leads me to believe that it must be in the OS.</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced this? Or have any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Laptop batteries can fail or over time can lose their ability to hold a charge. If the laptop suddenly stops cooperating, you can usually determine if a bad battery is causing the problem by removing the battery and running
 the laptop from the AC adapter only. If the laptop runs properly when connected to the adapter, the battery is most likely at fault.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>On the HP website, there are no available drivers for Windows 10 Technical Preview. You may download the latest available drivers and install it in compatibility mode to check if this helps.</span></span></p>
