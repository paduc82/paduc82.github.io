<h2>            how to fix ethernet issue on HP Pavillion dv6000 Laptop</h2>
                    I have a HP Pavilion dv6000 Laptop with an Nvidia nforce network controller Ethernet adapter. Whenever i plug in my Ethernet cable it says unidentified network and i have no network access. I tried uninstalling and restoring to an older version but neither
 worked.

            What version of Windows (7 Home Premium, 7 Pro, etc.) and service pack (none, 1) is installed?<br />
<br />
What is the name and version of your antivirus program?&nbsp; Has it always been kept up to date?<br />
<br />
What other security software is installed?<br />
<br />
What are you trying to connect to -- your own router; a corporate network; a school network; something else?<br />
<br />
Have you ever been able to connect?&nbsp; If so, what happened to your system just before the problem started?<br />
<br />
The two most common solutions for this problem appear to be:<br />
<ul>
<li>Disable the McAfee Network Agent service and Firewall Core service (or disable any other 3rd-party firewall and "security" services).&nbsp; To completely remove McAfee --&gt;

            I am using Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1.
<div><br />
<div>My antivirus program is Norton and it runs an automatic live update and is my only security software.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This problem has happened with two different routers in my household while other desktops and laptops connect just fine through ethernet.</div>
<div><br />
<div>i was able to use ethernet just fine when i upgraded to Windows 7 but im not exactly sure when it stopped working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried Uninstalling the device driver but when i restart it tries to install then tells me there was an error in the installation or it wasn't installed correctly&nbsp;</div>

            This may be related to something that Apple's "Bonjour" network discovery services does -- even if you haven't installed any Apple product.&nbsp; See this --&gt;<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/network-sharing/21418-solution-unknown-network-no-connection-inter.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Where did you get the Windows 7 drivers for your laptop?&nbsp; Apparently, hp doesn't really support upgrading the dv6000 from Vista to Win 7.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
See <a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Operating-Systems-e-g-Windows-8-and-Software/Windows-7-Upgrade-Guide-for-dv6000-dv9000-models/td-p/179816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
<br />
Usually, it's best for laptops to use drivers from the laptop manufacturer rather than from the manufacturer of the individual hardware bits.&nbsp; According to the above "guide," if you have an AMD processor in your laptop, the Ethernet adapter's driver is included
 in the chipset driver.&nbsp; If it is still showing in Device Manager as having a problem because the driver isn't installed, you may either reinstall the chipset driver or go here (with a different computer) --&gt;<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi, i performed the final instruction only...</p>
<p><strong><em>Open Device Manager (type Device Manager in the search box and press Enter); right-click on your network adapter and select "Uninstall"; reboot and let Windows discover and reinstall your adapter.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't seem to work. On reboot&nbsp; I received message - "Device driver installation failed - contact your manufacturer"<br />
However when I checked by plugging in an ethernet cable it had actually worked ???? Strange!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thank you. &nbsp;I thought the Ethernet card is fried and I was about to spend $30 + to get a PCMCIA adapter to replace it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your solution is brilliant.</p>

            <p>Hi Bavarian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with mail app. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you able to open the attachment in other email browsers?</p>
<p>2. What kind of attachments are you trying to open? </p>
<p>3. What is their extension the characters (usually three) at the end of the file name, after the dot?</p>
<p>4. Is the issue is confined to perticular email attachment?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps given below to save the attachment in Mail App and try to open it if you are still not able to open it please write to us.</p>
<p><br />
When an attachment arrives in an e-mail through the Windows 8 Mail app, you'll recognize it: It's a large rectangle at the top of your e-mail. The rectangle lists the file's name with the word Download listed directly beneath it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Click the word <strong>Download </strong>next to the attached file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tells the Mail app to actually download the file. Until you click the rectangle, the Mail app tells you only the attached file's name and file size. When the download completes, the rectangle turns into an icon representing the newly downloaded file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
b) When the file downloads to the Mail app, click the attached file's icon and choose
<strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
That tells the Mail app to copy the file from your e-mail and save it to a folder in your computer.</p>
<p><br />
c) Choose a <strong>folder </strong>to receive the saved file.</p>
<p><br />
The Windows 8 File Picker appears, letting you navigate to a folder.</p>
<p><br />
d) Click the word <strong>Files </strong>in the <strong>File Picker's </strong>top-left corner and then choose which library to receive the incoming file:
</p>
<p>Documents, Pictures, Music, or Videos.<br />
Saving the file inside one of your four libraries is the easiest way to ensure you'll find it later.</p>
<p><br />
e) Click the <strong>Save </strong>button in the File Picker's bottom-right corner.</p>
<p><br />
The Mail app saves the file in the library of your choosing.</p>
<p><br />
After you've saved the file, the Mail app returns to the screen. And, if you notice, the attachment still remains inside the e-mail. That's because saving attachments always saves a copy of the sent file. That's handy because, if you accidentally delete your
 saved file, you can return to the original e-mail and save the file yet again.</p>
<p><br />
I hope this resolves your issue, please write to us if he issue still persists or if you have any Windows related issue</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Ruth!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your relpy!&nbsp; However, BavarianSB has been out of the country for some time and I ( his wife) am the one who is having difficulty opening the win.dat files.&nbsp; He sends them from his work computer as PDF files and I can usually open it
 w/ Adobe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, no matter what browser I use I am unable to open ANY document which comes from his work email address. They also come to the email in a win.dat form to those other browsers..Chrome, FireFox, etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it appears as an attachment in the mail, it IS in the large square box you refer to, however when I right click on the box it brings me a menu of "SAVE or OPEN WITH.&nbsp; No option to Download.&nbsp; I/ we have tried EVERY option&nbsp;w/ in the OPEN WITH menu.</p>
<p>As I try to SAVE it I am able to do so, but when I go to OPEN and read the file, it again takes me back to a menu from which to choose a tool to open the document..Adobe Reader, Word, Internet Explorer, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be sending me in circles.&nbsp; I am not exactly a computer "whiz" in fact, I know only the basics.</p>
<p>I appreciate your assistance and if you have ANY other suggestions, I am extremely interested in hearing them.</p>
<p>Again,&nbsp;great thanks &nbsp;for your assistance!</p>
<p>Mrs. BavarianSB</p>

            <p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am confused by which account I am to sign out of and back into? I have my Yahoo email set up and apparently an Outlook account. Both appear to be added. I uninstalled the Nook app and reinstalled it. I get the same error about not having an email address
 and name added into my account. </p>
<p>Getting frustrated with the Surface as it doesn't seem to be real user friendly.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. </p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>It sounds like this isn't&nbsp;a Surface or Microsoft concern, but instead&nbsp;a Nook issue.&nbsp; I'll try to help though, because I use the Nook app and I sure like it.&nbsp; Hopefully you can make good use of it as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I' referring to signing out of your Nook account.&nbsp; You can do that opening the Nook app, opening the Settings (by swiping in from the right edge of the screen), and then clicking the Account option you see at the top of the Settings:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ce7d639-ccff-47d2-aa53-cdcf62f9dee3" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In the Setting section, you can setup a brand new Nook account, login to an existing one, or
<em>merge</em> it with your Microsoft account for handy access and simple usage.&nbsp; After you have signed in to (or created or merged) your Nook account, it should work great for you.&nbsp; Let me know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Camera issues&#58; do I have one&#63; If so... how could I get it to work&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo laptop and have just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. When I click the camera app, a box opens with a grey camera that has a grey slash line across it. &nbsp;A tiny green light comes on, on the computer itself, above the screen frame.
 But then, when I click the camera command, nothing seems to happen. Do I have a camera in my computer? If so, how do I get it to work? Do I need to download a driver? If so, which one. Obviously, I never used the camera when I had Windows 7. I know this is
 really basic stuff... but I'd appreciate some help. Thank you.

            Thank you. When I checked the Device Manager I did not see a Camera app, so I guess I don't have one! Could you let me know which camera app I should download, that would work best with Windows 10--preferably one that is free? After I've downloaded it,
 do I have to download a "driver" separately? Again, thank you for your help.

<h2>            Windows 10 fails to install with no error message</h2>
                    <p>I completed a windows 10 upgrade from 8.1 on my laptop without any issues. However after a few weeks my laptop had problems with freezing, which seemed to be caused by comodo update. In the end I had to do a factory reset to windows 8.0. I then did an update
 to 8.1 after which I used download tool to upgrade to windows 10. Everything goes well until the install says "cleaning up install files" or something similar. The window then just closes and nothing. No error message, no windows 10 as if never downloaded.</p>

            Maybe try restarting the console because if i have a problem like that i just restart and it normally works.

<h2>            Minesweeper &#34;currently not available&#34;</h2>
                    After years of using Microsoft Minesweeper on my Windows 10 PC, it suddenly yesterday (07/06/17) started failing with the message "Microsoft Minesweeper is currently not available to you." in a popup titled "Check your account".&nbsp; Checked my account --
 no clues there.&nbsp; Tried reinstalling -- no change.&nbsp; No system updates since mid-June, and I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything to cause this strange behavior.&nbsp; Any ideas?

<p>I have the problem since 2 days. I did Perfect in Minesweeper and Mahjong&nbsp;for 3 years in a raw and now I get this error message and cannot connect to the game. Same is true for Mahjong and Jigsaw, but Sudoku and Taptiles work ... for the moment. Now I just
 see a dialog box.</p>
<p>Using the same account on different computers generates the same issue.</p>
<p>Using a different account on the same computer works fine.</p>

<p>Hi. I have just resolved my problem and Minesweeper now loads again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First my game 'disappeared' when I tried to open it, I read somewhere to uninstall it, then reinstall it, but all I got was a 'check your account' message. My solution - modified from another user somewhere called Tracy H:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy and paste this link:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sign in</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click 'Run the troubleshooter'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select 'Advanced'</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, it turned on some permissions, and voila!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Some people in Tracy's post couldn't find 'Advanced', but it shows after clicking on the run option.</p>

            None of the suggestions either here or elsewhere helped.&nbsp; Eventually I uninstalled and reinstalled.&nbsp; That did correct the problem, but I lost current status of the game.&nbsp; Nasty.<br />

<p>Depuis la derni√®re mise √† jour du syst√®me de ma 360, j'ai un probl√®me r√©curent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Chaque fois que j'allume ma console et que mon profil est d√©connect√© (ce qui arrive tr√®s r√©guli√®rement), quand je me connecte, √ßa me dit presque imm√©diatement, vous avez 1, 2, 3... amis en ligne comme si tout allait bien, sauf que je ne sort jamais de la
 spiral qui tourne et qui tourne... &nbsp;sans jamais arriv√© dans l'interface principale.</p>
<p>Il me faut donc √©teindre et r'allumer ma console et la comme par magie, √ßa fonctionne. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Avant la plus r√©cente mise √† jour √ßa ne m'√©tait jamais arriv√©.</p>

<p>Est-ce que d'autres personnes ont ce probl√®me?</p>

<p>Je pr√©sume que je devrais contacter le service √† la client√®le...</p>

<p>Un autre qui viens se plaindre apres avoir hacker. Si tu click sur ton profil, tu vas voir que microsoft a fait un reset sur ton gamer score pour cause de tricherie. Donc a ta place je me poserais plutot la question a savoir pourquoi tu n es pas banni au
 lieu de perdre ton fameux 42 000 gp? P-e que je juge vite, mais les gens avec tous les jeux a 100% sans triche sont plutot rare (Quoique pas avoir de vie, je chercherai p-e a avoir tous mes jeux a 100%, mais j ai fait un choix et j y tiens)</p>

Bug check description: This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.<br />
This appears to be a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware problem.
<br />
A third party driver was identified as the probable root cause of this system error. It is suggested you look for an update for the following driver: amdsata.sys (AHCI 1.2 Device Driver, Advanced Micro Devices).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>ZigZag 3143,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the other site for info on replacing the amd sata.sys AHCI 1.2 driver. The instructions were to completely uninstall the driver before loading the new driver. To complete the uninstall, it is necessary to reboot the computer. After reboot, I am
 no longer able to access the hard drive and get a BSOD message that the boot device is not accessible. Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I attempted to perform a system restore, a reinstall of Win 10/keep existing personal files and a startup repair using an Iso Win 10 on a flash drive, but all attempts to get the computer to boot have failed.&nbsp;</p>

            Have you tried booting from the win 10 dvd and doing a repair install? You may need to give it the new driver when repairing.

            I tried booting from a flash drive because to boot from the Win 10 DVD, I would have to purchase it instead of the upgrade from 7-10. I may need to have someone look at the unit.

<h2>            Want to change Microsoft login account but keep settings, files, programmes etc.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have seen questions like this already in these boards, but I'm too much of a techno-fool to understand the answers already given. Sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, when I set up my current laptop I used a Microsoft account that I now no longer want to use for various reasons.&nbsp; I now want to use the Microsoft account I should have utilized when I set this PC up (I but didn't understand what was going on at the time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I need to be in Setting&gt; Accounts. But what on earth do I do in there?</p>
<p>Any and all help gratefully recieved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for answering. But the reply you have linked to is one of the replies that I have already looked at and didn't help.
</p>
<p>It tells me where to go (Settings&gt;Accounts) but it doesn't tell me what to do when I get there........</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There you can disconnect from the old email account and connect to your new Microsoft Account...."</p>
<p>Great, but how do I do that? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried "Adding an account" (the one I need) but it had none of my files, none of my settings, none of my programmes. Do I sign in with a local account? What's one of those, how does it differ from a Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm seriously lost here, and in desperate need of a manual! Why doesn't Windows come with help? A manual has to be more efficient than you having to answer the same questions repeatedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thank you for any help you can give. </p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Repair Loop. 2 yr old laptop BRICKED. Need help.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I am going to start off by saying I am a fairly technical person, but I am perplexed and upset by the Windows 10 Repair loop that I am in.</p>
<p>It all started when I ran Windows update in Nov. 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Windows 7 Pro and got the free Windows 10 upgrade like many of you. My laptop came with Windows7Pro preinstalled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My warranty with Dell just came up a month ago and they want to charge me $289 for support for a year. I don't think so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop only has USB out/inputs. No cd drive. I tried downloading the Windows 10 iso on the thumb drive and I get as far as it asking me to reinstall it, but it won't install without a key despite what the MS support website says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't get to a Windows login screen. I am just in a repair menu loop. I know my files are there, but it seems the boot is gone and Windows along with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried almost every suggestion out there apart from buying a $120 Window license, which seems silly as for&nbsp; $100 more I can get a new laptop or desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Windows 10 Digital License
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />See how to perform a custom install:

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br /> 
<br />From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn‚Äôt fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br /> 
<br />If Safe Mode doesn‚Äôt work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />An alternative is to run Factory Recovery from it‚Äôs  hotkey at boot; find yours by googling the ‚ÄúPC make/model + Run Factory Recovery.‚Äù    But keep in mind the Factory install is greatly inferior to a Clean Install, a Reset or a Refresh without the crippling factory bloatware.    After Recovery mitigate the inferior factory install with the Checklist steps from earlier.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and keep us posted on how it goes.

            Hi tmcfar,
<br />
<br />Start your laptop, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you tell us what are the steps that you do when you use the repair function while using a Windows 10 installation media? Do you receive any error messages? When you tried to reinstall Windows 10, have you clicked the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do
 this later'?<br />
<br />
Let us know so we can assist you further.

<p>Good Day Eric!</p>
<p>The Laptop is a Dell and it only has USB input. It did not come with a CD. Windows7 Pro was pre installed. I called Microsoft and Dell.</p>
<p>Dell finally caved and admitted the way they handled my situation was wrong and they are working with me to remedy it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft support admitted to the issue and gave me some tips, but said I would need the code from Dell as Dell purchased OEM licenses from Microsoft and thus why they barcoded the Windows sticker and making it so it became proprietarily (is that a word?)
 Dell's license to do and display as they saw fit, so MS couldn't help me without the code as I was thinking about rolling back from 10 to 7Pro, which is what the laptop came with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yes, previously I did do the bit with the install without the code and that should have worked. I also encountered the can't install on this drive issue that MS offers in relation to the Windows Update bricking issue&nbsp; and the support guy said to delete
 the partition drives until there is only the main drive and it should work. I will probably lose everything, but I should be able to save my computer and it is not my HD that is dead just the Windows boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I am off to try to boot with an iso for Windows 7 Pro from Dell and if that does not work I have a digital iso and new key that I purchased.&nbsp; Wish me luck.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            windows 10 upgrade, won&#39;t reboot, why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was upgrading a windows 7 PC to the free Windows 10, after being notified to upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then followed all the steps, done copying all the new files, installed devices and drivers, down to the final step of configurations and settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then the windows logo appears, and the spinning dot wheels turns. And the PC just hangs at that step forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This PC of mine is a Core2Quad with crossfired video cards and 16GB of ram. Plenty of hard drive space. &nbsp;I wouldn't think it would be a hardware issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why does the system hang like that at this step&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other PC, is an AMD platform. That PC upgrades itself fine with no problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
Depending on how you got your copy of <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, activation will use either a digital entitlement or a 25-character product key. Digital entitlement is a new method of activation in
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> that doesn't require you to enter a product key.
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are some of the most common activation errors in <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, and a few things you can try to fix the problems that are causing them.</p>
<p>

            <p>My problem is not about activation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that the system will not reboot during the installation process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the 3 steps are "copy New files", "install device drivers", "finalize setting and configurations". During each of these steps, the machine needs to be updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the installation process on my Core 2 Quad machine will complete up to the "install device drivers" stage. and then dead with the reboot right after that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the process is like 70%+ complete, one more reboot, and then last step, I will be done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some said, it is because I have some hardware in the system that is causing the system not to reboot. A device driver problem some say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I truly do not understand whats causing the system to hang dead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the most obvious I can think of might be, a cross fired twin video cards of ATI 5770?</p>

 Thinking its an actual issue with the Xbox console itself.&nbsp;</span>

                    I'm using the most recent version (7.56 (776)) of Skype for Mac. &nbsp;Many of my contacts have disappeared. &nbsp;They are still accessible to me from my Skype for iOS app on my iPhone. &nbsp;What gives?

</p><p><span>Welcome to Skype Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most possible that you are accessing a different Skype account from your Mac, but
<strong>how do you sign in to your Skype app from your iPhone? (is it a Skype username or email address?).
</strong>Can you try to sign out from your Skype Mac and <strong>sign in manually
</strong>again to your Skype account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope this information helps.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for replying Juan. &nbsp;I did what you suggested, i.e. I logged out of my Skype for Mac and logged back in using the same account I use on Mac iOS and still don't see some of the accounts I can see on my iPhone. &nbsp;I also logged in from web.skype using
 the same account and I could see all my contacts from there. &nbsp;It's only on the desktop app on my Mac that I'm missing half of the accounts I can see from the other two "devices".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if it would help to continue this conversation over Skype so I can show you the problem.<br />

    <title>How do I re-enable the built-in display adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rpstrom  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I re-enable the built-in display adapter</h2>
                    <p>I installed a PCIe video adapter in my Gateway and I'm trying to remove it a go back to the built-in adapter. If I remove the new adapter, nothing displays on the screen except the 'no signal found' message. I'm afraid to disable the current adapter in the
 device driver, for fear of not being able to get the display to work again with the old or new adapter. I would appreciate it if&nbsp;some one could tell me if I'm thinking correctly&nbsp;in disabling the PCIe adapter which should make the original Radeon adapter live
 again.</p>

    <title>Extremely slow opening up internet pages. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> backagaincanuck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extremely slow opening up internet pages.</h2>
                    My 2-year old Dell PC&nbsp;contains Microsoft Windows XP Home Service Pack 2, with an Intel Pentium 4 3GHZ Processor, and 504 MB of RAM; and I have Norton Internet Security 2010 installed.&nbsp;<br />
Over the&nbsp;month it has become slower and slower opening up web pages, and in particular the first one I open after logging on. This page now takes about 2 minutes to open up, and then another 30 seconds at least before the links download and I have control of
 my cursor.<br />
I delete my files and cookies daily, and I clean disk and defragment every week, but nothing I try will speed up the performance.<br />
A couple of days ago I ran 2 scans from Registry Cleaner programmes, and both indicated that I had literally thousands of faults including Registry Entries; Residual Junk Files; Privacy Items; Bad Active X;&nbsp;and Performance Features Not Optimised.<br />
I considered purchasing one of the Registry Cleaners, but did a bit&nbsp;of research, and found that they could cause even more problems than I presently have.<br />
I'm a bit of a neophyte at the computer game, and I hope that some kind person could explain to me in layman's language what is wrong, and how I could (easily) fix it.<br />
Many thanks to all of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Malkeleah:<br />
My sincerest apologies for not replying to you sooner - my wife and I went away for 10 days&nbsp; just after your reply, and when we got home I ended up with a&nbsp;virus, but I don't think I caught it from the computer!<br />
Both myself and this contraption of circuits, wires, and chips (or whatever) are now back to normal, and as promised, I'll give you a walk through of what happened. (probably won't be in the correct sequence, but you'll get the gist of it, I'm sure). My work
 colleague's son was the computer expert who got it all up and running.<br />
Basically what he did was: remove all the unnecessary programs which were running in the background; uninstall Norton SS 2010, and replace it with&nbsp;McAfee Security Suite (&nbsp;tied in&nbsp;with BT Net Protect Plus);&nbsp;remove my 504MB of RAM and&nbsp;replace it with 1.24GB of
 RAM; backup everything I had in my computer to a flash drive; remove a lot of unneeded Windows Programs; close the whole darn thing down; and restart using the 2 Dell CDs. There were other things I'm sure he did, but I just can't remember them.<br />
So, in a nutshell, my friend, this little baby is now running like a Cray Computer (starting &amp; closing, and opening up web pages, all now faster than a speeding bullet - well, for me anyway).<br />
Malkeleah, as I said, the sequence I gave you is probably all out of kilter, and I realise that you aren't a fan of McAfee, but my young friend&nbsp;knew a lot more than me and that Philadelphia Lawyer I was talking about, and everything has been&nbsp;going just perfectly
 since its tune-up.<br />
Many thanks&nbsp;for all your help; my apologies&nbsp;again for not getting in touch sooner; and if I ever need your help again, I know&nbsp;how to get in touch.&nbsp;<br />
Slainte!&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10 Photo app you can surely manage and view your photos but you want advanced features I suggest you to use other similar apps like Microsoft PowerPoint to present your stories giving it a refining look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also find other similar free apps in the windows store. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Get back to us for further queries on the issue above. We are happy to help!</p>

<h2>            Xbx Charge and play kit LED light not working</h2>
                    Just bought a new Xbox One controller and and a charge and play kit so i dont have to buy batteries all the time. The battery pack works, but when i plug the charging cable up the LED light doesnt work. I dont think the controller gets charged either which
 is what i care about. I just bought both very recently and wanted to know what to do, thoughts?
