<h2>            time zone problem I don&#39;t have eastern standard time in my choices</h2>
                    I don't have eastern standard time in my choices, I have pacific time zone setting only? When I move clock 3 hours ahead it resets to pacific standard time the next day.

            Hi, Hockeydad20.<br />
<br />
&gt; I did everything right<br />
<br />
Are you sure? Please tell us, step by step, exactly what you did - starting <br />
with clicking on the clock in the lower right corner of your desktop. If <br />
you just say something like "I did that", we are never sure you understood <br />
the instruction. But if you say, "I clicked the clock, and then I clicked <br />
'Change time and date settings'", then we know that you did understand and <br />
follow the first step. I'm sorry to be so pedantic, but experience in <br />
thousands of these online help sessions tells us that often the message is <br />
not understood, after all. "Tried that" tells us nothing. "Didn't work" <br />
also tells us nothing. We are trying to help you, but you must do your <br />
part.<br />
<br />
After "Change time and date settings", do you see the "Date and Time" <br />
window? In addition to "Change date and time...", there should be a button <br />
to "Change time zone..." If you click this, do you see the "Time Zone <br />
Settings" window, with your current setting shown? Click that current <br />
setting to see a drop-down menu listing all the available zones, in order, <br />
probably starting with your current setting. (Mine starts with Central <br />
Time, UTC -0600. To see "Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada)", I have to scroll down <br />
about 4 lines to -0500.) Is that what you are seeing? Can you see <br />
the -0500 line at all? How is it labeled?<br />
<br />
Windows always comes preset to Pacific Time, by default, since that is the <br />
setting for Microsoft's home office in Redmond, Washington. Almost every <br />
user must change this to his or her own particular time zone.<br />
<br />

&gt; I did everything right I do not have that option, no eastern standard <br />
&gt; time. Do I reinstall windows, can I update this somewhere in microsoft web <br />
&gt; base? <br />

<h2>            windows 64 percent loop</h2>
                    <p>a few days ago i decided to try and factory reset my computer.</p>
<p>all was going well but that night an error popped up when i tried to turn on the pc.</p>
<p>i got rid of the error by pulling up command prompt and using cmd then regedit and changing a value from 1 to 3. (Idk what the thing was im not great with computers)</p>
<p>It got rid of that error but now it keeps cycling between a loading circle, then a loding circle that says preparing, then windows update progress at 64%</p>
<p>Ive already searched for a few hours on how to boot using another computer installing windows on a usb and trying to open bios but it seems as though my keyboard doesnt work, but ive tried other keyboards and nothings happening.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing escape repeteadly or f2 does nothing. Ive tried fn and windows, ive tried various combinations with f8 and f10 to try different things but nothing is working. Please help.<br />

<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Info:</strong></em></span> In 2011 My Dad downloaded Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon. He downloaded the game on his account, and I tried to play on it on my account. I
 did, It worked and I only played it once, I even have 2 achievements on it to prove it haha. Recently I had a sudden urge to play it again. So I go to the "My Games" section, select the game to play it, and it says "action could not be launched." So I tried
 every other account on the xbox and only My dad's account could play it now. </span>
</p>
<p><span><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">My attempt to fix it:</span></strong></span></em> Deleting the game, and redownloading it.

<p><span>- I don't know if this helps anything, but recently we (Not sure on which account) downloaded: Minecraft Xbox 360 edition. It works on every single profile. Just wondering why minecraft works, and Spyro doesn't, when it originally
 did. <br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any other ideas of how to help, much obliged. :)</span></p>

            <p>Yes, games are licensed to the first console they are downloaded to. &nbsp;If your old console broke and you moved your hard drive to another console you will need to license transfer your gamertag and then go to your download history to redownload the content.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem! Except, I couldn't play it. It would just say can't be launched. But I transferred the license and it still didn't work.. My boyfriend downloaded "Destiny" on his xbox360, then turned around and transferred the license to mine
 so I could play it. But it still wont let me play at all.. &nbsp;</p>

<p>When a license transfer is done you'll need to redownload the content. &nbsp;Have your boyfriend head to Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Download History on the console and redownload the game. &nbsp;There is no need to delete it first.</p>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />If you activated Windows before with a key (Not OEM), that key should be attached to your Microsoft Account, make sure you follow this and you shouldn't have a problem.

            If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.

            With Windows 10 you get a digital license where your activation information is stored on MS servers. As soon as you do a clean install, Windows would automatically activate when it connects to the Internet, for the first time-provided you install the same version as was installed before. If you are asked for a key, skip it.

            Hi jaidevp,
<br />
<br />Your Windows 10 license should automatically activate upon reinstall, unless the laptops motherboard has changed. 
<br />
<br />You can go into Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation (left-hand side) for more information.
<br />
<br />The following Microsoft article will also show you how to use your Microsoft account to activate Windows: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/20530/window...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

<br />Activation issues after a re-install are generally caused by installing a different Edition (Home, Pro . ..  etc.) of Windows 10, that does not match the previously installed Edition
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to System - About
<br />
<br />What Edition of Windows 10 is reported there, and does it match the previous Edition that came pre-installed?

<li>Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.</li><li>Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.</li><li>Press a key when prompted to boot from the DVD.</li><li>Select "Repair PC" from the menu.</li><li>Select "Repair" when prompted.</li><li>Select System Restore when prompted.</li><li>Set Windows back to a point before you disabled your one and only admin account.</li></ol>

Ask a friend to burn a Repair CD on his machine, then post again for instructions on how to create a bootable flash drive from it. Make sure your friend's machine uses the same architecture as yours (32 or 64 bits). You can tell like so:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click the Start globe.</li><li>Right-click "Computer".</li><li>Left-click "Properties".</li><li>Read "System Type".</li></ol>
<div>If this sounds too hard, ask your friendly PC technician to help you.</div>

<h2>            Windows stuck in automatic repair mode</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Paragon' s HFS+. After installation it prompted to restart my computer so I did. When it got to the Windows logo a blue screen with a sad face. It said my" pc ran into a problem and needs to be restarted. We'll restart it for you." It also
 gave a stop code that said "INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE". </p>
<p>
</p><p>So it restarts and goes into automatic repair mode. It than brings up a screen to choose my keyboard layout and my keyboard or mouse will not&nbsp; work. Any ideas what to do next?</p>

                    How do I simply play all my songs randomly in my Windows Media Player v12 that are in the library?
<div>It seems I have to make a playlist named "all" &nbsp;select all of &nbsp;the music then play this list. Thus I need to do this every time I upload more music to the computer. The new music is in the library as it scans the&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;drives but then the playlist "all"
 is old and missing the new songs. There must be an easier way that I am missing that works without needing to create a new playlist every time I add new music to my computer. Anyone know?</div>

            The just limiting to mp3's was only an example, they key part that is up to you is to customize the filter for your library: "so we must pick a criteria that matches all songs".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Another option is to just add a "Sort By" criteria, which doesn't actually filter at all.&nbsp; Then you just play with Shuffle turned on if you want to ignore the sorting criteria.<br />
<br />
You could add a file type filter, and even though the mp3/wma/wav selector is a drop down, if you click on it and then start typing, you can type in "blah" and change the first drop down to "Is Not".&nbsp; This says include all files which are NOT of file type "blah".&nbsp;
 This means that all file types will be matched since there isn't a real file type of "blah".&nbsp; I have tested this and it works fine.<br />
<br />
Similar approach could be taken with any of the other filters like Title/Album etc. by selecting "Filename" "Is Not" "asdflkjsdflskjfsd" and this would include all music files except the one named "asdflkjsdflskjfsd" :)<br />
<br />
Another approach would be to just use a rating filter and say "Is At Least" "Unrated", which will basically include all songs regardless of whether they have a rating or not.&nbsp; I'm not sure if some of the more obscure music filetypes will have ratings though
 as I'm not sure where that information is stored, some filetypes might not support it.<br />
<br />
"More..." "File Size" "Is At Least" "0"<br />
<br />
I could go on.<br />

<p>Check if the issue persists in safe mode (Step 1). If the issue does not persist in safe mode/Safe mode with networking then, perform clean boot (Step 2) on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p>1. Restart the computer<br />
2. Start tapping F8 key<br />
3. You will get advanced boot option window<br />
4. Select the option “Safe mode” or Safe mode with networking</p>

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."</p>
<p>Follow the steps provide in the below article to perform clean boot. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>To return your computer to a Normal startup mode, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>1. Click Start in the Start Search box. <br />
2. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>3. On the General tab, click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.
<br />
4. When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>

            Hi!! Thank s for rply.<br />
I tried for step 1&nbsp; and booted with safe mode and safe mode with networking but in both the cases again same problem exists .<br />
<br />
I guess i am having this problem for last 15 days and so .<br />
<br />
one more thing i want to add , first time when i had this problem , on that day when i started my system then on very initial screen a line was written (I/O parity is wrong : -- some hexadecimal address location was there)&nbsp; after this start , restart problem
 comes in ..... <br />
<br />
currently i have 6002 SP 2 build of vista .<br />
should i go for restore option ??&nbsp; but in any case this is a looking like a serious bug in win kernal
<br />
<br />
<br />
please try to find the solution .. update me what else i can try to resolve it <br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Appactivate calculator not working on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Appactivate calculator not working on windows 10</h2>
                    Hi, I'm trying to bring the calculator on the foreground with windows 10 using appactivate("Calculator") but this seems to not be working but I tried with notepad, notepad++ and it is working so I wonder if there is an other name that I should use to put
 in appactivate so I can make focus on it and then send keys to it.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing the information with your Windows 10. We would like to verify if you checked for the latest driver of your Display/Graphics card. Please follow these steps on how to check for driver update:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Select the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;button,
 type</span><span style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp;Device Manager</span><span>,
 and select it from the list of results.</span></li><li><span>Expand </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Display adapters</span><span>, and right click your graphics card and select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Properties</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Choose </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Driver tab
</span><span>and click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Update Driver.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">

<p>
If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for updates in your computer's manufacturer website using the model of your driver.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
We are looking forward to your reply.</p>

            If your manufacturer says your drivers are up to date for your model search for a driver update utility they are better at singling out specific drivers. I have noticed on intel for example if it identifies a chipset of drivers and may not update the drivers.

<p>well what payment option did you use?</p>
<p>a new creditcard or a debitcard?</p>
<p>if you use a prepaid membership card that doesn't solve the issue</p>
<p>you need to add a creditcard or debitcard or paypal account</p>
<p>or you can always call xbox support</p>
<p>and see if they can push your payment thru the new creditcard</p>

<h2>            Problem with update and new Nordic &#40;Danish&#41; version</h2>
                    
<p>X1 just launched in Denmark and a new Nordic localized version of Zoo Tycoon has been released.</p>
<p>The problem is that the current update won't install. Network connection works flawlessly and I have no problems installing other updates. The Xbox support agrees with me that it could be the update is for the international english
 version of the game and therefore not fitting with the Nordic version.</p>
<p>Have anyone else experienced this? Will there be another working update for the game? Otherwise I can't be online while playing the game!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>had the same problem with this game...</p>
<p>I'm from belgium so language is dutch when i start game from dash i tells me that i need to update but update fails... tested with different regions on my xbox same result. But you can launch the game from the shop. You pop in you game in the xbox, then
 you go to the shop look for zoo tycoon dan you will see instead of a buy icon you will see play or start and for me it runs without asking for the update, seems weird but at least i can play the game that way.</p>
<p>grtz</p>

<p>I have this same issue. So what they say is that we need to play it in english so the game wont fail? Hopefully theres coming an update soon what can fix this problem.</p>
<p>Everytime i want to play the game it goes to black screen and says that zoo tycoon must be updated.. and then it gives an error. I will call microsoft NL (dutch) soon to ask about this same problem and maybe they have a better solution.

                    <p>Hi, there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I'm constantly having BSOD (PFN_LIST_CORRUPT and MEMORY_MANAGEMENT) among others. I already did a clean installation of Windows 10, at least 4 times, and I'm still getting errors. I used the command, chkdsk c: /r , sfc /scannow, memory check, it looks like
 I'm not having problem. I went to device manager everything seems to be ok but stillI uninstall all the divides on opaque color. I run the verifier command, reboot and gave me the message: dam.sys when it crashed. My desktop screen goes black and flashes and
 sometimes desapear completely. Someone can help me to solve this problem? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Sitting behind a ds-lite RFC-6333 line with prefix delegated, my XBox One S receive a NATted IPv4 that is not available across the AFTR server at my ISP. So the XBox has also an own IPv6 and report IPv4 &amp; IPv6 and NAT moderate.</p><p><br /></p><p>Found this: Xbox Live requires the following ports to be open:</p>

<pre>Port    88 (UDP)
Port    3074 (UDP and TCP)
Port    53 (UDP and TCP)
Port    80 (TCP)
Port    500 (UDP)
Port    3544 (UDP)
Port    4500 (UDP)
</pre><p>Providing a static IPv6 to the XBox will make it possible to forward these ports through the router firewall. But it seems this list is only for IPv4 connections? Have a UPNP server on my router that provides pinholing for IPv6, but there is no request from the XBox seen.</p><p><br /></p><p>Greetz</p><p>Eric<br /></p>

<p>Hi Razvan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further troubleshoot the issue, we would like to ask the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you only experiencing this on your mechanical keyboard?</li><li>Have you tried using a different keyboard?</li><li>Do you remember making any changes prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For now, we recommend running the Hardware and Device troubleshooter by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Click on the Start button, and type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” on the search bar.</span></li><li><span>Click on troubleshooting, then click on “<strong>Hardware and soun</strong>d”.</span></li><li><span>Under Hardware and sound, click on “<strong>hardware and devices</strong>”.</span></li><li><span>A pop-up will appear, click on the “<strong>Next</strong>” button and your hardware troubleshooting will start.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>We look forward to your update.</span></p>

    <title>Limited configuration options for Power Options in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertchmielinski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Limited configuration options for Power Options in Windows 10</h2>
                    Recently my Surface Book installed a large Windows 10 update. &nbsp;Since that update, the computer has deleted several of my Power Plans (in the "Power Options" window), and the "advanced settings" are now also very limited (to screen brightness, closing lid,
 pressing power button, etc.). &nbsp;Prior to this "upgrade" I was able to throttle the CPU speed, minimum processor state, maximum processor state, etc. &nbsp;Is there any way that I can get back to the ability to modify these advanced settings? &nbsp;I have tried activating
 "hyper-v" but this does not restore the advanced settings selections I had before. &nbsp;The result of this loss is that my battery life is reduced to 8 hours, instead of what I was able to accomplish before - 16 hours. &nbsp;This is a great loss of capacity. &nbsp;Thanks
 for help on this.

            Hello and thanks for your quick response. &nbsp;I followed your instructions, and ran the "search online" update for all three sub-items under the Device Manager Batteries option. &nbsp;All responded that the driver I had was the latest available. &nbsp;I went back to
 Power Options to check, and under "Advanced Settings" I still only get settings for Desktop Background, Sleep, Power Buttons, Display and Battery. &nbsp;My present battery life is horrible - 5 hours, down from 16 hours where I was able to set it before. &nbsp;Please
 see if you can help. &nbsp;Thanks again.

    <title>Windows 7 Live Mail - lost storage folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pemysl marek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Live Mail - lost storage folders</h2>
                    <p>One day after opening Windows Mail (with one POP3 account), all the local storage folders were gone and in their place standard folder structure as when opened for the first time. I had several folders and subfolders created, with several hundred mail stored
 (passwords, bank statements, auction details etc.). I tried closing and expanding the folder structure, tried searching for the e-mails in the Mail program and on the disk, but nothing.
</p>
<p>I then tried to navigate to the folder (<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">C:\Users\"user"\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows
 Live Mail</span>) but inside I only found the standard structure, not my subfolders and mails. Trash is full of even older e-mails (no automatic deleting), no subfolders or e-mails in question there. Inbox for the only account is still with e-mails (some older
 than the missing ones).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guess to what happened and if it can be reversed?</p>

<p>That folder should contain a lot of files and folders - are you saying it doesn't? Here's one. for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38dc04ef-5c38-4614-ae23-d1b3dda921c1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Were your missing folders under an account or under Storage folders?</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Trash is full of even older e-mails (no automatic deleting), no subfolders or e-mails in question there.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trash? Do you mean the Windows recycle bin, or a <em>Deleted items</em> folder either under an account or under Storage folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't find the missing message files (with names like A0B1C2D3-00FF9876.eml) in the store folder, your best bet would be
<em>Previous versions</em>:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>In Explorer, right-click on the store&nbsp;folder and select
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Restore previous versions</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></li><li>
<span>If you can locate a previous version of your store folder that predates the folders' going missing,
