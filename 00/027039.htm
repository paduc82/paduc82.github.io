    <title>Why don&#39;t all emails that I delete from PC&#39;s Outlook 2013 also - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why don&#39;t all emails that I delete from PC&#39;s Outlook 2013 also get deleted from inbox of Windows 8 Nokia Lumia 635 phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>This happens to me all the time. Is my phone broken? <br />
FYI, I only have one outlook.com email address and my phone, Nokia Lumia 635 that has Windows 8, and my Windows 10 computer that uses Outlook 2013&nbsp;are both set up to only access it.
</span></p>
<p><span>I do have some gMail addresses that are set up on live.com to forward into the outlook.com address.<br />
Most everything stays in sync such as Contacts, Appointments, Tasks, Email Folders although I have had some troubles a few times,&nbsp;I seem to recall, over the past few months, with Contacts also not staying synced if I use my phone to add a new one or edit it.
 So I've learned to just always do either on my computer's Outlook 2013.</span></p>
<p><span>I never use outlook.com or live.com on my computer using a browser. I'm an Outlook type guy.</span><span> I've asked another Question on that here on the site and it has gone nowhere. That I would guess is because since it makes no sense, nobody wants
 to get involved.<br />
BTW, my year old computer is a year old Clean Install of Windows 8 that was upgraded to 10. I run Malwarebytes Pro, cCleaner, Microsoft a/v and I barely use or browse with this home computer.<br />
I really just use it on Facebook, check my bank account and use Outlook 2013 which is set up with only my outlook.com address in it using Exchange ActiveSync settings and it got transferred to the new server last November. Does the phone or the Outlook on the
 computer need to be turned OFF &amp; back ON in order to have them refresh the Inbox along with the email Folders or does that happen with each Send/Receive? That could explain this odd behavior since quite often I haven't done either thing.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inbox from Outlook 2013 and in your Lumia 635 phone should automatically sync. This could just be a delay. We suggest that you run a manual sync on your phone from time to time. Make sure as well that your phone's build is up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>

            <p>Thanks. Maybe the times that I've noticed an email in one of the Inboxes are in some rare instances when I deleted one in one and then didn't wait long enough for them to have both done an automatic Send/Receive or I hadn't caused a Send/Receive by sending
 an email on both of them yet. But I'd swear that's not the case and that's why I felt compelled to ask this Question.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by suggesting that I run a manual sync or how that would be done but to me that just sounds like it is some overkill so I guess unless you can tell me why I'd want to do it, I'll pass.</p>
<p>My phone is set somewhere that I've seen a million times lately to update automatically. I've been fighting this silly phone on various issues including doing a Hard Reset and a warranty replacement from T-Mobile.</p>
<p>I was told in another of my many Questions on these Microsoft Answers forums that Microsoft and their Nokia aren't putting out any updates anymore for these Lumia 635s so I guess I got what I got.</p>

            <p>Which variant of Lumia 635 do you have? Is it the 512MB or the 1GB version? To run an update for your phone, you may follow the steps provided below.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>Swipe left.</li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Phone Update</strong>.</li><li>Then select <strong>Check for Updates</strong>.</li><li>Wait until searching for updates is done. Once it's done, it will let you know if your phone is up to date or not.<br />
</li><li>If an update is available, you may proceed with it but be sure to back up your phone before running it.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To check if there's a Windows 10 upgrade available for your phone, you may download the
<strong>Upgrade Advisor</strong> app from <strong>Windows Store</strong> and run it.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, my Lumia 635 is the 512MB version. I've known that's one of its major problems as that is far too little RAM and it should have never been sold to us unsuspecting, trusting customers.</p>
<p>I've purposefully only downloaded a few APPs, which isn't a problem since there are so few that anyone would want compared to the multitudes of them that are available for Androids &amp; iPhones.</p>
<p>I realize that some APPs run stuff in the background automatically unless they're turned off which uses up RAM.</p>
<p>I went ahead and ran the Update you suggested, even though I already knew that I've done it manually plenty of times in the past few months while fighting this beast along with the fact that I already knew it is set to Update Automatically, as most people
 would probably have it set to do by Default. I'd assume it is shipped set that way.</p>

            <p>It doesn't really matter but I get to Settings by going to the home screen and swiping it down and then in the upper right is a link marked ALL SETTINGS.</p>
<p>I tried your "swipe left" from the home screen which I guess was what it should have said, but that gives that long list. I suppose Settings is down there somewhere.;-)</p>

            <p>Sorry about my doing 3 replies. Anyhow, I checked months ago to see if there's a Windows 10 upgrade available for my phone online &amp; also by using the Upgrade Advisor APP. There apparently never will be one from what I read. Microsoft is willing to admit
 that they made a mistake buying Nokia to keep the Windows phone thing going so that they could appear as if they wanted to compete with Androids &amp; iPhones.</p>
<p>My son, who works a a Sprint cellular store, tells me to give up and switch since Windows phones are going to die soon.</p>
<p>I argue with him on that as I know that Bill Gates wants his Microsoft to be a "one stop shop" for everyone for personal &amp; business use.</p>
<p>I even tried a T-Mobile Android for a while since their salesgirl said the Outlook APP would do the same as a Windows phone does with Contacts, Appointments &amp; Emails.</p>
<p>But it had way too many limitations so I returned it.</p>
<p>One major limitation was that the APP couldn't Edit anything in the Note section of Contacts even though it would display it.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the help. I did steps 1-5 but it got odd during 6 since at first, Microsoft Account was grayed out. So then I went back a screen and chose
<strong>Add an account </strong>and the 2nd one down was a choice to A<strong>dd an outlook.com account</strong>, so I picked that. Then it had me type in email address and password twice in a row and then it ended up telling me that account is already set
 up in this phone.</p>
<p>So I clicked OK and went back to the home screen and I do see that the email icon is gone like you'd said it would. Then I clicked on
<strong>People</strong> and all of my Contacts are there. Then I went and minimized the Outlook icon that was now at the bottom of the home screen and dragged it up to where the empty spot is where the old icon was.</p>
<p>It has an 8 on it showing that there are&nbsp;8 unreads, so that's good. I sent myself a test email and it soon arrived back, so that's done. I'll give this a try. I'll also try to pay more attention and make notes about any email deleting like which device I
 did it on and if &amp; when it disappeared from the other device.</p>

            <p>Hi Gaynor,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If using MSE, then Windows Defender should be disabled in Vista/W7 or uninstalled in XP (in fact, a proper installation of MSE would have done this automatically).&nbsp; This is true with several other AV programs as well (Norton, McAfee,...).&nbsp; If it is disabled
 and/or uninstalled, the icon should not be showing up at all.&nbsp; The fact that it appears indicates that&nbsp;Windows Defender is somehow being started (or trying to be started) or that the system believes it should be enabled (which makes me worry about the status
 of your AV protection or may be the result of your attempt to do so when it shouldn't be happening).&nbsp; If you are using MSE, does the MSE icon show and is it green and when you open it does it show it is working properly?&nbsp; If using some other AV program, when
 you open it does it indicate it is running and providing real-time protection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How we proceed depends on several things.&nbsp; What is your operating system (e.g., 32-bit Vista Business SP2 - and yes, that much detail)?&nbsp; What security software do you have installed whether being used or not used or disabled or never used (all names including
 the versions)?&nbsp; This might be MSE or Avast or Norton or McAfee or Trend Micro or PandaSoft or Avira or SuperAntiSpyware or Malwarebytes or any of a hundred others.&nbsp; I need to know ALL of them and their full names and version numbers (unless they aren't installed
 - then just the names for now).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel / Security Center or Action Center and click on the arrow to expand the Malware protection section.&nbsp; Under Spyware and other Malware Protection what does it say?&nbsp; Is one listed?&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it show as being on or off?&nbsp;&nbsp;In either case, click
 on "Show me the antispyware programs on this computer" link and tell me the options listed and whether they show on or off.&nbsp; Go back and also look under Virus Prottection and tell me what it says and if it shows as being on of off.&nbsp; This is not a comprehensive
 listing and does not take the place of the check in the prior paragraph - but should give me some idea about what the system thinks is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Run and type MSCONFIG.EXE and enter.&nbsp; When it appears, check the Startup tab and see if Windows Defender is checked or unchecked.&nbsp; Next, go to the Services Tab and check to see if Windows Defender is checked or
 unchecked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Services.&nbsp; Scroll to Windows Defender and double click on it to show details.&nbsp; What does it say under status (Started or Stopped)?&nbsp; On the drop menu in the center, what does it say (Automatic, Automatic (Delay),
 Disabled, or Manual)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the above information, I believe I will be able to assist you resolve this issue (and perhaps make sure that other issues don't exist because this one does as well - depending on what you tell me).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>But I need your help.</strong>&nbsp; I need ALL of the above information in your reply and you need to be sure.&nbsp; If you leave out some answers or omit some information or provide incorrect information, what I suggest may either not work as expected or
 not fully resolve the problem or may cause me to omit steps you need to do because I don't know they are needed (or suggest steps that are inapplicable) and also provide reference links that aren't appropriate or incomplete.&nbsp; It may even cause more problems
 than it solves.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm confident we can do this TOGETHER - but I depend on you for information I cannot see myself.&nbsp; I could make assumptions and I could get rid of that icon easily enough, but I don't know&nbsp;enough to know if that's the proper solution even if it might look
 to&nbsp;you like&nbsp;it worked when all I really did was mask the problem or miss the underlying issues and leave you with a problem that doesn't show as clearly as before but still is there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of us want that and&nbsp;we both want it done corrrectly and,&nbsp;preferably,
 completely and right the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your cooperation and I await your response so we can move forward and resolve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            Since this is the Microsoft Security Essentials forum, I take it you are using MSE. If so, Windows Defender is not needed since MSE has its own antispyware component builtin and will disable Windows Defender by design.<br />

<h2>            Letters and words spontaneously corrupting&#47;disappearing in Windows Insider Preview build 18262.rs_prerelease.181012-1414</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I'd like to start off with saying that this is my first time doing something like this; I'm not sure if it belongs here, so if it doesn't, do tell me. Also, if I'm missing any information, or need to revise anything, tell me about that, too.<br />
<br />
I've recently joined the Windows 10 Insider program. Everything worked fine for about two weeks; I was installing updates as they came out, and I had experienced no outstanding issues... until a few days ago. As I was using Virtualbox, I noticed letters were
 missing from the menus, as seen here:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/feca2319-88d8-4a8a-b07f-fc8dc1b9585a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/feca2319-88d8-4a8a-b07f-fc8dc1b9585a?upload=true" height="277" width="259" /></a></p>
<p>I tried opening Notepad to see if anything was missing from that, and here's what it looked like:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80cb357b-705e-4e09-afc6-323354fd3006?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80cb357b-705e-4e09-afc6-323354fd3006?upload=true" height="227" width="349" /></a></p>
<p>(Disregard Notepad++ crashing in the background.) Not so good, huh? It was then that I decided to reboot my computer. Everything worked fine after the reboot, for a while. Then I started having a few more issues, namely with Explorer. Observe:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b11b097f-208e-41af-b115-ed2f3268169e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b11b097f-208e-41af-b115-ed2f3268169e?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f825aca2-c4e5-42d7-b523-e82f566905eb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f825aca2-c4e5-42d7-b523-e82f566905eb?upload=true" height="213" width="97" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6581103-1c5b-4f6f-a1cf-c7615f29825d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6581103-1c5b-4f6f-a1cf-c7615f29825d?upload=true" height="213" width="161" /></a></p>
<p>From left to right, that's entirely missing filenames, text that isn't shadowed, and corrupted text. A lot of text was missing from MSPAINT as well. I thought that maybe the font cache was corrupted, so I followed
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/54452-rebuild-font-cache-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this guide</a> to try and fix that. It actually seemed to fix the issue, until today. It's worse than ever before, and I was forced to boot into Safe mode to type this. Here are some screenshots:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e79fe058-1f68-46ab-9c4d-4ad17eb6b1db?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e79fe058-1f68-46ab-9c4d-4ad17eb6b1db?upload=true" height="138" width="222" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c028c470-c751-4b14-9537-1ff2b9b9ae09?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c028c470-c751-4b14-9537-1ff2b9b9ae09?upload=true" height="138" width="222" /></a></p>
<p>On the left is a text box that never ends (containing corrupted text, nonetheless), and on the right is Task Manager, evidently with no text. I tried opening CMD to try and run a system file check, but no text was displayed in the window either. I rebooted
 the computer, and the text was still missing, same as before. Also note that Explorer was missing every word except for "Pictures". I then rebooted into safe mode to run the check; here are the results:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d119d469-2c7a-45eb-9430-64b17766304d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d119d469-2c7a-45eb-9430-64b17766304d?upload=true" height="199" width="319" /></a></p>
<p>It found nothing wrong. Something tells me <em>it</em> is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I came here to write this post. If it wasn't clear, I'd like to know how to fix this problem. As you can see in some screenshots, I am on build 18262.rs_prerelease.181012-1414. My computer is 64-bit, running Windows 10 Pro. Since this issue&nbsp;<em>might</em>
 be graphics card related, my GPU is a NVidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti Boost. I tried searching these forums for issues similar to mine, but found nothing. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Also, if any Microsoft representative sees this, I'd like to tell them that the automatic filling-out of the "category" boxes when making a post is&nbsp;<em>insanely</em> annoying. It 'corrected' itself to "Word" at least five times while I wrote this...)</p>

<p>Sometimes the commands you have used do not help for Insider Builds as they are checking for corruption in System Files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If System Files that were downloaded are not different than what was downloaded those commands do not see a problem but the problem still might actually be built into the way the System Files were made by the Programmers that created them.</p>

<p>I have exact same issue with 960M and intel hd 530 HP notebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started when I opened word for the first time after a while after update (i guess), where an invisible popup appears and i can not see anything written either on popup or document. Then fonts disappereded everywhrre gradually. Deleting font cache and
 rebooting helps, but I also get frequent GSOD irql less or equal every 10-15 mins. Incredibly unusable. This is my last day as an insider. Hopefully.</p>

<p>I have the latest version of the NVidia drivers installed. I took a look at the Reliability Reports, and something caught my eye:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59195a1d-bddf-4883-942d-2e80a9aa430f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59195a1d-bddf-4883-942d-2e80a9aa430f?upload=true" height="267" width="460" /></a></p>
<p>(I copied the link at the bottom to <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/ZeLuPAi6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this pastebin</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that there are many more reports similar to this one, all correlating to the times and dates in which the font system has stopped working in the past. This one is simply the latest one (I have since cleared my font caches to temporarily be able to use
 my computer). Hopefully this sheds some light on the issue.</p>

<p>This issue still occurs on the latest Insider build (Build 18272.rs_prerelease.181026-1425). I tried checking the Reliability Reports for any sort of new error, but...</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa20f8f5-e48f-4545-9e03-049c4a3890b5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa20f8f5-e48f-4545-9e03-049c4a3890b5?upload=true" height="221" width="379" /></a></p>
<p>It doesn't appear to be working right now. Given the symptoms, however, I'm sure it doesn't differentiate much from the "Usermode Font Driver Host" report I've already uploaded.</p>

            <p>Hi kNouman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, you CAN login more than one Microsoft&nbsp;Account per computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Using another web browser, you can login another Microsoft Account, so you can easily get a code prompted by the procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have another browser, using the&nbsp;Private Window feature of it will work as well. Here's how to open it for&nbsp;each specific browser.</p>
<p>For IE : "CTRL+SHIFT+P"</p>
<p>For Firefox : "CTRL+SHIFT+P"</p>
<p>For Google Chrome : " CTRL+SHIFT+N"</p>
<p>For Safari : Safari &gt; Private Browsing..</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if all else fails, what you can do instead would be to login to your main account, request for a code, sign out of your main account, login using the secondary account (that's used to get a code), open the inbox and get the code, sign out the secondary
 account and login using the main once more, then use the "I have a code" feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use this link below as it will&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;log you out on any Microsoft Account on your current browser.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Ive also ben having the same error code, I havent tried to rent it nearly as long, but when I turned on my Xbox an saw Immortals for 90 points I clicked on it an had to do an update on Zune, then when I updated an clicked on it again to rent it, it gave
 me the error multiple times, so I went through Zune on my dashboard an went to rent it that way, but it was 360 points.... ?</div>

    <title>Win10 running Outlook 2007&#58; Error &#39;Cannot start Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oneeyedmanuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 running Outlook 2007&#58; Error &#39;Cannot start Microsoft Windows Office Outlook&#39;</h2>
                    <p><span>I have recently undertaken a major hardware upgrade in order to migrate from Windows 7 to Windows 10. This was successfully completed on 27 December, the new system comprising:</span></p>
<p><span>Intel Core i5-6600K CPU (3.50GHz); Asus Z170-K motherboard (64-bit); 32GB RAM; and Wacom Intuos graphics tablet. Windows 10 was loaded onto a Crucial 255GB SSD.</span></p>
<p><span>Amongst other software I loaded Windows Office 2007 which still meets my needs. All worked well – including Office Outlook 2007, until 9 or 10 January
</span><span>when I found that Office Outlook failed to start, displaying the error message ‘Cannot start Microsoft Office Outlook’. This message appeared immediately with no discernible latency.</span></p>
<p><span>All other applications in Office 2007 seem to work fine, as do Windows 10 Mail and Calendar. This and Office Outlook are set up to read mail from my Outlook Online (ex-Hotmail) account and the built
 in apps are working as they should. I have iCloud for Windows, which also worked fine with Outlook 2007 until the current problem.</span></p>
<p><span>There was no immediately obvious cause of the failure: I had not loaded new software, although I had run an overnight backup to cloud storage (Idrive). Windows updates had been installed on 4 January,
 but no problems occurred immediately after this. I have since downloaded additional updates on 10, 11 and 14 January. Those on 10</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> included MS Office File Validation add-in;
 KB2553065; KB2881030. On 11</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> KB3213986; KB3214628 and KB890830. It is conceivable that these might have caused trouble.</span></p>
<p><span>I have already tried the following in an attempt to diagnose/fix the problem:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Outlook
 does not start in Safe Mode – so presumably not a problem with add-ins</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I have tried resetting dat-files – presumably not due to corrupted settings</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have scanned and repaired Outlook data files using scanpst.exe and scanost.exe – errors were detected and repaired, but no change to the behaviour on start up</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have tried loading an older pst-file from&nbsp;a &nbsp;back up – no change</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have tried recreating my mail profile via the Mail applet in the control panel- no change in behaviour at start up
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have run repair from Control Panel Add/remove programs - no change in behaviour at start up
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have uninstalled and re-installed Office 2007 and all updates- no change in behaviour at start up. This suggests to me that the problem might lie in files that were left on the machine when I did the uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>I have run Event Viewer and attach below all events since 6 January, at which point everything was working fine. I did the reinstall on 14 January.</span></p>
<p><span>Please can you advise what I should try next?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            <p>Hi Hal</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. I'm running the latest version of iCloud and tried signing out and re-signing in as suggested, but this hasn't affected my Outlook problem.&nbsp;I think the fact that Outlook doesn't open in Safe Mode rules out iCloud as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm inclined to&nbsp;think the most likely cause of the problem is a corrupted file left on the system after uninstalling Office, which still causes the problem to appear after I re-installed the application.... But I'm by no means an expert!</p>

            <p>I haven't made any further progress with this problem and no-one else has come up with a solution. I think my next move will be to try to remove all traces of the original Outlook installation
 from my machine and then reinstall Office again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I last uninstalled Office (using the Windows tool in the 'Programs and Features' section of the control panel) some files were left on my system.

<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a way I can make sure ALL Outlook folders and files are removed?</p>

            <p>Hi Palcouk</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. This looks hopeful, but I've run into a problem with Method 2 on the MS support site. They say:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">To uninstall the 2007 Microsoft Office suite automatically, click the&nbsp;<strong>Download</strong>&nbsp;button. In the&nbsp;<strong><span>File Download</span></strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click&nbsp;<strong>Run</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Open</strong>,
 and then follow the steps in the easy fix wizard.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The problem is that I can't find a download button for Windows 10 on the page (although there are buttons for Windows 8 and Windows 7, Vista etc.) . Should I have moved to a different page? Or maybe I'm missing something? Can you
 help or should I raise the question on the MS support site?</p>

            <p>I have now tried all 3 methods for removing Office 2007 as shown at <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/928218/how-to-uninstall-or-remove-microsoft-office-2007-suites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>For anyone using Windows 10&nbsp;interested in trying Method 2 on the above page, I found I could download the Easyfix tool from this page:</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971179/how-to-uninstall-office-2003,-office-2007-or-office-2010-suites-if-you-cannot-uninstall-it-from-control-panel</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, having tried all the methods of uninstalling Office 2007 suggested by Microsoft and then re-installing after each, none of them have made any difference to my problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have now spent many hours trying to sort this out I decided I would buy Office 365. Unfortunately Outlook 2016 won't start on my machine either. I suppose I will now have to go through the whole troubleshooting process again on a different bulletin
 board. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you uninstall MS Office, manually or via the FixIt, if you then reinstall Office, whether the original version or new version, MS Outlook will connect to the original Profile, and if that Profile is damaged/corrupted it wont work.</p>
<p>I would uninstall Icloud before;</p>
<p>Win Key+X&gt;Control Panel (View by large icons)&gt;Mail Applet (Mail32Bit)&gt;Profiles&gt;Add a new Profile with prompt for profile ticked, add the single mail account and test if available, if OK finish the process, then start OL under the new Profile</p>
<p>NB When adding the mail account using the auto setup page it will, depending on the mail account create an Exchange or IMAP mail account

            <p><span>Thanks for your reply. I have uninstalled iCloud and created the new profile as suggested (using auto setup), and Outlook 2016 starts and indicates it is loading the profile. This is an advance!
</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, after 5 mins or so of processing it comes up with an error message ‘Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened.’</span></p>
<p><span>Is it possible that the old .ost and .pst files from my Outlook 2007 installation could be interfering (located in C:/Users/[username]/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Outlook)? Would it make sense to remove
 them? Sorry if this is a stupid question…</span></p>

            <p>Hi Palcouk</p>
<p>Thanks again. I've run OffCAT on Outlook and the following issues have come up:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Office 2016 Click-to-run is not at the latest version</td>
<td>I have run Office updates and now up to date. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BITS service is not running</td>
<td>As recommended I've tried going to this link for a fix, but page doesn't exist! http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=267360</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Outlook is slow to close due to the RequireShutdownNotification registry value (under HKLM)</td>
<td>This relates to Avast antivirus. I haven't checked with Avast to see if it would be OK to change the registry key, so haven't done this yet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Outlook is slow to close due to the RequireShutdownNotification registry value (under Wow6432Node)</td>
<td>This relates to Avast antivirus. I haven't checked with Avast to see if it would be OK to change the registry key, so haven't done this yet</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I've tried opening Outlook again, but the same error message is coming up after several minutes of 'loading the profile'. Shall I try changing the registry keys for the slow shutdown problem? Not sure what to do about the BITS service not running....</p>

            yes there are some apps by Psiloc i believe that handle zip files. i'd rather unzip the file on the computer first and extract the files from that, then copy it to the phone. much much easier. try searching under "zip" in the Nokia Store on your device.
 to download Nokia Store, point your phone's browser at <a href="http://store.ovi.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>in addition to&nbsp;<span>Jaeson's suggestions,&nbsp;</span>you can try one of the following techniques:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) first enter a single quote, then the number with the leading zeros</div>
<div><br />
<div>'<span>040000234548</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>When you hit enter, the single quote character will not display and the data will be text.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>2) enter the data as a number and format the cell to have 12 digits with leading zeros, using the custom format</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>000000000000</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>(that's 12 zeros). The data will still be numbers but will display padded with leading zeros until it shows as 12 digits.This will be the quickest option if all your codes have 12 digits.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>

<h2>            miniscule font in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>The text in my emails suddenly became so small it is hard to read. This occurred while I was in the middle of writing an email.</p>
<p>I am not aware of anything I did to cause this.</p>
<p>The setting still shows the Calibri 11 default.</p>
<p>I have tried changing the font setting which was letting me select a new font and size for a single email.</p>
<p>It has now gone back to the even smaller font regardless of what the font setting is.</p>
<p>This is happening in new emails and replies.</p>
<p>The replies even show the sender information in the same tiny font and it seems like it is getting smaller each time I try something to fix it.</p>
<p>I have Outlook 2013 and the operating system changed from 8.1 to 10.</p>

            <p>Outlook 2007 can do it - but you need to set junk to be deleted, not moved to junk folder. I'm not aware of any addins that can do this.
</p>
<p>Why not make a rule to delete the mail? You'll need to add the addresses to the rule. However, it will be unweildy with hundreds of addresses on it.
</p>
<p>FWIW, using the blocked list for hundreds of addresses is poor antispam management - the blocked and safe lists combined are limited to about 2000 addresses and spammers change their addresses all the time. You should set the junk mail filter to High&nbsp; and
 use the safe list to white list addresses. Use the blocked list for addresses that never change - like for newsletters and advertising you are having trouble unsubscribing from.

<h2>            Office 365 Portal User Edit</h2>
                    
<p>I create a user in my local AD and sync the user up to Office 365. &nbsp;Then I go to add the license and get this error "We're sorry, the user couldn't be edited. Review the user information and try again. Correlation ID: 09252a8a-2738-4eef-85e3-f52152b2f742."
 &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to automatically make Word distinguish between two works in referencing like this:</p>
<p>

<p>Johnson, 2003b</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than this:</p>

<p>Johnson, Yes it is, 2003</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using APA 6th edition and that should in theory work like the first example, but can't make it work...Can anyone help?</p>

            <p>Basically I'm referencing two works by the same author and same year. Word does it automatically like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Jelsbak Mortensen, CCPA 1st Interview - Denmark HQ, 2013)&nbsp;(Jelsbak Mortensen, CCPA 2nd Interview - Denmark HQ, 2013)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'd prefer it to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Jelsbak Mortensen, 2013a) (Jelsbak Mortensen, 2013b)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the APA 6th edition workflow and it should do the same thing. Is there then a add-on or something I can use to fix this?</p>

            Word can't do it, but as I said, BibWord is the addon that can do it for you. Specifically, the BibWord extender scans your document, and adds the suffixes. Check out the documentation, and you'll see how it's done.

            <p>Use the BibWord APA style, and then when the article you are writing is done, run the BibWord extender to add the alphabetic suffixes. Unfortunately, if you change the article's citations (add another citation, etc.) you will lose this, and will then have
 to run the BibWord Extender again to re-add them again. That's why you generally want to leave it till the end.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about the Extender is that it works on a copy of your document, so you still have the original as a backup.</p>

<p>

</p><p>Let's get this resolved by performing a soft reset. To soft reset the phone, press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, make sure that the software is updated. To check it, go to <strong>Settings&gt; Update and security&gt; Phone update&gt; Check for updates</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Remove &#34;on behalf of&#34; in Outlook.com for registered address</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this question has already been asked many times -&nbsp;recently as well was in the past. Unfortunately it appears as if there are promises made every time but never kept. As you can imagine this is not an acceptable situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is as follows: when you create an Outlook.com-account with your own E-Mail address (e.g.
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) and use it as the address to send e-mails from, then the receiver sees something like this in the from-field: "*** Email address is removed for privacy *** on behalf
 of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is obvious that his looks somehow suspicious and surely not very professional. Furthermore often SPAM-filters react on this and filter the E-Mail. Therefore many users asked how to remove the "on behalf of"&nbsp;to only have
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;in the from-field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In numerous threads it was said that Microsoft would change this behaviour and often even that the process of changing it is already on the way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I never heard of anyone who was able to get the "on behalf of" removed so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is: will this behaviour be changed in the near future or not?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't mind if it is not changed, but I need to get a clear statement from Microsoft in order to consult customers the right way (e.g. do they need Exchange Online to achieve this with Microsoft - whereas here of course it might be that they shift to another
 free service of a competitor if that is the case).</p>
<p>I do understand that Outlook.com is a free service and might not be meant for professional use, but it should also be kept in mind that other companies had great success with these kind of services and managed to also attract customers interest in their
 other products and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me it feels like Microsoft has made a big step forward with Windows 8 and the whole new design and usability concept - it has been a long time since Microsoft-products have made customers that excited.&nbsp;It is just that in my opinion to make this really
 fly you need services&nbsp;that interconnect your various devices (something a recently growing competitor is really good at) and therefore your Microsoft-account (also Outlook-account) should not limit this by putting restrictions on that immediately gives you
 second thoughts and forces you to look for other solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to a clear statement on this topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Dominik</p>

            <p>Hi Dominik, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the late reply.&nbsp; I know the inconvenience that you are having if you still have the feature "On Behalf Of" for your email account. Please be informed that the "On Behalf Of" feature has already been removed during the upgrade. If you still
 have the feature on your email account, please be reminded that it will be removed once the update has fully completed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your patience is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi Eugene,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your reply. Unfortunately I have seen many people complaining about this issue and often the answer was, as I wrote, that it should already be fixed or be in the process of being fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the Microsoft-/Outlook-Account we set up is brand new and the issue still persists so I am afraid there must be some misinformation in some way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I am also just misunderstood: what we want to achieve is that the customer is able to send E-Mails using his own e-mail-adress which is hosted by a provider that is also holding his&nbsp;company-domain. He does not want to send E-Mails from an @outlook.com,
 @live.com or @hotmail.com-E-Mail-address - or put in other words: the receiver should not see that he is using the Outlook.com-Service for sending E-Mails but should only see that the E-Mail is coming from his own domain/his e-mail-address (let's say firstname.lastname
 at companydomain.com). The goal is to be able to synchronize his contacts, calendar and e-mails on three PCs without the need for an Exchange-server and therefore he is using the Outlook.com-Service which would allow to do so. However if he also uses this
 Outlook.com-Service to send E-Mails then the "on behalf of" is added when he wants to have his own e-mail-address as sender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that I could clarify the issue. It would be great if you could tell me if there is a way to remove the "on behalf of" in this scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Dominik</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this feature was promised&nbsp;often and this already quite a while ago&nbsp;(e.g.
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-email/remove-outlookcom-on-behalf-of-when-sending-from/c5339e0e-07b2-4ce6-846b-7c631262c30d?msgId=17b11484-2250-4605-a869-5b2191015175&amp;page=12&amp;tm=1367995512818">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily I found this recent blog entry: <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2013/05/02/outlook-com-400-million-active-accounts-hotmail-upgrade-complete-and-more-features-on-the-way.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the question is just how the SMTP-Server is recognized and why there is not just an option to put it in yourself?</p>
<p>Maybe the feature is already updated on the account but something else is causing issues (e.g. not finding the SMTP-server).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope somebody can shed some light on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Dominik, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your time and efforts for getting back to us and for providing us more information about this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that by design, Microsoft will automatically recognize the SMTP Server of the third party email accounts that you're trying to add on your Microsoft account. If in case that there were some issues with the SMTP Server, you will see the
 error message <em>"There's a problem connecting to the SMTP mail server"</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dominik, if there's anything else that I can help you with, please do not hesitate to reply here and we will further assist you. We'd love to hear from you again.</p>

<p>I assume that the SMTP send-feature has just not yet been updated on the customers Outlook.com-Account. Is there a way to find out if this is the case? Because if the account is already updated then we would need to find out why it is still not working.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>unfortunately the issue is still not resolved and I am starting to wonder where I can get support for this issue if not here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been a while now and to wait and hope is not something we can tell a customer for a long period of time. It has been a month now since Ronaldo wrote "<font color="#000000">Rest assured that this will be done as soon as possible." - I am trying to
 rest assured but without a timeframe and weeks just passing by it is a bit disappointing especially for our customer.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">I do believe that there is a team working on this project&nbsp; at Microsoftwhich can be contacted and I would appreciate if you would try to get in contact with them. I can also provide you with the Microsoft-Account of the customer if
 you can give me your e-mail address - maybe the feature is already implemented but the E-Mail-Account needs to be setup new in Outlook.com or something similar.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Thank you for your support - I am sure this is a difficult situation for you as well.</font></p>

            <p>Hi Dominik,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand your frustration regarding "on behalf of" issue in your account. Let me help you with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the current updates in Outlook.com, "on behalf of" issue is already been resolved. It will only appear in&nbsp;your emails&nbsp;when you setup a
<strong>send-and-receive account</strong> and still didn't verify it. Please verify it and then check if the issue still appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, please provide us the affected email address and the screen shot of the issue and provide it in the private message that I've created. You need to click the notification that states “You have a private reply to this message.
 Click here to read it on our secure private messages section."<br />

            <p>Hi Eugene,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like we are really close to resolving this issue since by now we do actually have the option to edit the SMTP-details for accounts in Outlook.com and tell it to use the SMTP-server of the provider (thus neglecting the "on behalf of"). I can't tell
 since when this option appeared but it is new to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we just have one issue: this works fine for a second e-mail-address that the customer is using but the main e-mail-address he has and that he would like to use as sender is also the primary address for the Microsoft-account. This means that when we want
 to change the SMTP-settings of this account within Outlook.com we only see two buttons: "Account settings" and "Cancel" whereas for other e-mail-accounts within Outlook.com we see a button "Edit" when we click on "Details" and there we can adjust the SMTP-settings
 etc. Now&nbsp;when we click on "Account settings" of the primary address&nbsp;we are forwarded to the settings of the Microsoft-account but there I can't find any option to change the SMTP-settings for this account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we resolve this? Do we need to setup the main e-mail-address again as a send-only-account and have this as default? Will this cause issues since the same e-mail-adresse is already linked as the Microsoft-Account primary alias (if this is the correct
 wording)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5800 not receiving texts problem&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys Bought the Nokia 5800 about 2 weeks ago and all has been fine with it until recently.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ive done no modifications of upgrades or played about with any of the settings..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now for some reason im not receiving text messages when they are sent??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way I can get them is by either sending one, turning my phone off then back on or by going into message settings and selecting view sim messages then the message will pop up....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have to do this everytime which is quite annoying! I can do everything else fine....send messages, ring people receive calls etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ive rang vodaphone and 5 times they have fobbed me off with different things to try and none have worked....Ive tried the hard reset and still nothing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anybody else having this problem, or does anyone know a solution to fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Call vodafone and request a new sim card. If they are difficult about it just say that a nokia care point said it was a problem with the sim.&nbsp; They should then replace it for free.</p>

<p>i want to bump thistopic up since i have been experiencing the same problem starting 3 or 4 days ago, after i installed an app from the phone's download manager, namely wavesecure lite, for trial, after that, these same problems started appearing.</p>
<p>diagnosis, seems like the phone does'nt have any problems recieving the text messages, the problem is showing these messages. the only time the recieved messages would show is to either turn on and off the phone or me sending another message before the phone
 would show the recieved messages. the message sending can be anything even if the message cannot be sent due to an invalid number or anything as long as there is some outgoing sms traffic from the phone. then at that time, your recieved texts will be shown.</p>
<p>all other functions of the phone work fine, just this problem, and its very annoying since you need to like "manually" check if you have messages in your inbox or not. please help.</p>

<p>Following up from my first post I didnt manage to solve the problem so I changed phones and before my 14 days return I changed it again to another Nokia 5800.......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And guess what after changing phones and sim cards after a day this phone started doing the same thing....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as much as i loved the phone i cut my losses and changed it all together!</p>

            i have the same problem! my friend has a 5800 as well, but not the same problem - his is flawless. i love this phone, but i'm wondering if its just a fatal flaw in nokia's first generation touch endevour. hopefully the n97 has been better designed and
 tested, i'm still skeptical if i want to pay nokia another 700, having bought a n95 n loved it, and now this 5800 deal, th n97 seems almost too good to be true - like the price tag of the 5800 seemed

<p>I have also been suffering from this problem and I think I may have fixed it for the moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read on post on the asia-nokia forums and someone said that turning the log off fixed the problem. I tried this and then asked my friend to send me a txt. A few moments later I received his txt along with one sent to me earlier in the day, but I am not
 sure if this is due to turning the log off or because I had just received a call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have now enabled the log again and also uninstalled an app called SMS DS Plugin. I am not sure what it is for but those combination of things appear to have fixed my problem for the time being.</p>

            i got my 5800 in january, had the same problem as you, i spoke to o2 and they put me through to nokia, and i had to format the phone to sort the problem, apparently its pretty common! anyways, back up ur stuff and on the dial screen put *#7370# and it
 will ask for a lock code, if you havent changed it then it will be 12345. when it all boots back up it will work fine. by the way, you could also do with upgrading your phone to v21 pn nokia software upgrader :) hope this helps.

<p>I had this problem where I wasn't able to receive any texts until I sent one. WhenI got somone to text me the white notification light started blinking but there was no new message indication or sound.&nbsp; All I did was turn the log back on and the problem

            Actually it's still a problem after turning the log back on.&nbsp; The only other setting I've changed recently is I've enabled the screen lock.&nbsp; I'll try disabling the screen lock and see if it fixes the problem.

                    I have Outlook 2019. My gmail messages are showing up in my sent box twice. I have gone in and turned off the "save sent messages" and it is still doing it. This only happens with my gmail messages (I have two accounts that go through outlook). Any fixes?

<h2>            Nokia N8 Update.Help&#33;&#33; &#58;D</h2>
                    
<p>So...first of all hey xD,i am new to this forums so I am sorry if I placed this topic in a wrong section.</p>
<p>So the problem is that I got a dark grey Nokia N8 and that is from French.</p>
<p>His product code is:<strong>059C304</strong></p>
<p>The telephone is from a company named SFR,but I am not living in French,and someone gave me this telphone as a present.</p>
<p>The problem is that i cannot update the telephone to Belle.Because it says he cannot find a new version.</p>
<p>At this moment my version is:<strong>Symbian Anna 022.014</strong></p>
<p>So...how can i update the telephone?Or i must wait for the update to come out?</p>
<p>-Thanks for reading this.</p>
<p>-Regards,Duddy</p>

<p>Belle would only be released to that product code once SFR approved the update</p>
<p>If it's not offered when you connect the phone to pc suite, it suggests SFR have never approved the belle update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case and given the length of time that has passed since Belle was released. they never will&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could talk about warenties at this point, but likely it has expired&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you can either find a freindly care point to flash belle, or look elsewhere for unnoficial methods of obtaining updates that we cannot discuss here&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;everything depends on your Nokia Product Code. Even in the past for very vital products like the Nokia N97, some Product Codes were only updateable after visiting Nokia Care. You cannot determine from the lack of an update for one Product Code, there would
 be no support anymore.&nbsp;</p>

The roll-out starts now first for the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 in selected countries as well as Lumia 521, Lumia 810, and Lumia 928 in the US. Exact delivery timings will vary by region, model and operator, but we expect the update to reach your Lumia 520, Lumia
 620, Lumia 720, Lumia 820 or Lumia 920 by the end of September. Your Nokia Lumia will check periodically for software updates automatically, but you can perform a manual check by going to Settings&gt;Phone update&gt;Check for updates.<br />
<br />
We will also be publishing an availability check-list so that you can check the status of the update for your country and network operator in our support pages:

    <title>IE 11 Extremely Sluggish on Huffington Post - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim-l  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE 11 Extremely Sluggish on Huffington Post</h2>
                    In the last few days I noticed that IE 11 becomes extremely sluggish when loading pages from Huffington Post (for example,
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/13/marius-giraffe-denmark-zoo_n_4782063.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/13/marius-giraffe-denmark-zoo_n_4782063.html</a>). I tried the link on several PCs (Windows 8 and Windows 8.1) and the results are the same. What might be the cause?

            <p>@Karthik, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Huffington Post&nbsp;is the only website I've experienced this issue so far. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. There was&nbsp;no error except that a warning "huffingtonpost.com is not responsive due to a long-running script" mid-way of the rendering. There also wasn't any error in the F12 tool.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. It happens on both UIs. I'm running IE on 64-bit mode.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>No issue was found.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>I disabled all add-ons and it seems have no effect.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Method 3:</p>
<p>I tested the website&nbsp;on a fresh installed VM and it's still the same.</p>

<p>When the page is being load, the CPU usage will jump to around 15% (which is roughly a single core fully-loaded on a 8-core system). After around 30 seconds, CPU usage will go down to around 5%. When I scrolled the page, CPU usage will goes up to 15% for
 a few seconds then come back down to around 5%. I also tried disabling GPU rendering but it had no effect.<br />

</p>
<p>Both Firefox 27 and Google Chrome 32 rendered the website just fine, although slightly more sluggish than other websites.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My IE's security is set at default level (medium-high), and there were no available updates for IE.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firefox and Chrome both load that page a little faster than IE, but the problems are:</p>
<p>1. The page is too large at over 3 MB.</p>
<p>2. The page pulls content from too many servers. Go to View (IE Menu Bar) (or Alt + v, v)&gt; Webpage Privacy Report to see the summary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Don,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yes, Huffingtonpost.com is notoriously large and slower than most websites across browsers. But the frustrating part is when rendering/scrolling it IE's tab&nbsp;barely responsive (other tabs are fine), while the UI remains very responsive on Firefox and Chrome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't think pulling content from too many hosts was the culprit. The slowness seems to be caused by some heavy/poorly written JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>

<p>Hardware acceleration is a new feature that lets Internet Explorer move all graphics and text rendering from the CPU to the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). In some cases, you have to enable or disable hardware acceleration to check for hardware or software
 compatibility issues with viewing certain Internet websites, such as websites that contain streaming or full-screen video.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: Rendering</strong><em> </em>is the process of using computer code to display the text and graphics that you see on your screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method</strong> <strong>1:</strong> Turn off the <strong>Hardware Acceleration</strong> and check if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>a</strong>: Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>b</strong>: Press<strong> Alt+X</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>c: </strong>Then click <strong>Internet Options.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>d</strong>: Then click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>e:</strong> Place a check mark on the option <strong>Use Software rendering instead of GPU rendering</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>f: </strong>Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>ok</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>g</strong>: Close and then <strong>Open Internet Explorer</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Hi Karthik, that was the first thing I tried. It didn't have any noticeable impact on the "sluggishness".

            <p>Hi Karthik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure. I agree with you that it's very likely due to some implementation of Huffington Post's website. I actually just wanna report this issue to the IE team so that they might be able to take a look and hopefully improve the performance in a future release.</p>
