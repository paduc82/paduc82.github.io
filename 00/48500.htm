<h2>            Partition lost after windows 10 update 1809</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated my windows 10 with update 1809 and now I cannot see my personal files partition anymore. In a partition tool that I use, I see that 230 GB has now an unallocated file system and that there is no used space in it. What happened with update
 1809? And how can I get my files back?</p>

<p>What version of Windows 10 did you have previously. Did you update using windows update or the v1809 ISO. What process did you use.</p>
<p>How did you partition your hard drive and what program did you use.</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the device or spec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to investigate recovery software that may be able to recover a deleted partition. I hope you have a backup of the personal files.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding. I do not know which version I had previously. Probably the last update before 1809. I updated using winodows update. Partitioning was done using minitool pratition magic. My laptop is an Acer Aspire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just downloaded an old version of minitool partition magic that still has a recover option. I managed to recover some data. Furthermore, I do have a weekly backupsystem, so the harm is only annoyance instead of total loss of data.</p>
<p>

<p>Good news about the backup.</p>
<p>I've been reading this forum for some time now and yours is the first I've seen where a partition is lost from an update to 1809 via windows update. (very unusual)</p>
<p>I assume you had your data partition previously allocated with a drive letter, so C: was the windows partition and D: was your data partition. In theory windows update wouldn't touch the extended partition.</p>

<h2>            Drive D&#58; not detected, cannot copy&#47;paste</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have recently resurrected an old laptop that had a motherboard failure. After the repair I rebooted the laptop in bare bones configuration, no second drive, no mouse, etc. The unit came up and everything looked normal. I had to reactivate Windows due to
 the motherboard change and all seemed normal. I went through several Windows Update downloads/installs without issue. The primary drive was fairly full so I deleted several old personal files and uninstalled a couple apps I no longer used. At this point, I
 decided to install the second hard drive. When I rebooted the laptop, the second hard drive would not show up in file explorer. I went into disk management and the drive did not show up there as well. I then rebooted the laptop and went into the BIOS to have
 a look and the drive is recognized by the BIOS. I was not sure what to think, so I took both drives out of the laptop and put them into USB caddies to check on a second PC. Interestingly, the second hard drive came up normally and functioned normally. The
 primary drive for the laptop, however, did not show up in file explorer. I tried disk management and the drive showed up with a healthy partition, but no file system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Willing to compromise at this point I put the primary drive back in the laptop and it booted normally. I figured the laptop would be usable in the short term in this condition, I just needed to copy a couple files over to it. I grabbed a SanDisk Cruzer 64GB
 flash drive and copied a few files to it. I plugged the flash drive into the laptop and it came up normally, showing all the files on the stick. I then tried to copy the files from the Flash drive over to my primary drive on the laptop and, while it started
 normally, it then failed. The error message stated that there were no files to copy from the flash drive, they didn't exist. Sure enough, in file explorer, the flash drive was empty. I looked at the location that I copied to on the primary drive, but the files
 did not exist there either. I ejected the flash drive and opened it up on another PC. The files were still there!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have never experienced a situation like this and really have no idea where to start. This laptop has a couple legacy programs on it that I don't use often, but are real handy to have when I need them. So if there is a way to salvage this, I would greatly
 appreciate it.</p>

            Thank you for your help. I tried to run DISM and it kept failing with error 87, option is unknown. I did some research and while I will wait to hear from you, I did download and create a Windows 10 installation media to a USB flash drive, in case it is
 needed.

 should fix it!

            <p><span>Hello Stanhart,</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model number of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you installed any software prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>MacroVision Software manager performs online checks in the background. It is not a threat or a virus. To un-install it, search for “agent.exe” file and rename it to “agent.old”.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t work, I would suggest you to check with the computer manufacturer’s support.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Set the computer to clean boot state then identify the process and uncheck the option to run at startup for the program.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps from the link “<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</a>”, to place the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Follow the step “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state”, from the link, to place the

    <title>Aspect Ratio randomly changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blaster249  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aspect Ratio randomly changes</h2>
                    
<p>Since I purchased the Xbox One I have had my Digital Cable through Time Warner hooked up through my xbox one and I have had no issues. Yesterday something happened while watching a movie on TV. I lost sound and the aspect ratio on my cable box kept switching
 between 1080i and 480 every 30 seconds. With every switch the image would freeze so watching TV became impossible. I was able to watch netflix and play games with no issues so I assumed it was the cable box and called Time Warner.</p>
<p>A tech visited this morning and after working through a number of solutions we found that the cable box works fine when hooked directly to the TV, and the xbox one works fine by itself. I dont know what suddenly happened after a year of enjoying the tv going
 through the xbox but something changed. Has any one else had this issue? Any solutions?</p>

<p>I have had the same problem with TWC using Scientific Atlanta box and 1080i (insert eye roll) plasma tv. &nbsp;I have checked/verified the signal strength with TWC over phone and swapped out cable boxes. &nbsp;Similar to Blaster249, cable box direct to TV HDMI works
 fine. &nbsp;Patching through XBO causes no audio, video for 3-4 seconds, then aspect/ratio shifts for ~10 seconds, then the cycle repeats. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In same timeframe, have also had issues with connecting to XBO using SmartGlass on Surface Pro 3. &nbsp;Error code 0x80060001 is given by SmartGlass application, but error isn't found in error code look up database. &nbsp;For whatever its worth, also have AC unity
 and Halo:MCC installed. &nbsp;Everything was working smoothly before patchfest from both titles.</p>

<p>However, if it is a small scratch you could check to see if your local video game retailer has a disc repair station or check to see if the game is on the list for the disc replacement program. &nbsp;The disc replacement program costs approx. $20 per disc.</p>

<p>If there are any movie / video game rental stores near you, I would visit one of those. They almost all typically have a disc resurfacing machine that will fix almost any damage to a disc, as long as it is not cracked.</p>

<p>If it's a scratch on the disc that the console made, nothing you can do about that. Install your games next time. If it's a spot, then I would make sure you store your discs properly, as that is the layers in the disc separating/rotting.</p>

<h2>            I lost my access to the net after upgrading to 10-limited connection error</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I've just upgraded my windows 8.1 to 10. Running the windows for the first time,I noticed that I was not connected to the net. I checked the connection and it said you are connected to "my connection name". I restarted my pc but it did not work. Then
 i went to networks sharing center and chose "forget" the network. And then chose my network again ... but this time it said that you have limited access to the net .... whereas my &nbsp;cellphone was connected very fine &nbsp;at the same time. I uninstalled my wireless
 driver and restarted my machine.... still did not work ... I then updated my driver manually using my cellphone and transferred the file to pc and run the update file...but it also did not help-actually my driver was updated before that attempt. I contacted
 to my internet service provider and told them the story, they asked me to set some ip on protocol 4 and also to check the ping .... and finally they told me that maybe my wireless card is not suitable for win 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my wireless card info:BCM43142 wireless network adapter date: 9/28/2013 driver version 6.30.223.181&nbsp;</p>
<p>My laptop model :sony vaio SVF15A18CXB.</p>

<p>I already mentiond about my wireless card and my laptop properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my wireless card info:BCM43142 wireless network adapter date: 9/28/2013 driver version 6.30.223.181&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My laptop model :sony vaio SVF15A18CXB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what extra information should i say about my pc?</p>
<p>I went through the methods ... Method1 did not work because my exe file didn't have compatibility tab. In method2, there was no blank to type "troubleshooting" in my windows 10. I clicked win+x keys, then went to run and i typed trpubleshooting. From the
 right and top of the window i cliccked on "view all" again there were no "network and internet" option... any way i troubleshooted using similar options but didn't work. .. the third method was also so general and didn't help. I need a more strightforward
 solution to the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p>
        </p>

    <title>My Recording Devices keeps crashing on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My Recording Devices keeps crashing on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>HELP PLEASE</p>
<p>I'm having a huge issue with my Recording Devices on my volume controls. And believe me when I say I have litterally sat up all night trying everything I've read in MANY forums including here to fix this to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to speaker on the taskbar and right click it takes me to the Sound and Recording Devices so you can set defaults and configure. ALL the other tabs on Sound work fine except for the Recording tab. When I touch anywhere on the tab, doesnt matter
 where.. it crashes and throws up a message that says Windows Shell Common Dll has stopped working, close program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran all the suggested command prompt suggestions. I tore out all the sound devices and redid them all MANY times and finally got the VIA HD Audio Deck finally working.. but I still cant config anything in the sound Recording Devices because just that tab
 continues to crash</p>

<h2>            Producti Registration Page Refuses to Co-operate</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased an Xbox 360 recently and have been attempting to register the thing for warranty via the registration page on this site. All goes well until I try to enter the BOT catcher phrase, which despite my best efforts is never acceptable to the submit
 system. I have tried to enter capital and lower case versions and substituted&nbsp;&nbsp;Ohs&nbsp;for zeros etc., I've even listened to the audio version to check I'm correct, but to no avail. I would like to get this chore out of the way, so any suggestions anyone?</p>
<p>Incidentally I am not using Internet Explorer as my browser, could it be that simple?</p>

<p>it may be that your xbox is already registered. try to start the repair process on the page without going all the way. in the middle of the process it should tell you if there is still a warranty on your xbox. if that happens, then your xbox is already registered.
 if you got it from microsoft, then it is already registered</p>

                    <p>So when launching the win 10 mail, it shows that "we couldnt access your contacts, please check your contacts privacy settings to make sure you've given access to mail and calendar", how do i stop this from saying it EVERY singel time i launch the program?
</p>
<p>I have no one in contacts and have the "allow apps to acces contacts" option set to OFF, I had stopped using win 10 mail while back, but the program I am using currently, doesn't support Yahoo for some reason.</p>

            Hi Donald.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yahoo has an annoying Security setting that tries to scare you off from using other Mail sync apps, in it's Security Settings  to "Use less Secure apps to access Yahoo Mail."   This plus turning off Contacts in Mail app Settings &gt; Manage Accounts &gt; Yahoo account should get rid of errors which are rare to begin with.  
<br />
<br />If not then report back the exact error and behavior and I'll help you further.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>"Your PC/Device needs to be repaired<br />

I have downloaded an ISO and put it on a DVD and attempted to use it to boot, with no luck. When I tried again, the disk didn't work at all. The automated repair isn't working, and all of the other fixes I have seen require the computer to be able to boot.
 Please help.</p>

<h3> tmgregory  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows services will not load on startup</h2>
                    
<p>I had an automatic update load and now I get multiple errors on startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main error I get on startup is:</p>
<p>C:\windows\system32\config\systemprofile\desktop refers to a location that is unavailable.&nbsp; It could bo on a hard drive on this computer or on a network.&nbsp; Check to make sure that disk is properly inserted or that you are connected to the internet or your
 network, and then try again.&nbsp; If it cannot be located, it might have been moved to a different location.</p>
<p>There is nothing on my desktop but the recycle bin.</p>
<p>I have tried system restore and received this message:&nbsp; C:\windows\system32\rstrui.exe.&nbsp; The dependency services or group failed to start.</p>
<p>I can start in Safe Mode and everything starts with the limited capabilities.&nbsp; When I start normally, I cannot access any changes, even with my user designated as "administrator".&nbsp; Nothing windows based loads, and I cannot do windows update.&nbsp; When I attempt
 to use these programs, I get a message regarding a missing file named ATL.DLL and asking me to reinstall.&nbsp; I don't know what this is, and am reluctant to install something I don't know about.</p>
<p>This all started after the update that loaded on 8/13/10.&nbsp; I have run several virus programs (avast, trendmicro) and have no viruses found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have attempted to do a repair on startup and it does not run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am afraid that I am going to have to wipe my hard drive and start from scratch, but I'm hoping that I don't have to do something that drastic.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You might also need these methods and the ATL.DLL methods in the previous message.<br />
<p>Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do<br />
not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also<br />
your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can try System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

I use two keyboards languages - English and Czech (QWERTY). Windows 10 at least once per day installs third language Czech (QWERTZ). How can I stop this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in Czech Republic so my computer region is obviously set to Czech Rep., is that cousing this problem?&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi <strong>JanUreš</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are referring to the language that appears on the language icon on the lower right part of the desktop, then yes, the language that would appear there would depend on the settings that you have, as well as the Region or your location. So on top of
 the settings that you have under Preferred language, an additional language will be added on the language desktop shortcut will also be added based on your location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.

            Yes, I would like to know how to stop Windows from installing the Czech language with QWERTZ keyboard. I switch from ENG to CES quite often with a shortcut and when there is a third option it really makes writing anything hard for me. Is there an option
 how to keep just the Czech language with QWERTY keyboard layout there?&nbsp;
