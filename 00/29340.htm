    <title>Surface Pro 2 will not display after emerging from sleep mode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 2 will not display after emerging from sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>Greetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro 2 (a i5 1.6GHz processor, 8GB RAM and 252G SSD device) has been having what I think are difficulties emerging from sleep mode, tied with display problems. I'm hoping someone will be able to assist me in restoring function to my device, as
 since last Monday it hasn't been useable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I was able to use the Surface Pro 2 was last friday, August 1st.&nbsp; I mostly used it as an E-Reader during the day (using the Kobo app) and the Skype app during the evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it was left mostly unused for the weekend. It was closed via the type cover, and kept plugged on its charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Monday, I left with it to work, and on my way back I reopened it to use it again as an E-Reader. However, I wouldn't get any response from it. From toying around with the power button thereafter, I could see the Surface logo appear, with the little loading
 dots circling, and then the screen would go black (black as in, the screen would display black, but wasn't OFF).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got home, I experimented around with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;I tried powering it off by pressing the power button for 10 seconds, then powering it back up. Same results.
</li><li>I tried the above, but on restart press the Volume+ and Power button. A textual menu briefly appeared, went away, I got the Surface logo and the circling loading dots again... and it ended up&nbsp;doing the same.
</li><li>Further fiddling around had me discover that even though the display wouldn't show me much that the OS was actually running. I entered my password and managed to reach the Start screen. The Surface emitted a "Bling!" sound which - I suppose - was tied to
 some Windows alert pop-up. I discovered that when I used the Windows Key that any major changes to the image displayed (like, going from desktop to the start screen) very brief flickers of the image that was supposed to be displayed on screen before going
 dark once agai</li></ul>
<p>The only time I've been able to get an image consistently displayed&nbsp;on the Surface Pro 2's screen was by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del, which brings the appropriate blue screen. However,
<em>any</em> operation done from that point has the screen go back to being black.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be grateful for any assistance provided that could help me get my Surface Pro 2 in good working order again. Thank you.</p>

    <title>Download errors &#40;Mafia II&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Download errors &#40;Mafia II&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Account region - UK</p>
<p>Actual region - Sweden</p>
<p>Connection type - ADSL Broadband</p>
<p>Speedtest.net result 14Mbps</p>
<p>Before anybody says my Account region and actual region have to be the same, I was advised to do this by support over the phone, this is because I don't read, write, speak or understand Swedish. Now this makes everything rather messy as if one was advised
 to change region and am unable to download content, something needs to be done on the Microsoft Xbox side of things for other expats such as myself.<br />
<br />
Mafia II will not download due to whatever feeble reason people come out with. Status code 80150017. &nbsp;To enjoy xbox live experience, we need to understand what everything means, not have foreign words/letters that we have no understanding of.</p>
<p>Mafia II is a game that I desperately want, so was Army of 2 which gave me same error, though Assassins Creed downloaded with no problem. Please, help me download the game. I don't want to be going around getting a UK VPN onto the laptop, bridging connections,
 making a crossover cable to connect laptop to xbox in order to give me a UK IP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Sorry, but that error code does mean it is a region issue. With region locked content your account region has to match your physical location. Since not all content is region locked that is why you are able to download some content but not others. Region
 locks are put in place by the developers.</p>

<p>@Mr Popek</p>
<p>First thing you must do is delete the partial download from your hard drive.</p>
<p>Then clear the system cache</p>
<p>Then download again but you must stay on the active downloads screen.</p>
<p>Make sure you stay on the active downloads screen. Do not use the console when it is downloading. Also do not let is shut down.</p>
<p>So it might be a good idea to turn off auto power off mode.</p>
<p>To me it looks like there is a bug in the system software where the download corrupts if you play games or use app while the content is downloading.</p>

<p>It doednt matter why you want english content you arent lawfully allowed to use uk content outside the intended region</p>
<p>They only advised you to use uk account to get english content </p>
<p>And yes you actually have to comply with international laws and use the correct content which would be your actual regions</p>
<p>Itit is also a terns of use violation to use a vpn </p>
<p>You are only garenteed access ro content you are lawfully allowed to use ehicb is your actual region</p>
<p>How cna you travel the world and not learn your host countries laws and languages</p>
<p>Your work handbook should cover that</p>
<p>Local laws and signs dont change because you cant speak rhe local language you adapt to your enviroment not the other way around</p>
<p>I can tell you not knowing basic language can cause problems like hwen i went to my home country and had to ask where the toilet was lets just say spending 10 mins trying to explain where i wanted to go to a mall cop wasnt fun lucky for me he knew english</p>

<p>It is an terms of use violation to not use your actual location</p>
<p>International laws dictate what and which content you can access </p>
<p>Due to international laws and distibution rights you canmot access content that isnt intended for your region like regio. Locked content usually because of content laws and distibution rights</p>
<p>In some countries thata is also a fine able offence and in some cases jailtime is included</p>
<p>(germany and new zealand and australia have the strictests of laws)</p>
<p>You arent allowwd ro reroute access nor can xbox remove lawfull region locks that follow international laws distibuted by your local region</p>

<p>It depends on what region you're in. Sometimes they do offer a different game if one of the games is not available in your region. Try checking here for the games for you region (make sure the region in the bottom left of the page matches yours) -

<p>I'm not in Sweden through choice. I'm here through unfortunate circumstances which I'm not prepared to talk about.</p>
<p>Obviously there is nothing I can do about the game, and I can't change region for another 2 months, not that I want to, but if I have to, then I have to. When it comes to upgrading to next gen, I obviously have to think about my options, on what suits me
 and my needs!</p>

<p>Usually a game is only offeredd if it is generally a restrictive country usually germany or australia
</p>
<p>As there is allowed sweden content in your region its not an alternative</p>
<p>It depends on your regions laws</p>
<p>International laws arent to be ignored </p>
<p>You will continue to have issues regardless including getting lost on the street because you refuse to adapt to your enviroment which is never suggested in a workplace</p>
<p>To following local laws and customs</p>
<p>Googlr banned games content laws are enforced on all consoles </p>

    <title>Internal Hard Drive Missing after Upgrade to Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internal Hard Drive Missing after Upgrade to Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Western Digital Internal Hard Drive (second drive) is not visible after I Upgraded from XP to Windows 7.&nbsp; The missing SATA drive is visible in the BIOS Boot Menu, but not when Windows 7 finishes launching.&nbsp; Westerm Digital "Data Lifeguard" also does not
 detect the SATA drive.</p>
<p>Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Shut down the computer and disconnect the SATA cable to the second drive.</p>
<p>Reboot to Windows and go to your computer manufacture's support web site and check for Windows 7 drivers for your specific model number.</p>
<p>If there are Windows 7 drivers then download to a folder on your hard drive and install all of them,<strong>starting with the Motherboard/chipset</strong> drivers,
<strong>SATA</strong>, LAN, Audio, Etc., and so on. Then shutdown the computer.</p>
<p>Now reconnect the SATA cable and boot to Windows, it should normally detect a drive has been connected and indicate so via a popup.</p>
<p>Next,&nbsp;open 'Disk Mangement' and see if the drive is listed.</p>

            Quick question, are you trying to access the fifa points through the companion app? If so, you need to log into your account on your console first. If not I would head over to EA support and find out what went wrong.

            <p>Not sure if this applies to Windows 8, but in Windows 10, the Properties' dialog for the Screenshots folder has a 'Location' tab, which allows you to move the Screenshots folder like any other User folder.&nbsp; When you change the location from the default,
 a value named <strong>{B7BEDE81-DF94-4682-A7D8-57A52620B86F}</strong> will be added under:</p>
<p><strong>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserShellFolders</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>with the path to the folder as string data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing <strong>HKLM</strong><strong>\...\FolderDescriptions</strong> will change the creation location for all new profiles on the computer.</p>

    <title>Desktop icons keep moving to left of screen on reboot. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mvin46  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop icons keep moving to left of screen on reboot.</h2>
                    I had previously read the thread "Windows 7 desktop icon's keep moving" but can not reply to it since it is "locked".&nbsp; So here I am.<br />
<br />
Mine started about 4 days ago (after surfing some questionable sites??).&nbsp; All of my icons were splashed up against the left side and were changed from small to medium size.&nbsp; Running Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus did not help.<br />
<br />
I reviewed all 8 pages of the thread and did note that Microsoft was watching, but only to divert tangential repliers to start new threads.&nbsp; Nothing to help us threaders.<br />
<br />
I ended up cutting and pasting solutions from the thread to Word and observed ~12 different "solutions" which worked for some but not for others.&nbsp; I ignored any comment regarding 2 monitors or an external monitor on a laptop.&nbsp; With all of this my conclusion
 is that the glitch must be multicausal.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that if you have a lot if icons that you group them inside new folders to avoid moving&nbsp; and removing several dozen separate icons as the fixes are attempted.&nbsp; I reduced the icon number to only 8.<br />
<br />
I started out trying the simplest fixes first.<br />
1.&nbsp; Unticking Auto Arrange did not help<br />
2.&nbsp; Right click on desktop to refresh would push any icon I had moved to the right back to its original position on the left and always to a specific position.&nbsp; Pressing the F5 button did the same.<br />
3.&nbsp; Holding down the shift button while rebooting did not help.<br />
4.&nbsp; I had had Avast antivirus but changed to Ms Security Essentials last year.<br />
5.&nbsp; Dragging the icons so they lined up horizontally at the top of the screen did not help.<br />
6.&nbsp; I went to Personalize&gt;ChangeDesktopIcons and unchecked AllowThemesToChangeDesktopIcons.&nbsp; Did not help.<br />
At this point I was looking in Control Panel to see what Graphics card I had (Nvidia?&nbsp; ATI radeon?)&nbsp; when i had the epiphany.<br />
Still to go were:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>getting rid of the Library function of Windows 7</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; getting into <span>'System Configuration'
</span>and unchecking various start-up services<br />

<br />
The epiphany while in Control Panel:&nbsp; My glitch was only 3-4 days old and I could do a system restore.&nbsp; I was able to go back to June 21, well before the glitch.&nbsp; This led to a reboot and my icons were restored to original position and size.&nbsp; The new folders
 were there although many of the icons I had placed in them were out in their old positions.&nbsp; For now I'll keep the folders and the number of icons reduced.<br />

            Just fixed this problem myself. I created a new user account and the problem didn't occur in that account. So I just switched accounts and deleted my old one, and this got rid of my web browser bookmarks and some other files... but I don't mind replacing

<h2>            Windows 10 frequently hanging after cloning to an SSD.</h2>
                    <div><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)"><span>My build is randomly hanging every now and then, and I am forced to wait normally 10-15 seconds before I can do anything. This has only happened since I installed a new SSD: the Kingston A400 480GB.
 It isn't a full freeze: I can move my mouse about and sometimes right click. However, what I have noticed is no new stuff can be done. If I have tried to do any new things they all open at once. For instance, a common scenario is I am in chrome, say watching
 YouTube, and I want to open a new video in a new tab. I can do this, but nothing will appear: the tab will be there but nothing displayed. I can open a tab of google, but again nothing appears. I can right-click the task-bar and open task manager but it doesn't
 appear. Then, all will happen at once. As well as this, sometimes no application responds and I just wait to be able to do something.</span></span></div>

<br />If you used Acronis for cloning try uninstalling Acronis as this has worked for other users with the same issue with Acronis.

<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type msinfo32 in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .nfo file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.

<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type eventvwr in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file

            The Event Logs show repetitive critical Kernel-Power errors preceded by the following :
<br />
<br />Kernel-Boot - Windows failed fast startup with error status 0xC00000D4.
<br />
<br />Can you turn off Fast Startup and see if it helps :

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products).

<br />If the issue persists can you try a "clean boot" and see if it makes a difference:

<br />
<br />If a clean boot does resolve the issue there is a section in the article "How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot".
<br />
<br />Reset the computer to start normally afterward.
<br />
<br />As a general precaution create a System Restore Point prior to initiating a clean boot.

<h2>            view in browser option not working</h2>
                    <p>inorder to watch animated gifs in outlook 2010 and windows 7 I use the view in browser option, but when I do a temp file cleanup with windows disc clean I receive error message "cannot display page". The only fix is to do an image restore from a backup.
 System restore doesnt fix it.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Office help desk assures me it is a windows problem and not an Office issue.</p>
<p>Anyone else had similar problem</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I use view in browser when their is an animated gif embeded in an email otherwise there isnt any animation, or some emails say if you cannot view please select view in browser.</p>
<p>the problem arises when as part of normal house keeping I do a disc cleanup using windows clean up tool, if I then use view in browser I rec the error message "cannot display web page. so lately i have unchecked the clean &nbsp;temp files box and all is ok but
 I haven't got this issue with other pc's.here is the address that view in browser uses</p>
<p>C:\Users\Rams\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.Outlook\ZKHCXXUC\email.mht</p>
<p>after a temp file cleanup this link disapears</p>
<p>The strange thing is as you can see it is located in temp internet files but cleaning out the internet or explorer temp files doesn't cause any issues. It is only windows temp files cleanup that causes the issue.</p>
<p>I know it isn't life threatening but it is annoying when you rec an email that I cannot view</p>

<h2>            Where has my HP C8180 All-in-one Scan Function gone&#63;</h2>
                    I have an HP desktop running Windows 7. I used to be able to print and scan to and from an HP C8180 All-in-one Printer scanner, but now I only have the print function - I have lost the scan function. I have tried every possible downlaod of drivers etc
 etc per HP &amp; Microsoft websites with no luck I tried the HP solution center but just get a message saying it can't run because my device installation is incomplete. It merely recommends&nbsp; looking for help files etc which takes me back where I started. Can anyone
 help?

            Hey Pete,<br />
<br />
Could you let me know what operating system you are using? If your using XP or newer I recommend first running the
<a href="http://www.hp.com/go/tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HP Print &amp; Scan Doctor</a> to see if it is able to resolve the issue. Post back and let me know if this helped resolve the issue at all. Please include any new details or error messages that the utility provides.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Sean - I am running Windows 7. When I first moved to that on my new HP desktop (I had previously been running Windows XP pro on my old dell desktop)&nbsp;I remember managing to download a fix because I lost the scan function when I changed systems.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time around (the scan finction just disappeared one day) I have tried every conceivable download of drivers etc and used HP Print &amp; Scan Doctor and tried removing and re-installing HP&nbsp;but to no avail. I am constantly getting a message from the HP solution
 centre saying that&nbsp;it can't run because my device installation is incomplete. It's a Catch 22 situation.</p>
<p>I even tried re-loading the original print drivers from the CD that was provided when I first bought the C8180 but that just gave me a message saying that it was not compatible with the device (ie my new HP Desktop running Windows 7) that I was trying to
 load it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Pete, <br />
<br />
Thanks for the detailed response. When you ran the Print &amp; Scan Doctor did you receive any specific errors?
<br />
<br />
First lets go ahead and re-download the last driver pack which we will need later on in this process. Here is the link to the driver pack. (You didnt state if&nbsp; your running 32 or 64 bit so I included both).<br />
<br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-76036-1&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4062&amp;product=3204788&amp;sw_lang=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">C8180 Full Feature Software - 32 bit</a><br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-76036-1&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4063&amp;product=3204788&amp;sw_lang=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">C8180 Full Feature Software - 64 bit</a><br />
<br />
Next lets follow these steps:<br />
<br />
<p>1. Click the Start button and type %temp% in the run field</p>
<p>2. Find and open the folder starting with 7z (Example: 7zS2356)</p>
<p>3. Open the folder "Util"</p>
<p>4. Open the folder "CCC"</p>
<p>5. If you have an HP computer run the L3uninstall.exe. If you have a non-HP computer run the L4uninstall.exe</p>
<p>6. Run Disk cleanup from Accessories\ System Tools</p>
<p>7. When the uninstall has completed restart the computer</p>
<p>8. Download and install the latest version of Adobe flash player</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads</a></p>
<p>9. Run the downloaded full feature software to reinstall the printer</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixed the issue. If not post back with any new details and we will continue from there.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Best of luck,</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            FOLDERS, FILES, &#38; SETTINGS MISSING AFTER WINDOWS 10 UPDATE</h2>
                    <p><strong>I just updated my laptop to Windows 10 Fall Creators Update.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After my computer restarted I have found the following problems;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. My settings appear to have went back to default i.e. taskbar position, icons on desktop, programs pinned to taskbar, etc. gone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. A file folder on my desktop with various files missing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Approximately half my apps missing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. At least one program (Amazon Kindle FWIW) missing that I've found so far.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Documents, Photos, Music, Video files missing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Email settings including contacts, calendar, etc. missing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I tried doing a system restore but all my restore points prior to the update are gone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do I go about getting the above back?</strong></p>

<p>I am the original poster.<br />
<br />
The first advice was to try the rollback function in System Update. &nbsp;That did not work for me as it appeared that one of my profiles got corrupted.<br />
<br />
That second reply gave me this link;<br />
<br />
https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10<br />
<br />
Which unFUBARED my profile(s) and allowed me to do a rollback (YMMV) and restored all my missing files, programs, and apps.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it will work for you or not, good luck. :=)<br />
<br />
Since then I updated my Desktop with no issues but I have not tried updating my Laptop again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck</p>

            <p>If your gmail email address is your Microsoft Account username, it isn't actually going to receive incoming email by default.&nbsp; For example, you could go to
<a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a> and login with your Microsoft Account (your gmail address), but there'd be no email there because the email is really going into the Google website.&nbsp; So there's one more step you need to take to get your
 gmail emails flowing into it, and you options for how to do it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Setup your Microsoft account to "pull in" your gmail emails</strong><br />
This method sets it up so that the Microsoft Account connects to Gmail, downloads the email, and then displays them on your Windows 8 computer.&nbsp; You do this one-time setup from inside Outlook.com.&nbsp; I wrote about how to do it
<a href="http://cmdrkeene.com/use-pop-email-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">on my blog here</a> (I wrote it for a different purpose, but the steps are identical).<br />
<br />
If you do this step, you might also want to remove your Google account from your phone and setup your phone to sync with Outlook.com instead.&nbsp; You'll still get and send email using your Gmail address, it just uses Outlook as the server.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Add your gmail account to Windows 8 Mail App separately</strong><br />
This option is easier to setup, but I don't like it personally (just because of how Gmail behaves a little different). But there's no problem with it.&nbsp; I wrote about how to do this also with a video demo:
<a href="http://cmdrkeene.com/using-gmail-in-windows-8-mail-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use Gmail in Windows 8</a>.<br />
<br />
If you use this option, go to your Mail app settings and uncheck the "Email" box from your Microsoft Account (the first listed email account) so that you don't have two accounts showing in your Mail app.</li></ol>

<p>Thanks Rolando, for your helpful and speedy reply and that does provide some sort of solution.</p>
<p>However, I was looking to restore the use of the 3 digit ASCII character set from the keyboard, assuming there would be a tweak in the registry setting or elsewhere in 'settings'.</p>
<p>On my 'tower' PC, running Windows 10 and Office 2016, I can use that 3 digit set from the keyboard.</p>
<p>For example:&nbsp; </p>
<p>Alt-130 é on the 'tower' PC, on the notebook computer shows the <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
�</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>(</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>REPLACEMENT
 CHARACTER). </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>This
 notebook is of<span style="color: rgba(0, 118, 0, 1)"> </span></span></span></span>Chinese origin, GoBook N1410, supplied in October 2017 and it was displaying 'correctly' until I performed a new Win 10 install. I did that because the version as supplied failed to validate
 after the big update of September 2018 and I was unable to contact the supplier to help me..</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be no problem to learn the 4 digit equivalents, e.g. Alt-0233 é but was hoping I could continue using the 3 digit set across my devices.</p>
<p>Thanks again, Malcolm</p>
<p>

            I don´t know why it does not work, ascii is an international standard.
<br />
<br />There should not be any difference between languages.

<p>It is the characters in the extended set, 128 to 254 as in this table - these were working fine in Office suite on the notebook from China until I replaced the operating system with the Autumn 2018 update, replaced because the installed operating system
 would not validate the update. These characters work fine on my 'tower' PC which also has on latest Win 10 and Office suite (and on previous PCs I've used across the years in a workplace evironment before my recent retirement):-</p>

<p>As I say, it is no 'big deal' but just thought someone would have a tweak I can use in the registry or some other setting. Thanks Malcolm</p>

<p>I suspect that the table you use was created for DOS. Since DOS has been dead for some 30 years, you now need to switch to the Windows code table. It is vastly richer than the extended ASCII set but it requires the extra leading 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on your settings, you might still get away with Alt+130 if you first turn on NumLock.</p>

<h2>            Some websites won&#39;t load properly on any the browsers on my PC &#40;windows 10&#41; inspite of them working other PCs with the same windows version.</h2>
                    <p>Some websites (e.g. airtable.com, spacetable.spacegene.com) don't seem to load properly after I login. The websites load perfectly fine until I login. I tried logging in from chrome, firefox and microsoft edge and the three of them have the same problem.
 I even tried installing the Airtable app (one of the websites that won't load) but even the app wouldn't load properly after it was installed. putting in mind that these website load perfectly fine from different PCs with the same Windows version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>here's a list of the tings I tried to spare your time:</p>
<p>- trying different browsers</p>
<p>- trying different networks</p>
<p>- clearing cache and browsing history from the browsers</p>
<p>- performing cleanboot (one of the sites started working after I performed the clean boot but a few days later it stopped again)</p>
<p>- turned off the firewall</p>
<p>- checked the websites blocked by the windows and the urls written weren't the ones I'm trying to load.</p>
<p>- changed the DNS server address&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clarify this for us. Has it always been like this before? When did the issue start happening? What changes have been made to your device since then? If this only happened recently, I suggest that you revert any changes that you did so we can isolate the
 issue. Also, if you recently installed any software, temporarily uninstall it and check if it will make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we might need you perform a repair upgrade. This should refresh your Windows operating system while keeping your personal files. One of our MVPs, Andre Da Costa, created a detailed

I am using a Panasonic Kx mb2030 network printer. While accessing the printer through network it is asking password.<br />

Kindly update me, what will be the default password to access the specified printer.<br />

            What version of Windows, including service pack, is on the computer you are using to access the printer?<br />
<br />
To what is the KX MB2030 physically connected -- another computer (with what version of Windows); a router; something else?<br />

Have you ever been able to use this printer before?&nbsp; If so, what changed?<br />

            Please answer the questions.<br />
<br />
There is no "default password."<br />
<br />
If this printer is on a corporate/business network, ask your network administrator or supervisor for help.<br />

            Hi ReyL88 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM Windows 7 licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on a Retail Windows 7 licence, if so that inherits the Retail status and does have transfer rights . . .

            Hi Rey.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Once you upgraded it uses a Digital License which can be moved to new hardware following this procedure:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />If you sign in to the new hardware with your MS Account and had previously used a MS account on the other PC, you can run the Activation Troubleshooter to move the license.  If all else is correct it will even offer an exception to allow OEM licenses to move to new hardware which was not possible in the past.
<br />
<br />So it is worth trying and if that fails contact Microsoft Support by one of these methods:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

Is your Windows 10 licence based on a Retail Windows 7 licence, if so that inherits the Retail status and does have transfer rights . . .

<p>It was an OEM Windows 7 license (since I was building the entire thing from scratch) but I bought the OEM version of the license (not the full retail). Where does that leave me?</p>

</p><blockquote>Hi Rey. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />
Once you upgraded it uses a Digital License which can be moved to new hardware following this procedure:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a> <br />
<br />
If you sign in to the new hardware with your MS Account and had previously used a MS account on the other PC, you can run the Activation Troubleshooter to move the license. If all else is correct it will even offer an exception to allow OEM licenses to move
 to new hardware which was not possible in the past. <br />
<br />
So it is worth trying and if that fails contact Microsoft Support by one of these methods:

<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks Greg. I'll try that and let you know what happens. The new components are not here yet but I think it'll get here this weekend or Tuesday at the latest.</p>

            Hi ReyL88
<br />
<br />The general rule is that an OEM licence is non-transferrable, you can however, after moving Windows 10 if you wish, try your luck with Microsoft Support and see if they are willing to give you a one-time exemption to transfer your Windows 10 licence . . .

<p>To expand on Dave's reply ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of issues to consider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your original Windows 7 disk.&nbsp; What you need is a retail license, with a "FPP" code on the product key sticker.&nbsp; Retail licenses include transfer rights. BUT, many people are "tricked" into buying a cheaper "OEM" type license.&nbsp; This type of license
 is not intended for sale to the end user (like you). It is cheaper because one of the license terms limits it to the original computer hardware only. No transfer rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, MS has officially ended the "free upgrade" from Windows 7 to Windows 10 offer. In theory, your "free upgrade" inherited the license rights from your Windows 7 license. So if you have a retail license you should be allowed to transfer it to a new computer.
 I just don't know the mechanics.&nbsp; Product Keys are version specific, so your Windows 7 key should only work to activate a new Windows 7installation.&nbsp; I don't know how you would go about getting the Windows 10 license transferred to your new computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This article says that you can use the Windows 7 retail product key to activate a Windows 10 installation on a new computer, provided the old computer is no longer usable (this is usually a reliable source, so follow their instructions)</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is some documentation from MS, but it does not appear to address your specific situation</p>

<p>The new build is up and running. Activation troubleshooter did not work with the code that I pulled off the hard drive. Called Micorsoft as suggested above, after trying a bunch of stuff, and finally locating the original windows 7 cd, the key from the windows
 7 cd worked. The new build looks and feels just like the old one, just a little extra spring in the step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions and information, it was really helpful to try them out and learn a little bit about activation and licensing. &nbsp;Helped me speak with some knowledge when i did call Microsoft. And the tech support person was great to work with, i
 made sure to complete the survey at the end.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            procedure entry point e could not be located in the dynamic link library SHLWAPI.dll</h2>
                    I just installed Windows Vista 64 bit on my Biostar duo core 2 machine that I had it on a while back. The DVD is clean with no scratches and took twice to load properly. I just installed a new DVD RAM and disconnected an older CD ROM. All minimum specs
 met for Vista. It finally loaded on second attempt but when finalizing Windows programs such as Mail and IE this message showed up.<br />
The procedure entry point e could not be located in the dynamic link library SHLWAPI.dll<br />
I tried to install the motherboard drivers CD and it shows the same message. This is the same machine I had this Vista loaded on for 18 months and had to reload due to issues and switched back to XP for 5 months, then installed the new DVDRAM and tried again.
 I have ran exhaustive diagnostics on all hardware and memory, as well as cleaned the computer of dust.

<p><span>Hi Bleweys,
</span></p>
<p><span>Seems like missing DLL file or
</span><span>missing
</span><span>link between the Dynamic link Library &amp; registry entry.For replacing the missing Dll files please go ahead and run the scan by following the simple steps below using the
<strong>System File Checker</strong> tool and check if it does the trick.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>
 You will have to insert the Vista DVD to perform the scan.</span></p>
<p><span>To run System File Checker with the /<strong>scannow</strong> parameter, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, and then click Run.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Open box, type cmd, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt, type sfc /scannow, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>Using &nbsp;<strong>System File Checke</strong>r with the /<strong>scannow</strong> parameter to immediately scan
 and verify the versions of all the system files that Windows File Protection helps protect. If System File Checker discovers that such a file was overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the cache folder (<strong><em>Systemroot</em>\System32\Dllcache</strong>)
 or from the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the cache folder. You must be logged on as an administrator or as a member of the Administrators group to run
<strong>System File Checker</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>All the Best...!!!</span></p>

                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are having issues connecting to Wifi on a brand new Asus F555L laptop. It will connect via wifi every now and then and will work fine. Most times it will come up as Limited Network/No Internet.&nbsp; The wifi adapter is a Qualcomm Atheros AR9485 Wireless Network&nbsp;Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried uninstalling/reinstalling the drivers and updated the drivers to make sure it was the lastest version. This seemed to work for about a week and now the issue has reappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what else we can try to fix this?</p>

            <p><strong><span>Hi</span></strong><strong><span>,</span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the security software installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Teredo is a tunneling protocol designed to grant IPv6 connectivity to nodes that are located behind IPv6-unaware NAT (Network address translation) devices. It defines a way of encapsulating IPv6 packets within IPv4 UDP (User Datagram Protocol) datagram
 that can be routed through NAT devices and on the IPv4 internet. </span></p>
<p><span>Teredo is installed by default and enabled so that it remains in a standby mode and comes into action only when required. This is typically when you install an application that needs Teredo to function properly. The main problem with Teredo is that
 it involves a bit of heavy-duty work, and if it is switched on unnecessarily, it might slow down your network connection. In addition, as there is no way to uninstall this default application – you can only disable it. However, try to update the driver for
 Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adaptor:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Update the driver for Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adaptor</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.</span><span>‌</span><span><br />
</span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
</span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Look for Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-Interface, right click on it and select ‘Update Driver Software’<br />
</span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Browse my computer for driver software, then select ‘Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer’.<br />
</span><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Reboot the computer and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Disable and Re-enable IPV6</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try uninstalling IPv6 on all interfaces. To remove IPv6, </span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;Click on Start and type in Network and Sharing Center.<br />
b.&nbsp;Select Local Area Network <br />
c.&nbsp;Go into the properties for each network adapter.<br />
d.&nbsp;Either uncheck the box next to the protocol "Internet Protocol version 6(TCP/IPv6), that will disable it, or select it and click uninstall, which will remove it off the computer.<br />
e.&nbsp;Restart the computer.<br />
<strong><span>NOTE: </span></strong>You should do this for each network connection.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Re-enable the IPV6 </span></strong></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;Click on Start and type in Network and Sharing Center.<br />
b.&nbsp;Select Local Area Network.<br />
c.&nbsp;Go into the properties for each network adapter.<br />
d.&nbsp;Place a Check mark or select Install and install the IPV6.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span> <br />
If any third party anti-virus is installed, try disabling the same and check if that helps. If you are able to join workgroup then you might need to uninstall and reinstall the software.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: <span>
Make sure to enable those security software's on the computer after checking.</span></span></p>
