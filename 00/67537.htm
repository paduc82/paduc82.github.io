<h2>            Bootcamped Windows10&#58; Blutooth ARTECK HB030B Keyboard Issues</h2>
                    <p>Summary: My blutooth ARTECK HB030B Keyboard stopped working suddenly two days ago and I've spent yesterday and today trying to fix it. I have neither dropped nor damaged it, I've tried the usual restarting everything, and also the tips from a similar post
 (See below). My issue is that I am on a Boot-camped Macbook Pro I think. The keyboard connects just fine to the mac side and my phone but will not connect to windows; it will even connect long enough to let me hold the ALT key, that allows me to boot to windows,
 but immediately turns off then doesn't allow me to connect it under any circumstances; This tells me the problem is with my computer and drivers, not the keyboard. I have tried updating drivers, and I've tried restoring an older version, and nothing... SPECIFICALLY:
 the Keyboard will appear under "Add Blutooth device " about 1/3 of the time then connect endlessly despite hours of waiting.</p>
<p><br />
I am willing to try things Ive done before, but with more certainty that this is the proper way to fix my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Previously I have had this issue and it was solved almost by magic when one day I decided to be stubborn and try it again; to my surprise it worked and I thought: wow, the try again button sometimes actually works (except there was no try again button)...
 Last time I spent at least four hours a day for like three or four days trying to fix this issue, now I am scared as to why this happened, and how to fix and prevent it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems it was sudden, meaning there was no update until I told my computer to update due to me thinking that I needed to update the drivers.<br />
<br />
I am using another temporary keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried restoring to a previous system driver state according to this article: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/bluetooth-keyboard-not-connecting-after-latest/9b92f3d6-aae0-471f-8653-572fcc7ff1e0</p>

            I tried to do exactly what you said, I even took a screenshot to send you (See Below) but it still did not work. After a while of me talking with my family my computer randomly restarted, and when I tried to connect the ARTECK HB030B on launch, and though
 I reached the bootcamp screen with the other keyboard, and was able to maneuver with the ARTECK; (this is normal, as in I've tried it before). Before hitting enter with the other keyboard plugged in, I removed it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Much to my surprise, despite remembering that I've tried this before, (I may be wrong and not have tried it), it is still working and I am typing from it now.<br />
<br />
My only question is a big one: how did this connect again despite your suggested fixes not working (apparently) right after?<br />
<br />
In any case, thank you. Can I post further if this happens again?<br />

<h2>            Touch Screen not working with Windows 8 Acer&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I just got a new Acer touch screen computer, and the touch screen worked fine after a day... it stopped responding when I touch it! I have no idea what happened. But I'm really frustrated right now because my computer was REALLY expensive. Please help!

    <title>Windows 10 RAM upgrade procedure&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan ayres  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 RAM upgrade procedure&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've upgraded an older Acer Aspire Z3731-UR21P from Windows 7 (x64) to Windows 10 via the Internet. &nbsp;It has only 4GB of RAM physically installed. &nbsp;Under Windows 7 (x64) I have tried three times to add another 4GB of RAM, accumulating "orphan" chips in the
 process, even though the dealer/distributors of the chips claimed compatibility. &nbsp;Obviously, there is some "issue" with the sequence needed to upgrade and register new memory in the BIOS of this device. &nbsp;Most modern RAM is "faster" than what was used by Acer
 in its' original construction. &nbsp;I have not tried replacing the entire bank &nbsp;of 2gb chips with matching new chips because I have not actually had them in hand for testing purposes, but... I'm about to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone confronted an issue like this? &nbsp;What preparations within Windows 10, its' associated security settings, etc. should be followed to insure that if the BIOS recognizes the chips, the operating system will? &nbsp;Is there a "hardware guidance step or
 two" issue within the typical BIOS menus from 2010-11-12 era BIOS menus which might insure that the hardware accepts and properly re-times itself to use a bank of physically compatible, but actually faster RAM? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in the day, I built a Thompson Big Board CP/M kit. &nbsp;At the time 2.2 Mhz RAM was all you could get. &nbsp;When 4Mhz was available, I was able to re-code the timing loop in the BIOS, and upgrade it in the EPROM that was used by the kit, so that when I soldered
 64K of new chips on board, I was able to take advantage of the speed increase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would think that a modern BIOS architect would anticipate this issue and support a way of "testing" newly installed chips before setting the clock for them. &nbsp;If a computer BIOS can do this, are there "issues" in Windows 10 that might interfere due to
 paranoid thinking about hacking built in?</p>

            <p>You do not have to do anything whatsoever to Windows for a change of RAM except for 32bit being limited to around 3.2GB. As you are already on x64 that does not apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows manages RAM dynamically and configures itself to the available memory each time it boots. The one exception is if you have made changes to the Virtual Memory settings but as avoiding changing this from the recommended option of Let Windows Manage
 These Settings is by far the best you shouldn't have to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything you express concern about is entirely hardware related and has nothing to do with Windows unless the computer won't boot at all. The BIOS (UEFI or Legacy) will tune itself to the requirements of the memory as defined by the Serial Presence Detect
 chip built into the DIMM ( a small 8 leg IC normally in one corner). If those requirements cannot be met then either the bank gets locked out or the system will not boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS does not "test" the RAM, it in the 1st place gets told what settings to use by the chip. There is no upgrade "sequence", if it is compatible it works, if not it doesn't. RAM is initialised every time the computer starts and about the limit of stored
 parameters within the BIOS settings is its size, a few BIOS report when it detects a change in the amount of RAM and requires going into BIOS setup to register it.&nbsp;If it supports overclocking then it may go through a check routine to make sure it can&nbsp;operate
 any user setting values and reset back to default if boot fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acer will have issued a memory compatibility table with the motherboard release, the problem with that is they are seldom updated as memory listed becomes unavailable and new memory gets produced. The alternative is to go to one of the better memory suppliers
 such at Crucial or KIngston who certify the memory they produce as compatible based on the motherboard spec (they do not physically test each motherboard/memory combination).&nbsp;Most motherboard manufacturers and memory supplier recommend installing memory in
 pairs if not a complete matched set with the accusation that they want to sell more but as you are finding mixed sourcing does cause problems.</p>

 and it displayed the computer's key on the screen. I typed this in, and it did not work. we couldn't even get the key&nbsp;<em>printed on the back sticker&nbsp;</em>to function, it just said there was an error in your request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help, we are getting desperate. I will be able o get a summer job for the first time over the summer and i do not want to waste it on buying a new computer!</p>

<p>If 7 came preinstall key finder programs will not find a useable key to reinstall.</p>
<p>You need the key on the COA sticker.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I do NOT want to see the product key or the COA sticker.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to do is reinstall the same edition of Windows that is on the COA sticker that will match that product key on the COA sticker.</p>

<h2>            Tried to do windows 10 fresh start, now my computer wont start</h2>
                    <p>Hey so I tried to use the windows 10 fresh start tool (https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10startfresh). The tool finished downloading and it restarted my computer a few times, but after a while, the computer turned on, but nothing
 would show up on my screen. I googled it and everything I saw said that there should be something on my screen, so I turned off my computer and turned it back on again. The computer is on, but there is nothing on my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many things, including taking out the power cord and peripherals, checking the cables connecting my monitors, and making sure everything else is working correctly. When I turn the computer on I hear a single beep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much if anyone can help.</p>

            Hi Re.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Why do you have paging files on all of your partitions on the disk?  I would remove them from all but C as this is unusual and could be problematic:  <a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/disable-move-windows-paging-file/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/disable-move-wi...</a>
<br />
<br />You would also not be able to convert MBR to GPT in this case because it requires a separate EFI System partition of at least 100mb which is hard to construct and then write the needed boot files when it doesn't match the original layout.  If you're still wanting to try then I would follow only the MVP guided solution here:  <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/convert-mbr-to-gpt-disk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/convert-mbr-to-g...</a>
<br />
<br />The correct way to convert is during a reinstall, booting the media created only by Media Creation tool as a UEFI device, deleting all partitions down to Unallocated Space to clear the MBR formatting, then click Next to let it auto-create and format the needed partitions and begin - this makes it foolproof.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello, I am having the same issue as you are...&amp; beyond frustrated now after hours of trying to Sign-in to Xbox Live profile with no luck! As with you my Internet, Network, &amp; XBOX Live shows they‚Äôre all connected &amp; also shows a Service Alert but doesn‚Äôt
 state what the reason is or how to fix the issue. When I attempted to access my Hulu app it notified me that I needed to sign-in to my Xbox Live Profile, yet it shows in Network Settings that I‚Äôm connected to Xbox Live. Any clue what I‚Äôm doing wrong &amp; how
 I can fix it so I can finally access my Hulu App &amp; hopefully relax &amp; get back to ENJOYING MY XBOX CONSOLE instead of wanting to Destory it????

            After trying the solutions that the others have provided and still finding the same issue you might see if there is a hardware issue and need to send your console for servicing.

            Hi Walter!<br /><br />‚ÄúTry to reset all Skype settings.<br />Quit Skype or use Windows Task Manager to kill any Skype.exe process. Go to Windows Start and in the Search/Run box type %appdata% and then press Enter or click the OK button. The Windows File Explorer will pop up. There locate a folder named ‚ÄúSkype‚Äù. Rename this folder to something different, e.g. Skype_old.<br /> <br />Next go to Windows Start and in the Search/Run box type %temp% and then press Enter or click the OK button. Delete the DbTemp folder.<br /> <br />Restart Skype.‚Äù<br /><br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_win10-skype_startms-skype_signms/cannot-open-my-skype-with-new-update-says-we-cant/dc20b11d-2c2f-4d26-8b3b-4f93d81479ef">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum...</a>

<h2>            I can&#39;t connect to a 32-bit shared printer from my Win7 64-bit &#33;</h2>
                    I'm running Win2003 server (32-bit) and sharing a Lexmark printer.<br />
I can't connect my 64-bit Win7 Pro client to the printer. I know the share is OK and my rights are fine because I can print from WinXP clients using the same login. How the heck can I get this to work other than by connecting the printer directly to the Win7
 client and thus leaving my WinXP clients out of luck?<br />
Any help would be appreciated.

            This works fine here, 2k3 32-bit with print queue (share in your post) Win7 64-bit prints to that queue. More - 2k3 has 64-bit additional drivers (printer properties, sharing, additional drivers button) installed.<br />
<br />
What I think will work for you (since your printer doesn't have network interface) is this:<br />
<br />
1. Connect printer directly to your Win7 computer, install drivers (note where they are installed), make sure you can print.<br />
2. Move printer back to your 2k3 server.<br />
3. In Win7 start add new printer Wizard and point to print queue off your 2k3 server, you will be asked if you want to install new drivers or keep old, choose later.<br />
4. Delete printer created in step 1.<br />
<br />
Now this last part is a bit tricky and I'm doing it from the top of my head.<br />
5. Map root of your Win7 systemdrive (usually $C:) from your 2k3 server. On 2k3, go to printer properties, sharing, additional drivers and tick x64 and you will be asked for source - point this to where the drivers are on Win7. (or you can supply 2k3 CD, if
 you don't care much for version of drivers).<br />

<h2>            Weird fonts in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have little bit weird problem on my computer. I have 2 laptops - older Lenovo G50-30 and new one Lenovo IdeaPad 300. Both 15' and 1366x768 resolution. On new one laptop i have problem with weird fonts. It's looking more sharp and "weird". On older laptop
 everything is ok. I don't know what's matter and why it's looking that. I have new drivers for graphic card and also launched cleartype option. There is also no zoom on computer - it's 100% showing. Anyone have any idea what is the source of my problems?</p>

<p>Hello Adi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to provide you the possible resolution and the accurate information as to why the fonts on your laptops look different even if they both have the same resolution, we suggest that you check your laptops' Screen refresh rate and see if they have the
 same value. To do so, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Right-click on an empty space on your desktop and click on <strong>Display settings</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Go to <strong>Display adapter properties</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04184a37-fec5-4b46-b8b1-3bc77e08802b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04184a37-fec5-4b46-b8b1-3bc77e08802b" height="521" width="594" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under the <strong>Monitor</strong> tab, you will see <strong>Screen refresh rate</strong>. Check if the value on both of your laptops are the same.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several factors why you encountered this error. One possible cause of it is outdated drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes in your computer?</li><li>Have you tried asking the manufacturer if the application is compatible with Windows 10?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

            <p>Hi Rose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a new notebook, that has everything up to date. I did try something more like:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>-reinstall graphic driver, because i have a problem with run Relux with chosen GPU:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f79c517b-f049-425e-9c01-b53684916e8e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f79c517b-f049-425e-9c01-b53684916e8e" height="120" width="285" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, my account has a administrator privileges, and this problem occurs only with Relux...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>-reinstalled all microsoft redistributable (x86 and x64). </strong></p>
<p><strong>-perform clean start of windows, </strong>I switched off all services witch are not related to Windows. I switched off antyvirus Panda and Comodo Firewall (with service).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relux folder contain two files: RlxCalculator_x64.exe and RlxCalculator.ece, I tried swap that files by renamed RlxCalculator.ece to x64 extension, but the problem is still exist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is new, and I'm sure everything with it should be ok,residue software works fine.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i found the answer whats going on. The problem is Comodo Firewall 10. But what is very interesting, even if i performed clear start, without any process of software ( external form external distributors) Relux has blocked by Comodo, how? I'm not sure, but
 help me unisntallation Comodo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course ii deinstaled Comodo only for test, now i try to unlock Relux, ReluxCalc and Codemeter in Firewall but he is still block my calulcation process...</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>i found the solution. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem was generated by communication between two files - RlxCalculator_x64.exe and werfault.exe. To fix it you should set in Comodo, RlxCalculator.exe as<em> Contained App,
</em>not as Windows allowed app or Allowed app!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Permissions for Relux.exe, Codemeter are meaningless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why, but this settings works fine and now i can do calculations without errors.

<h2>            Comprare Xbox One dall&#38;&#35;39&#59;Australia</h2>
                    
<p>Salve Community,</p>
<p>se mio fratello compra una XboxOne dall'Australia, viste le offerte interessanti, e la porta poi qui in Italia, possiamo usarla senza problemi? Anche l'online non avr√† alcun tipo di problema anche se √® stata comprata in un'altro paese? E per i giochi?<br />
<br />
p.s. vi prego di non soffermarvi sul particolare del viaggio in Australia e dei suoi costi, e di concentrarvi sulla compatibilit√† della console comprata all'estero, fuori dal territorio europeo.</p>
<p>Grazie buona giornata</p>

<p>Sorry, but your message is very confusing, and I don't understand it.</p>
<p>NTFS is a file system, and either your external drive is all NTFS or<br />
not. The backup can't be NTFS and everything else FAT32. <br />
NTFS is a file system that Windows XP can read without a problem.<br />
Whether One Care is installed or not has nothing to do with whether<br />
you can access a file on an NTFS drive.</p>
<p>I know next to nothing about One Care, but your saying that an<br />
anti-virus program backed up your files sounds very strange. Are you<br />
sure that's correct? Anti-virus programs don't normally do any<br />
backups.</p>
<p>What are the names of these backup files? In particular, what are<br />
their extensions (the part of the file name after the dot at the end)?</p>
<p>How have you tried to open them? What happens when you try? If you get<br />
an error message, please quote it verbatim.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 DVD player lost after refresh - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 DVD player lost after refresh</h2>
                    <p>Following my upgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro with media center I downloaded the DVD player app and was able to play commercial DVDs on my Windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I completed a fresh install of windows 10 and lost the "right" to install the DVD player download.&nbsp; Frustrated with this, as my wife needs to use the player&nbsp;in her job, I paid for the DVD player at over ¬£11.&nbsp; I shouldn't have had to pay for this
 again but I didn't have time to complain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three months down the line I need to re-install the OS and guess what I have no DVD player again!&nbsp; There is no way I can see to retrieve the previous purchase and so, in desperation I bought it again - so I spent ¬£23 plus so far.&nbsp; I am not going to do that
 again - I would like MS to restore my facility to play DVDs on my laptop.&nbsp; I paid for the media centre upgrade in windows 8, then for 2 subsequent app downloads and now I have none of them..</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very poor service in my opinion - it seems a petty issue for Microsoft to hold back on providing such a basic facility&nbsp;to its customers for such a small outlay on their part. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to get my DVD player back...?</p>

            So, according to the link you refer to I will have to uninstall Windows 10, re-install my previous Windows version and then go through the upgrade process all over again?&nbsp; Why is the DVD entitlement not&nbsp;added into the machine profile during the activation
 process?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you gone through the link mentioned by Jessen you must have read the <strong>
point number 8 which states</strong>: </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The free Windows DVD Player app is tied to your Windows 7 or Windows 8 Pro installation, so any action that reinstalls Windows over the top of an existing Windows 10 installation will break this tie and remove the free Windows DVD Player app. To recover
 the free app, you‚Äôll have to use your installation media to re-install Windows 7 or Windows 8 Pro + Media Center, and then upgrade to Windows 10.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Apology for the inconvenience but these are some restriction,&nbsp;with this app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do feel free to post on the forum if you have any more concern&nbsp;related to Windows. We will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            installing drivers for lexmark prevail pro705</h2>
                    I just got an HP Laptop with Windows 8.&nbsp; I am trying to install the printer software for the Lexmark Prevail Pro705.&nbsp; When I went to the Lexmark support site, they only had software for Windows 7 and earlier.&nbsp; I tried the Windows 7 version and it didn't
 work.&nbsp; Will this be fixed soon?&nbsp; To be honest, I'm not really happy with the interface already on Windows 8 vs 7.&nbsp; This is just aggravating me further.

            What it should do and actually does are &nbsp;two different things.&nbsp; I am having the same problem with no luck.&nbsp; contacted Lexmark and they wanted to charge me to fix this. contacted windows and they wanted to charge me as well....I&nbsp;had not problems with my
 windows 7 plug and play option but the windows 8 is horrible to say the least!!&nbsp;

            <p>According to the Lexmark website</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lexmark.com/index?segment=SUPPORT&amp;userlocale=EN_US&amp;locale=en&amp;productCode=LEXMARK_PREVAIL_PRO705&amp;page=product&amp;frompage=null#1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lexmark.com/index?segment=SUPPORT&amp;userlocale=EN_US&amp;locale=en&amp;productCode=LEXMARK_PREVAIL_PRO705&amp;page=product&amp;frompage=null#1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 support is provided with the OS. So, it should be possible to plug the printer into power and connect the USB cable to the computer and the printer and have it automatically detect and install the drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know. If the process is failing, let us know details of any error messages and how the system behaves during the process.</p>
