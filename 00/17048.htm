    <title>Blocked Microsoft Office account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carolleej2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blocked Microsoft Office account</h2>
                    <p>My Microsoft Office Professional 2013 has been returned to Microsoft and blocked. &nbsp;I did not return it to Microsoft, nor did I block it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a computer from Dell that was a 4th time replacement (I had a 5 yr hardware warranty with Dell) and this one had Microsoft Office installed on it. &nbsp;It too crashed and I refused to call Dell again and get another replacement computer so I called Microsoft
 and asked them what to do. &nbsp;They told me that if I purchase a support contract with them (I already had one with Dell but it was useless), they would fix my computer and if necessary, if they had to reinstall Windows, they would also install another Office
 for me in view of my situation. &nbsp;I purchased the software agreement on Sept 19, 2013. &nbsp;The computer did have to be re installed (to factory settings) and I did loose my Microsoft Office. &nbsp;But the technician kept his word and installed the one that is now blocked.
 &nbsp;He did not give me the Key number, however. &nbsp; In February of 2014 I needed to know the key because I was having issues with my computer again and thought I should have it in case I needed to re-install Windows again. &nbsp;I opened up a case on Feb. 14, 2014 and
 though it wasn't easy, Microsoft was able to track down the technician who installed my software and they gave me the Key. &nbsp;I have had no trouble since then (I got my key on March 5, 2014) until NOW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a small business owner and in June I decided I would like a way to use my Office on all of my computers for my business,. &nbsp;I tried a free 30 day trial of Microsoft Office 365. &nbsp;It worked fine but I found a cheaper solution with Microsoft 365 Office
 for small business. &nbsp;In the interim, however, before I could even get fully signed up and loaded with Microsoft 365 for Office, I started getting notices that my software was not valid and I need to reactivate my subscription. &nbsp;I knew they were talking about
 the Office 365 Home free trial so I didn't pay it much attention. &nbsp;I continued to ignore those issues, though I did call a couple of times and got transferred 8 times one day and 6 times another, as no one knew why it was doing that, so I decided to live with
 it. &nbsp;But, now they have deactivated it completely and I no longer can download it even with my product key. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After speaking with about 20 people (not exaggerating either) and each time spent at least an hour, sometimes 2 or 3 hours, as I did this morning with a woman on Chat, no one is able to come up with anything except to contact Howtotell.com and say that I
 think my Microsoft is a counterfeit. &nbsp;That just isn't the case and if I say that am I not just slitting my throat a little deeper?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? &nbsp;PLEASE, IN THE NAME OF GOD, PLEASE (I am literally praying) HELP ME. &nbsp;I NEED MY OFFICE RIGHT NOW. &nbsp;I have two website businesses and along with my office went my inventory. &nbsp;PLEASE. PLEASE. HELP ME. &nbsp; Thank you!!! &nbsp;I'm praying. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Maureen, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're experiencing such a frustrating scenario with Facebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to confirm if you're trying to use <strong>Facebook App </strong>
and <strong>Facebook Messenger</strong><strong> app </strong>or <strong>Windows Phone Messaging App</strong><strong>?
</strong>(pictured below from left to right)</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/138929a0-baab-4594-8bba-0f1287712f2b" height="94" width="89" />&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f20e8b74-373d-48fc-abcf-f943ec2ae509" height="95" width="94" />&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c186827-b135-45d2-96dd-d576eaa85818" height="95" width="100" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible to also tell us the version of Windows Phone you're using? If you go to
<strong>settings&nbsp;&gt; about &gt; [more info] </strong>under <strong>OS Version:</strong> you can see if you're using Windows Phone 8.0.xxxx or 8.1.xxxx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using 8.0x.xxx and trying to use the <strong>Messaging app</strong> in Windows Phone, Facebook has made changes to their settings that has broken functionality to this feature. The appropriate one to use is Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p />

    <title>Refering to the same endnote more than once - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ishitagaikwad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refering to the same endnote more than once</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I used the cross reference feature to insert a refernce to an existing endnote (&nbsp;Insert&gt;Reference&gt;Cross-Reference). However, when I click it, it takes me to the first reference within the document and not to the bottom of the document where the actual list
 of endnotes is. Is there a way to make the click take me to the actual endnote in the list of endnotes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>I.</p>

            Inserting a cross-reference to an endnote only ever inserts that cross-reference to the original endnote reference in the document, not to the endnote content. To go to the actual endnote via a cross-reference, you need to click on the cross-reference,
<em>then </em>on the original endnote reference.

            <p>I'm having the same problem right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I insert ENDNOTE to 1st reference, then CROSS-REFERENCE for 2nd and 3rd reference to that same ENDNOTE as the 1st reference; however, clicking on the 2nd and 3rd reference only goes to 1st reference, instead of the ENDNOTE, and clicking on the ENDNOTE only
 goes back to the 1st reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to have it so if the last CLICKED reference, either 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, all goes to ENDNOTE and clicking the ENDNOTE goes back to the last CLICKED reference, either 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, like a footprint track back itself, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know how to do this?</p>

            As I've already said, if you insert a cross-reference to an endnote, clicking on the cross-reference only takes you to the endnote reference, not to the endnote. If you want to go to the endnote, click on the endnote reference.

            <p>Yes, I'm well aware of that. This process is such a double-sided inconvenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we want to to got the endnote itself, you should have specified the "1ST" endnote reference because clicking the "2ND" endnote reference only goes back to the "1ST" endnote reference, yet now here's what you mean by clicking on this "1ST" endnote reference
 will now take you to the endnote itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's like rerouting itself back to "1ST" endnote reference for all the other ones that follow being clickd on that corresponds to that same endnote...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet clicking the actually ENDNOTE at the end itself, will only go back to that "1ST" endnote, and not the other ones that share it...like a pingback track footprint.</p>

            <p>I'm not a licensing expert so I can't say for sure, but as far as I known, uninstalling and reinstalling on the same machine shouldn't use up a license. Even though Word, Excel, and OneNote are able to boot on their own, the web apps use an ActiveX control
 installed with Office to launch the apps. If that control isn't installed or is corrupted, then you would see the error described.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can also happen if you are running the 64-bit version of Office with the 32-bit version of IE (or vice versa). This can also happen if the SharePoint Open Document control is disabled (look in Tools|Manage Add-ons in IE), or if you have all ActiveX
 controls disabled.</p>

<h2>            How long until a deleted email is unrecoverable&#63;</h2>
                    This is regarding the new feature (at least new to me) with hotmail/outlook. After you empty the deleted folder in your email account, you have the ability to recover said deleted emails. I checked on the link where it says learn more about this feature
 but it's only a short blurb about what the feature is/does. What I want to know is how long would it be before emails that I delete become completely unrecoverable from the state of being deleted in my account?

Beyond that won't be possible.<br />
If you don't see the deleted messages that you wanted, it means they are permanently lost.

To<b> try to </b>auto recover your email do the following<br />
1. Sign in to your Hotmail account.<br />
2. Go to your Deleted folder.<br />

<p>Hi Zdenek,</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>The version of the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect (AAD connect) is the newest. The issue should be related to the SAMBA 4.3.3. The Supported Operating System of AAD connect are Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows
 Server 2012 R2. Your system is not supported.</p>
<p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Problem playing .rmvb files on 5800xm</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I bought a 5800xm last week and I figured out that videos which were converted from .avi to .mp4 were huge in size. So I decided to try .rm format which is really compact in size.</p>
<p>The problem is that the files in .rm format play perfectly fine, but the ones in .rmvb do not play properly. While playing .rmvb files, the audio keeps playing but the video moves frame by frame slowly.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what is the difference between .rm and .rmvb??</p>
<p>Also can you suggest a converter to concert .avi files to .rm?</p>
<p>i use Xilisoft converter right now but that has the option of converting files to .rmvb and not .rm.</p>
<p>Also how do i convert videos to wmv 9 format?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rakshith&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>RM</strong> stands for Real Media. Real Media is one of the most popular formats for streaming content on the Internet, RealMedia includes the RealAudio codec for sound clips and RealVideo codec for movies. RealAudio and RealVideo files are often
 given the common RealMedia ".RM" file extension. RealMedia files are often heavily compressed so they can stream over dial-up Internet connections.<br />
<br />
<strong>RMVB</strong> stands for Real Media Variable Bitrate. RMVB is commonly used to contain Real Video 9 and RA (Real Audio).</p>
<p>&nbsp;______________________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is surprising that Xilisoft video converter cant support output for .rmvb... I advise you to try this
<a href="http://convert-video-dvd.com/video-converter.html#135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">best video converter</a>, it supports output .rm and .rmvb from .avi perfectly, and let you edit the video files for high output effect... As for converting videos to wmv, this
 video conversion tool could fix it up easily too.</p>

<p>RM is fixed bitrate</p>
<p>RMVB has variable bitrate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5800 supports both but only to some max resolution and bitrate. I donot know if it will support resolutions above QVGA</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ATP of other user mailboxes doesn‚Äôt provide
<span>coverage to shared mailboxes. </span>Shared mailboxes need to be licensed for ATP. For example:</span></p>
<p><span>A company has five users in Office 365. Each user has a mailbox, and there is one shared mailbox. This company will need a license for:</span></p>
<p><span>¬∑ 6 seats of Exchange Online Protection (5 users + 1 shared mailbox)</span></p>
<p><span>¬∑ 6 seats of Advanced Threat Protection (5 users + 1 shared mailbox)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You need more ATP and Exchange Online licenses for the shared mailbox</span><span>.</span></p>

<p>Attached is an example of the problem. In the first column, there is an extra space at the bottom because the line starting "with the conviction..." has been moved to the second column to keep the hyphenated word together. However, I do not want the extra
 space. I want either the line ended in "...per-" to stay in the first column or not hyphenate "person," but hyphenate the rest of the paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every resource imaginable, with no results. That is why I have come here for assistance.</p>

            Select just the word you want not to be hyphenated and apply the "Do not check spelling or grammar" property from the
<strong>Language</strong> dialog. Disabling proofing also disables hyphenation. If this is a common problem, you may want to define a No Proofing character style that can be applied to single words quickly. See

<p>That solution did stop the hyphenation, and allow a solution. However, it is not automatic, and I have to edit each column at a time. But thank you greatly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The additional problem is, if I Ctrl-A and then deselect "do not check" for the whole document to clear the changes if I have edited text, it does not clear the individual words I chose to ignore. When I go to do this again and again, the box is filled by
 the square as if I changed nothing each time.</p>

<p>Are you also aware that the filled/shaded square may be misleading, in the sense that you often see it for any selection which is large enough (even though formatting is the same throughout the selection)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you select a single word,&nbsp;"Do not check spelling or grammar" should be correctly checked, cleared or&nbsp;shaded, though.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All&nbsp;I can think of is that "Do not check spelling or grammar" may be "expanded" during typing the same way other attributes (such as bold or italics) might be. You may already have considered that possibility, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A long-term solution is to apply "Do not check spelling or grammar" formatting via a character style. That will give you more control over formatting.</p>

<h2>            Secondary school teacher UK - eligible for discount on Office 365&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having researched this, I thought I was eligible for the ¬£59.99 4-year license on Office 365 as a secondary school teacher in the UK. However, when I try to purchase it, it seems set up primarily for students. One purchasing option asks me to enter my academic
 institution name, but the list seems to consist only of universities, and when I try the manual eligibilty option, the only acceptable eligibility info seems to relate to students - student ID, etc. Does anyone know if I AM eligible and, if so, how I go about
 buying this software?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks indeed for your help and advice.</p>

 in every way. <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/reader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/reader/</a>&nbsp; Just do a custom install and watch for the optional toolbars and junk that come with the free version.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue you're experiencing with sending emails might be due to a variety of reasons, and that is what we are going to find out. To help us identify the cause of this issue, we would need to know the following information:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build, version and edition of Windows is installed on your laptop?<br />
</li><li>Are you using Outlook.com or the Outlook app to send the emails?</li><li>If you are using Outlook.com, are you experiencing the same issue even when using other web browsers?
</li><li>If you are using the Outlook app, which version of Outlook are you using?</li><li>Are you experiencing the same issue with all of your contacts or the issue is isolated with a specific email address?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response. </p>
        </p>

<p>OK - going to try and reply to your questions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a MacPro laptop, using MacOS Sierra, 10-12-6</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm able to send emails by opening my hotmail account (Outlook) in Safari, but not if I use the icon on the bottom of my screen. &nbsp;I continually get an error message. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm uncertain how to know what version of outlook I have....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message (there are several) generally says that email cannot be sent 'CANNOT SEND MESSAGE USING THE SERVER HOTMAIL. &nbsp;THE SMTP CONNECTION TO SERVER "SMTO-MAIL.COUTLOOK.COM" FAILED. &nbsp;SELECT A DIFFERENT OUTGOING MAIL SERVER FROM THE LIST BELOW......'.
 &nbsp;When prompted to &nbsp;enter password, I receive a message stating that my password needs to be updated. &nbsp;Yet I cannot seem to logon to change it. &nbsp;When I click FORGOT PASSWORD, I get a different error message stating that an error has occurred, and to try again
 later. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've continually attempted to send emails to various people, with the same results. &nbsp;This has been going on for a few weeks. &nbsp; Very anixious to get this resolved. &nbsp;It happened once before and was resolved by the Apple folks, in conjunction with a separate
 issue. &nbsp;I cannot recall how it was solved</p>

<p>However, when I Ctrl+click MICROSOFT OUTLOOK, my options do NOT include MICROSOFT OUTLOOK. There is one entitled MICROSOFT OFFICE 2011, but it does not contain an option SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS</p>

<h3> raymondcastillo27  say:</h3>
<h2>            LinePrinter font</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using MS office 2013 and word viewer 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open my Word Viewer 2003, the font is Times New Roman but when I try to open for editing using MS Word, suddenly the font changes to LinePrint and I find it weird because I don't have LinePrint on my installed fonts so it's quite tedious for me to
 change font everytime wherein I shouldn't be doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone assist me on this matter?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are facing this issue with one file then this issue may occur due to formatting issues with the previous version of Office. Then I would suggest you to copy the text

                    Does the N73 support updating the phone firmware Over The Air? There is an icon in the Tools folder which lets you check if there are any updates, but it has never worked for me. I just want to know if I'm tryng to do something that's not supported, or
 if there is something wrong with the network.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Based on your description, you cannot sign into SharePoint Designer 2013 and encounter the error message: "We are unable to sign you in to Office. Please access your documents through the browser." I would like to suggest you check the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Remove SharePoint Designer 2013 related credentials: Open Control Panel &gt; Credential Manager &gt; Windows Credential &gt; Generic Credentials, then delete any
 items which contains MicrosoftOffice15_Data. Then restart your computer and SharePoint Designer 2013 to sign into SharePoint Designer 2013 with your Office 365 account again.</span></li><li><span>Go to SharePoint Online site, open a library or site in SharePoint Designer.
</span></li></ol>

            Dear surfacepro3userwithoffice,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />If you have added Gmail account as connected account, than depending on the amount of emails it may take a while to sync. However please note, you are not importing emails to your Microsoft Account, you are using Outlook.com to view several accounts at the same time. This means that all of the emails are originally in Gmail.
<br />
<br />If you have syncing issues, please check this article for more suggestions with resolving them <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-connected-accounts-in-outlook-com-a99a1f0b-700d-4b3b-8f9a-28d463ff07f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubl...</a>

<p>i think i misunderstood what adding my gmail would do. I thought i could copy over all my email in this way. i'm only accessing my gmail account through outlook. there is no copying taking place that would allow me to delete all my emails from my gmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the only way to transfer my emails is through some mbox to pst file format converter? You would think they would make it easier to switch from gmail to outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there a way to transfer my emails over without getting a spammer jumping in to this thread and tell me to buy a mbox to pst converter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your time</p>

            Dear surfacepro3userwithoffice, 
<br />
<br />I would advise you to use those two separately as connected accounts. The main reason here is basically storage. You Microsoft Account offers 15gb of free storage but depending on how you are using your email and what for and how much information you have there, you may easily reach your limit. 
<br />
<br />You can check you current storage for Outlook.com here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/storage/mailboxStorage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/s...</a> and also check the storage in Gmail and do rough calculation on how much storage both will take.

<p>
</p><p>2) Since Windows 10, Silverlight Apps have stopped working in VPN. UWP Apps work fine in&nbsp;VPN. Do you acknowledge this as a Bug or instruct the users to search for UWP equivalent of those Apps?</p>

<h2>            Word Document won&#39;t open, I get a file converter box with an encoding list but none of the options will display the text in my document.</h2>
                    I was working on a document the other day in Word 2000 and I completed two pages and saved my work. I didn't close the document when I took a break and I got side tracked and it set on my screen for a few hours. Before I shut down my computer I saved my
 work again and closed. The next morning when I tried to open the document that I had been working on it wouldn't open, and I got a file converter&nbsp;box with an encoding list. Every option I tried&nbsp;in the encoding list had numbers and symbols instead of the text
 that I typed when I previewed them. How do I convert my document back to its original text?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Since you are using Word 2000, I assume you are using DOC format.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Build 10074 Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swaminathanramasubramanian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Build 10074 Installation</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am installing Windows 10 Build 10074 in VMware (7.1.0). After I sign in with my microsoft account during installation, it hangs up at "Just a Moment". The circle spins for a few minutes and it hangs up. I tried it twice still this happens. The hardware
 I have given to the Virtual Machine is,</p>
<p>4 cores of CPU</p>
<p>4GB Ram</p>
<p>60GB Hard Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My host specifications are,</p>
<p>Intel Core i7 4770,</p>
<p>8GB RAM</p>
<p>2TB HDD</p>
<p>
</p><p>How should I install it?</p>
<p>PS: I have already installed and using Build 9926 successfully. I am trying to install Build 10074 in a new VM as fresh install.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Swaminathan</p>

While Hyper-V is a great out of box solution because of its tight integration and robust performance, it does have certain limitations and complexities. In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox. For instance, VirtualBox makes network connections easier, I don't have configure switches and configure Internet sharing especially for wireless networks, it does all of that for me.

<h2>            Add iCloud Tasks to Outlook To-Do List</h2>
                    I've recently used iCloud to sync my iPhone with Outlook. My iCloud tasks have appeared in a separate iCloud Tasks folder. I want these to appear in my To-Do List along with my flagged emails. I've had a good look through all the settings but can't find
 a way to do this. Much appreciated if anyway can let me know how.

            I believe only the tasks in your default Tasks folder can appear in the To Do bar.

    <title>convert .pdf to .jpeg on Windows 10 mobile - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            convert .pdf to .jpeg on Windows 10 mobile</h2>
                    Recently a vendor emailed me a discount coupon in .pdf format. I placed an order over the phone and the vendor asked me to text over the coupon. Fine except that my phone does not allow for texting a .pdf attachment. So here is the simplest way to convert
 the .pdf to photo: screenshot of either Adobe Reader or Edge view of document. Depress Volume Up + Power buttons. Photo lands in Screenshot album as a .gif which is text messaging compatible.

            Use the help of a specialised converter for this purpose. For example, the one called
<a href="https://www.coolutils.com/TotalImageConverter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Total Image Converter</a> will easily deal with it, I guess. I totally recommend you to try it out as I have been using their products for a long time so far, and I am happy with everything
