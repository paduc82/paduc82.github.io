    <title>Outlook 2019 Calendars on To-do bar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2019 Calendars on To-do bar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Does Outlook 2019 still only allow one calendar month on the To_do bar?&nbsp; Microsoft removed the ability to show more than one month in Outlook 2013 and 2016 and was wondering if they might have re-added this capability in 2019. I still use Outlook 2010 for
 this reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Thanks, looks like I will stick with 2010.&nbsp; I have voted for this numerous times as have hundreds of others. Microsoft obviously does not care and there was really no valid reason to remove this feature.

            They are using a 'new' calendar control in it and in the peek and needed 1 calendar for the peek, but I wish they'd go back to the old control, which also supports dropping messages on it to create events on that date. 
<br />
<br />The navigation pane in the calendar still uses the old control - may that never change. :)

<h2>            Emails getting stuck then getting quarantined</h2>
                    I work for a company that has a dispatch team. Each person on the team has access to a shared mailbox that we call the dispatch mailbox. Each person on the team also has their own email that is not shared. There is a specific email with an attachment (not
 too big) that is sent to the dispatch mailbox every morning. This email gets stuck for 2 to 3 hours before being sent. Then, when it gets to the dispatch mailbox, it is put into quarantine. If the same email is sent to a single dispatcher's email it arrives
 immediately in the inbox, not the quarantine. Checked to make sure none of the accounts were working in offline mode. I checked to make sure that none of the accounts had any rules set up. Everything on the computers is up to date (Windows, drivers, software).
 I know that an admin can adjust the spam settings in the exchange admin center and that the changes made will apply to everyone but I don't think that will fix this problem. The shared dispatch email is the only one that has a

<p>Hi Chase Peterson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know did this email was sent out &nbsp;by a single mailbox or different mailboxes. If by single one, can other emails sent out normally in this mailbox? And how many mailboxes would this email send to?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a setting in EAC( Exchange Admin Center) can make emails deliver to different places automatically. To find out what happened, we still need to check it from EAC first. Please check your domain’s SCL( Spam Confidence Level) setting. If the value
 is set up too low, some normal emails may be detected as spam email. About where to check: EAC&gt;Protection on the left pane&gt; spam filter&gt; double click the spam rule&gt; spam and bulk actions&gt; check the action and the SCL value like following picture.</p>
<p>

<h2>            RIP 9860 &#33;</h2>
                    <p>Good riddance to 9860. It was less friendly and more buggy compared to 9841. If 9879 proves to be more stable and speedier than 9841(or 9860), I may stay with it till the final release of Windows 10.

<p>I seriously hope the problems of 9860 are behind us. It was really a drag on the system. I am not complaining as I understand the "Alpha" and "Beta" phases of testing. So far it seems to work with minor hiccups. Certainly took a long time to download and

            <p>We probably are not going to see this release actually take shape until around the Developer Preview next year. Right now, its feed back, apply feed back, rinse and repeat until all three audiences are happy. We are probably gonna see a lot of DCR's until
 Microsoft believes we the consumers are satisfied. The phases right now are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phase 1 - Enterprise/IT Pro&nbsp;(current state right now).</p>
<p>Phase 2 - Consumer (starting early next year)</p>
<p>Phase 3 - Developers (probably by the next Build conference)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then its refine, freeze code and bug fixing until the code is snappy and stable enough where the Windows&nbsp;team feels confident enough to send it to market.

<p>I had few problems with 9860. Installed Preview on new build. Updated to 9879 and the problems started! I have an external soundcard&nbsp; X Fi Go Pro 1200. My USB ports fail to initialize on occasion when I reboot. The card is Win8 ready. No new drivers are
 available. </p>
<p>Second issue is IE 11. I can't type in a URL. Is anyone else experiencing these issues?</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 - From Field Dropdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jshrm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 - From Field Dropdown</h2>
                    I often have to send e-mails on behalf of an address other than my own.&nbsp; In Outlook 2010 the From Field has a dropdown menu.&nbsp; In Outlook 2007 I was able to type the address in, just as you can type in the To field, which is much, much quicker.&nbsp; How can
 I get rid of the dropdown box and go back to being able to just type in the address I need in the From field?<br />
<br />
For reference, this screenshot is the functionality seen in Outlook 2007 (and how I want Outlook 2010 to operate): http://i.imgur.com/yk0Tm.png<br />
<br />
This screenshot shows the functionality seen in Outlook 2010: http://i.imgur.com/wUs0k.png<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Technical Preview help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewschoeman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview help</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Andrew, I have downloaded the software on my primary laptop with the intention of creating a bootable USB drive for another system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded it no problem. The problem lies in that I cannot put&nbsp;the Technical preview ISO file&nbsp;on my flash drive using either Rufus 1.4.10 (<a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a>)&nbsp;by Akeo Consulting&nbsp;or the Windows 7USB/DVD Download Tool
 (<a href="http://wudt.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wudt.codeplex.com/</a>)&nbsp;that was recommended. At "Create a Bootable Disk Using", the button on the&nbsp;far&nbsp;right hand side will let me browse for the file; this also is no problem. It's when I find it, select the file,
 then try to open it, it doesn't let me select it--rather, when I click "Open" on the navigation (or browse) pop-up&nbsp;window, it opens it as a folder, which is not as it should. It should, after selecting the Technical Preview ISO file,&nbsp;and pressing open on the
 browse screen, go back to Rufus and say that it has been&nbsp;selected and it's ready to start, right? But it doesn't. Can anyone help? Am I doing something wrong? Running x64 bit Windows 8.1 Update 1 on an Acer Aspire V5-552P-8646<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1d12581-cdad-4750-9662-986b9c78ae65" /></p>

<p>I know a clean install would work and I usually recommend it myself. I was just trying to avoid reinstalling&nbsp;all my programs. It is a very full computer 😓 the upgrades worked very well on my tm2 and Miix 2 8 sigh. Thanks for your reply though.</p>

<p>If you still want to try a workaround, try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a 'Command Prompt' window by right clicking on Command Prompt found under Start Menu, all Apps, Windows System folder all the way at the bottom.&nbsp; Select 'Run as Administrator'.</p>
<p>Type the following command followed by the 'Enter' key.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>"dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth" (note that there is a single space after each section's last letter&nbsp;of the command and the following slash mark).&nbsp; Verify you entered it correctly, then hit the 'Enter key'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you do, it may take minutes to complete, but it will tell you.&nbsp; Wait for it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it finishes the operation it will report back.&nbsp; Regardless, at the Command Prompt, type this new command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth" Verify you entered it correctly with a space after the last letter in each section of the command line as before, then hit the 'Enter' key again.&nbsp; It'll go to work.&nbsp; It takes some time.&nbsp; At the end when it
 reports back to you, you should have a restored uncorrupted set of W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the Command Prompt type "Exit' and hit enter.&nbsp; Voila!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you should be good to go.&nbsp; If not, reply back.</p>

<p>Okay.&nbsp; It was worth the try.&nbsp; Did the operations run properly and&nbsp;at least correct the corrupted files for you?&nbsp; Which version of W10 Pro are you currently running?&nbsp; RTM or an earlier beta?&nbsp; How much room do you have available on a suitable hard drive?&nbsp;
 Would you consider dual boot?&nbsp; Is your mainboard bios dual boot capable or will it require a boot loader?&nbsp;

            <p>They ran smoothly with no problems. I am running the x64 RTM version on this machine from an in place upgrade from the last Windows&nbsp;Technical Preview&nbsp;Pro before RTM. I have 64G free on the&nbsp;SSD. I have run dual boots before and don't really&nbsp;need to go that
 route. I have WMWare Workstation running Windows Vista, 7Pro, 8.1 home,&nbsp;Linux Mint, Ubuntu and OSX Mountain Lion. I can make the BIOS go to non EFI mode if required to dual boot. What I am wondering is WHY?? I can't get this to work without doing a clean install.
 The OS seems to be working fine since I upgraded in July, no serious glitches that I can see (except IE11 crashes every time I use after about 10 minutes or so) I love Edge but it won't run Adblock+ or my Norton Vault :-(</p>
<p>If it won't run this then what happens when the TH2 comes out in November?</p>

<p>Well the last issued 'update' for 10565 (KB3105208)&nbsp;tore a lot of people right off at the ankles that had UEFI bios and secure boot.&nbsp; Went in like butter here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Life with beta's.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; I'm sensing a conflict added after the fact of the RTM install.&nbsp; Right
 now though, the 'INVALID PACKAGE' part of the log is a puzzle too, which is why I suggest the ISO route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to invest the time to try it, the 'Make a DVD from an ISO" route has worked for me in the past when WU threw up and died.&nbsp; I too am a fresh installer as a preference, but hey, I totally understand.&nbsp; Every serious crash took days of re-installation
 and data reload.&nbsp; I get that.&nbsp; I'm packing about 3TB of files and data I can't afford to lose either.&nbsp; My best protection is a pile of clearly labelled cloned hard drives and two external USB3's backing up 5TB between them.&nbsp; On this machine I went dual boot
 with W7 on a separate drive and have cloned drives of it and RTM on standby, should I dump the betas or have one totally go south.&nbsp; I also collect the ISOs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summing up because I wandered off...;) Get the Media Creation Tool and download a x64 version (before it's gone)&nbsp;make an ISO and burn a DVD or go the USB dongle route to get a known good package and try again.</p>
<p>If at first you don't fricassee, fry, fry a hen.&nbsp; ;)</p>

<p>Setup couldn't start properly. Please reboot your PC and try running Windows 10 Setup again." Been there, done that and got the T-shirt. Of course I can't run an upgrade from the disk when I boot to it without doing a clean install not an upgrade.</p>
<p>I also have 5 2.5HDD in enclosures and 4 3.5 HDD in enclosures for backups I have at least three of those drives with Windows System images :-)</p>

<h2>            Is there a 6131 advanced user handbook&#63;</h2>
                    Does anyone know if there is an advanced version of the handbook available which details the more complex setup items which are glossed over in the normal book?<br />
<br />
As an example, I am thinking about details relating to setting up web connections - such as "what is meant by 'Preferred access point' and how do you use it?" and "how do you get the phone to access the web from all applications which should be able to do it?".<br />
<br />
Other aspects are also treated very lightly and could well do with being expanded.

            You make a good point there, i've noticed that the handbooks cover very litte.<br />

Unfortunately there isn't an advanced handbook available.

Shame that, but it is what I suspected.<br />
<br />
Seems daft to put all these facilities on a bit of kit and not explain fully how to use them.<br />
<br />
It is not as if there is even a proper Help file contained on the phone itself.

<h2>            Excel VBA - Getting Error when Pasting to another Worksheet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have some VBA code that I am using to copy and paste certain data from Sheet1 into specific rows in Sheet2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure I am copy/pasting and generally working in the correct sheet, I created a Workbook variable and set it to the active workbook. Which it's the ONLY workbook open at the moment. And then I created 2 Worksheet variables in which I set one to Sheet1
 and the other to Sheet2, using the Workbook variable... In a few other places in my code I copy data from Sheet1 and paste it into Sheet2. But, during this one loop I have I am doing pretty much the same thing, but when I attempt to past into Sheet2 I get
 an error, which says:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>"Run-time error '1004':</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>&nbsp;Application-defined or object-defined error"</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><strong>So the code in question looks like:</strong></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">sub myCode()<br />
<em>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...................cut non-needed code.................</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<em>'&nbsp;&nbsp; Define the Workbooks and Worksheets involved in this code:</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim reportWB As Workbook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set reportWB = ActiveWorkbook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim newSheet As Worksheet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set newSheet = reportWB.Sheets("SORTED-SHEET")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim origSheet As Worksheet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set origSheet = reportWB.Sheets("ORIGINAL-UNSORTED-SHEET")<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...................cut non-needed code.................</em><br />
<br />
<em>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This code WORKS just fine...</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; origSheet.Cells.Copy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newSheet.Cells.PasteSpecial xlPasteFormats<br />
<br />
<em>'&nbsp; &nbsp; Copy all the Worksheet's Titles from Row 1 to 6 to the NEW Worksheet:</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; origSheet.Rows("1:6").EntireRow.Copy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newSheet.Paste<br />
<br />
<em>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...................cut non-needed code.................</em><br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim destIndex_start As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destIndex_start = 7<br />
<br />
<em>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This for loop is actually the inner loop of another For loop, which we don't really need to show...</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each srcCell In origSheet.Range("B5:B1000").Cells<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim curRow As Long: curRow = srcCell.row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim data_cell As Range<br />
<em>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......Code cut that checks values of the cells in the range being looped and some other stuff......</em><br />
<em>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .......Also Code cut that decalres a few Long typ variables.......</em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If InStr(blah blah blah....) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; origSheet.Rows(curRow &amp; ":" &amp; data_cell.row).Copy<br />
<em>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ************************* ERROR ON THIS LINE *************************</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newSheet.Range("A" &amp; destIndex_start).PasteSpecial xlPasteValues<br />
<em>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **********************************************************************</em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destIndex_start = destIndex_start + data_row_count + 1<br />
<em>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breaks out of INNER Loop and drops back to the Outer Loop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit For<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End For<br />
<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I had put a watch on ANY/ALL of the variables involved in on copy and paste section above where the error is, and all Longs/Int that specify what rows to copy and where to paste all have values at the point of pasting... So I'm confused as to why i get this
 error here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Above the 'for' loop I copy the formatting of Sheet1 and paste it into Sheet2. Then I also copy the 1st 6 rows from Sheet1 and paste it into Sheet2, which are all the column headings and such, and that goes without issues as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Error for the copy/paste occurs on the line I marked with <em>"************ ERROR ON THIS LINE ***********"</em>....</p>
<p>The pasting DOES WORK&nbsp; if I use the <strong><em>".Activate" </em></strong>function on the destination ws/cell before I paste, but I've read many times that is not the best idea to be using
<em>"Activate"</em> and/or <em>"Select</em><em>"</em>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea why I am getting this error?</p>
<p>Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>UPDATE:</em></strong></p>
<p>I tried doing something slightly different... I created a new Range variable and set it to the rows in Sheet2 where I want to paste the rows from Sheet1. Then I tried pasting it to that Range and I get the same error on the line below where I set the Range
 variable's value.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim pasteRange As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pasteRange = sortedSheet.Rows(destIndex_start &amp; ":" &amp; destIndex_end)</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px"><em>'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sortedSheet.Range("A" &amp; destIndex_start).PasteSpecial xlPasteValues</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pasteRange.PasteSpecial xlPasteValues</p>
<p>So the error now shows on the line above where I set the "pasteRange" variable... So I guess there is something wrong with my range selection in the 2nd sheet..?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

            <p>Ok so I tried it with Set and had the following for the Past portion of the code:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>'COPY:</strong></em></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set pasteRange = sortedSheet.Rows(destIndex_start &amp; ":" &amp; destIndex_end)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pasteRange.PasteSpecial xlPasteValues</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">So I ran my code again using the above section for the
<em>paste </em>code. And I still get the error. So I stepped through the code in that loop and at the time I run the PasteSpecial line, the variables:</p>
<em><strong>"7"</strong></em> </p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>And I get the Error:</strong></p>
<strong><em>pasteRange</em></strong> variable and I still get the same error on the
<em>PastSpecial</em> line...</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I'd post the Workbook, but the data in the book I'd rather not be out there, and it would take a while to modify it enough to remove the sensitive data... So maybe there is a few more things I can try before we go there...</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Like, is there a better way I could copy specific ROWS from Sheet1 and paste those ROWS in Sheet2? I tried the
<strong><em>.Insert</em></strong> method <em>(*which I believe I got to work at some point)</em>, but I cannot shift cells up or down or else it will mess up the formatting so I switched to Copy/Paste instead of Copy/Insert....</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Any other ideas? </p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I am confused as to why if I specify the exact WorkSheets I am using by creating those worksheet variables and specifically setting those variables to the Named Sheet variables why it would be an issue at all....?</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> I forgot to mention that when I get the error, I can see that rows 7 to 11 in Sheet2 get selected/highlighted, but it's not pasting in the data... So how would it know WHERE I want to paste the data,
 but its unable to do so...?</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thanks Again,</p>

            <p>Sorry for the consecutive posts. But, something different just happened this time...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the code again, but this time I remove the <strong><em>"xlPasteValues"</em></strong> portion of the PasteSpecial Line and it worked just fine... Weird...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Dim pasteRange As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set pasteRange = sortedSheet.Rows(destIndex_start &amp; ":" &amp; destIndex_end)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;pasteRange.PasteSpecial</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Also, I removed the <strong><em>Activate</em></strong> lines that switched to the Sheet and it still worked...</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">So since that code worked without the <em>xlPasteValues</em> option, do you think the issue was with the actual data I am copying? I think there might be a few Merged Cells in there, could that be the culprit?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Richard,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Based on your description, the issue seems caused by the Mac OS update and the update made some config files relate to Outlook client corrupted. Please try the steps below and see
 if there is any improvement:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Go to KeyChain Access</span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Search "Exchange" under Login --&gt; All Items and delete everything</span>.</p>
<p><span><span>3. Search "Office" and delete everything</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Search "ADAL" and delete everything<span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Launch Outlook</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6. You will get the activation prompt and then If account is already added you will see the password prompt for app and ADAL again. Please do 2-Factor Authentication
 if asked to.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn’t help, we need to collect some information below for troubleshooting:<br />
1. Can you add your Office 365 account on other Office suites such as Word on your Mac?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Can you configure other types of email accounts such as outlook.com email accounts on your Outlook for Mac client?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Your detailed Outlook for Mac version.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>@Craig, please try the steps as well to check if there is any improvement. In addition, I noticed you’re using Outlook for Mac 15.31 (161220) which is our Office Inside program.
 Actually, we have a dedicated support channel (Help menu &gt; Contact support) to copying with Office Inside program related issues. If the issue persists after performing the steps above, please seek professional assistance there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>@Morgan, have you updated your Mac OS as well? You can also try the steps I mentioned above. Let us know the followings if it doesn’t work:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Can you add your Office 365 account on other Office suites such as Word on your Mac?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Can you configure other types of email accounts such as outlook.com email accounts on your Outlook for Mac client?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Try to create a new Mac OS user profile to check the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Larry</span></p>

<p>My school uses Outlook 365 for email. Every time I open Outlook 365 I am prompted to install Office 365 for free (due to my .edu address.) How can I get the prompts to stop? I do not want to install Office 365.</p>

<p>Unless someone can suggest a supported method to prevent being prompted to install Office 365

    <title>Handsfree text messaging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin 520  say:</h3>
<h2>            Handsfree text messaging</h2>
                    <p>Cortana has a problem reading text messages to me in the car: she always misinterprets my
<em>"Read it"</em> command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana: <em>"You have received a text from &lt;whoever&gt;.&nbsp; Would you like me to read it, or ignore it?"</em></p>
<p>Me: <em>"Read it!"</em></p>
<p>Cortana: <em>"Sure.&nbsp; Who would you like to send the text to?" </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens every time.&nbsp; Since I don't often receive texts while driving, I don't know quite when it started but it was before I switched from my old Lumia 520 to my current 640 (both on WP8.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, two questions:&nbsp; Plainly the main one is how can I fix the problem, but the other question is what can I do when this happens (other than say "Cancel" and give up on receiving the message)?&nbsp; Is there a voice command I can give Cortana to navigate back
 to the message and have another attempt to read it?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do remember this is all happening over bluetooth while I'min the car - my phone is in my pocket and while I'm driving it has to stay there.</p>

            PS&nbsp; It might be worth adding that Cortana has absolutely no problem understanding what I'm saying if I tell her to
<em>"Text &lt;whoever&gt;"</em>,&nbsp; dictate my message then tell her to <em>"Add more"</em> or
<em>"Send it"</em>.&nbsp; Rather it seems as if she hears the commands okay but in this one case takes the wrong action.

            <p>Hi.&nbsp; Since I posted that, my phone's been updated to W10M and no, it doesn't seem to exhibit the same behaviour.&nbsp; Still not working well, though:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it does now is to mute about the first two seconds of any announcement, so if I get a text message while listening to the radio I'll hear a bleep then two seconds of silence then Cortana's voice will fade in "...would you like me to read it or ignore
 it?".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I ask her to read it, then again I get a bleep then silence then the end part of the message.&nbsp; If it's a brief message of course I hear none of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That behaviour isn't consistent though.&nbsp; Sometimes Cortana just doesn't speak.&nbsp; I got a sequence of five messages yesterday and Cortana only announced the second one.&nbsp; The other four were just a bleep then silence then back to the radio.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you help me with my question though: is there any way I can use voice commands to ask Cortana to read out a text message if I didn't hear it the first time?</p>

            <p>Hi SFroy,&nbsp; Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I hadn't seen that article, but it only tells me how I can activate Cortana from my car radio and I already know how to do that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know if there is any article listing the voice commands I can give Cortana concerning text messages?&nbsp; That's what I really need to know: if there's a way to make Cortana read out the most recent message from a particular contact.</p>

    <title>Word Label Cell Clip Art Centering Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Label Cell Clip Art Centering Problem</h2>
                    <p>When I first purchased Word for Mac 2008, I was having trouble with printing labels.&nbsp; I like to insert clip art and an address.&nbsp; Even though the clip art LOOKS perfectly centered in the label cell on my screen, when it prints, the clip art is sitting right
 on the bottom of the label (or the cell) so it is not centered.&nbsp; (I view the label at 500% to make sure it is centered).&nbsp; And the odd thing is, this only happens when I use Avery Labels 5161, a 1" X 4" label (other sizes of labels seem to print fine). I have
 scrutinized and measured the sheet of labels themselves and they appear to be perfectly aligned. I have a Mac, Version 10.9.5 Maveriks. When I choose Word&gt;Tools&gt;Labels&gt;(pick an option)&gt;File&gt;Page Setup&gt;Settings (I choose Microsoft Word)&gt;Apply Page Setup settings
 to: (I choose whole Document)&gt;margins I see there are all the settings for the particular label I have chosen, in this case, Label 5161.&nbsp; From there I don't know what to do.&nbsp; I can make the top margin smaller but if I do and it prints correctly, what else
 do I choose?&nbsp; There's a box that says "Apply to: <strong>Whole Document </strong>
or <strong>This Point Forward".&nbsp; </strong>And then below this you can click on <strong>
Default </strong>from which you get a pop-up box that says:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1f4f550-eb01-4b44-9240-3fcd3f5d1391" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p style="text-align: left">So there's something else I'm not sure of.&nbsp; What exactly does this mean to me specifically for these 1" X 4" labels?</p>
<p style="text-align: center" />

            Since this only happens with one label, it can be that the label size is not supported by the printer. Its very odd but sometimes updating the printer does actually resolve the issue. So, try updating the printer first before changing the Page Setup setting
 in word. Also see: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313553</a>

                    I have embedded a YouTube video that automatically plays on the first time the presentation runs. Upon the loop, the video appears as already played on YouTube and won't refresh so it plays again. Is there a powerpoint trick to refresh the video (or a

</p><p>Ongoing &amp; reoccurring&nbsp;issues. Word was running okay for a week, now I'm back to the old issue - yet to be resolved:</p>

</p><p>I open a new Word doc. Type my content, save to OneDrive (properties set to full access, and work offline is enabled). Then each time I reopen the doc to edit, It opens as a new Word doc (!!), and when I try to save it with the same file name as original
 doc (so as to over-ride the original) it tells me I can't use the same file name as a doc that's already open. Infuriating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other times, the docs open as READ ONLY. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Other times, 'Word is not responding' or 'Word is not working'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other times, you are not connected to the internet therefore may not be able to access your files.</p>

            <p>Hello Daniel</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The docs in question have the extensions '&nbsp;.docx' (compatability mode)&nbsp;and '.dotx' .</p>
<p>.docx' invariably 'READ ONLY'</p>
<p>'dotx'(saved and reopened for editing) opens as Word (no.xx) - error msg rec'd when attempt to give same doc name. However, lightbulb just went off. I saved a blank Word doc on desktop to save going through apps to open Word when I want to start a new do
 (I know I should pin to desk top).&nbsp; Now realize this is probably a template doc, which would probably explain the issues, yes?</p>
<p>Then, when I save as (new name), I get 'Word is not responding' msg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, I extensively use docs with the '.doc' extension, generally&nbsp;without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 &amp; 3. Am generally online when I save the docs, as I can't save when offline (even though settings allow offline editing/access. Resorted to saving to desktop today to try and retain file name, only to be told doc was open, and I couldn't use the same file
 name. (Again, possibly template issue.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. No, only with Office docs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from possible template issue, I think maybe I should do a hard boot to reset things ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, in advance for your help.</p>

<br />
Thank you for replying.<br />
<br />
1) When you open a *.dotx document, Word will use the document as a template to create new document and the actual *.dotx file won't open for editing.
<br />
<br />
To edit/make changes to the Word template, *.dotx files, you must open it from within Word.
<br />

<p>
</p><p>Another day - and more road blocks. Can't get into docs for editing - again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked out the following info on Word MPV site. Deleted tmp files (or those I could), not sure about ~*.do?, and ~*.wbk.&nbsp; Is it safe to delete these without risk of losing original (wanted)&nbsp;docs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>
I keep getting files that I am working on locked for editing. Word only&nbsp; allows me to open them read-only
<p>Article contributed by <a href="http://word.mvps.org/AboutMVPs/terry_farrell.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>This is an indication that some Windows locking files are not being released&nbsp; correctly. This happens everytime your computer crashes whilst Word is running&nbsp; and often for inexplicable reasons. In order to minimise these problems, a good&nbsp;
 regular clean up of your computer is recommended.</p>
<p>If you are working to a deadline and don't have time for a full cleanup&nbsp; procedure, just follow steps 1-3 below. To thoroughly clean out your system,&nbsp; follow the complete procedure. This will be very similar for all Windows&nbsp; operating
 systems and versions of Word.</p>
<ol>
<li>Close all applications and reboot the computer.</li><li>Open Windows Explorer and Search for <strong>*.tmp</strong>, <strong>~*.do?</strong>, and
<strong>~*.wbk</strong>, and delete all that are found (Ctrl+A then press Delete). If you get the message, 'Unable to delete filename', Ctrl+click to deselect that file and press Delete to continue deleting the remainder.</li></ol>

    <title>Windows Security Confirm Certificate box does not appear in IE&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sammeader  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Security Confirm Certificate box does not appear in IE&#63;</h2>
                    I have come across a problem within IE when browsing to sites using security certificates. Normally I would expect to see a dialogue box appear asking to me to confirm the certificate to use. This does not happen however and after 15-20 minutes of waiting
 the pages times out. I have tried the following...<br />
<br />
Adding site to trusted sites. Un-installing and then re-installing IE (Both 7&amp;8, patched and unpatched). Cleared browsing history, internet files, cookies etc. Uninstalling and then re-installing the certificate. I have tried enabling and disabling the IE security
 setting "Don't prompt for client certification when only one certificate exists". I have tried whilst logged in as several different users, both admin and non admin.<br />
<br />
The client machine is Windows XP Pro SP3, on a domain and uses a proxy server and would go through a firewall but it is nothing to do with these as on another machine, same domain, same proxy, same user, same OS and same version of IE with same security settings
 it works fine!<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
*After more testing we have found this is an issue with all certificates used in this way. The only difference between a machine which works to one that doesn't is the updates installed. It also works fine on Google Chrome.<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>The issue might be likely with Internet Explorer/Certificate issue.</p>
<p>As the issue is with the system which is working fine and the one with Updates not installed,&nbsp; I would suggest you to perform all the updates.</p>
<p>Check if it helps.</p>
<p>You can also try re-installing the certificates.</p>
<p>Hope it helps!</p>

<h2>            Admin Account Change for Office 365</h2>
                    We have had a personnel&nbsp;change at my school and I have not been able to update the administrator information to the new person's email and user name. When I'm logged into the admin account and trying to edit the "personal info" it lets me change the name
 and phone number, but I can't edit the email address or login name (same email) for the admin profile. Please advise.

<p>Hello Catie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where did you edit the information? Since you cannot edit them, please capture a screenshot of the interface for further check. If there is any error message, please also let me know.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I can see that you are the Office 365 admin. Given the situation, you can sign in
<a href="https://portal.microsoftonline.com/admin/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 admin center</a> and go to
<strong>Users-&gt;Active users</strong> to update the personal information for yourself. If you still cannot do it, please let other Global admins do it to see if there is any difference.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>
