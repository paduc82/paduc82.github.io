    <title>remove jar file association - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamests  say:</h3>
<h2>            remove jar file association</h2>
                    
<p>I have file associations to two applications to .jar&nbsp;that are invalid.&nbsp; There is no .jar item in the control panel program to manage file associations.&nbsp; Yet when I right click a .jar file association two associations exist.&nbsp; One is IE. The other is supposed
 to be a java executable.&nbsp; When I double click the .jar file, a eternal loop is created launching IE endlessly.&nbsp; IE never actually displays.&nbsp; This causes performance problems and the only way to stop it is to log the user off.&nbsp; When the user logs in again the
 computer has returned to normal.&nbsp; The result is I am unable to run a .jar application by double clicking it.&nbsp; Also the association to a java executable is invalid and needs to be deleted so a valid association can be created.&nbsp; I have researched this probem
 for days an find no answers.&nbsp; Please suggest a fix.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

    <title>Add second hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spellcasterguitars  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add second hard drive</h2>
                    I've replaced a defective computer with a second hand replacement. Both are programmed with XP and the same browser. I've installed the hard drive into the slave position of the tower, plugged in the secondary ribbon cable and power cord, and powered up.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
 computer doesn't recognize the added hardware. Is there an easy way to simple transfer the data to the new hard drive, or is there a way to access the second hard drive so I can use it as part of the computer program?

<p>You've misused some terminology in that question, so it's a bit difficult to determine what your issue may be.</p>
<p>What do you mean by "the computer doesn't recognize the added hardware?"&nbsp; Does the drive show in Disk Management (Start &gt; Run &gt; diskmgmt.msc &gt; OK)?&nbsp; If the drive shows in Disk Management but not in My Computer, you may have to use Disk Management to assign
 a drive letter.</p>
<p>It sounds as if you want to take the hard drive from the defective computer (assuming, of course, that it was not the hard drive itself that was defective) and put it in another computer.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a "slave position of the tower."&nbsp; Presumably, you just placed the old drive in an available drive bay.</p>
<p>Typically, the "secondary ribbon cable" is used for optical drives -- not a second hard drive.&nbsp; Usually, if there is only one hard drive, it is attached to the connector at the end of the ribbon cable and the second hard drive is connected using the connector
 in the middle of the cable.&nbsp; The cable attached to the primary IDE connector on the motherboard should be an 80-wire cable, whereas the other might be a 40-wire cable:<a href="http://www.mikeshardware.com/howtos/howto_connect_ide_hd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mikeshardware.com/howtos/howto_connect_ide_hd.html</a></p>
<p>When you have 2 drives connected on the same 80-wire cable, one is the "master" (the one connected at the end of the cable) and the other is the "slave."&nbsp; You need to tell the drive about this, which you do by properly setting the jumper on the pins at the
 back of the drive.&nbsp; You set the jumper on one as "master" and the other as "slave" or both drives can be set to "Cable Select" if they both support this and you have the special "Cable Select" cable.</p>
<p>However you connect them, you should ensure that the drive from the old computer is set as the slave drive, because you do NOT want to boot from that Windows installation.</p>
<p>The foregoing assumes that both drives are the older IDE type of drive.&nbsp; If either or both are SATA drives, that's a different thing entirely.</p>

    <title>Black screen after updating the Graphic driver on Windows 10 on my hp - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> salem91is  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen after updating the Graphic driver on Windows 10 on my hp laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This problem first occurred last year with my Windows 10. The computer asked me to restart to install updates, and suddenly after restarting the laptop, and before the Sign In screen appeared, a black screen takes over and no matter how long I waited, the laptop
 the Sign In screen doesn't appear after rebooting. I have tried to reinstall the windows but after a couple restarts the same thing happen, a black screen before the Sign In screen appears. I figured it must be the updates. I searched the internet for a solution
 and couldn't find any since the updates was recently introduced. So, I looked for an alternative which is disabling updates. I did that and problem solved, no updates = no black screen.<br />
<br />
Then, 4 days ago, I restarted the laptop and same thing happened, a black screen. I reinstalled the windows, downloaded the drivers but it seems that the Graphic driver says "the computer doesn't meet the minimum requirements" although, I have used the same
 driver to install the same driver before and there was no problem. I used Driver Manager to choose to update the driver from the internet on its own. And the driver was installed successfully. But once I restart the laptop, a black screen appears before the
 sign in screen. I have tried the same thing 4 times and getting the same result.<br />
<br />
I have searched and searched, no solution to this problem and don't what to do next.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</p>
<p />

            First sorry for the troubles.
<br />Many many users are experiencing Windows update issues since the Spring update.
<br />
<br />First you will need to force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Advanced Options.
<br />
<br />Select to go back to previous build.
<br />Once that is done then below is a link on how to stop the update for awhile.
<br />Use that after you rollback.

<br />
<br />If you can not do the above then try a custom install.
<br />Below is a detailed link by Andre Da Costa on how to do that.

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Here are minimum system specs listed. As per that you are good to go. But you also need to check whether your Intel processor is a pass for Windows 10 or not.

            Hi InkaHeile 
<br />
<br />Your system will handle Windows 10 very well . . .
<br />
<br />Your processor is a bit old, however the i7-3517U has 2 cores and 4 threads, so there is no problem with that processor
<br />
<br />However, that processor has Intel HD Graphics 4000, which is now considered legacy and not supported on versions 1809 and 1903 of Windows 10, so if you do not have a dedicated graphics option, you may need to install a version of Windows 10 prior to version 1809 . ..

            <p>Hello rosebill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend going to HP's site and downloading the latest driver for the atheros blue tooth adapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will want to go to <a href="http://www.hp.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hp.com</a> and go to their support and drivers link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello rosebill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is recurring every 10 days, I wonder if the machine is pulling down an alternate driver from Windows Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check your Windows Update settings to see if you are pulling down optional driver updates along with the other important updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Reinstalled drivers over and over. Works for 10-15 sec each time.<br />
Was online with dell support for 2 hours. Solution they gave. Restore to factory default.<br />

                    <p>Original title:&nbsp; DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Few days ago my motherboard stopped working, so ordered a new one (GIGABYTE 970A-DS3P). At first everything seemed fine, but then I noticed that PC is working very slow (CPU speed was 1.4Ghz) and often freezes (I could click on
 browser, program, game... but nothing happened; Usually freezed for couple of seconds 30 - 60). I downloaded few tools to monitor CPU speed and figured out that is due to motherboard setting "Cool 'n Quiet". I turned it off, but then new problems appeared.
 System started crashing frequently - blue screen with message SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION. I reinstalled Windows, tried all possible BIOS settings combinations, OCed CPU manually to 4.1 - 4.4Ghz, but neither of it helped. I ran Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool
 and it said everything is fine. After that I ran Driver Verfier with settings "Automatically select all drivers installed on this computer" and restarted PC. After running Driver Verfier, I was getting crashes all the time (At login screen, right after typing
 password and hitting Enter) with error DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION. I had to restore system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. OP also has a BETA BIOS version installed. Question is, was that also the case in the old motherboard? if it was, then I suggest that, it warrants further investigation.</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>&nbsp;A: </em><em>Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has built-in </em><span><em>PunkBuster</em></span><em> which had been found compatibility issue with Easy Tune 6 utility.
<strong>We suggest you to disable Easy Tune 6 before playing this game to prevent system crash.

<p>
</p><p><em>You have two versions of Easy Tune driver installed. I believe, the earlier version should have uninstalled before installing the newer version, but at this point, its moot. you should disable the utility.</em></p>

</p><p>You have to remove the battery and press the power button for 10 to 15 second. Then again plug the battery and power supply. It will reset all the settings.</p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you bought a computer with Windows preinstalled there should be a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker somewhere on your computer, on some laptops it’s in the battery bay. It will
 have a 25 character alphanumeric code on it - that is your product key. If it's not on your computer look in your paperwork or on any CD/DVD cases that were included with the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you bought a retail copy of Windows 7 the key should be included in the box.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you bought Windows 7 online and downloaded it the key should have been sent to you through email. If you bought from the MS Store you can log in to your account to view your key.</span></p>

    <title>MY XBOX CANNOT SEE MY PC ON THE NETWORK AND VICE VERSA&#33;&#33; Why - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick2965  say:</h3>
<h2>            MY XBOX CANNOT SEE MY PC ON THE NETWORK AND VICE VERSA&#33;&#33;  Why won&#39;t Windows 7 work with my Xbox 360&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to "network" my Windows 7 PC and my Xbox 360 console. They are both connected by ethernet cable to a TP-Link modem Router. Individually both devices can connect to the internet/xbox live without any problems. The problem is I want both machines
 to see each other!&nbsp; The Router is acting as DHCP server and both machines are getting their IP Addresses through DHCP. My Routers local address is 192.168.1.1, My Xbox is currently on 192.168.1.2, and my Windows 7 PC is set to 192.168.1.64. I've tried using
 all sorts of ways to connect them both, Windows Media Player Media extender, Zune, but my Xbox will not see my PC and vice versa! My PC can't even get a reply when I ping my xbox!</p>

<p>Hi, I have got it working eventually. To get it working, I did the following:-</p>
<p>1) I reserved the first five IP addresses in the range. On my router (default settings) these are 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.5.&nbsp; To do this open your TP-link router web interface, click "Interface setup" and then click "LAN" and under the heading DHCP, change
 the starting IP Address to 192.168.1.5 and click save.</p>
<p>2) Next go to your Xbox 360 and assign it a static IP Address on the local network within the range you just reserved. (Done using the Xbox System Settings)<br />
(For example if your Router is the default 192.168.1.1 then I gave my Xbox 192.168.1.2, (Set the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0)</p>
<p>3) Go back to the Routers web interface and click "Advanced setup" and then click "NAT" and then click "Virtual Server".&nbsp; Add the following Rule Listings:-</p>
<br />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<table>

<tr>
<td><strong>Rule</strong></td>
<td><strong>Application</strong></td>
<td><strong>Protocol</strong></td>
<td><strong>Start Port</strong></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>* - Change this IP Address for the address you assigned your Xbox 360.</p>
<p>This worked for me but I'm not sure why, because XBox Live was working fine before I did this. However after I did this I had no problems seeing my PC's shared folders and Windows Live Media Extender also worked perfectly!</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at both the threads and I think I have tried every solution it listed. The issue is I cannot even add my Gmail account through the regular setup, and when I try adding it through the Advanced Setup, it appears to be added, but won't sync, and
 I receive another Error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think the issue is with my email account. I tried adding my second Gmail account and it didn't seem to work either. I am not sure what to do at this point, but if worse comes to worst, I might not use the Mail app, which would be a shame, or I might
 reboot my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you once more.</p>

            The sync issue is with the gmail account that is blocking access from “Less secure apps”. Simply log in to your gmail account and change this setting and the app will sync. A youtube video can explain you how to deal with the 0 x8000000b error message
 throug advanced setup of gmail account.

<h2>            WLAN autoconfig won&#39;t start instead it gives me an error 1068</h2>
                    My wi-fi capability of my PC has been rendered inoperable. From research I was able to determine that my Windows Wireless Service (aka WLAN autconfig) was&nbsp; not starting automatically at startup. I tried getting it to start manually from the Services utility
 but then I got an error 1068 message. I then enabled *all* group dependency services to be enabled at startup, but still my Wi-Fi won't work. I can tell because the "manage wireless services" prompt is missing from the network sharing conrtrol panel. What
 should I do?<br />

            <p>Hi JohnHeffernan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does the wireless connection has ever worked correctly before?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you an administrator of the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How long have you been facing this issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the methods listed below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> After restarting the computer, check for the status of the wireless service -WLAN AutoConfig and ensure that it’s started and the startup type is
 set to “Manual”.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click “Start”, type “services.msc” in the Start search box and hit “Enter”.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate “<b>WLAN AutoConfig</b>”.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click the service and select “Properties”.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select “Manual” from the “Startup type” drop box.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click “Start” to start the service.</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click “OK”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>You may <b>temporarily</b> <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">disable antivirus software</a> (and any other security
 software) and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-firewall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">firewall</a> on the computer as a test and check if that fixes
 the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If disabling the antivirus software fixes the issue, you may have to configure the settings of the antivirus program accordingly. Please contact the software vendor for further
 assistance in this regard. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Make sure you enable the antivirus software, other security programs, and firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus
 software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b> Refer the following link for information on troubleshooting wireless connection problem. In particular, refer to

    <title>Comprare dallo store USA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gdn gianniplay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Comprare dallo store USA</h2>
                    
<p>Ad oggi è possibile comprare dallo store us senza subire ritorsioni (ban, blocco del gioco etc etc)???</p>

<p>perchè io sono italiano, vivo in italia, ma per abitudine uso la console settata in inglese(us) e quindi quando devo comprare qualcosa...passo la console in italiano perchè altrimenti vedo il marketplace americano</p>
<p>ora...per ovviare a questo continuo cambio di lingua...posso comprare direttamente dallo store americano???</p>

<p>ps:so bene che non posso usare il mio conto MS.</p>
<p>so bene che alcuni giochi non sono localizzati.</p>

<p>voglio solo sapere se posso o non posso farlo.</p>

<p>Ciao, aspettando il chiarimento del bravissimo Brave, io volevo solo spiegare una cosa.</p>
<p>Anch'io ho la console settata USA, per motivi che non 'sto a spiegare tanto vi annoiereste, ma non c'è alcuna differenza per la dashboard. La dashboard è sempre italiana. Se setto anche la lingua in inglese allora i giochi li sentirò in inglese. Per avere
 la dashboard americana con relativi contenuti USA (ma anche Germania etc) devo creare un account americano. Oppure usare lo strumento sul sito per cambiare il paese del mio account. Tutto quello che tu modifichi sulle console non ha effettive modifiche sul
 Marketplace, almeno per la 360.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Domanda: la One è diversa dalla 360 per quanto riguarda la dashboard relativa al profilo?</p>

<p>@vesting la one e la 360 sono profondamente diverse in questo.</p>
<p>se metto inglese us...diventa tutto americano, dash,app,store,lingua dei giochi...ecc ecc ecc.</p>

<p>@vestingsugar... i redeem-code si possono comprare da siti specializzati...ma molti sono rimasti fregati (MS gli &nbsp;ha bloccato il gioco).</p>
<p>@uait: ok...han messo il pulsante per cambiare lingua va bene...ma rimane il fatto che se setto la console us e compro dallo store us...compro un gioco a 44€ e non a 59€.</p>
<p>se poi dovessero vietarlo è un conto...ma di certo 15€ a gioco non son pochi.</p>
<p>ps:che poi è un informazione che interessa a molti...mica solo a me. anzi io per fortuna molti giochi li ho già

<p>Gianni, sarà dura vietare di "schiacciare un pulsante" della mia console.</p>
<p>Quello che possono fare, se vogliono che nessuno lo faccia, è toglierlo: tanto MS sa perfettamente dove abiti.</p>
<p>Lo lasciano per la semplice ragione che ci guadagnano e finchè la legge non dirà loro che non si può, lo lasceranno lì.</p>

<h2>            Czech Language pack fails to install</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got a problem to install Czech Language pack in Windows 8 Pro. I pressed button to download a language pack, download was successful, but installation fails and shows&nbsp; "The Following updates were not installed" " Czech Language Pack - Windows 8 for
 x64-based Systems - (KB2607607) [cs-CZ_LP]".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas how to fix the installation? Anybody with similar problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any reply.</p>

            <p>Hello Teapack_Kuba,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, it looks like you are having issues with installing Czech Language pack through Windows Update.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can understand the inconvenience caused to you. I will help you resolve the issue!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Before we proceed with troubleshooting, I would need little information on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does the issue occur with particular update?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the methods and check after each method:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Try the methods provided in the article below and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Windows 8 language packs are available</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2607607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2607607</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> You may disable the Security Programs and third party software:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Check in “clean boot mode”, to disable startup programs.</b>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press the<b> ‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the <b>‘Run’
</b>windows type<b> ’MSCONFIG’ </b>and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>‘Boot’
</b>tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option
<b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the <b>‘Services’
</b>tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the <b>‘Startup’
</b>tab, click <b>‘Open Task Manager’</b>. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select<b> ‘Disable’</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>‘OK’</b>, and then click
<b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the<b> ‘Run’
</b>windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click<b> ‘Ok’</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>j.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the <b>‘General’
</b>tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click <b>
‘OK’</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>k.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><b>Step 2: Temporarily disable Security Software.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Disclaimer for disabling or uninstalling the Antivirus and Firewall:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses
 and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while
 your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your computer (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Once you performed the steps, make sure you ‘Turn on the Firewall’ and re-enable the antivirus to avoid the risk of virus infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, post your reply with results and questions asked as above. We are happy to assist you further with advanced troubleshooting steps!</p>

            Hello Imran M,<br />
<br />
I have completely the same problem with the Russian language pack. W8 was installed into a separate drive and seems it runs well. That what I have:<br />
<br />
1. Installed W Vista on the different drive (since year 2009).<br />
2. Installed licenced W 8 (32 bit) on to the separate drive<br />
3. After the W 8 installation i have installed a few apps including apps from the Store and an old Office 2007 Pro.<br />
4. To run the suggested by W 8 program for fingerprint scan, I installed the NET Framework 3.5 using instructions posted on this site (inserted the Win 8 installation disk and ran the special command in cmd.exe under the administrator privilages). I must do
 this that way because there was an error also while installing the NET Framework 3.5.
<br />
5. AFTER I have the NET Framework 3.5 installed, I decided to install the Russian language pack through the Control pannel. The wizard shows all stages of installation as "Done!" (I mean stages of download, initialization, installation...). But finally it shows
 the message: "The Following updates were not installed"....<br />
With no code of error.<br />
<br />
I have tryed all your previous suggestions, including Troubleshooter, but nothing helps. Please tell me, if there any ways to show you any log files to determine the problem?<br />
Or maybe there are ways to install KB2607607 through the cmd.exe? (see point 4 above).<br />

Could anybody help us with that? It affects office as well as you cannot change the language there. Office refers to the language that is set in the system. That is really annoying.<br />

            Well,<br />
It is a fairly new thread and it should not be closed.<br />
<br />
This happens a lot with many different languages. Is not like there is an especific language, it happens ramdomly.
<br />
<br />
I have many slates with W8 and some languages installs and some don't and not the same language in all systems. For instance, I can get to install Japanese in one and not in a second system.<br />
<br />
Now, how can it be fixed?<br />

<h2>            Error message says that my password is incorrect</h2>
                    <p>When opening my email, Windows Live Mail asks for my user name and password.&nbsp; I get an error message that says that my password is incorrect. I have changed my password already and have made sure the box is checked that says to remember my password. What
 do I do next? I need my emails</p>

<h2>            Ark Survival Evolved connection</h2>
                    <p>So I have recently purchased Ark from the Microsoft store and I'm currently attempting to join and for the past days I have not been able to play I get a roll back every 3 min and I get disconnected from the online server a lot. I am finding the game enjoyable
 and unplayable in my current situation. I have reset my internet, re-installed the game, and restarted my pc multiple times and nothing seems to be working. In the game i have good ping. My computer meets the recommended requirements for the game. If you could
 help me that would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard stops working  - Power Drive Failure</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So I have this issue in windows 10 where the keyboard of my laptop stops responding at random instances . None of the keys work. No other part of the computer is affected while is still on. Restarting the computer when this occurs results in a BSOD and
 a " Driver Power state failure error message". When forcing the computer to restart by pressing the power button resolves the issue . But the keyboard still stops at random intervals. &nbsp;I have already check all the drivers and they are up to date and there
 are no yellow explamation marks in device manager. Can anyone please help?</p>

<p><span><span>I realize that you are facing issues with the keyboard on your PC. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Suggest you to plug in an external keyboard and restart the computer to test if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may access the computer manufacturer’s website to download and install the latest chipset drivers along with other drivers available on the website for the computer. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Suggest you to boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if that helps. A clean boot state will help us to determine if any 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span> party service or application is causing this issue.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Network drive no longer mapped. Unable to re-map.</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
Please excuse the general igonrance of computer issues i may dispaly in the following discussion.<br />
<br />
I have an iomega network drive which i have been using to store my media. Normally im able to open up any of these drives (Z:music, Y:movies, X:Photos etc..) from windows explorer (under the 'computer' heading), and access the media instantly.
<br />
<br />
Recently, the drives are no longer showing up in windows expolrer and im unable to access the content in this way.&nbsp; If i open the home storage manager button on the taskbar, the window opens and where each drive was once displayed along with its letter designation,
 it says Photos:?, Movies:?, music?. <br />
<br />
My Ps3 is still able to access the media from the network drive so im guessing that the problem is with the computer itself rather than the drive.
<br />
I have made a few tentative efforts to remap the drive but i dont really know what im doing.<br />
<br />
Any help to fix thi would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
<br />

            Hello,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<ol>
<li>What happens when you open the network drives? </li><li>What's the error message that you get when you re-map the Network drive?</li><li>Were any recent changes made on the computer prior to issue?</li></ol>
<div>Check if you followed the correct process to map the network drive, follow steps provided below:<br />
<br />
Please follow the steps to re-configure the mapped driver on the client and then check if the issue will re-occur.<br />
<br />
a)Open the Start Menu and click on the <b>Computer</b> button on the right dark side.<strong><br />
</strong><br />
b)Click on the <b>Map network drive</b> toolbar button.<br />
<br />
c)Select a <b>drive letter</b> that you want to be assigned to this mapped network drive.<br />
<br />
d)Click on the <b>Browse</b> button<br />
<br />
e)Select a listed <b>shared folder</b> on your computer OR&nbsp;a <b>shared network folder</b> that you want to have mapped as a drive, then click on
<b>OK</b>. ive gets mapped<br />
<br />
f)If you want to always have the map network drive available in the <b>Computer</b> window, then check the
<b>Reconnect at logon</b> box. </div>
<div><font color="red"><strong><font color="#333333">Note:</font></strong></font><i> If you do not check&nbsp;the
<b>Reconnect at logon</b> box, then the mapped network drive in Computer will be disconnected (unmapped) automatically whenever you log off or restart the computer next</i>.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>g)If you want to log on to the network for the shared network folder with a different user name and password than what you already have set for this network connection, then check the
<b>Connect using different credentials</b> box.</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Normally you would leave this option unchecked unless you wanted to log on as a different user on the network than the default one you already have set up</em>.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>h)Click on <b>Finish</b>.<br />
&nbsp;If you checked the <b>Connect using different credentials</b> box in step 7, then you will now be prompted to enter the user name and password that you want to use instead to log on to the network with. If you want to be automatically logged on each time you
 open the mapped network drive, then check the <b>Remember my credentials</b> box. Click on
<b>OK</b> after entering them. (see screenshot below)</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> &nbsp;<i>If not, then skip this step and continue to step i</i>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>i) You will now have a mapped network drive of this shared folder or shared network folder in Computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the above methods are helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Right...<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, I have a single Iomega wireless network drive (named DRIVEY) which itself is partioned into 6 seperate 'drives' Movies, Photos, Music, Backups, active folders and public. I thought i should mention this in case it causes any confusion.
<br />
<br />
1, The network drives arnt there (in windows explorer) to be opened. They are normally listed in 'computer' underneath C:, D: and E: drives as u-z drives.
<br />
If i look in 'network' i see the Network drive under Media devices as&nbsp; Drivey: PVconnect: windows media connect.<br />
If i click on this it opens windows media player and i can access some of the content of the drive but its disorganised, slow and incomplete.<br />
<br />
2, When i attempt to map a drive, i get to e, in your guide and the network drive or any of its subfolders (movies, photos etc) are not there to be selected.<br />
<br />
When i open the Iomega home storage manager icon, all 6 drive partitions are displayed with ? where there letter designation would usually be. If i click on these unmapped drives , it attempts to map them for me, inputting \\192.168.0.3\music into the folders
 box. <br />
I click ok and get the following <br />
Windows cannot access \\192.168.0.3\music<br />
If i run the diagnostic, it says<br />
Your computer appears to be correctly configured but the device 192.168.0.3 is not responding.<br />
<br />
My PS3 is able to detect the drive and view the files without issue. <br />
<br />
3, I only really use my computer to send emails and use the internet so i dont tinker with any settings which may have caused this. I have ran Malwarebytes recently but there were no malicious files detected.
<br />
<br />
What would you suggest i do next?<br />
<br />
I would also like to back up the files from this drive. Can i plug it directly into my computer via a usb and transfer them via cable? Or are these drives designed to transferr wirelessly only? Is that a stupid question?
<br />
<br />
Many thanks for wading through the above explanations. <br />
<br />

            <p>Hello,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for response.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As you mentioned that you are getting message: "Your computer appears to be correctly configured but the device 192.168.0.3 is not responding.", You may refer to following article and check if that helps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>"Your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource (DNS server) is not responding" error message in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2779064/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2779064/en-us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also Verify Network settings</p>
<p>=========================</p>
<p>1. Click <strong>start </strong>and click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Double click <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Select <strong>"Change advanced sharing settings"</strong> option in the right panel.</p>
<p>4. Turn on <strong>"Network discovery"</strong> and <strong>"File and printer sharing".</strong></p>
<p>Check for permissions on the network drive.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

            Hi <br />
<br />
I have tried all three methods in the article you suggested. <br />
<br />
In control panel, the network discovery and file and printer sharing are both turned on.
<br />
<br />
I am still unable to map the drives. <br />
Im pretty resigned to the idea that i wont be able to sort this out and will need to buy a new one.<br />
Am i risking damaging my computer or the data on the drive by connecting it directly via a usb cable?
<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions you have to fix this are also welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
<br />
