<h2>            Apps does not work after update</h2>
                    <p>Most of my apps like Instagram, telegram, watsup and even photos don't work correctly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i touch to open, these apps just loading and blue spinner spinning for many hour and app would not open,</p>
<p>when i can open them after too many tries and restarting my phone, they crashes after a few work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please give another update</p>
<p>this update is bad</p>
<p>
</p><p>do not disappoint windows lovers, I'm reluctant to use windows phone anymore and i may switch to android if these problems do not come to end,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

<p>Hi Majid,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If restarting your phone doesn't resolved the issue,&nbsp; we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. The hard reset will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can reset your phone under Settings: <strong>System</strong><strong> &gt; About &gt; Reset your phone.</strong> Make sure to back up all of your files before performing a hard reset. Go to
<strong>System &gt;</strong><strong> Update and security &gt; Backup &gt;More options &gt; Back up now.</strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are still experiencing difficulty connecting to Facebook chat on your phone, there's a few things we'll want to try to resolve this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First thing we'll want to do is to uninstall the Facebook app if you have that installed.&nbsp; You can do this from under the apps list, by tapping and holding on Facebook and then selecting Uninstall from the popup.&nbsp; Once that's done, go to Settings -&gt; Email+Accounts,
 and remove your Facebook account from there as well.&nbsp; You can tap-and-hold on the account and select Delete to do that.&nbsp; Next, go to Settings -&gt; Applications -&gt;&nbsp;Internet Explorer&nbsp;and tap on Delete History, and then restart your phone.&nbsp; Once the phone is back
 on again, go back to Email+Accounts, tap Add, and enter your Facebook account information again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have a problem connecting, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>Your mobile service provider:</p>
<p>Your account region:</p>
<p>(This can be found at commerce.microsoft.com under Profile)</p>
<p>Your phone OS version:</p>
<p>(Found under Settings -&gt; About -&gt; More Info)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing we would like to check is if you can use Facebook messaging from the Facebook website through your browser, or if it works from within the Facebook app, or if this issue is contained just to the People hub.</p>

    <title>Office 365 Outlook Online Archive Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pawnie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Outlook Online Archive Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just thought I'd summarize the many problems I've had with the online archive feature of Outlook using Office 365 (likely the same for other versions of Outlook with the online archive).&nbsp; Hopefully Microsoft looks at this and puts a little more thought/work
 into this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, I have saved my PST files dating back to when I first started my own business (about 12 years ago).&nbsp; I work in the engineering consulting business and I regularly search through old emails from several years back looking for old contacts, or maybe
 a problem has recently surfaced on a project I worked on years ago, etc.&nbsp; I want *all* of my email available in a searchable format.&nbsp; I have traditionally used Gmail for this but I only ever had my Inbox mail available (through email forwarding everything
 to Gmail) and I'm tired of managing multiple accounts and clients and I also want to be able to forward an old email once in a while without having it come from a gmail address.&nbsp; I was delighted when I first installed Office 365, especially the Outlook connectivity,
 DNS options, etc.&nbsp; Everything about it went so smooth that I find it perplexing that the online archive is so kludgy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems in order:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Uploading email was excruciating.&nbsp; I tried using the ridiculously complicated Azure blob data upload and mapping file method at first but the transfers kept failing with very little explanation why in the log file (typically because of a timeout - I tried
 all kinds of ways to fix this including limiting the number of transfer pipes but same result).&nbsp; I eventually learned that you can just keep restarting the transfer and it will pick up where it left off but not until I tried the method below.&nbsp; They really
 should tell you this (that it saves the partial upload even if it aborts part way through).&nbsp; A lot of the transfer jobs also informed me that they didn't transfer completely and I watched the data size closely and indeed every single job was short by a GB
 or 2 without any information on what wasn't transferred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Another issue with this method is it completely shuts down the Internet in our house (it overwhelms the connection to the point where Internet access is way too slow to do anything in the entire house) and of course it takes hours and hours per file.&nbsp;
 This is weird because the methods I tried below did not do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- After the frustration using Azure storage method to upload, I eventually started just importing files with the desktop app directly to the online folder.&nbsp; These too would fail constantly after partially transferring, leaving holes in the data all over
 the place.&nbsp; So then I tried just opening PST files and copying large chunks at a time into the folders in the archive.&nbsp; So slow and tedious and of course, lots of failed copies and aborts just like the other methods.&nbsp; In case anyone thinks this is because
 of my Internet connection, it does the same thing if trying to copy from one data file to another on my local machine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Using these last two methods, any Outlook meeting invite I've ever received would pop up like a new event.&nbsp; I had to close hundreds of windows throughout the process.&nbsp; I also suspect these had something to do with the aborted transfers but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- After weeks of struggling with this (no joke), with spotty results, holes in the data that I knew I would have to comb through and fill in, much to my dismay, I realized Outlook had started duplicating messages all on its own, in some cases up to 5 times!&nbsp;
 Very strange but somewhat common from what I've seen online.&nbsp; The clean up tool won't work on the online archive so my choices are to live with the duplicates or manually comb through years of emails and manually deleting duplicates (not bloody likely).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have the Enterprise E3 edition with the unlimited auto-expanding archive.&nbsp; I knew from the beginning the way it works:&nbsp; when you approach the data limit, you have to wait up to 30 days for them to add an extra 10GB.&nbsp; This is fine for someone whose data
 is just normally being auto-archived as messages expire but excruciating for me but I was willing to live with it.&nbsp; I have about 150GB of email so I purposely only uploaded 90GB and planned on uploading the rest, 10GB at a time over a few months.&nbsp; I see this
 as just not a great system.&nbsp; I've also recently read that there might be a 170GB hard limit on the archive which is absolutely not as advertised (can anyone confirm this?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The worst part of all:&nbsp; after carefully checking my archive limit constantly to make sure I stopped at just over 90GB, I stopped transferring and went to bed one night only to wake up to 120GB in my archive and it stated I was over the limit in the Exchange
 admin area.&nbsp; &nbsp; I suspected this was happening earlier but now I knew for sure.&nbsp; I have no idea if this is because of more duplicates, but I don't think so (see below).&nbsp; I was worried about whether this would mean something would get deleted after all the work
 I did so I contacted support and the help desk tech told not to worry, it just auto-expands.&nbsp; I knew this isn't quite how it works but I didn't want to debate it.&nbsp; I also said it was still letting me transfer data even though I was over the data limit and
 asked if I should just continue and she said yes.&nbsp; She emailed me a couple of links to how auto-expanding works (which I already had and were contrary to the advice she gave) and that was that.&nbsp; At this point I was losing interest in the whole project so I
 shrugged and continued uploading until it finally prevented me from doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- More phantom data expansion occurred after that.&nbsp; I probably have uploaded about 75GB of real data that had magically turned into 190GB on their end.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Then the data was automatically split into subfolders for each year of data.&nbsp; I'd be OK with this if I could search for a specific message in a subfolder from the root folder but nope, doesn't work (tested thoroughly).&nbsp; So I would have to know exactly
 what year the message I'm looking for is located or navigate through several folders and searches until I find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- After all of this, the data has so many holes in it and I can't upload any more to fill them in and I don't want to wait 30 or more days to find out they only give me another 10GB (leaving me still 70GB over the limit) or maybe even just start randomly
 deleting some of the data to bring it into compliance so I decided to just delete everything more than a couple of years old (the only data that seems complete) and start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Deleting data from the online archive has been equally frustrating with lots of failures, aborted attempts, painfully slow, etc.&nbsp; Also, apparently you can't delete folders from the Deleted Items folder.&nbsp; You can get rid of the messages but from what I've
 read online, you're stuck with those folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- In the end, after deleting everything but the last couple of years of data (maybe 35GB max), I have an archive that's still over a 100 GB.&nbsp; There are no duplicates in this data as far as I can tell so I'd sure like to know what's taking up all that space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Perhaps the most annoying thing of all is finding out I can't access this data from the mobile Outlook app or a mobile browser. Also, Outlook goes to great lengths to prevent me from loading the web app in "desktop" mode on either Chrome or Samsung's web
 browser (I did find a mobile browser that can get around this but I'm afraid to mention the name of it lest Microsoft "fix" this loophole - it's still not really a functional way to get to this data from my phone though).&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I can access an eternity of
 email on Gmail from the mobile app and instantly/seamlessly search for a message all in one convenient folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was the final straw.&nbsp; I'm currently archiving my mail with MailStore and hosting the data myself.&nbsp; MailStore's web host is almost exactly what I wanted the online archive to be.&nbsp; I'll be playing with the MAPI host too to see how it works so maybe I
 can even access all of this from the outlook mobile app (it has an add-on for the desktop Outlook app which is very good).&nbsp; It's just too bad the online archive wasn't better though, I'd love to have all the functionality I need in one convenient application.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking maybe the problem is I'm trying to use the online archive for something it's not designed for.&nbsp; But then, if you can't use an "unlimited" online archive to store and search through old email, what on Earth would it be for?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Pawnie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that the they will take larger space via uploading data via PST file, especially when the you export those items from different server, since the format storage of emails or attachments may be different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the issues you encountered, since we are not clear your situation and you mentioned you have contacted support, would you mind providing us the ticket number in private message, so we can know more details about your scenario and the troubleshooting
 steps you have tried.&nbsp;</p>

            HI,
<br />According to our conversation today, the double-line option in Word 2016 for IOS is not implemented yet. Next, I attached a link so you can create a forum for Microsoft developers in the future they can implement this option in the future updates of Office 2016 for Word.

<h3> rayomatic  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get rid of a margin created by a cover page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was editing a long document (300+ pages) in MS Word 2010 and used Insert&gt; Cover Page to add the "Conservative" cover page to the document.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this seems to have added a blank wide margin on the right-hand side of the entire document (not just the cover page), which has effectively made the available space for text on every page narrower.</p>
<p>Even more unfortunately, I saved the document like this, so now I'm stuck trying to find a way to undo the damage.</p>
<p>But because I ended up changing the cover page after deciding it was too fancy, I can't seem to use the "Remove Current Cover Page" function.</p>
<p>Nothing happens, and that right-hand "ghost margin" does not go away. it gets darker when I move the cursor over it, but I can find no way to delete the bugger.</p>
<p>I would gladly send or upload the file to show what I mean.</p>

            You appear to be viewing the document in Full Screen Reading view, and the wide margin is allowed for markup (changes and comments). If you switch to Print Layout view (and select Final view on the Review tab), you should see your document as it should
 be; you will need to Accept All Changes in Document and Delete All Comments in Document (and turn off Track Changes) in order to make this view permanent.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Everyonem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sister and I both have different Windows Mobile 6 devices; 1 atom exec and 1 glofiish. We both use the same computer with a generic login name at home. We have the latest ActiveSync installed and both phones are registered with ActiveSync
 with different names. We dont use Outlook at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I connect my phone to update files etc, her Calendar and Contacts get updated onto my phone and vice versa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way of preventing this as then I have to manually delete all her calendar data from my phone and vice versa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<br />You cannot merge you MSFT account with Office 365 account to sign in in Windows 10, you can use your Office 365 account to sign in but will need add the pc to Azure AD.

            Ciao Lois, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, can you please tell me which Office 365 account do you have?
<br />
<br />In any case, regaring your issue with Word [thanks to Vijay Verma]:
<br />
<br />ADD-INS PROBLEMS
<br />Start in Safe Mode (Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation). 
<br />
<br />Then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in. 
<br />
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; (scroll down below up to Manage: Com Add-in) &gt; Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them 
<br />
<br />OFFICE REPAIR
<br />First try a quick repair install, If it doesn't work, please try Online Repair:

<br />Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.

            I don't know of a way to  "merge" the separate accounts. But you may be able to access them using a single email by using an "alias".
<br />
<br />Do you have anything other than Windows on that account, have you bought anything from the store?   If nothing else is associated with the "windows" account, then "retire" it.  Keep track of the email id and password, just don't use them any more. Instead, just use the Office email.

<br />
<br />When your old email address doesn’t suit you anymore, but you want to save your contacts, online storage, subscriptions, and settings, then add an alias to your existing Microsoft account. An alias is another email address that works with the same account.

<br />I HAD A TYPO IN MY EMAIL ADDRESS USED TO ACTIVATE OFFICE 2013, NOW I AM STUCK!
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-office_install/i-had-a-typo-in-my-email-address-used-to-activate/68465f5c-01d2-43b6-943f-583a98b1ef07">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum...</a> 
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt; When activating Office 2013 home and business I had a typo in my email address domain name.  Now I am stuck because the verification email isn’t going to an actual email box, so I can’t verify.  If I try to start over the product key is rejected as it is already in use!
<br />HELP!!
<br />
<br />Update, after waiting 90min on hold MS the fix is to install the product (I happened to have the download) and then click “I want to activate with product key”, then put a bogus code in so it will switch to give you a ‘I want to activate by telephone”.  Call the number on the screen and explain everything, then they will activate your OFFICE 2013!  The last step is to start a new live account and switch accounts.  What a pain MS! &lt;/snip&gt;

<br />HOW DO I CHANGE MY EMAIL ADDRESS FOR MY OFFICE 365 HOME PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION

<br />
<br />Answer
<br />“Now why would anyone ever want to do something like that”  &lt;heavy sarcasm&gt;
<br />
<br />Sorry, but apparently MS did not think that anyone would ever want to do that when it designed the Office 365 activation system.  There is no easy fix for your question
<br />Move Office 365 University to a New Email Account - barely possible 
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-office_account/moving-office-365-university-subscritpion-to/053401f9-2f7b-4684-90d2-2e876873fd96">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum...</a> 
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />Well after nearly 2 hours of hold time, someone finally picked up.  I explained my situation and he said he’s been getting a flood of phone calls in the past week regarding the issue.  He explained that many people have registered for Office 365 with incorrect or misspelled email addresses/accounts and they currently have no power to change this.  He only offered to escalate the issue to the next level and take down my contact information. 
<br /> 
<br />For anyone with the same issue, you should keep calling and make some noise over this because it’s insane that MS locks in your account, giving you no ability to change it.  If I get no reply back on this in a few days, I will try and cancel my Office 365 University subscription.
<br />However, I am now running into a roadblock because they require me to re-verify my university status.  When I go enter my .edu address, they tell me it has already been used for verification of the 365 subscription that customer support just cancelled.  I’ve emailed them back about it and hopefully they can correct this.
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;

<h2>            Bluetooth Constantly Disconnecting From Audi Connect</h2>
                    My Lumia 920 and Audi A6 2012 have been suffering constant disconnects from Audi Connect since the Portico update. I was hoping the recent at&amp;t post-Portico update would clear this up, but it has not. Needless to say it is tremendously frustrating.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try to switch off the phone, take out the SIM card for a second and then switch on the phone after that. Once done, try to check if you're still experiencing the same issue.&nbsp;</span>On your phone, have you tried pressing and holding both the volume
 down button and the power key for 10 seconds and then observe if the issue is still the same?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To isolate the issue, have you also tried connecting with another car kit?&nbsp;<span>If it's still the same, can you tell us what's the OS version and firmware revision number of the phone?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</span></p>

<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've experienced the same issue with a Lumia 920 and my 2012 A6.&nbsp; Prior to the 920, my 900 connected reliably.&nbsp; After going through several phones (AT&amp;T was kind enough to indulge me), I concluded it must be "something" in the 920 -- I've verified that other
 (borrowed) phones connect to the car just fine and have even had my dealer validate/test that the Bluetooth is operating as it should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, I upgraded from a 920 to the new Lumia 1020 only to discover that the connectivity between phone and car is even worse!&nbsp; At least with the 920, turning the phone off and on would sometimes resolve it for a little while.&nbsp; I'm not able to establish,
 much less maintain, a reliable Bluetooth connection between the 1020 and the car at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate some assistance...ultimately, if I have to choose, the phone is less $ to replace than the car.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there, experiencing the same between my newly bought 1020 and Volvo XC 60 2012. Have no problems with other mobile brands, HTC, Samsung, Apple devices etc. works fine.&nbsp;Have you gotten any solution on the matter.</p>
<p>Status for me is that I have to turn off and on the mobile to get connected every time I enter the car. Also&nbsp; disconneting while driving, pretty annoying.</p>
<p>Thankful for any replay</p>

<p>My Nokia 928 connects with my Audi A8 (voice &amp; music) automatically as soon as I turn the car on. However, after less than 5 minutes it disconnects. Every time. It does not automatically reconnect unless I turn the car off &amp; on (or the phone off &amp; on).</p>

<p>Very good analysis: Then, it is very likely a interoperability bug not with Microsoft but between Audi and Nokia. We need as much information as possible to track that bug down:</p>
<ul>
<li>model line: Audi A8</li><li>model-year or better production-month: ??/????, for example 08/2012</li><li>order code: ???, for example 9ZX</li><li>country bought: ?, for example Germany</li></ul>

<p>I had a Lumia 1020 (Amber/GDR2) and Audi A7. My first Lumia 1020 had no issues at all. Setup and connected quickly from day 1 until I received a replacement 1020 (because I cracked the glass). The new Lumia 1020 (same OS version) has had bluetooth connectivity&nbsp;problems
 with my Audi. So...I swapped it out for another 1020 (same OS) and cannot maintain a connection for&nbsp;a full car ride. The version on the OS is the exact same number certified by Audi on their website to be compatible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So sad...I love this phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone knows a fix!</p>

<h2>            Excel&#58; save to PDF has an extra blank page</h2>
                    I'm using Office for Mac 2010 and I have a simple one-page Excel spreadsheet and when I save it to PDF it saves with an extra blank page. The print preview also shows the extra blank page. This is really frustrating for a paid Office 365 subscription.
 Any ideas on how to save the spreadsheet to a single page, without the blank page showing up?

            For other Mac users having this problem, I've found the solution. Go to Menu - File - Page Setup - and under "Scaling" change the radio button from "Adjust to:" to "Fit to:" 1 page wide by 1 page tall. This is almost what Wyman W said earlier, except if
 you're using Office for Mac his description of how to find this was not applicable.

<h2>            Using an Existing Merge Document to Create a Fillable Form</h2>
                    <p>Reading a past Post maybe this can not be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have an existing Merge Letter form (Contract Agreement).&nbsp; The Source Data comes from an Excel spreadsheet.&nbsp; Most of the pertinent information required for the Merge Letter (Contract Agreement)&nbsp;is pulled in from the Excel Spreadsheet.&nbsp; After the
 letters are merged there are additional items that need to be included.&nbsp; REQUEST:&nbsp; I would like the agent to be able to hit a TAB key and go directly to a part of the Contract Agreement that needs to be filled in and TAB to the next area and so on and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never done a Fillable Form.&nbsp; I tried using an existing document and going into the Developer but everything was grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Help!</p>

            <p>My MergeTools Add-in has the ability to "mail merge" a document that contains either Content Controls or Legacy FormFields though I would probably suggest using Content Controls.&nbsp; If you use Plain Text Content Controls, you will be able to tab from one to
 the next.&nbsp; Do not apply any Grouping to the document before executing the merge as Grouping is applied as part of the process so that the only part of the documents that are produced that can be edited is the Content Controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can download the MergeTools – 20150422.dotm Add-in that I created from the

<p><span><span><br />
The MergeTools – 20150309.dotm file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, the default location for that folder is<br />
<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box of "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8 and 8.1, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box of
 "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />

<span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook.

<span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character (0-9).

<p><span><span><span><span>NOTE: The MergeTools applications cannot handle “Compound” MergeFields such as the «AddressBlock» or «GreetingLine».</span><span><span>&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, for delay in responding. Are you still facing the issue? If so, you may follow these steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Formatting a drive in Windows 8.1 is handled by the Disk Management utility. The same process applies to both hard disk drives, or HDDs, and solid state drives, or SSDs. After deleting the volumes, or partitions, on the drive, you can format the drive and
 create new volumes. Remember to back up any files you want to keep before starting this process. Deleting and formatting destroys all data on the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Tap the "Search" icon on the Windows Start screen or click start and type "format disk" in the Search field. Select "Create and Format Hard Disk Partitions." The Disk Management utility opens.</li><li>Select "Create and Format Hard Disk Partitions."</li><li>Click the drive that you want to format. Note that in most cases "Disk 0" is the drive with the Windows operating system on it. If this is the disk you want to format, you should reinstall Windows instead.
</li><li>Select the drive you want formatted. Select "Delete Volume."</li><li>Click "Yes" at the warning that all data on the partition will be deleted. After a few seconds, the volume is deleted. The drive is now listed as unallocated in the Disk Management window.</li><li>Disk Management warns that all data on the partition will be lost.</li><li>Select the drive you are formatting if it isn't already selected. Click the "Action" menu, then "All Tasks" and "New Simple Volume." The New Simple Volume Wizard opens. Note that if the disk is part of an array, advanced users will have additional options
 like creating a new spanned volume, striped volume, mirrored volume or RAID-5 volume.</li><li>Create a New Simple Volume. Click the "Next" button in the New Simple Volume Wizard so you can specify your preferences. The New Simple Volume Wizard opens.</li><li>Specify how much space should be used in the new volume by entering a value in the text field. If you are creating only one volume or partition in the drive, this number should be the same as the maximum disk space displayed above. Click "Next."</li><li>Specify the volume size. Select a drive letter that you would prefer the computer to use for this drive. If you don't want a letter assigned, click the "Do Not Assign a Drive Letter or Drive Path" option. Advanced users may also prefer to mount the drive
 in an empty NTFS folder. Click "Next."</li><li>Specify a drive letter. Select a file system for the volume. Your options are ExFAT or NTFS. Use ExFAT if you're going to share files with a Mac computer; otherwise, NTFS is the better choice. Unlike its predecessors, ExFAT can support the same volume sizes
 as NTFS -- up to 256TB. However, it's not as robust as NTFS and doesn't support file system-level encryption and built-in compression. Mac computer's can't write files to an NTFS drive.</li><li>Select a file system. Select the "Perform a Quick Format" option if the drive doesn't contain any private information, or if you're using the drive for your personal use. A Quick Format takes only a few seconds, but the data it leaves behind can be easily
 recovered by anyone with the right software. A full format takes much longer but it does erase every byte of data. Select the "Enable File and Folder Compression" option if desired. Type a name for the volume and click "Next." Change the volume label if desired.</li><li>Click "Finish" after reviewing the settings that were applied to the new volume. If you want to change anything, click the "Back" button and format the drive again. Close the New Simple Volume Wizard by clicking "Finish."</li><li>Exit the Disk Management utility.</li></ol>

<p>It helps to understand that the Language attribute is applied to text passages or entire documents the same as other formatting, such as Bold, Italic, or the font selected. For any given text, the spell checker uses the appropriate language that was applied
 to the particular text passage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you set a language as a default language, you're setting it for NEW documents, not the current document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To apply a particular language to text, first, select the text, then apply the desired language to the selected text, and then save the document.</p>

<p><span>Hi Bram,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on my test on Outlook for Mac 2016 Version 15.36.1 (170721), the Automatic Language Detection feature works fine.
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95a17426-794a-4410-a413-12d122c7502a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95a17426-794a-4410-a413-12d122c7502a" /></a></p>
<p><span>So I suggest you first set automatically detect and spell check languages in your emails based on this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Let-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-automatically-detect-and-spell-check-languages-in-your-emails-1a94b031-78c3-4aa8-abe2-c2d89a01a2d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then if the issue still happens, I suggest you do the following troubleshooting steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Log your account to another Mac where there is same version Outlook for Mac client to see if same issue happens.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do others in your organization also encounter this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the issue happen on the Outlook for Mac version before?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Amanda </span></p>

<h2>            Memory Full - Asha 311</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever i run the internet radio I get a "memory full " message. In Nokia Suite the remaining ohone memory is shown as 1.49 MB out of 168.13 MB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is 1.13 GB free on the memory card. I have only two very small apps installed others than the pre-installed. 3) any photos and music is on the memory card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Nokia Suite the options to store for all except contacts is "memory card". Nokai Suita also complains that phone memory is running out!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) How many contacts can you store on the Phone &amp; SIM. 2) is there any way to release more memory?</p>
<p>I will be grateful for any help, for I have struggled but cannot do anything further unless guided.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Is it a message coming in the form as Java Error - Memory Full. If it is so, it refers to your phone's RAM getting full rather than the Disk Memory.<br />
As its just a streaming app, the main memory has a little role to play. Try restarting your phone to free up some RAM and disable any apps that run in background, such as WhatsApp or the email clients.

<p>I have done that several times through Nokia Suite, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Is there any limit on how many contacts you can store in the phone. I have about a thousand?</p>
<p>As the memory card has plenty of space I do store the minimum possible of photos/mp3 on the memory card.</p>
<p>the phone cannot multitask so i do not run any background applications. I am at a complete loss to what is needed.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>have you tried doing "settings -&gt; reset application" inside the internet radio app? It's possible that the app would have cached some temporary data on your phone. I'll have to give this a try and see if it's reproduceable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>another thing that could be eating up space on your phone is the browser cache. you might try cleaning that also ("settings -&gt; clean all personal data" inside Nokia Browser).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if those steps don't help, then one possible way to perhaps figure this out: go to settings-&gt;phone-&gt;memory status-&gt;phone and let me know the values listed.

<p>Even though I have toggled on the 'desktop notifications' button in outlook.com, and allowed notification from Chrome, I still don't receive anything on both Windows 10 and Mac (using the same Chrome sign in credentials).&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span>However it's working fine on Firefox. I installed a third party Chrome notifier&nbsp;(OWA), and it also worked.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be because I am using both Hotmail (outlook.live.com) and my work email (outlook.office.com) at the same time that's causing a conflict? But I did allow notifications for both, though. I tried to reset browser cash and use only one of the 2 accounts,
 but no results.&nbsp;</p>

            Dear Jimmy 
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />I doubt that using 2 accounts will influence the notifications. I also have problem with enabling those and I contacted Outlook In app support and they are investigating this. I suggest you to contact them as well, so this could be resolved quicker. 
<br />
<br />In order to contact Outlook In-App support please follow this guide <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to-get-outlook-com-support-f5482a98-616c-4d44-b7c5-8aaaadf5c11a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to...</a>

<h2>            The context menu for setting a rule creates a &#34;stop processing&#34; entry</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Whenever I use the context menu (Right click) on a mail message on Outlook 365 desktop to always move a mail to another folder, it creates a rule which ends with the line "stop processing further rules"?&nbsp; This is driving me insane because I have over
 40 rules and I have to edit each of them to correct the fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b)&nbsp; Is there a way to export the rules as a text file so that I can program/edit them using a text editor.&nbsp; The export option exports them in a semi-binary format and so is useless for that purpose.&nbsp; I could write rules so much faster and easier if there
 was a mini programming language used to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really tired of treated as if am moron by Microsoft using such puerile embarrassments as&nbsp; ribbon bars that neither classify functions properly nor do so consistently across applications and my personal ultimate stupidity gold: "tell me what to do";
 it should teach you how to do it not just do whatever "it" is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>And oh, please get rid of the re-incarnation of Clippy that is that stupid blue bar that appears on the right-hand-side of Word saying "it appears you are writing a xxx"?&nbsp; Yes, now bugger off, I have a brain, I went to school, I can write it on my own thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put menus back as an option please and fire the idiot who "researched" that ribbon bars are useful.&nbsp; THEY AREN'T!!! STOP IT God created menus and they have lasted as long as they have done for a reason, USE THEM!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

<p>A move rule should always end with Stop processing more rules.</p>
<p>If Stop processing more rules is not included, all 40+ rules will be checked and only the last rule that applies will be applied.</p>

<p>Thank you except that is what I want it to do.&nbsp; If it applies a move rule, then it must continue to process all the remaining move rules until the entire set of rules has run to completion.&nbsp; I don't want it to abort the move once it has moved a single recipient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh thank you for clarifying that.&nbsp; You see this entire problem came about because I have rules to move messages that started to be defeated by the spam/junk mail filter.&nbsp; Previously I would receive emails from clients and the last few days their mail started
 to appear under spam/junk which has serious consequences because it means I am replying late to business opportunities that I am only becoming aware of when the client phones in a panic.&nbsp; Hardly good for business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to totally disable the junk filter?&nbsp; I have turned it "off" as far as I can in Outlook desktop but I see there is one in Outlook 365's web interface.&nbsp; Does the one in the web interface apply first then the one in Outlook desktop after or are
 they completely unrelated?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather NOT have a spam filter that consigns business email to the junk box and I noticed that if I apply a rule created via the context menu to the mail in the junk box, it moved the first one from the client, but left the remaining messages&nbsp; from
 the same address behind in the junk mail.&nbsp; Hence my need to understand the processing order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

    <title>Odd Page Footer and Even Page Header on same page resulting in same - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ralucavida  say:</h3>
<h2>            Odd Page Footer and Even Page Header on same page resulting in same page number in 2 different pages</h2>
                    <p>I have been working on a very long document with multiple different sections in Word 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After filling in a section all the text, I inserted page numbers and it's then I've noticed that the 1st page number of the section is the same as the 2nd section page page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, the 2nd section page (having the same page number as the 1st page) has a very strange anomaly : the header is an "Odd Page Header" and the footer is an "Even Page Footer" (on same page!). The same anomaly is encountered on the 3rd page of the document
 ("Even Page Header" and "Odd Page Footer").</p>
<p>The rest of the pages seem ok.</p>
<p>

<p>I'm wondering if the so-called white space between pages could be hidden in your document (see
<a href="http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/WhiteSpace.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/WhiteSpace.htm</a>). This is a bit of a long shot, though, as it would hide headers and footers, unless you have enabled the header/footer view (which greys out the rest of the document).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Can you share an example document that illustrates what you see? <br />

<p>You cannot have an odd page header on the same page as an even page footer.</p>
<p>Something else is going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following free tool may help you figure it out.</p>

<h3> jim baek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Percentile &#47; Quartile Function doesn&#39;t show the formula result as it is seen in function argument</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Excel 2010 and tried to use percentile / quartile functions. </p>
<p>Here is a small example that I face now. Please look at and give me some solutions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have three groups(A,B,C), and in each group there are vaules assigned. <br />
According to my formular of Quartile, F2 should have result of 2.75 because among arrays (2,3,False,False,False) the 0.75 percentile value is 2.75. and it is CALCULATED as 2.75 in the function argument as you see here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However,&nbsp;results from F2 to F6 shows that this Excel seems not to care about groupping.&nbsp;All the&nbsp;results are 4 ,and it&nbsp;is probably 0.75 percentile of&nbsp;(2,3,4,5,2).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you guys help me out here? </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello all, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Excel 2010 and tried to use percentile / quartile functions. </p>
<p>Here is a small example that I face now. Please look at and give me some solutions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have three groups(A,B,C), and in each group there are vaules assigned. <br />
According to my formular of Quartile, F2 should have result of 2.75 because among arrays (2,3,False,False,False) the 0.75 percentile value is 2.75. and it is CALCULATED as 2.75 in the function argument as you see here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However,&nbsp;results from F2 to F6 shows that this Excel seems not to care about groupping.&nbsp;All the&nbsp;results are 4 ,and it&nbsp;is probably 0.75 percentile of&nbsp;(2,3,4,5,2).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you guys help me out here? </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must enter that formula as an ARRAY formula like this and it will return 2.75.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.</p>

            I have experienced exactly the same issue. Sometimes it happens once a day sometimes a few times in a row. I went back to 8.1 upgraded to 10 preview etc. Nothing helped... I can live with the fact that this is a budget phone and is slow etc but for freezing
 issues like this? It's a disgrace.

            Pretty useless comment - but I don't want to go into entire 'it was to be supported but was abandoned' rant. The Preview is being offered without any registry hacks etc so unless it stops that tells me that Microsoft want to hear about any issues - that's
 the whole idea behind insider...&nbsp;

            <p>the idea about insider was to test windows 10 upgrades. now it is to test updates to the Windows 10 releases. your device is not getting windows 10, ever. so it is pointless to "test" any further. the 520 is not listed as a supported device in the insider
 program anymore. if it still gets it or not is not relevant. </p>
<p>
</p><p>discussing windows 10 on non-supported device is the useless thing.</p>

            <p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being a studious reader you certainly are you should have noticed that the 'home screen freezing' issue is not 520-specific. Google search reveals a number of threads and comments on that topic. Sometimes it's due to SIM card issues, sometimes it is due
 to SD card issues sometimes there is no clue as to why that happens and the only solution offered is to do a hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely an area that needs improvement and I am hoping Microsoft is actively looking into it regardless of whether it's 520 or other models.</p>

            <p>i probably found a working solution:<br />
had the same problem with my lumia 1320 since updating to w10m. sometimes when pressing the homebutten from out of an app the homescreen would just "freeze". it then does not accept any touch gestures on the screen nor react to pressing volume/camera/display-off.
 even some rainbow coloured stripes on the display when turning it back on again (sometimes). the only solution was a soft reset by pressing the powerbutton for 10sec. this happend 3-10 times a week.
<br />
<br />
i tried multiple hints:<br />
factory reset and reinstalling all the apps: [B]no improvement[/B]<br />
changing microSD from 64gb sandisc to a new 64gb samsung: [B]no improvement[/B]<br />
<br />
what worked for me:<br />
[B]removing homescreen background[/B] (settings - personalisation - start - no background). no "freezing" for 4 days now - yay!<br />
the picture was saved on my sd-card. that might be a reason why this issue only appears on some Lumia 1320.
<br />
i also removed some unused apps but i'm pretty sure the problem was the background picture.
<br />
<br />
let me know with a comment or upvote if this worked for you!<br />
<br />
greetings from berlin!</p>

            <p>hey Sebastian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the post and hint! I hope it works for someone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I did not have any background set so the 'fix' did not work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I did some more testing and it seems it is somehow related to SD issues. I put in some very old slow SD and the freezing happened more often - even though no apps were installed to SD. Would yet have to try the phone with no SD at all.</p>
