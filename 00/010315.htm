<h2>            E71 Corrupted 8gb memory card. How to reformat&#63;</h2>
                    My E71 has corrupted my memory card for no apparent reason. The problem I have is that it now wont let be reformat it because it thinks its encrypted, which it isnt. Is there any way to reformat my memory card despite this apparent "encryption" and start
 again? Im not impressed with this device destroying my card...

            I assume by "encrypted" you mean that you are being prompted for a microSD card PW, a PW which you never set? If that's the case, your card IS effectively encrypted, even though you had nothing to do with it! You will also sometimes (always, for me) get
 a "card corrupted" message if you power the phone off/on, but the solution there is to remove/reinsert the card, at which point it is read properly.<br />
<br />
I've had E-series phones TWICE set random PW's on SD cards on which I had placed NO PW whatsoever. Both times, this happened in the context of resetting the phone (an E60 in my case) to the factory defaults. In my case, the phone could read the card after the
 reset, and I then smugly restored all of my data to the phone from by card-based backup. The phone then did a reset (normal after such a restore), but then requested a PW to be able to read the card! I had set NONE!<br />
<br />
After some equivocating, Nokia support admitted (by phone -- no written record, of course) that the E60 had applied a random PW to the SD card. Nothing could be done. Nokia as much as said "Nokia's fault, your problem" claiming that because the card was not
 a Nokia-brand card, they weren't responsible, even though they didn't even suggest that the fault was with the card, but rather the phone. Seriously irritating.<br />
<br />
The cards were made by Kingston, and have a lifetime warranty. I explained the situation to Kingston, and they said as much as "Nokia's fault, but our problem" and sent brand new cards! I was impressed by Kingston's support. They indicated they'd had similar
 reports about Nokia phones pulling this stunt.<br />
<br />
There ARE devices (eBay) which will remove the PW and also destroy all of the data. Given the price of microSD cards now, it's usually better to just get a new card. A KINGSTON card, in my opinion. You will NOT find a way to recover data directly from your
 now-locked SD card. Neither will you find the Nokia-generated PW anywhere in a hidden file on your phone. And you won't find a way to format it either as long as it is PW-protected. It's a really secure little card. I still backup my phone to the SD card,
 but also backup both phone AND card to my PC. Keep a copy of that SD card somewhere for days like this...<br />
<br />
BUT, after those fiascos, I began putting a PW on my SD cards, reasoning that Nokia can't do so if one is already there. Not sure of that logic, but I've had no further such troubles. So, I have concluded after nearly two years of no further episodes that the
 trick is to always set your OWN PW on these cards so that your phone won't surprise you by doing it for you!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            Same thing happened to me when i installed and then removed handy safe from nokia download. I was able to still format and use the card in the phone, transfer files to and from it in pc-mode, but was unable to access/format it in card reader.<br />
<br />
some time later I made a complete system restore - and later much to my surprise found that the card has been restored to normal. Formatted it in pc to complete the excorcism, haven't had any trouble since.<br />
<br />
Too bad I wasn't aware I was restoring the card so I wasn't paying attention to exactly what I was doing, all I know is I somehow restored the thing w/o ever finding out the password.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as I was googling for help, I found a post that 'FExplorer' should unlock the card. It requires signing, however, and I didn't feel like bothering @ the time, so I can't confirm that it works.

            I've had the exact same problem with my E66. What do you mean by "complete system restore" is that a soft or hard format? I understand that if I update the firmware before the password problem is resolved, that I won't be able to access the card? I'd prefer
 avoiding formatting the phone - what is the device that removes PW and destroy all of the data? I could not find on eBay.<br />

            I had the same problem, the memory card suddenly locked without knowing what is the unlock code.<br />
I follow some guide on the internet, update to the latest firmware and reformat the memory card through the phone, it works...! now it works fine and also can be read through Card Reader on my PC, big thanks to this resource..! I just wondering how if my firmware
 is already the newest? :)

            I had this problem after I upgraded my E71 to the latest firmware. In order to reformat the card I selected Tools-&gt;Memory and got an option to reformat which worked fine.

<p>If you've set the Remote Lock feature - try that as the password for the memory card - I had a bit of a nightmare with that until I was told to try it...</p>

<p><span>Hi Papas83,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which
 fix it tool did you run to fix the issue earlier?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 it only happen with single website?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 was the last time it was working fine?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>This may happen due to any add on installed in the internet explorer browser.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you check if any add-ons on the Internet explorer are causing the error. I would suggest you to try opening Internet explorer
 in the no add-ons mode.</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click the &nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, click&nbsp;
<strong>All Programs</strong> and click &nbsp;<strong>Accessories</strong></span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click &nbsp;<strong>System Tools</strong> and then click&nbsp;
<strong>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more information.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then try resetting the internet explorer browser settings to default and check,</span></p>
<p><span>For more information refer the below link.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>:&nbsp; Reset Internet Explorer
 to its default configuration. This step will also disable any add-ons, plug-ins, or toolbars that are installed. Although this solution is quick, it also means that, if you want to use any of those add-ons in the future, they must be reinstalled.</span></p>

    <title>Office 2013 Files will not open from Network locations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> howard p. fairfield, llc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 Files will not open from Network locations</h2>
                    <p>Any type of document that Office supports will not open from a network location. When a file is attempted to open, all that it says "We're sorry, we are unable to open this file." This happens if I open it from Explorer or from within an Office program.
 When trying to save to a network location, I get a bogus error message saying "The file pathway is too long" even though the same user can open and save&nbsp;the same file on a different computer running the exact same version of Office 2013. I now have 3 computers
 that are doing this, they started this&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;30 days after install of Office Professional Plus&nbsp;2013.&nbsp;I have 9&nbsp;identical machines, the other 6&nbsp;do not have this issue even though installs are identical.&nbsp;Each one is running Windows 7 and yes, I have valid legal
 keys for Office and each one has been validated. The event viewer shows no additional information from the error mentioned above and only shows this as an Information level posting, I have received no errors about validation or other issues in Office. The
 environment is a 2008 domain and we do not use any type of cloud storage, only internal network storage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried to fix the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have gone into the trust center and have set the network locations as trusted, I've disabled all the settings that I can find that prevent files from opening.</li><li>Reset permissions on the files and locations</li><li>I have done a repair on Office</li><li>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Office</li><li>I have formated the computers and reinstalled Office</li><li>I have replaced the Office folder from a working station to a not working station</li><li>Moving a file from a network location to the desktop - This works but is not the long term solution I need.</li><li>Everything on the web points to it being a Trust Center issue but I've followed every suggestion I've found regarding this, the documents simply will not open</li></ul>
<p>Any suggestions are welcome, please keep in mind that this happens in ALL Office programs, not just one, so I'm inclined to believe there's some type of registry issue.</p>

            Hi Alberto,<br />
<br />
The Save As is not active by default when you try creating a template. However, I’ve done some researches and found an easy workaround for your reference:<br />
1.Create a new email and save it to the folder Drafts.<br />
2.Create a folder named Templates and drag the email created in step 1 to it. <br />
3.Press the Option on your Mac keyboard, then with your mouse, drag the email and drop it, you’ll see a copy of the email. By repeating the steps, you’ll get lots of copies.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Jasmine<br />

<h3> gnatsuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music pass Build 10162 no download option</h2>
                    <p>For the last few builds on both Windows 10 mobile and Windows 10 desktop I can no longer download music to those devices, it signs me in to my account, and plays previous downloads but there is no longer an option to stream or download only purchase and
 preview. </p>
<p>It will let me stream existing playlists and download those to my phone, it will let me add new tracks and playlists on my Xbox One and they will show up on my devices.</p>
<p>I am unable to install the Music Preview app on either laptop or desktop so not sure if that's the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions are most welcome.</p>

            I'm still seeing this behavior as of build 10240. My understanding is the store is no longer in beta, yet this is still not working. Microsoft please give us an idea of when this will be working again since this is a subscription we are paying for!

            <p>Its getting very frustrating now, I can't stream or download to either my phone, laptop or desktop, the only option I have is to create a playlist on my Xbox One and set the available offline to On. It's been quite a few weeks now and am still waiting for
 someone to acknowledge that this is a bug or a feature that hasn't been added yet.</p>
<p>I understand that the phone is in beta but the desktop version surely should be working by now as we are less than 7 days away from launch.</p>

    <title>Excel will only respond to at least 3 mouse clicks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jos_ua  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel will only respond to at least 3 mouse clicks</h2>
                    <p>When attempting to select a cell, click on "File" or click on anything in Excel, I must click at least 3 times. This makes selecting anything extremely difficult and makes Excel essentially unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an issue when double clicking to open any existing spreadsheet file and when running in Safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select Excel and run it in "Administrator" mode, this is not a problem.</p>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>We understand you want to modify your profile's privacy settings. Please be informed that with the release of the new People experience, information not used for communication such as 'favorite things' and other general
 information have not been used and/or maintained by the majority of our customers, especially as many of their social interactions and profile updates are being managed on their favorite social networks.</font></span></p>
<p><br />
<font>Customers have told us that they don't want yet one more profile to manage and they don’t want to invite their friends and family to yet another network if they've already built those relationships somewhere else.</font></p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>So, with more focus on communicating with your contacts, we have removed the need to maintain some of the profile characteristics that are more akin to social networks, and your profile will really focus on just the
 core contact information that you want your Messenger friends to see. </font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance on this.</font></span></p>

    <title>Cortana and Office 365 - No results - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kd909  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana and Office 365 - No results</h2>
                    I have Cortana connected to my Office 365 (Business) account and I am unable to get any results. If I look at the drop down for filters I notice there isn't an option for email. If I check indexing option under Cortana&nbsp;my Outlook email is enabled for indexing.
 I'm not seeing any error in the event viewer under applications or system that pertain to Cortana. I'd be more than willing to check out a log that might have a hint of what's wrong but I don't know where to look (assuming that there is a log). Any assistance
 is appreciated.

<p>
</p><p>I've tried searching email in the format you have above with no luck. As stated before Cortana doesn't list email as a filter option. There's no icon for email like your graphic displayed above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for receiving error messages like the webpage (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3086254/how-to-troubleshoot-issues-when-you-use-cortana-with-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to troubleshoot issues

</p><p>I did some testing and it's not working on 2 other Windows 10 computers both with my account and another employee's account which leads me to think it's on the Office 365 end. Could there be settings or permissions to check with Office 365 other than making
 sure Cortana is turned on in the Admin center for Office 365?</p>

            <p><span>Hi </span><span>KD909,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For Win 10 users, there are a few things to be aware of before you start using Cortana in Office 365.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. </span><span>To use Cortana in Office 365 scenarios, you must set up the Windows 10 Outlook Universal Mail and Calendar apps with Office 365. (Support for using Cortana with Outlook on the desktop is planned for a later release.)</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>2. Cortana with Office 365 only works on Windows 10 devices and is available in only certain languages and markets today.</span>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Please make sure your situation suits the 2 points above. Especially for point 1, did you set up the Windows 10 Outlook Universal Mail and Calendar apps with Office 365? If not, please set up your Office 365 account into the Win 10 Outlook Universal
 Mail and Calendar apps and test again to see if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,<br />
Mouran</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;BrianNaine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to use the skype for business in the Outlook Client, you can try to disable the skype for business add-in in the Outlook. Please go to File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins&gt; Manage COM add-in (go)&gt; find the skype for business add-in and then uncheck
 it &gt; Save you changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that the skype for business would disappear from your calendar in the Outlook.</p>

    <title>Create a new Excel 2007 worksheet in existing Excel workbook with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zorrodidit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create a new Excel 2007 worksheet in existing Excel workbook with fresh data from and using Access 2007</h2>
                    I have already got an embedded macro on the event properties of a control-button in an Access 2007 form which sends data from a select query to an Excel 2007 workbook.<br />
<br />
This will be done on a regular basis, say weekly, to create a list of proposed mail recipients names and email addresses in Excel 2007.<br />
<br />
I then propose to use a macro in the Excel 2007work book to create an Outlook 2007 Distribution List.<br />
<br />
On the very first instance of using these processes, all is good, but when I repeat the process from Access 2007, I am asked if I wish to overwrite/replace the prior Excel 2007 workbook.<br />
<br />
If I say yes, then the new list is created in the Excel 2007 workbook, but I lose the Excel macro that is to automate creation of the Outlook 2007 Distribution List.<br />
<br />
If I say no, then I have the same problem, i.e. an Excel 2007 workbook that I have to build a new macro into.<br />
<br />
Basically I need to adjust my existing macro for the control button in Access 2007 to create a new work
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">sheet</span> in the existing target Excel 2007 work book, rather than create a new Excel work book on each instance.<br />
<br />
If this cannot be done with a macro in Access 2007, then can it be done using VBA?<br />
<br />
If so, can someone please provide the code necessary to achieve my aim and how I go about placing the code into the correct place in the Access 2007 database?<br />
<br />
Trusting someone can help, as I am modifying a downloaded Access database ("Charitable Contributions" template) as a volunteer for a charitable organization and need to make it easy for other walk-in volunteers to mouse-click most functions and processes as
 they are not very computer savvy.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hello Michael<br />
<br />
You want to send data to an existing excel workbook? <br />
<br />
You will need to modify your set up from using a macro to using VBA. Automate excel, open that particular workbook and insert the data in worksheet of your choice.<br />
<br />
If it is what you want, i do automate excel in my application, i can share the code.<br />
<br />
You will need a form with the command button&nbsp; to execute the VBA code to automate Excel<br />
<br />
<br />

            Hi Ronald.<br />
<br />
I have done some experimentation and testing since posting my question.<br />
<br />
As it stands, I now have the code working to such an extent that when I click the control-button in the Access 2007 Form, it not only open a Query, but also exports the data from the query to an existing work-sheet in an Excel 2007 work-book, which is in .xlsb
 format.<br />
<br />
On each instance of clicking the Access 2007 control-button a fresh query is opened and the data is exported to over-write the Existing data in the Excel work-sheet. (this is what I want to happen)<br />
<br />
The only remaining problem is that the Excel 2007 work-book does not open (I have to go to the folder it's in, and open it manually)<br />
<br />
Can you assist with a modification or addition to the code, so that the Excel workbook opens?<br />
<br />
Here's the code:<br />
<br />
[code]Private Sub Command104ContrDonatWeekly_Click()<br />
On Error GoTo Command104ContrDonatWeekly_Click_Err<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenQuery "Contributors Who Donated in Past Week", acViewNormal, acEdit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet acExport, acSpreadsheetTypeExcel9, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Contributors Who Donated in Past Week", "C:\Users\Michael1\Desktop\KSN\DistributionListWeekly.xlsb", True, "Sheet2"<br />
<br />
Command104ContrDonatWeekly_Click_Exit:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Copy the following code to the top of the module, below the line(s) such as Option Compare Database and Option Explicit, but above all Subs and Functions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Declare Function ShellExecute Lib "shell32.dll" Alias "ShellExecuteA" ( _<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; ByVal lpOperation As String, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ByVal lpFile As String, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ByVal lpParameters As String, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ByVal lpDirectory As String, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ByVal nShowCmd As Long) As Long<br />
<br />
Private Const SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED As Long = 3<br />
Private Const SW_SHOWNORMAL As Long = 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can then use the following in your On Click event procedure, below the TransferSpreadsheet line:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoEvents<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ShellExecute Application.hWndAccessApp, "Open", _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Users\Michael1\Desktop\KSN\DistributionListWeekly.xlsb", 0&amp;, 0&amp;, SW_SHOWNORMAL</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remarks:</p>
<p>1) I don't think you need the DoCmd.OpenQuery line. TransferSpreadsheet also works if the query isn't open.</p>
<p>2) To save as a .xlsb file, you should use acSpreadsheetTypeExcel12 instead of acSpreadsheetTypeExcel9 - the latter is for .xls.</p>

            Thank you HansV MVP<br />
<br />
I need to have the query open in Access, so I will keep the DoCmd OpenQuery line.<br />
<br />
I am confused.<br />
<br />
When you say .....<br />
<br />
<br />
</span>Do you mean<span style="font-style: italic">, </span>copy it into the same module as the Private Declare Function goes into?<span style="font-style: italic"><br />
<br />
</span>Or are there two separate places,&nbsp; that code is to be copied to?<br />
<br />

<p>You could also copy&nbsp;the code&nbsp;into a general module (i.e. a module created by selecting Insert &gt; Module in the Visual Basic Editor), but then you'd have to replace the three instances of Private to Public:</p>

            This is how it looks, but I can't get rid of a line across the page, as simulated below.<br />

            No, only a separation line that separates the code from the next code below.<br />

It is exactly as I posted above.<br />

There is no separation line above the 'comment part at the beginning of the code we are working in that separates it from the code above, which ends with End Sub.<br />

<h2>            Building up 16 teams &#40;2 persons per team&#41; using excel</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am preparing for a&nbsp; tournament and I am trying to build it up through Excel, the inputs are as follow:<br />
<br />
1- 32 players<br />
2- 16 teams (each team consist of 2 players)<br />
3- 12 Rounds (1 Round per day,&nbsp; which means there is 8 matches per day - every team is competing with another team)<br />
4- Teams changes every round (which means two players can only meet once in one team for the 12 rounds,&nbsp; for example, in Round 1 player X is playing in the same team with player Y, however; in round 2 player X &amp; player Y shouldn't be in the same team again
 everyone should team up with another players. This scenario keep on going until the rounds finish - each round different teams).<br />
<br />
I have tried using this formula: {=index(array:list of the 32 players, mrand()+1) this gives me only the first round teams. However; for the second, third, forth,...... round I need to make sure that no one is playing again with the same player that he teamed
 with before. I don't want to manually check it, I need to make sure that excel is generating 16 teams every round different from the round before. Can excel do that?<br />
<br />
Any Ideas? PLEASE HELPPPP<br />
<br />
Thank you for helping in advance,<br />

<div>Hi. &nbsp;If you don't get a better answer, here's a possible solution.</div>
<div>These are very difficult problems that I don't believe can be solved with worksheet functions.</div>
<div>I'm not sure of a solution for 32 players.</div>
<div>One technique would be to work with half (16). &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>16 Players can be paired a total of 15 rounds, which is just over your 12 round requirement.</div>
<div>The other half can be paired in the same manner.</div>
<div>Good Luck!&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Being a macro kind of guy, I see this as just begging for a macro solution.&nbsp; One problem with formulas is either you have to do some really crazy things to make sure you haven't duplicated a team pairing or you have to try to do something equally crazy with
 RND or RANDBETWEEN.&nbsp; The problem with those functions being that they're volatile, so every time you select the schedule sheet the teaming would change!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[OOPS - Edit]</strong> Found that the code previously posted does not cover assigning a team of two people with both people being the same person!&nbsp; Fixing that.&nbsp; Will post again as soon as that's fixed.</p>

<div>So, I may be wrong here:</div>
<div>On Round 1, is player #2 listed twice, and missing player 32?</div>
<div>On Round 2, is Player #13 listed 4 times. &nbsp;I also don't see player 1,31,32 listed at all.</div>

            Hi,,<br />
<br />
The probabilities that you are assuming is right and the spread sheet that is attached is also right.
<br />
The main problem is that the formula that I am using to allocate the 32 players on 16 teams is =index(A1:A32,mrand()+1) this formula allow duplicate results which in my case they are not allowed.<br />
<br />
Therefore if I just can find a way to stop the duplication and tell excel that give me all the possible probabilites that you can combine.<br />
<br />
I guess the total combination that I have in this case is 496.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you&nbsp; have any idea.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance <br />
<br />

            <p>You're correct - I'd also discovered that it was not preventing pairing up, for example, Player #10 with Player #10 as a team of 2.&nbsp; That alone was enough for me to pull down the code.&nbsp; I probably should go delete the file from Media Fire also, but I've
 deleted the link to it here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm working on yet another brute force kind of thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AmerBsiei</strong> - you are correct in that there are 496 combinations to be considered once all duplicates of both the 1 &amp; 2&nbsp; and 2 &amp; 1 teaming are deleted.&nbsp; Now I'm trying to figure out how to select 12 days worth of 16 teams from those 496 without
 duplication in any day and without missing an entrant in any day.&nbsp; I think I'm close, but then I thought I was close early this morning.</p>

            <p>You can find such a macro here!&nbsp; I've finished it up, checked it out, and it builds 12 days worth of schedule with 16 unique teams on each day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download the working sample file from here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TeamMaker_002.xlsm <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/qd2k3yythdc6c4k/TeamMaker_002.xlsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mediafire.com/view/qd2k3yythdc6c4k/TeamMaker_002.xlsm</a></p>
<p>It's not pretty on screen - just choose to Download it when you get it up on screen then open it in Excel, you'll have to [Enable Content] if you get an alert that it has special content (macros) in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[Edit] - see next post for version with 'by name' schedule setup available.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got a sheet set up in it that could be used to hold entrant's names associated with their numbers which could eventually be used to provide a schedule showing names instead of just numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For anyone wanting to check it out without downloading the workbook, here's the code.&nbsp; You will need an Excel workbook with 2 sheets in it.&nbsp; Name one of the sheets "TeamMixer" and the other sheet must be named "TournamentSchedule".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build-down from 1024 possible combinations to the 496 unique ones takes a bit of time - it takes about 5-10 seconds from the time I click the button on the TournamentSchedule sheet until the schedule is actually placed on the sheet. (Win 7 Ultimate 64,
 Excel 2010 Pro 32-bit, 3.6GHz i7 CPU)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code.&nbsp; To put it into a workbook, open the workbook.&nbsp; Press [Alt]+[F11] to open the VB Editor.&nbsp; In the VB Editor, choose Insert --&gt; Module from the menu and copy all of the code below and paste it into the module presented to you.&nbsp; Close the VB Editor
 with its 'red'-x or by pressing [Alt]+[Q].&nbsp; <strong>Important</strong> save the file as a Macro Enabled workbook, type .xlsm or .xlsb to preserve the code for future use.&nbsp; Run the macro named
<em><strong>BuildSchedule</strong> </em>to do the job.</p>

            <p>After seeing your display sample, I went back in and have added a sheet with a couple of buttons on it to build a "daily" schedule that would be suitable for printout.&nbsp; Looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fde7d265-8a6a-445e-a9b9-78c992f34597" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you enter a day # into B1, the names in the schedule area change, along with the displayed "Day #".&nbsp; If you delete the entry in B1, all names are cleared, so you could print out the form just for hand entry if you wanted.&nbsp; Only the area from A4:E14
 is printed out.&nbsp; It uses the list on the 'EntrantsList' sheet to get the names from the numbers that were placed on the 'TournamentSchedule' sheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The [Build a completely new Schedule] button calls the same routine that the button on the 'TournamentSchedule' sheet calls.&nbsp; I just put a copy of that on this sheet for your convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay first off. Your&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong> able to uninstall skype for Samsung S8. My phone is unlocked, and bought directly from the samsung store. Microsoft and skype
<strong>force</strong> users to have certain apps. the S8 has no apps manager, and the only way to "remove" the app is to
<strong>disable</strong> it. There also is no option to clear cashe. And re downloading it from the play store dosnt fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to rephrase. the problem i am having is that when someone calls me on skype. from&nbsp;<strong>anyone</strong> it pops up on my phone, even when locked. and gives an option to pick it up and RINGS IT MAKES A NOISE!!!! when im sitting on my pc, FULLY capable
 of picking it up there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I CANT EVEN UNINSTALL IT!!! OMG.&nbsp;</p>

            As long as you have a perfect internet connection (regardless if it's WiFi or mobile data), emails should work perfectly. For further investigation, are you accessing the same web address "m.hotmail.com" when your phone is connected to a WiFi connection?
 If so, please try to access <strong><a href="https://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.outlook.com</a></strong> instead.<br />

            <p>The font change is probably because the two documents (source and target) have different default formatting. I'm not sure why you lose font attributes such as bold and italics, though. It may indicate that a faulty add-in is interfering with copy and paste.</p>

            <p>Go to <strong>File | Options | Advanced: Cut, copy, and paste</strong> and see what the settings are for pasting between documents and pasting from other programs. If&nbsp;"Merge Formatting" is&nbsp;selected, then the result you see is to be expected; you need to
 change to "Keep source formatting." But the default for style conflict situations (which will be common between Word documents) is "Use Destination Styles." This would account for the font change; as for losing italics or bold, the rule here is that
<strong>direct</strong> font formatting (font formatting not defined in the style) is preserved provided it is applied to less than 50% of the selection. If it's more than half, it will be removed.</p>

<h2>            cannot open any more tables</h2>
                    <ul>
<li>I have an application that I wrote in Access 2003, that worked fine in Access 2007 and now gets this error in Access 2010.&nbsp; The code is in a front end that links to a database backend. I do a lot of looping in VB, but always close queries and tables...I
 have not yet found a good answer or solution to this issue.&nbsp; In my application, it works the first time I try a function, and then gets this error the second time I call it.</li></ul>

            <p>Please quote any error messages VERBATIM.</p>
<p>Also, if you want us to investigate, make a copy of the database available, stripped to the bare essentials, removing any sensitive information.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The reason I ask is that generally speaking upgrading from A2003 -&gt; 2007 -&gt; 2010 is not a problem. You must have some special situation going on.</p>

</p>
<p>You are on the latest Office 2010 service pack, right?</p>

You could post your code that links the tables here. Maybe that will be enough for one of us to spot the problem.</p>

I don't know what has changed but I do know 2010 databases are bigger than 2007 or 2003. I guess it's the nw features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To monitor the database size, open Windows explorer to the folder with the database. Run your routines. With focus on the Explorer, press F5 every few seconds to refresh the window and see what size the file is.</p>

<p>You can modify the style named Bibliography to make the text Times New Roman 12pt double spaced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S to open the Styles pane.</li><li>Click in one of the bibliography entries. You should see the highlight on the Bibliography style.</li><li>Depending on the exact build of Word you have, either right-click the highlighted style or click the down-arrow to the right of it, and choose Modify in the menu.</li><li>In the Modify Style dialog box, set the font dropdowns to Times New Roman and 12pt, and click the double-spacing button (the third of the three line spacing buttons).</li><li>Click the option at the bottom for "New documents based on this template", and click OK.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using APA citation style, as it appears from your sample, the first line of each entry will start at the left margin and the other lines will be indented. These things are in the coding of the APA style and can't be changed unless you're willing
 to dig into the XML language. You can select the whole bibliography and then drag the markers on the horizontal ruler to make the first lines indented the same as the other lines -- but if you later update the bibliography, the alignment will go back to the
 way APA style is defined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can click in the References heading, which is in Heading 1 style (usually left-aligned) and press Ctrl+E, or click the Center button in the Paragraph group of the Home tab. That will remain in place when you update.<br />

            Your 'References' heading is most likely formatted with the Heading1 Style. Changing it's alignment, etc., could be done by modifying that Style, but this would affect everything else to which the Heading1 Style is applied.
