<h2>            Microsoft OneNote &#34;Account Does Not Exist&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a school Office 365 account and have full access to the office 365 apps available online.&nbsp; However, when I downloaded the office OneNote 2016 desktop app for my iMac (running 10.10.5) and try to sign in, I'm met with the following error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When I try to sign in I get this message:</p>
<p>"That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different account or get a new one."</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I try to create a new account I get this message:</p>
<p>"You can't sign up here with a work or school email address. Use a personal email, such as Gmail or Yahoo!, or get a new Outlook email."</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, I suggest you try the following steps to sign into OneNote:</p>
<p>1. Open OneNote.</p>
<p>2. Select OneNote&gt;click Sign in.</p>
<p>3. Type your school account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. The screenshot of <a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Subscriptions</a>.</p>
<p>2. Check if you can sign into other Office programs, such as Word.</p>
<p>3. The screenshot of the sign in window. We can check if it is same with normal situation.</p>
<p>4. Where did you download OneNote?</p>
<p>5. The Office version. (Open OneNote&gt;select OneNote&gt;click About OneNote)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Qing </p>

    <title>TOC indentation problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> westweasel  say:</h3>
<h2>            TOC indentation problems</h2>
                    <p>The TOC indentation on several of our documents got messed up. I am trying to figure out how to fix it, and knowing what caused this would be a nice bonus. There are two problems. The section headers are indented much too far; they should have the least
 indent. And the page numbers to not line up to make a neat column. See picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The TOC is automatically generated. All the headings are formatted using the heading styles (H1, H2, etc). So far as I can tell, they have no custom formatting applied. And in Format -&gt; paragraph, all of the headings are set to an indent of 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Unless you have modified the TOC styles, they are all set to update automatically. This means that if you change the formatting of a single entry at a given level, the change will be applied to the style so that all the other entries are immediately corrected.
 The easiest way to do this for paragraph formatting of this nature is to drag the indent and tab markers on the horizontal ruler. With the insertion point in one of the TOC 1 paragraphs, drag the left indent back to the left margin and drag the right-aligned
 tab marker to the right margin. Repeat for the tab marker of TOC 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that, if you have applied a right indent to any of the TOC styles, you won't be able to drag the tab marker to the right of the indent. You can set it to the right of the indent, provided it is inside the right margin, but you have to do it through
 the <strong>Tabs</strong> dialog.</p>

            Hello. No, it is a very unique file type as you have learned. You actually will only be able to use the file on the exact same type of device (e.g. Touch) running the exact same version of Windows Mobile. There are no readers for the PIM.vol file. It especially
 won't function on the Wildfire, which is an android device. If it is very important to you, you might want to look on eBay for a Touch. Make sure it is not running any custom ROM and the stock Windows Mobile OS. You probably don't care what condition it is
 in if all you want to do is get the contacts/calendar off it. If you go that route, let me know and we can get that PIM info for you. Oh, and if I may ask, why didn't you ever sync the Touch to Outlook?

            Hi, thanks for the reply.
<div>I have managed to get my hands on a replacement HTC Touch, same model as i had previous.</div>
<div>i have tried to replace the existing PIM.VOL file using the windows mobile device software, however this did not work. Can you please advise if this file can be restored.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The reason i had not synced it with outlook is that the phone was mainly use a a back up as i had a HTC desire which was stolen along with my laptop a week ago.</div>

            Hello. Did you go through the renaming procedure? The PIM.vol cannot just be copied over the existing file. So you have to rename the current one on the root of the device, e.g. PIM1.vol, then copy over your PIM.vol to the device root. Wait a couple of
 minutes and give the device a soft reset.&nbsp;

            Yes i did rename the existing pim file however when i try to copy over the existing file i get an error report. the message reads that the device has been disconnected. i though this might have been due to the automatic lock on the device, so i disabled
 this and tried it again but i still get the same error message.
<div>Is there some setting i am missing on the device?</div>

            Hello. You are trying to copy the file via USB and WMDC, right? That is the only thing that is "connected" or "disconnected" but should be not relevant. Was the device in the process of syncing? Maybe the file is not getting to the device??? Is it a fairly
 large database? &nbsp;Do you have a SD card and card reader to try to eliminate the USB connection?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>On the phone, go to Start&gt;settings&gt;connection tab&gt;USB to PC and make sure the "advanced network functionality" is not checked. Soft reset the phone.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi, sorry to be a pain in the ****, 


but i am still having trouble transferring the file to the device. 


i have connected the device to my pc via USB and WMDC. 


it is the only connection to the pc. 


It had preformed a sync prior to copying the file. 


the file size is 796 KB. 


i did mange to copy the file across however after doing this i did a soft reset but i cannot access the contacts folder, it is as if it does not exist. 


any thoughts!

            Hello. No problem, just sorry you are still having problems. It is sounding like the OS is just not the same. I think the Touch was upgraded to 6.1 so if you don't remember ever upgrading, you may have been running 6.0. You can check that: Start&gt;settings&gt;system
 tab&gt;about. &nbsp;That is enough to cause it not to work. Do the calendar functions appear to be working? I suppose the file could have got corrupted by the copying. Only things I can think of to try is use of the storage card/card reader to get the file to the
 device. Outside chance it was corrupted during the USB file transfer. Delete off the renamed PIM file completely from the root directory so there is no chance of conflict. Give the device a few more soft resets to see if that helps. Wish I could be more help.
 Don't know why MS made it so difficult.
<div><br />
<div>Lastly, a few desperate people have opened the file in a text editor like Notepad. It will appear jumbled like a raw data file but the contacts names and numbers will be legible. If you only have a few important people you want to recover and alot of patience,
 you can ctrl-f (find) through it. Good Luck.&nbsp;<br />

            Thankyou for answering. I had no trouble until i switched from Android to Windows a few months ago. That only happened as a new salesgirl at my Cricket store slipped one by me. I appreciate your help but in the morning I'm changing carriers and retuning
 to Android. Lumia and Windows have many good features but after years on Android the switch is just to much. Again thank you all.

            <p>Hello Lenoreo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft community and welcome to the Windows 10 family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are few major improvements that Microsoft has introduced in Windows 10. Few of the main highlights are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1) Start Button&nbsp;is back</strong></p>
<p>The Start Menu will allow you to access apps, search for content as well as pin apps, contacts and websites into it.</p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>2) Windows 10 price</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 will be FREE for existing Windows 7 and 8/8.1 users for the first year.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3) Improved multitasking</strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 will introduce a quadrant layout allowing up to four apps to be snapped on the same screen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4) Improved Memory utilization and DirectX 12 support</strong></p>
<span><br />
<br />
</span>
<p>Hope the above information is helpful. If you need further assistance, we are here to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>W10 does have a few good features, BUT I notice the negative were not mentioned in the above reply From Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOME of the Negative.</p>
<ol>
<li>Its often unstable, often it breaks when updates are installed.</li><li>If you do an upgrade install from W8.1, be prepared to wipe your drive and install again from fresh, seen so many failed or crappy upgrades its not even remotely funny.</li><li>You cant easily turn off updates, Microsoft FORCE them out </li><li>Some programs simply wont work on W10</li><li>Just look through the posts in this form, and see all the various problems people are having. Do you want an unstable system ?</li><li>From experience, two of my own W10 PC's have needed to be reinstalled at least once a month from fresh, due to updates either system or driver updates screwing the systems. ( yeaaa -- Fun)
</li></ol>
<p>Theres lots more no doubt someone will add.</p>
<p>End of the day try it yourself.</p>

            <p>*<strong>Windows 8.1</strong> is better still...it is the best Windows system...Windows 10 comes in second place, it not as good...and Windows XP comes in third because it's out dated but VERY stable</p>
<p>*<strong>Windows 8.1</strong> has <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">one </span>
click Full Start screen, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">one</span> click All app screen,
 more difficult to modify pinned apps and they are sized poorly and mostly all the same colors...</p>
<p>When you close the Start and Menu screen say by accident one has to start all over again...sucks</p>
<p>Many app screens still crash occasionally...</p>
<p>Right clicking on apps/icons in Menu, also causes the menu to crash many times,..again having to start all over again.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">But...</span></em>otherwise <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
*Windows 10 </span>is not bad... keep on experimenting .*john</p>

            <p>Yup starting to see more of #4 on your list with latest updates.</p>
<p>Trying to install some of my older programs, netpersec, in my case and when I tried to install it nothing seemed to happen then when I ran the troubleshooter it finally told me why: "this is an incompatible program" and thus could not install it!</p>
<p>Seriously thinking of just wiping the whole thing and going back to Win8.1 because at least I already had most of the programs/games I use working there and it was at least stable and gave me a lot less headaches!</p>
<p>Even if you manage to get it stable seems the next Windows update manages to break it somehow!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot I took of latest reliability history and you can see how often OneDrive likes to crash!</p>
<p>windows calc update failed? didn't even know they even needed to update that?</p>

            Thanks for responding, John. I have made no changes to my email settings. Note that it works fine late at night, but any time during the day, it's slow (with lots of stopping and server disconnects). My connection speed remains virtually the same, whether
 it's day or night. This has been going on for a week. My service provider says my connection is fine.

 pretty stable. If it becomes unusable again, I'll do another late-night update, or try your suggestion about using a different email address with the same IMAP settings.

<p><span>Well, shoot. Still having problems. Retrieving Outlook email, via Thunderbird, is fine at night... but during the day it is really slow. It often freezes on “Loading Message” for several minutes, then I get “Server
<em>{my email address}</em> has disconnected. The server may have gone down or there may be a network problem.” (A Frontier IMAP email account in Thunderbird continues to work fine.)
</span></p>
<p><span>As far as trying a different email address with the same IMAP settings, do I need to create a second MSN account to do that?

<p><span><span>Solution:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Due to recent changes in Microsoft IMAP servers that handle Outlook.com/Hotmail for third-party email programs, the default settings for incoming and outgoing mail servers must be updated. Due to bottlenecks in server
 allocation, using the default server settings in third-party email programs can lead to server timeouts, server disconnects, and slow loading of messages. At the present time, the issue has been confirmed for Thunderbird email. Note that the fix below applies
 to email programs configured for IMAP, not POP.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To update settings in Thunderbird...</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            continuous looping of picture in a slide in ppt</h2>
                    I have five pictures in a single slide midway in a presentation.&nbsp; They currently fade in and fade out through all five pictures however I would like to loop it so that they continue whilst the presenter talks about the contents of the slide.&nbsp; Have been
 unable to do it althou find plenty of information about looping slides - not the same thing.

<p>Pinkun,</p>
<p>If looping slides is not an option, then I am afraid you are out of luck. You cannot loop a series of animations in PPT 2007. There is this add-in though:</p>

<p>Be sure to run the AVG Removal Tool: </p>
<p>AVG Removal Tool: <span><a href="http://www.avg.com/us-en/utilities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avg.com/us-en/utilities</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And see the following please:</span></p>
<p>Prior Security Software?&nbsp; What about a trial version of an antivirus program that was pre-installed when the computer was purchased? McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro?</p>
<p>Sometimes remnants of prior security software will suddenly cause issues with your current antimalware program.
</p>
<p>A <b>possible</b> reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Be sure you have removed all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You <b>may</b> need to uninstall/reinstall MSE.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You should be able to remove MSE from Control Panel. Any problems uninstalling see:

<p>Recommend you reboot the computer to ensure the uninstall is complete.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You can download&nbsp;a new&nbsp;MSE Installation File from <span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></span></p>

The 645 error is almost always due to a conflict with other security software.

            <p>Hi Lance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I'm glad to assist you with your inquiry. If I understand your concern correctly, utilizing the Advanced search feature within Outlook.com disappears after a certain period of time. To start with, I've simulated your concern
 on our end and I didn't encounter the same behaviour. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

            <p>Hello JASONCOVINGTON,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have understood correctly your Advanced search option in Outlook.com also times out and you've been experiencing this for almost a month and you've encountered this issue even with other browsers and computers. Please be informed that the issue with
 the search function in Outlook.com should be fixed by now as indicated <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/email/search-stopped-working-see-this-response-from/37a034a7-9825-485d-971a-3bfc3e1a08fa">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you're still experiencing this issue with your account, please verify if you've tried to optimize your browser&nbsp;and&nbsp;have you tried using updated browsers when accessing your account. If you&nbsp;haven't tried&nbsp;this&nbsp;yet, please refer to
<strong>Ken_Rey_C.</strong>'s post for the link on how to do this and access your account on&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-wlsettings/which-browsers-are-supported-by-skydrive-people/63a2884f-99d9-4d21-806a-156c1b185b44">updated
 browsers</a></strong>&nbsp;and let us know the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please provide the exact error that you're receiving for further investigation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, do you have a POP or other accounts configured with&nbsp;your email address?&nbsp;If yes, please be informed that using POP Aggregation or manage email accounts with large volumes of mail can hit your max quota very quickly.&nbsp;When the mailbox is very large,
 the Search index may stop working and require re-indexing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your response. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Happens with all computers, all browsers. All are up-to-date and current. The Link is from 2012. The problem is still there. The message appears as a banner at the top of the page after about 20-30 seconds of searching. Happens with 'regular' search and
 advanced search.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>There was a problem with the Outlook service (a temporary network connectivity issue that has nothing to do with your computer). Please try again. &nbsp;If you keep seeing this message, go to
<a href="http://g.live.com/9ep9slc/mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Service status</font></a> to check if there's a problem with Outlook.
</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>The service status shows no problems. This happens every time, regardless of what I am searching for.</p>
<p>It is as if the search is timing out because the results are not coming back fast enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, when I use the right-click-menu option to move all emails from a particular user to a folder, this does complete after about 2 or 3 minutes, often finding a couple hundred message that match. So
</p>
<p>that form of search does work, but is only useful for messages from a particular user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the advanced search 'folder' drop-down only allows selection of a top level folder. That is a separate problem. However, if I select an empty folder, the search returns immediately with, obviously, no results. If I choose a folder with ONE
 or more items (yes, including just ONE item), it times out.</p>

            I tried the multiple browsers and tried updating and optimizing them. I don't know what you mean by POP. There is one other email account that had been configured with my account, but I don't get email there and I don't use it. I think the issue is the
 latter, the large volume. I am a premium member since the 1990s and use this as my only email address. Although I delete old mail, I have never archived or re-indexed. How do I do that? What is my max quota? Can you help me out? I am at the verge or changing
 to something else since right now I can only access one page of emails from that day. I cannot search or scroll or anything. I am paralyzed and this has been going on for a month.<br />

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">Lance Kibblewhite</font> and <font color="#0072c6">JASONCOVINGTON</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to us. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As what previous moderator said, when a mailbox is too large, search function may stop working and may need re-indexing. Indexing is a system-generated process of tagging your emails so that it can be identified using the search feature.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your question about the "maximum quota" of emails, we still need to verify it from our investigating team.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For investigation purposes, we need the information I have posted in the private message area I've created for each of you.

<p><br />
You see, this is part of the problem. I ask what does 'max quota' mean, the implication been that we are told there no limits, in fact, I have outlook plus, which gives me 10G, which is considerably more than what I am using. And we ask what does re-indexing
 mean, the implication been how do we cause that, and why would it be necessary, and why is re-indexing different to indexing? Using a common IT interpretation, it means something like the indexing failed and needs to run again. Why as consumers do we care
 about that? Things fail. Why is it such a big deal that it needs to be redone, and why does it take so long for the redoing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the answer we get is to effectively that reindexing is reindexing, and the max-quota is&nbsp;something you yourself do not know, and may not even exist. These are not useful answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you treat us like children?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of use work in this industry. We have the skills to understand more technical answers, many of us have the skills that we could write the code behind outlook.com. We know how these systems work, the technologies in use, and how it all fits together.
 We know the easy parts, and we know the hard parts. When we hear that you indexing algorithm has a bug with some form of quota limit, we shake our heads in disbelief that your implementations would be so poorly developed. This is a basic deficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also know that not everything can be done in a day. But for a system to have such a defect for going on a year now is incredible. Somebody hard coded an arbitrary&nbsp;limit, and mountains need to be moved to correct it.</p>

            I concur. I work at Symantec. Microsoft has not been any help at all here. They keep sending me generic replies and the custom replies ask me to do a laundry list of items that end with no results. I am going to have to change to another email provider,
 I guess, but how can I copy 15 years of archived emails somewhere so I can access the important communications and contacts?

Hi everyone,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Does anyone has experience&nbsp;with integration on-premises AD with AWS SSO and then with Office 365?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
The main goal&nbsp;is to use AWS SSO which will be integrated with AWS AD connector&nbsp;with on-premises and then AWS SSO will connect to Office 365 using SAML.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
After that, I'm not sure is it possible to do a hybrid&nbsp;with Office 365 and on-premises Exchange and SFB and does Outlook and other apps work well?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Also, I'm not sure do I need Azure AD connect tool with this configuration? Seams I don't need it.</p>

<p>Hello Marko,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try to use the Azure Active Directory to integrate with AWS for configuring the SSO.

<p>Hi Rudy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for reply.</p>
<p>If i understand it well, this is how to integrate Azure AD with AWS but first i think i need to install Azure AD connector and sync users to Azure AD then then perform this integration?</p>
<p>I'm interested in part where I'll use AWS AD connector to connect on premises AD to AWS and then use SAML on AWS for Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case do i need to install and configure Azure AD connector at all on my on premises? And does anyone oknow who it works in real life, since i saw limitation for AWS like:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span><strong>Does AWS SSO support single sign-on to native mobile and desktop applications?</strong></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<em>No. AWS SSO supports single sign-on to business applications through web browsers only.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

<p>Thanks for you reply. And we can fully understand your situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is official article to describe your scenario. Given this situation, perhaps chatting with the AWS support channel is a better way.

<p>Everyone in our office has the same issue.&nbsp; Began with the last set of updates on Oct 10, 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs with an empty Excel spreadsheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You type a letter, or click on a cell, or use the arrow key, and the CPU jumps to max instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting Excel in Safe Made by pressing&nbsp; &amp; holding&nbsp; "ctrl" increases excel response and CPU load is reduced about 50%...&nbsp;&nbsp; but the typing (I'm just simply pressing the "arrow" key to navigate around the spreadsheet) is still jumpy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't think any add ins are the issue...&nbsp;&nbsp; problem occurred with the latest update!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be able to improve response by starting in safe mode, then maybe in a few weeks they'll have found and fixed the issue in the next update....</p>

</p><p>Of course, Chris might have meant Excel in Office 365, which is currently Excel 2016 (sort of). But it is important to make a distiction between Office 365 and Office 2016 (stand-alone) as well as Excel in Office 365&nbsp;and Excel 2016 (stand-alone). They are
 all different.</p>

I have exactly the same problem within the office. Has been plaguing us for weeks and I'm now out of suggestions other than bin it and move to Google Sheets...<br />

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that you've already tried multiple troubleshooting steps to have this issue resolve. We would like to know if you tried uninstalling and reinstalling your Excel app? Also, were you able to repair your Office apps? This will actually help us resolve
 the problem with Office app like Excel or Word. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response. </p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>My original issue is resolved. I cannot pinpoint which or any of the many things I tried was "the" fix. I suspect it was a case of many incremental improvements and a further windows 10 update to finish, but I didn't watch closely enough. (to answer an earlier
 question , I am running a local installation of Office 2016, not Office 365. I hope others have also found a solution after my unhelpful input.)</p>

<p>I have encountered this many times and have just realised that each time, its when i have opened a file that is waiting for me to click on the Enable Editing button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work with a lot of downloaded sheets from client sites and if i leave one too long, Excel 2016 goes very very slowly, even on my new laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as soon as i enable editing or close the file, Excels cpu usage drops from high 40% to 3 or 4 %</p>

<p>We did resolve this, but have also signed up for Google Apps and will be migrating next year. I ended up having to roll all office installations back by about 6 months (<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Version
 1705 (Build 8201.2102)</span>). <br />
<br />
I had to push Group Policy to disable Windows Updates and change to the Semi Annual channel, rather than Semi Annual Targeted channel. I will try re-enabling updates in a few months in the hope that the issue has been mysteriously addressed.<br />
</p>
<p>We were using Office 365 Pro Plus and Excel 2016, and ended up trying both Version 1711 (Build 8730.2127) and Version 1708 (Build 8431.2131), same issue in both. I believe the issue was introduced in builds prior to this though, some time around the start
 of September or thereabouts. There was no resolution for those recent versions for us. It wasn't waiting for input as per Mike Ansell's suggestion (but thanks anyway for the suggestion), it was just a buggy build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roll back procedure:<br />

<p>
</p><p>I hope the above can help anyone in similar situation, it became a crippling problem for our business as more and more PC's got patched with the buggy build.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What worked specifically was step 12, disabling the Hardware Graphics Acceleration.&nbsp; Excerpt from the post Jeraldine provided:</p>
<p>
</p><p>12. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For possible resolution regarding your concern, see the methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Perform a Clean Boot<br />
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A <strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps
<strong>eliminate software conflicts</strong> that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also
<strong>troubleshoot </strong>or <strong>determine what conflict is causing the problem
</strong>by performing a clean boot. See this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> as a reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Start computer in Safe Mode</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Safe mode</strong> starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you
<strong>troubleshoot problems</strong> on your PC. For more information, see this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
