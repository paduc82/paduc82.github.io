<h2>            VBA Macro-generated emails fail to leave the Outbox</h2>
                    <p>I have used macros to process files as attachments and then generate emails. See
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/export-worksheet-to-pdf-using-vba/ff44be80-ca9c-4ce9-a067-b5644c34dbdc?auth=1">

<p>
</p><p>All works fine almost ... the emails are generated and arrive in the Outbox, but they stay there. They stay there even though subsequent general emails are created and are cleared from the Outbox. If I open an email and press 'send' again, it doesn't leave.
 If I drag the email from the Outbox to the Inbox, open it and press send, it does leave.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The macro that generates the emails is below. Can you help please? TIA .... Greg</p>

            It is fixed. The Sub SendAndReceiveAll() was not required after all.&nbsp; I had a local data file as well as a data file that is kept in sync with the network. The problem of emails failing to leave the outbox was fixed by&nbsp;changing the default to the network
 data file. Hooray, thanks very much Graham.

<h2>            This Is Directed to All and Sundry Present. How are We going to Handle the Vulnerabilities in our Communications &#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, and thank-you All for having me. I am not a tech, and though my IQ is 140, it tends to the Arts and Humanities, being</p>
<p>rather clumsy at technical and mechanical matters. This statement intends to sum-up my capacities in a humble manner ;
</p>
<p>in many ways, education's never complete, and ails of gaps and also ' vulnerabilities ' which, if at all at our power or reach to</p>
<p>elucidate or fix, the attempt should always be taken. I say this because I, like many, brought up within a Christian Catholic</p>
<p>framework did suffer a huge mistake interpreting this word, this virtue - ' humility.' Humility and humble come from the Latin</p>
<p>root word ' humus ', which means ' of the earth.' And to be ' humble ' means to have one's feet well-planted on the ground on self-consideration, not letting, or permitting the latter fly-off thru...fantasy, let's say, to illusory or delusional levels. To
 put it even simpler : WE ARE WHAT WE ARE, not what we would like to project, and not what our diplomas and other achievements</p>
<p>would signal us as. Humbly, our vision of total reality is keen. Not so within grandiosity or its direct opposite.</p>
<p>Here you can see - quite transparently, my intelligence's native inclination.</p>
<p>But there are matters that affect the totality of existence, and which permit not of a cubby-holing in the right or left side of the brain.</p>
<p>One of these Affairs, of GREAT IMPORT, has always been, for me COMMUNICATIONS.</p>
<p>A brief comment should suffice. Some 45 years ago, just officially a young adult I was, I took a ride to a well-known beach near Santo Domingo, the Capital of the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>I was in a particularly philosophical mood that day, which in my case, means much use of the visual faculties to give form to my thoughts or questioning. I had a great time on that day, but also a new door had opened ; I saw ( to put it somehow ) the very
 essential fact of communications as CENTRAL to human life and endeavor.</p>
<p>So that's my intro.</p>
<p>Now, I believe the introduction of the computer as the main pole of communications, pole-mode, has happened TOO quickly. Life and evolution are constant change, quite so ; but both keep a tempo, a pace, dangerous to change. Traditions</p>
<p>exercise a similar function. Example. Though we live in the beginnings of the 21st Century, any true student of Law - for example - will not be at ease studying developments made in the last half-century. He will go to the source of our legal system, Common
 Law, study its genesis, and development with all the possible ramifications it holds. This, in a way, I equate with tradition. About tradition youth, in general terms, exercises a rather impatient attitude, some wanting to chuck it all overboard, that the
 skiff might sail faster. An old saying goes ' Do not throw the baby out with the bathwater.' So, a general</p>
<p>respect for the traditional and established is benevolently quite part of the order of things.</p>
<p>In 25 years time, because of the huge and sudden change in communications - not slowly absorbed, but rather - I felt it much more as ' imposed ' , we have gone from telephone operators and attendants to a profusion of automated robots,</p>
<p>may I add - ill-fitted for the task. </p>
<p>If you clear ur throat when seeking something from an attending robot, it quite often mistakes it for an option ; and then, if that mistaken option's not seen - and quite quickly - ur in for another 20 minutes of useless bandying about on the phone, from
 here to there...I can well imagine some 70 year old men or women, at this point, and given an ever present choice to go online to such and such a dot.com, going directly psychotic and throwing the mini-cellphone, courtesy of the government, against a wall,
 hard ball fashion, or just plain becoming catatonic. Due-and-real consideration was never applied to the systemic system supplanting the old.</p>
<p>Also, every personal computer is HACKABLE at the moment, and no easily acquirable remedy is offered on the market.</p>
<p>Some IT capos, or experts, not too long ago - a couple of months ago - wrote quite clearly in an article appeared on</p>
<p>" WIRED " magazine...' being hacked is one of the most catastrophic and furiously stressful events which can happen to any modern [ woman or man ] '</p>
<p>And I still do not see a fix.</p>
<p>Anyhow, this is my point. Science follows as a result of complying with some invariable requirements. TRIAL and ERROR and RISK are 3 of them. A hypothesis cannot be called true until it has been finally sifted perfectly thru at least these 3 modes, and is
 RELIABLY PREDICTABLE.</p>
<p>Our tech, dominating now the globe, is definitely NOT SCIENTIFIC. It is simply put, APPLIED TECHNOLOGY full of holes and the so called VULNERABILITIES. And yet, IT RULES.</p>
<p>Now, how can we be - a) humble enough [ getting-off our Silicon Valley Arabian horses from which to gauge the world with an intrepidness and arrogance that neither Columbus or Vasco Da Gama ever showed ; why not even Albert Einstein ! ] and admit we still
 have a loooooooong way to go.</p>
<p>I think this is peremptory, essential, and without this new attitude, we could hit civilization's lowest, instead of a very possible highest, thanks to the very systems we DO NOT CONSIDER in a humble manner ?</p>
<p>Do the parents of our present IT CEOs have any blame in the matter ?</p>
<p>Perhaps...remember it was they who coined the phrases ' We Are The Lords of the Universe ' and ' whoever has more toys when he dies, wins...' No, these were ' valid personal philosophic worldviews ' sustained by not a few ' capos ' not so long ago. The only
 place I could properly find for such outrageous statements would be as part of some skits in Saturday Night Live, but even that great comic once a week show no longer exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TO SUM UP - WE NEED A NEW ETHOS TO ACCOMPANY OUR NEW COMMUNICATIONS. AND A HUMAN ETHOS, WHICH IS THE ITEM MOST AMISS IN WHATEVER THE HECK AMOEBA-ETHOS WE MAY DECLARE TO HAVE PRESENTLY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, since this was and is framed as a question. DO YOU SEE AND RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM ?</p>
<p>IF YOU DON'T, PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM ANSWERING.</p>
<p>IF YOU DO, ALL SUGGESTIONS ARE GOOD, LIKE IN AN INTERNATIONAL THINK-POOL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TX,</p>
<p>J</p>

            I do believe if you are so fearful of what you have posted maybe it's time to hit the OFF switch, button, lever, unplug, disconnect, or whatever device you need as we are not going back into the caves. and as this is a site for testing a BETA version of
 software and your question(?) has nothing to do with testing, and isn't the place to be posted. Just like your other postings that ramble on with no real directions and have nothing to do with testing of Preview versions of Win10

            <p>Hmmm, I do not think that is the problem.</p>
<p>I see a factor of ten at play here. Very insidious and hard to detect. When you multiply numbers by ten, they get bigger and can swell to proportions unintended. Being excessively verbose and assuming high intelligence is a typical manifestation of this
 problem. Check the windows log files for the ID-10-T notation and see what you find there. Report back your results, here for further analysis. I bet you are going to find you have a faulty processor.</p>

<p><strong>Get-Mailbox | Get-RecipientPermission -Trustee *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Get-Mailbox | Select-Object displayname,grantsendonbehalfto | ft -a</strong></p>
<p>

                    <p>Hello I am hoping someone can help me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regularly receive long questionnaires from customers that are created in Excel.&nbsp; Many of the questions we get from different customers are the same and could be filled in easily if there were a building blocks gallery but alas I cannot find one in Excel.&nbsp;
 I am thinking about a different method but I would ideally want to use the same method got both Word and Excel.&nbsp; Thus avoiding having to teach two different methods to the staff that respond to the questionnaires.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Opening Word to Same Size Window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pkp2019  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opening Word to Same Size Window</h2>
                    This question has arisen in the past, but I cannot find a solution. I am using Word for Mac version 16.25 on a large screen monitor. I size my Word windows to display a page in print view essentially the same dimensions as the printed page. Recently, whenever
 I open either a new or an existing document, the window opens much smaller, and I have to drag the edges to get back to my preferred window size. This is new. I cannot find a way to restore the way windows opened previously. How do I fix this?

<h2>            sync deleted all my videos on my phone - wasn&#39;t my intent, but the zune UI is soooooooooooo confusing</h2>
                    <p>Found the Zune Sync UI extremely confusing . . . Had videos on my phone I wanted to sync to the PC, but Zune said my phone was too full to sync so I had to manually delete videos but how could I tell which video was which?&nbsp; They all had filenames that were
 numeric and didn't make any sense to me.&nbsp; I accidentally selected all of them thinking maybe the list was of the videos on my Zune/PC.&nbsp; When it started syncing/deleting I panicked realizing it was wiping all my precious videos (none of which ever made it to
 my PC) from my phone!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at my phone, 100% of my videos are gone.&nbsp; Is there any way to get these back via a restore?&nbsp; Am I totally out of luck?</p>

            <p>Hello RosiePup,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zune's default behavior is to immediately begin syncing from the PC to the Phone/Zune Player once a connection is established.
</p>
<p>Information about changing default sync options can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/support/usersguide/yourzune/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zune.net/en-us/support/usersguide/yourzune/default.htm</a>&nbsp;,</p>
<p>there are a number of important topics listed under the "Sync" heading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like that is what was happening here, only, in your case, there were already photos stored on the phone. Zune was attempting to load photos and/or music onto your phone and gave you an insufficient space error, and prompted you to delete images
 from your phone to resolve it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What actually&nbsp;needed to be done was a "reverse-sync" from the phone to the PC, as explained here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/support/sync/usingsync/reversesync.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zune.net/en-us/support/sync/usingsync/reversesync.htm</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are never happy to hear that anyone's media was lost due to confusion concerning the sync process. We do build in warnings&nbsp;when data is about to be deleted. Unless the photos had been uploaded to your Skydrive account, or unless they were synced to another
 PC, I believe that the photos are more than likely lost. I hope you were able to stop the process before all the photos were deleted.</p>
<p>We understand that instructions can be confusing, and resolutions to unforseen issues may be difficult to find. However, we do offer one-on-one chat support from 6:00 AM to Midnight, Pacific Time, seven days a week including holidays, and the forums are
 available 24 hours a day. We do&nbsp;try to have some kind of support available around the clock to help answer questions before data is lost or something is damaged.
</p>
<p>Once again, we hope that some, if not all, of the photos had been backed up to another location. If&nbsp; you ever need assistance, please do visit our Support Page at zune.net, or consult the Microsoft Answers forum. We are here to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for consulting Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>DavidKH.</p>

<br />
<br />If you need an access to your account that it works for some browsers.
<br />
<br />Try to use different one, for me it works in Microsoft Edge. This can be used as workaround.
<br />
<br />Hope the issue would be resolved soon.

            Hello daniel,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your patience.
<br />
<br />I am pleased to inform you that Outlook.com has fully completed its deployment of the fix that had impacted service availability for some users in the infrastructure and there should be no more service interruption now.
<br />
<br />See: <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a>
<br />
<br />In case it is still not working for you, it could be a browser-related issue.
<br />
<br />May I suggest you to delete your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and clear browser caches then restart the browser? 
<br />
<br />- selectively deleting browser cookies
<br /><a href="https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10/clearing-cookies-from-just-one-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10...</a>

<br />Alternatively, open in private mode ("incognito mode") or try with a different browser
<br />
<br />Otherwise, clear your DNS revolver caches: <code>Win</code>+<code>R</code> and enter <code>cmd.exe</code> then key in <code>ipconflig /flushdns</code>
<br />

                    <p>I am trying to set paragraph spacing with outline numbering, and the "Text indent" is measured in inches, but the "Tab stop" is measured in "px". &nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes not sense to have two sets of units when you are trying to set a tab stop to go along with the indent.</p>
<p>

<p>you sms messages are not stored on the sim card, so if the software you are trying to use is going to try to get your sms off the sim card, you will not retrieve anything.</p>

If so, you must pay the balance before you can cancel the subscription.

<h2>            cannot get into hotmail.com</h2>
                    I have had no luck trying to download from windows store. I receive a login screen from Microsoft "hotmail" requiring password, which I don't remember due to lack of use. Please advise I would like to download and update my apps.

            Shaira, thanks so much for your help. Well after following the link and doing what was asked I still could not get in. So you ask how did I get here. Well at some point I may have opted to sign in using an alternate email, so I choose my yahoo account.
 Here I am. Never the less when I try and download from my Nokia 635 I Am asked to enter password for hotmail account. Tried to change it and receive "this account is not recognized". What next?😵

            Sorry, the password is not retrievable by anyone, including Microsoft personnel.&nbsp; Whoever 'owns' the parent id is going to have to contact Microsoft to get the password reset for that ID.

<h2>            Web browser for mobile phone</h2>
                    Is there any mobile web browser for mobilephones, like the Symbian OS phones have?<br />
<br />
What I wanna' say is that Symbian OS browsers opens the entire page, like PC windows browsers, but on mobile you can zoom on the part you wanna' see, and explore the entire page moving around.<br />
<br />
For example I don't like miniopera because it restructures the entire page, and compacting it and it's very hard to use the menu-based pages, like online games for example.<br />
<br />
I have Nokia 6288, thanks

<h2>            I cannot see Microsoft Security Essentials on my computer. I have a laptop with Vista, and normally there is an icon on the taskbar.</h2>
                    It also normally shows up in the list of commonly used programmes after pressing the Start button, but it has vanished from here too. Does this mean it is no longer installed? I installed it a good while ago.

            <p>Look in Control Panel and see if MSE is still there.&nbsp; If not, then it's been uninstalled.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you receive a Windows Update in the last several days that would upgrade you to MSE V4 from MSE V2?&nbsp; If so and&nbsp;the new version&nbsp;did not install properly you may need to reinstall MSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><span>You can download&nbsp;a new&nbsp;MSE Installation File from
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>here</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OR...if MSE is still listed in Control Panel see the following:
