<h2>            Computer files are showing up in my Internet Explorer History&#63;</h2>
                    Why are files that I access on my computer now showing up in my Explorer History? &nbsp;They have nothing to do with the Internet. &nbsp;This concerns me greatly from a safety and security viewpoint.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running Windows 7 and Explorer 10. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have opened up sensitive files and other files in Excel, Word, etc. &nbsp;I now notice that in my browser History, it shows "Computer". &nbsp;When I click on "Computer", below it shows the Excel files from my computer that I had opened each day. &nbsp;Is Microsoft
 tracking files accessed on my computer now or is some hacker of some sort?</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am afraid to use Internet Explorer now and I will us another browser for safety, which I would prefer to use Explorer.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Explorer has been doing this since at least IE4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know of one way to stop this. Right-click the Taskbar&gt; Properties&gt; Start Menu&gt; Customize&gt; Documents&gt; Don't display this item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you could clear out this Computer folder once per day or at some other interval.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            No email sync since 5&#47;7&#47;16</h2>
                    <p>Cannot synchonise outlook on one particular account on Windows Phone 7.5 <br />
<br />
Last updated 5/7/16 <br />
"We're having a problem synchronising with m.outlook.com.<br />
Last tried 2 seconds ago<br />
Error code: 8600010B"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tried the normal, removed battery, turned back on. Most previous issues been sorted like that.</p>
<p>I then think, "Ah ive been hacked and my password is now wrong!". NOPE</p>
<p>I logged into my email fine on laptop.</p>
<p>Ok then outlook/hotmail down, or WP7 cannot get updates! NOPE</p>
<p>My other account on my phone is fine, its just my main account on my phone i cannout update for a week now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i looked for differences between how they update in settings.</p>
<p>My second account syncd through - server - m.hotmail.com</p>
<p>The main original account syncd through something like - eas.outlook.com (something like abs,aps, abp etc)</p>
<p>I tried changing it but it didnt stick.</p>
<p>Today its stuck and trying to updating through m.outlook.com.</p>
<p>ALAS the same error comes up, i get nothing refreshed, no new emails.</p>
<p>I cannot get it to change to m.hotmail.com like the other account :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then thought, "Ah ok ill delete my account, then re-add it!". NOPE. <br />
Cannot delete main account off a WP7.5 unless wipe entire phone!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, i know its not the phone( as one account updates fine),<br />
its not hotmail nor outlook, and both accounts work fine on laptop. So whats the problem?<br />
Some update in the Outlook changes switched off this EAS server transmision service thing??</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit:<br />
used to use <span>windowsphone.com to see some details, contacts, find my phone.<br />
Site just shows adverts for new phones now.<br />
Looking on my account has no phone registered. Could it have been removed??</span></p>

<h2>            word cannot open this document.</h2>
                    I've ust installed Office for Mac 2011, but I have been getting this error "word cannot open this document. the document might be in use or might not be a valid word document, or the file name might contain invalid characters...."<br />
<br />
If that's not enough, I cannot even create and save a file.<br />
"Word cannot save or create this file. The disk may be full or write-protected."<br />
<br />
Every workaround, fix that I found does not work.<br />
<br />
<br />
More problem?&nbsp; Of course!!!<br />
<br />
Microsoft Excel cannot access the file '&lt;path to file&gt;:<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone?<br />

            Had the same issue opening Word/PPT/Excel files from my shared desktop. Both hard drives had the same name -- 'Macintosh HD'. Once I changed the name of my one of my drives all was well.&nbsp;

            <blockquote>Over here (Snow Leopard) the Finder enforces a 255 max length in folder and file names. However, Word seems to stop at 246 characters for file names (but not for folders). Even if I nest five or six 255-character folder names,
 Word does open the file as long as the name has 246 characters or less. Attempting to open a file with longer names produces a "File not found" error.
<div><br />
<div>On my iMac, the file name you provided (109 charactrers) did not cause any problem.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been tracking several "Word 2011 Cannot Open File" threads on various systems. There seem to be several manifestations:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;1) Supposedly invalid character in filename.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2) Supposedly invalid character somewhere in the pathname (including name of hard drive).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;3) Filename itself too long.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;4) File existing on a server somewhere (problem possibly stemming from 1-3 above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me (on OS X 10.7.5; I don't remember which cat this is), I have the issue baked down to a single problem (local hard drive only):</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Word 2011 (purchased via Office 365 product) WILL NOT OPEN a file, either by double-click or from Open Dialog, if the PATHNAME has a SEMICOLON in it. If the filename itself has a semicolon, it opens no problem. But if a semicolon is in ANY folder name
 in the path, no can do. This is totally reproducible. Remove semicolons from folder names, file will open. Put semicolon back in, no can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Guess what: I use tons of semicolons in folder names. So, Word 2011 is basically unusable for me. I refuse to rename folders to use the product; I refuse to pull every document I want to use to the desktop and then return it to the offending semicolon-burdened
 folder after I'm done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As others have noted, Excel 2011 and PowerPoint 2011 do NOT seem to have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Other testing: for me, other supposedly invalid characters (including slash, backslash, bullet, and others) in the path do not cause a problem. Oddly, a slash in the filename itself DOES make the file "no open." Go figure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HERE'S THE BIG QUESTION: After 4 years and these postings all over the universe, Microsoft is definitely aware of this ridiculous bug in JUST ONE of their flagship modules of Office. Why no fix?! When will it get fixed?! I mean, come on guys! Ask the Excel
 2011 team, or even the Word 2008 team, how they pulled off the amazing feat of opening a file with a ";" in the pathname. Make us proud!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Maby Skype isn't my main problem, Network struggle is instead due to the info #Tracert (10 hops of 30) and #ping (100% loss) is the main problem</p>

            Outlook for Mac's <b>Send</b> button does exactly that. It sends now. Unfortunately, Outlook for Mac does not have a Send Later feature.
<div><br />
<div>If you want mail to wait in the Outbox until you are ready to send then select
<b>Outlook</b> menu --&gt; <i>Work Offline</i>. This, of course, also disables receiving mail until you set Outlook to work online again.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Please be sure to let Microsoft know you'd like to see this feature in future versions by using the Help --&gt; Send Feedback mechanism in any Office application.</div>

<p>i had moved over from my Nokia N8 to first, the 920 and now the 1020, and had no problems at all.<br />
<br />
Download the latest version of Nokia Suite, and there is a tool in there that allows you to migrate your data over to SkyDrive which you can then pull down when you set up your new Windows Phone device. This pulls everything, your phone contacts, text messages,
 calendar entries etc. Simple and painless.<br />
<br />
The reason there are not a plethora of options like there was in Nokia Suite is because a lot of the services are cloud-based now, so there is no need to have a zillion options for everything. I was initially hesitant too, but have grown to love the simplicity
 and convenience of it all.</p>

            <p><strong>1. </strong>Are you accessing / monitoring your&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Account/Security/recentactivity.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>recent activity&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></a>to see what is going on with your account?
</p>
<p>If not please do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>What is the Recent activity page?</strong></p>
<div>
<p>The “Recent activity” page shows info about the activity in your Microsoft account, within the last 30 days.
</p>
<p>This includes any time that you <strong>(or someone else)&nbsp;</strong> signed in to your account, whether you used a web browser, your phone, an email app, a third-party app, or another method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have you read&nbsp; <strong>What should I do if I see unusual account activity?</strong></p>
<p>Viz...</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>You’ll probably recognise most of the account activities listed on your <strong>
Recent activity</strong> page.</p>
<p>Even if an activity sounds suspicious at first, you can expand it to see more details and decide whether you remember it.
</p>
<p>For example, if you accidentally made a typo in your password, you’ll see <strong>
Incorrect password entered</strong> in the list.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Or, if you signed in to your account from a mobile phone, you might find that your service provider routed the signal through a cell tower in another city.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>But if an activity looks unfamiliar, or if you see an unusual pattern (like multiple sign-in attempts or changes that you’re sure you didn’t make), let us know.
</p>
<p>We’ll help you make your account more secure to minimize any threats. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>If you click “This was me”:</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you tell us you were responsible for an activity, we’ll keep track of that info going forward.
</p>
<p>For example, if you sign in from a new location that happens to be the hotel you’re staying at on a business trip, we’ll add that location to the list of places we expect you might sign in from in the future.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>If you click “This wasn't me”:</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you tell us that you don’t recognise an activity, it’s possible that a hacker or a malicious user has gotten access to your account. To help protect your account, we’ll walk you through several steps, including changing your password and reviewing and
 updating your security info. </p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The September 2013 updates for Microsoft Office have caused problems for many Word users by somehow damaging the file associations for Word and other Office applications. These problems may be evidenced by any of the following
 symptoms:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The file icons are orange instead of blue.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Double-clicking on a Word document in&nbsp;Window Explorer generates an an error message (“The Office product necessary to open this file is not installed on this computer”) accompanied by a suggestion to purchase/install Office 2010
 (or 2013?) or to sign up for a 30-day trial of Office 365.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A prompt to enter the product key.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A message that <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"This program is unable to run because of missing or corrupted files.

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The users who seem to be suffering most are those who are using Office 2010 Starter. This is a free, advertising-supported version of Word and Excel installed by OEMs on new computers. It is not supported by Microsoft, only by
 the OEM, and once it is uninstalled, it is not possible to reinstall it except by performing a recovery installation with the OEM’s restore disk. Needless to say, Word Starter users who were told that this version would never expire are dismayed (to say the
 least) to find it suddenly not working, especially given the alarming suggestion that they need to upgrade to another version.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">While this problem seems to be affecting primarily Office 2007 and 2010 users, the solutions should work for any version. What is needed is to repair the file associations. There are several ways to do this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Word 2007:</strong> The simplest way to do this in Word 2007 is to go to

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Other versions:</strong> If you have only one version of Word installed, you should be able to repair file associations by “reregistering” Word, that is, allowing it to reestablish its “ownership” of specific
 file types (.doc, .docx, .dot, .dotx, etc.) in the Windows Registry. To do this you must run a specific command in the Windows Run box. How you open this box varies depending on your OS and personal settings, but in any version of Windows, you should be able
 to open it by pressing the Windows Key together with R.</span></span></span></p>

            The error message in some earlier Office versions (pre-2007) was more sinister. I don't have the exact message anymore, but it was words to the effect that Microsoft Office has determined that the file being opened has been corrupted.
<div><br />
<div>A relative was having this problem and feared virus infection because of the corruption message. The files could be opened from File&gt;Open within the application, and by dragging from Windows Explorer onto the application window, so we knew there was no
 corruption. When I actually got my hands on the computer, first thing I checked was file associations, so the problem was fixed in five minutes.</div>

            Thanks for this confirmation. We've seen several posts from users about files being corrupted, but in some cases, they insisted that the files were actually garbled even when opened from within Word, so it has been difficult to distinguish those cases
 from the general run. I'll edit the post above to add something about the corruption message.

            <p>You're welcome. I'm very disappointed in MS response on this, despite my repeated attempts to reach out to people in the Office product group. I had hoped that MS would either speedily issue a patch or at least put up an authoritative article to which we
 could point people. My post above doesn't presume to take the place of official MS information, but I figured users needed
<strong>something</strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see that there is now a post from the Microsoft Office Sustained Engineering team pointing to a blog post with a solution. I will add this to my original post.</p>

<p>I bought a new Lumia 830 in November 2014.&nbsp; It came with the Denim update but came with Nokia Camera.&nbsp; I cannot find Lumia Camera anywhere.&nbsp; Is it available for new 830's with Denim?&nbsp; I see Lumia Camera Classic but I assume that is not the same thing.&nbsp; I

<p>You will get the new Nokia Camera with all the improvements displayed at the #morelumia event in September (speed, 4K, rich capture, dynamic flash) when you get the Denim update.&nbsp; That is not the Denim that you have now, it is an UPDATE to it. Notionally
 Denim 1.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is rather ridiculous that Nokia / MS Mobile have not been able to articulate this better (or at all) with all of their blogs, websites, advertising, media and PR (no doubt with multi-million dollar budgets). Beyond ridiculous, actually.</p>

            <p>I don't believe that can be done. As I understand it, in Excel <em>hyperlink</em> is a property of the cell containing the text, not a property of the text, itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can do is create the hyperlink then select &amp; reformat everything except for the preferred word or phrase. IMO, that's far more trouble than it's worth... Not only is it a PITA to do, but it's an editing nightmare for further revision &amp; the user
 still must click the cell, itself, even if the term is displayed outside the cell.</p>
