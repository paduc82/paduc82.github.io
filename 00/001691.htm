    <title>Access Error 2766 regarding automation component - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Access Error 2766 regarding automation component</h2>
                    I have a simple 1-record table called TMPSearchKey which saves data that comes from 3 separate forms. The table/record is correct as far as the updating goes. The error appears in my macro when I try to SetTempVars for varSearch using [TMPSearchKey]![TMPSK]
 which is the field on the TMPSearchKey table that I want to use. I have tried everything I could think of. I even backed up my database and Ran the Compact and Repair option. This error has been a problem for 3-4 solid day of effort.

            <p>We'd have to see your code to help much further, but 2276 sometimes means you're trying to refer to something that's not open. Of course, you don't have to "open" a table, but it would be helpful to see the code (or a screenshot of the macro actions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to Compile your code? To do that, make a backup, then open the VBA Editor and click Debug - Compile. Fix any errors, and continue doing that until the Compile menuitem is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to create a new, blank database and import everything from the old database. Container corruption can cause strange issues, and the only way to fix that is to create a new container (i.e. database) and import everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also be sure your Windows and Office installations are fully up to date.</p>

            <p>Because this wasn't the only strange thing that has happened to my database, I opened another question called "Access 2016 hacked?" in which this same issue was mentioned along with 2 other weird issues. But following the suggestion, I just tried to Compile
 it but nothing changed. Since I had never done this before, after I clicked Compile on the VBA menu, it grayed out but nothing appeared anywhere, and I cannot click it again. I closed and reopened, but the same thing occurred. &nbsp;I am extremely concerned that
 I should NOT use Access to develop this unique Point of Sales system I am currently trying to write. That is not something I would want to stop working on a rare circumstance. Here are the specifics:</p>

                    <p>I have Windows 8.1 with media center pro on my computer. &nbsp;Have IE11 also. &nbsp;It was working fine until yesterday I don't think I did anything wrong,but now when I click on the icon it opens but won't connect to the internet all the tools are greyed out so
 I have to go through control panel to connect to internet options. Tried turning off features and turning it back on didn't fix it. &nbsp;google chrome works fine. &nbsp;Dosen't work from the App screen either. &nbsp;Tried to reset internet explorer to the default settings
 but it won't let me saying I need to close all windows programs first I did that and still get the same message. This is the first time I had a problem with IE 11. &nbsp;The only thing I did yesterday was downloaded Overdrive Media Console for deskstop and upgraded
 the security setting so I can play autobooks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these questions in order to understand the issue better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you download Overdrive Media Console from <strong><a href="http://omc.overdrive.com/windows.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">official website</a></strong>?</li><li>Are you using any third party antivirus program?</li><li>Did you try restarting the computer?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may face this issue if you have downloaded the programs from third party website which includes the virus or malware follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong><span>&nbsp;</span>I would suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security
 tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Also refer to this link: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/how-find-remove-virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/how-find-remove-virus</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Run Internet Explorer in no add-on mode and check if issue persists:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and then type <strong>iexplore -extoff</strong> and press ENTER.</p>
<p>b. Check if issue persists, if not some third party add-on is causing the problem, follow the steps provided to enable add-ons individually to determine which of the add-ons may be causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the article: Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer<br />
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>If issue persists, I would suggest you to boot into Safe Mode with networking and then try Resetting Internet Explorer and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Change or reset Internet Explorer settings</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Reset Internet explorer disclaimer:</span></strong></p>
<p>Disclaimer: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend
 that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> If issue persists, I would suggest you to perform System Restore. System Restore can return your PC's system files and programs to a time when everything was working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></li><li>Type <strong>rstrui</strong> and press <strong>enter.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Next </strong>and choose the restore point, when your computer was working fine.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</p>

            <p>Hi I had the same issue first thing after updating from 8 to 8.1 and IE 10 to IE11. I saw that the menu was greyed out in IE so I right-moused clicked the toolbar and selected 'Command Bar'. This brings up 'Tools'. I then went to the bottom option 'Internet
 Options' selected the 'Security' tab and then unticked -Enable Protection mode' and this unlocked the 'Reset all zones to default level' which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing this all was fixed.</p>

<h2>            Insert the Same Header into Multiple Documents</h2>
                    Hi there!<br />
<br />
I do a lot of work with technical writing, and I'm trying to find a way to cut down on the time it takes me do edit headers.<br />
<br />
Essentially, I want to automatically put the same header into multiple documents without having to copy / paste the header manually into each document. Each document will always have the same header...any ideas as to how I can do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Create a template specifically for starting new documents of this type, and include the header in the template. You can use various fields, such as StyleRef and Title, to pick up things that are specific to each document.<br />

</p><p>I have created a new Outlook email address to send these emails to so I can keep them but I can't send them from my iPhone app as the message reads 'they are not available on your server, contact support'.</p>

<p>Hi Paolo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through the Outlook app on my iPhone, I tried to forward an email to my new address from the Archive folder which it didn't allow me to do. I then moved the email to my Inbox through the Outlook app and it appeared in my Inbox. I then tried to forward the
 email to my new address from the Inbox but the message appeared 'This email no longer exists' even though it is in my Archive folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding configuration, I am not sure what you mean by those terms.</p>
<p>

            We appreciate the information that you have provided. Archiving emails is a way to reduce the size of your Outlook Data File, where emails that have been archived are moved to a separate Outlook data file which is why you're receiving the error message
<em>This email no longer exists</em>. For us to assist you, we suggest that you import the .pst file in your Outlook to have access to these archived emails.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back if you have further queries.

            You can download a program to download them for free: Shareaza. There you can search exactly for the game files, that have the .jar format. It offers lots of excellent options, like The Sims 2, Need For Speed ProStreet, Sonic and SimCity Societies.<br />
<br />
You must know that you need to have the PC Suite installed on your computer, because you need the Application Installer from it to install the games via Bluetooth or USB cable in your 7373.

            <p>Hello Wayne:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum.&nbsp; This is certainly an odd sounding behavior.&nbsp; It certainly sounds like the connection is timing our or being disrupted at some points.&nbsp; I have not heard other customers reporting this issue in relation to the update but
 we can certainly verify if this is the cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to verify if you are simply connecting via your data plan or if you are also connecting via Wi-Fi.&nbsp; If you are not connected to Wi-Fi please try connecting and inform us if the experience is different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this an issue you are only experiencing when at work?&nbsp; If you perfrom the same action on the phone at home or at a local hotspot do you get the same H symbol followed by lack of connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not quite tell from your original post if this is an issue that happens intermittently and then resolves itself or if you simply cannot connect at all in certain areas.&nbsp; If you are able to get this connection issue to go away, what action is taken
 right before it connects again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to hold off on testing if this is related to the update until we clarify some of the above.&nbsp; If you want to go forward, you can
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/restore-a-backup-to-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
restore your phone</a> to&nbsp;it's previous state.&nbsp; This will put the latest OS back on the phone in the condition it was just before updating.&nbsp; If you do this, be sure to back up any content added since the update as that will not be on the phone upon restore.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

</p>
<p>I come from a SFB background so I understand federation etc very well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However I haven't seen anything on if there is a similar function for Teams. ie from my teams client can I chat with another company also using Teams (or SFB). If this is possible how do you go about it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within the same tenant what is the current\future expected interop between a user using Teams and another using SFB from a IM&amp;P perspective (and audio perspective)</p>

<p>Hi Alistair,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my personal experience, it’s not feasible to commutate with other Microsoft Teams in different Office 365 tenants.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to communicate with Skype for Business users in your tenant, you can navigate to Chat interface and send instant message to them. Here is an article for your references:

<p>Hi PS Murray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, I want to know whether the public folder is shown in Portal (https://portal.office.com) -- Admin -- Users -- Deleted Users. If yes, please remove the public from there. Then wait for some time to check the issue.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please confirm the following information to better understand the situation:</p>
<p>1. Where do you find the public folder, in Outlook or Outlook Web App? Does the public folder show in Outlook Web App (https://outlook.office365.com/owa) -- People -- Directory?</p>
<p>2. Do you have the issue for all public folders or just this specific one?</p>
<p>3. Please use the command get-public folder and send us the screenshot for the result:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Following are answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0. There are multiple deleted public folders still appearing in the O365 GAL, but not the on-premises GAL.&nbsp; They do not appear in the Portal Admin &gt; Users &gt; Deleted Users.&nbsp; (They also do not appear under Active Users.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The deleted public folders appear in both Outlook and OWA.&nbsp; In OWA it appears under People/Directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Multiple deleted public folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will send additional information separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

</p><p>No.&nbsp; When I select "public folders" in the O365 EAC, I get a blank screen with the message "No public folders exist in this organization."&nbsp;&nbsp; This makes sense, since our public folders only exist in the Exchange 2007 environment.</p>

            It appears to me that you have somehow entered a debugging mode (sort of like a boot loader I think).&nbsp; If the&nbsp;soft reset does not work then if it were mine, as a last alternative,&nbsp;I would try a hard reset.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think this is how it is done on that device (but it should be explained in your user manual):<br />
Press the UP button of the navigation key and the reset button at the same time.<strong><br />
</strong><br />
<br />
As an aside, KITL means&nbsp;Kernel Independent Transport Layer.<br />
<br />
Just for some understanding, here is a partial explanation:<br />
<br />
<em><span><strong>The Kernel Independent Transport Layer (KITL) is designed to provide an easy way for you to support any debugging service. KITL separates the protocol of the communication service from the layer that
 communicates directly with the communication hardware. This reduces your involvement in creating a hardware transport layer that understands how to pass data to the device's communication hardware.
<br />
<br />
The hardware transport layer is then layered under KITL to keep KITL from needing to understand different types of communication hardware. For example, you could create both desktop and Windows CE device-side transport mechanisms.
<br />
<br />
On the desktop, the transport is a separate DLL that exports certain API functions that KITL relies on and is also registered in the system so KITL knows that it is a functional transport.
<br />
<br />
On the device, the transport is built into the OAL and therefore the kernel. <br />
<br />
On the CE device, KITL relies on the transport to support a set of API level calls that are needed to support the debug services.<br />
<br />
The kernel independent transport layer (KITL) contains the following two modes of operation:
<br />
<br />
Active: The device boots the OAL, calls KitlInit(TRUE) to initialize KITL, and initializes all default KITL clients like the kernel debugger. The KITL service then calls OEMKitlInit and registers all default clients that are used by the system.
<br />
Passive: KITL is not automatically started when the device boots. In this mode, KITL initializes itself and the default KITL clients. Call KitlInit(FALSE) to initialize in passive mode. OEMKitlInit is then called when a client registers with the KITL servers.
<br />
You must determine which mode the device should enter on boot. Platform Builder provides a flag called KTS_PASSIVE_MODE that determines which mode is used. You can set KTS_PASSIVE_MODE in Platform Builder by enabling active or passive KITL.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You must pass the KTS_PASSIVE_MODE flag, if used, to the OAL before KitlInit is called. On the CEPC hardware platform, passing the data through the boot loader in the BootArgs section does this. To view an example, see %_WINCEROOT%\Platform\Cepc\Kernel\Hal\Halkitl.c.<br />
<br />
Active KITL is best suited for the development processes so that the debugger can maintain a constant connection. Passive KITL is better suited to a real-world scenario where the debugger is not constantly needed. The benefit of the passive mode is that it
 allows you to create a device that does not have to be tethered to the desktop tools. The device can even be mobile and if it enters a state where the desktop tools are needed, it initiates a KITL connection between the device and desktop.</strong></span><br />

            I never encountered this error code before. Has anything changed on the device recently? Try rebooting the device without the storage card.

 email away when they find one. But they apparently only look in the Received: lines. Outlook will stamp your IP address in a Received: line, but webmail doesn't, it puts your IP address in a different header line. If that's what's going on you'd have to take
 it up with them."</i></span></font></p>

<p>Hi jniemi0600,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I can’t see the screenshot you provided above, I assume that you want to create predefined word-template document on Teams, however, based on my experience, it isn’t feasible. Generally, when we creating
 word document in Teams, its content will be blank and it show like below. To use full features of Word, I suggest that you may using word desktop client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Sync Outlook 2016 Contacts with Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I have my Outlook.com account as my default mail and file account in Outlook 2016. All my contacts in Outlook are in the Outlook.com Address Book (within Outlook 2016/Contacts), yet these are not all synced to Outlook.com. Within the People app (on Windows
 10 and the People website), contacts are missing, and thus do not show up on my phone (iPhone 5 that uses my Outlook.com Address Book as its own).</p>

            Like every other answer I have found this DOES NOT explain how to delete contacts. I have been in contacts but there is no obvious way of deleting them once I am there. Exactly what do I do once in contacts to delete one. I can find no option anywhere
 for deleting and using the delete button on my Mac while the contact is highlighted does nothing.<br />

<h2>            Two different views of outlook page</h2>
                    <p>I have seen two different views of Microsoft outlook email pages. One is very simplified and doesn't have a taskbar at the top.&nbsp; The other is a more detailed page.&nbsp; I tried to redownload the app to get the detailed page, but it keeps telling me I already
 downloaded the app.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the app -- I get the simplified page.</p>
<p>If I go to MSN and click on mail, it shows the detailed email page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know what I'm talking about? </p>
<p>Basically, there are two ways of viewing Microsoft Outlook.&nbsp;How do I get to the detailed page without going to the MSN website?
</p>
<p>Can I alternate between the two.&nbsp; Sometimes I prefer one, sometimes the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you referring to a hardware? If yes, then this is not possible. If you will do this, it may&nbsp;<span>cause unforeseen damage or side-effects, which also&nbsp;<span>invalidate the warranty of a Nokia device. T</span></span><span>herefore,
 we do not allow it to be discussed on an official Nokia forum. However, if you are referring on how you can add a security code on your phone to be able to protect it against from unauthorized use, this can be done by going to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Access codes</strong>.&nbsp;</span><span>You can set your phone to ask for the security code that you&nbsp;</span><span>define. Note that the default security code is 12345.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            exporting &#39;assigned to&#39; &#40;Owner&#41; task outlook 2016 excel</h2>
                    I am able to export task to excel with 'import export' option. But I am not able to get all the required fields. I need 'owner' / assigned to field in excel. But that field is not visible in 'custom map' option under 'import/export'. I have created tasks
 for team and assigned to them. I need to export in excel and share the tasks to my manager. How can I do that?

<p>
</p><p>It is not feasible to add the owner field when exporting task to Excel. It is suggested that you submit feedback via the link below to improve Outlook.</p>

<h2>            How can I fix problems with read-only pivot tables and filters&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>I really wish i had not paid the money for office 2011 on mac (mavericks).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Pivot tables on large spreadsheets that are read only (work files), all the drop down filters just don't work at all, it is intolerably slow, rubbish really. Had to load a virtual machine and use XP with office 2010 to get the job done. DOES MS EVEN TEST
 SOFTWARE BEFORE IT IS RELEASED FOR MAC ?????</p>

            <p>Generally, doing a complete reinstall without first doing a complete removal just makes a mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Reinstall</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have deleted system fonts, restore them before proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the Apple menu and choose Software Update. Install Mac OSX updates before proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to have a successful reinstall of Office, you must first completely remove Office by carefully following
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>these instructions</span></strong></a><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then reinstall, and allow AutoUpdate utility to bring Office to the current update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then use
</span><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Font Book</span></strong></a><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>(it’s in Applications
 &gt; Utilities folder) </span></span></strong><span>or other font utility to validate ALL your fonts. Delete old versions of duplicate fonts. Delete fonts that don't validate completely. Restart your Mac and empty
 the trash to get rid of the unneeded fonts and free up disc space.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use
</span><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Disk Utility</span></strong></a><span> (it’s in Applications &gt; Utilities folder) to verify the startup
