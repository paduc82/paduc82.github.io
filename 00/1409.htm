<h2>            Microsoft Word has stopped working - A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.</h2>
                    I have had my laptop since Jan 2015. &nbsp;I have a subscription based Office 365 licence. &nbsp;I rarely use this laptop, but recently have a need to use excel,word and outlook. &nbsp;I now realise I have an error with all office products when i log on. &nbsp;The all provide
 an error box saying 'Word/Excel/Outlook etc has stopped working. &nbsp;A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.' &nbsp;The only programme which seems to work is PPT. &nbsp;I have checked
 all necessary updates are complete and also tried to follow the suggestions on other posts but it just doesn't seem to work or be relevant to my machine. &nbsp;Which is an HP Pavilion running 8.1. &nbsp;Any help greatly received :-)

            Following are likely solutions.<br />
<br />
1. Please try to repair your Office as a quick fix.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx<br />
<br />
2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.<br />
<br />
4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
6. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
7. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
8. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
9. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
10. File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options.<br />
<br />
11. Review the KB articles - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758592 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2779852<br />
<br />
12. If none of above works, please uninstall the current installed Office, and reinstall it again. Before resorting to uninstall, make sure that you have the license keys.<br />
<br />
To uninstall the Office, follow the instructions in the following support article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 &amp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179/en-us<br />
<br />
Note: Ensure to save the Fix it on the desktop and then run the file.

                    <p>Yesterday I was looking for any Support or Help from Outlook.com, since I want to bring in my Email system (Outlook Express) into my this New Computer, I cannot do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From&nbsp;Yahoo/Google I found this phone number (***-***-****)&nbsp;to assist me for Outlook issues.
</p>
<p>A man answered my call saying to help, he want to check my computer. He asked me to open the Web page www.logmein1234 &amp; finally he took control of my PC.
</p>
<p>After a few clicks he was able to shoe me thousands of Error messages, saying he must clean my computer before his team can help. therefore I have to pay the required amounts.</p>
<p>I was shocked &amp; asked Whether he is from Outlook.com ? Also I&nbsp;said How come these tons of errors appeared in my brand new computer, &amp; I am not paying, why you did not tell me before? He replied He is working to assist Outlook.com.
</p>
<p>This is for your information to pass on to the management of Outlook.com. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if you can help me to open my outlook.com account.</p>
<p>It does not accept my User &amp; Password whatever I change to put.</p>

<p>&gt;At the Query Wizard, I select Excel Files; then the tradelog file. Then at choose collumns I expand the _xlnm#-&gt;FilerDatabase and select buy date or guru (any of them) and then select Preview Now. From there, you can see that it &gt;dose not return all the
</span>
<p>Response:</p>
<span>
<p>Personally I don't use Microsoft Query to get data from Excel files.<br />
For data that I want to query I use a database to hold the data rather than a worksheet.</p>
<p>I have found MSQuery difficult to use and it often causes problems when, as I have, there are multiple versions of Office on the same machine.</p>
<p>When I tried to create a MSQuery query from your file I got a message saying "this file contains no visible tables".</p>
<p>At one stage it offered me FilterDatabase as the only named range available for me to connect to.</p>
<p>_FilterDatabase is a hidden name that was set up earlier in your use of the sheet and it refers to A3:M107</p>
<p>Thus any data after row 107 is unavailable to this query.</p>
<p>I think this may be what you are connected to.</p>
<p>In order to create a successful query I had to first delete the 2 rows above the data so that the table started in row 1.<br />
And then in MS Query I had to click Options and check Systems Tables.<br />
This let me select from a small range of possible names.<br />
The one I chose was "Trade Log$" which represents the whole of the Trade Log sheet starting at A1.<br />
That worked and refreshed successfully but included all 2000+ rows that are used in the sheet.</p>
<p>So all in all, I suggest you:</p>
<p>- delete the top 2 rows <br />
- delete the excess rows and columns beyond the end of the data<br />
- redo the query, connecting to "Trade Log$" (which appears as a System Table)</p>
<p>Hopefully you will then be OK.</p>
<p>However, I imagine there is probably a better way to achieve what you are trying to do than using MSQuery to access one Excel workbook from another.</p>

            My Excel freezes, without message. The situation is non recoverable, Excel has to be restarted with Task Manager. Creating Box whisker Charts with Excel is thus impossible for me.

                    <p>I keep getting the above error every time my Entourage sends/receives. Everything is working properly, but it's really annoying to constantly get this error message!</p>
<p>I recently changed my Entourage (2008) from a POP account to an IMAP account as I was having issues with POP. These issues are now resolved, aside from the development of this new error code.</p>
<p>Is there any advice on how I get rid of this error?</p>

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to resolve your problem. 
<br />
<br />Have you tried removing the BD from the drive, and cleaning the data area with a microfiber cloth and a noncorrosive cleaner for digital products such as computer screens?
<br />
<br />From what you describe the errors symptoms match a hardware issue between the drive and your Windows installation and a dirty BD is a common culprit.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if after doing the above solution things start to work correctly.

<h2>            Windows mobile 10512 - Constant freezing&#47; locking up &#47; crashing &#40;and gets red hot&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So over the last few days my phone has become more and more unstable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the beginning everything was great but now it stops responding/ crashes/ freezes/ locks up every 5 mins and I have to soft reset 4 or 5 time before I can actually use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as the phone stops working it gets so hot that I can't hold it any more and the battery loses about 30% of its charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one else facing this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will eventually restore WP8.1 and try upgrading again but don't want to do that just jet, want to see if we can pin point the cause for feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Nokia Lumia 930.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to comment :o)</p>

            <p>Exactly the same problem, having to rebuild phone every couple of days... be good to hear a response from Microsoft... same model phone as well Lumia 930.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue symptoms:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Lock screen randomly does not appear when pushing lock/un-lock button</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; When lock screen does appear entering un-lock code is followed by a freeze of 30seconds to 5 minutes</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; When start screen appears takes between 30seconds to 5 minutes to load</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Notification screen does not always appear</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Apps intermittently refuse to launch / crash / lock-up</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feels like something to do with the app-framework is crashing out and restarting in the back-ground but I'm no expert.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same sorts of issues (my post to the forum was <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_perf/lumia-1020-has-become-completely-unreliable-with/16145648-a1b5-46cb-bb2f-973b965761d0?tm=1441675753875&amp;auth=1">
here</a>) on my 1020.&nbsp; I feel like in the last several days it's gotten significantly worse, which is odd but may mean that it's not the OS per se but some library that got updated by another app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Factory reset didn't help me, but in all fairness I did the reset and then re-installed basically every app that had been on there before.&nbsp; I'm somewhat tempted to restore back to 8.1 but gawd, I did that once before on an earlier build and it feels like
 such a step back after using WP10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping for a new build soon!</p>

            I have been trying different things over the last few days to try and pun point the issue and I think it is to do with location services. I have had the location setting turned off for the last week and touch wood no crashes..... Give this a go and see

            <p>I'm having the same issue. I'm wondering if there is a hardware issue and the on-board memory has an issue which causes it to lockup as it cannot read/write perhaps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had it hard-reboot while trying to take a photo quite a few times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After rebooting I have to wait 10-15 mins before i can use the phone as it locks up and apps don't start.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013&#58; Shows wrong user photographs</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook 2013 shows the wrong photos from me when I get a message. If I move the the mouse over the photo, the account information is wrong. So I have a contact for business and private mails. If I receive a private message Outlook takes the information of
 the business account. The picture is always wrong. Outlook 2010 does it correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Karl</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. Before staring the troubleshooting steps just a few quick questions:</span></p>
<p><span>1. What is the type of email account configured in Outlook (<b>POP</b>,
<b>IMAP</b>, <b>MAPI</b> or <b>Exchange</b>)?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does the contact photo appear fine when a mail is received at business email account?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Did you insert the picture manually for each contact or are the pictures uploaded from social networking site?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Create a new profile, configure only the private account and check if it works fine in new profile.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step did not fix the issue then provide us more information about the issue to help us understand the issue and assist you
 better.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

<p>thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>1: I'm connected with Exchange, but I work with several SMPT-accounts.</p>
<p>2: The contact-photos of me are shown wrong. The private and business contacts of me have different pictures. If I receive a mail Outlook displays only the icon of me and doesn't take the contact photo. - I know the preferences. - The picture of the sender
 of a mail takes Outlook&nbsp;&nbsp;2013 correct from the contact. And notice: Outlook 2010 works correct!</p>
<p>3. I inserted the pictures manually.</p>
<p>I hope you have enough informations.</p>

            This is a very annoying and embarrassing issue. When I get mail from my husband&nbsp;who has accounts with AOL and gmail there is a pic of him from FB and he is not even on FB and this person is very young and kissing a girl. It is very concerning that anyone
 with outlook gets this photo. How can this be fixed?

</p><p>Look, I realize this thread is a few months old and Microsoft has bigger fish to fry with Windows 10 and Xbox One making headlines.&nbsp; But come on!&nbsp; Lets fix this obvious oversight in an update of something, please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue with Outlook.&nbsp; I would have liked to at least have the option to use only photos I add to populate a contact or not.&nbsp; I just don't like how some people are using graphics instead of head shots, because.&nbsp; Seriously, I've no idea who
 they are at that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2013 needs a check box on contact card themselves.&nbsp; Check this box is you'd like this particular contact photo to me static or dynamic. &nbsp; Dynamic, of course meaning allow your contacts web attached profile to update the photo automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could see how "some" would like or trust their contacts to choose photos willy-nilly, but not all friends are worthy of such power.</p>
<p>

            The troubleshooting steps will not work for me because the picture in question is not of me. It is when I get an email from my husband there is a photo attached and it is not him but some guy kissing a girl from facebook. My husband is not even or has
 ever been on facebook. Its his other business&nbsp;emails I worry about- that they may be seeing this photo also.

            <p>I see, now that 'is' a strange situation.&nbsp; I'd not heard of Outlook 2013 holding onto one profile or another off the web.&nbsp; I wonder if someone other than yourself adding the account on another computer in Outlook 2013 would produce the same error?&nbsp; Do you
 know anyone with a PC having the same version of Outlook to test?&nbsp; It might just be some sort of corruption existing on your computer alone.&nbsp; In that case, I'd try uninstalling Outlook 2013 completely all traces.&nbsp; There are regisrty keys that need to be deleted
 and first run registry keys to reset, before reinstalling Outlook would really work like you were doing so for the first time though.&nbsp; Microsoft likes to make things as difficult as possible for the average user I think.&nbsp; maybe a Microsoft Support Tech can
 direct you to some Fix-It utility that will help you preform complete removal for a reinstall?&nbsp;

            <p>Great so after all this time this STILL has not been solved? I too have the same issue with my business account. Somehow the photo attached with my email address is a client of mine who is about 15 years older and looks nothing like me. This IS a very embarrassing
 glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything, from deleting my profile, my clients profile but it still is grabbing the wrong photo. Looks like it's a photo from Facebook or Google+
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FRUSTRATED!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way around this for now, is to delete my email box completely and create a totally different email address. That should NOT have to happen! I should not have to change email addresses to get that photo to go away!</p>

<h2>            Beta release of DivX player &#40;official&#41;</h2>
                    And it's FREE!<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mobile.divx.com/divx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mobile.divx.com/divx</a><br />
<br />
This is directly from DivX. I'm testing it right now, and so far I'm impressed.<br />
<br />
Really easy to use, don't need transcoding on N95 if the divx or AVI file is less than VGA or not too high bitrate. There are versions for S60 2nd edition and other S60 versions. If you can, try them out.<br />
<br />
Seems to be that bitrates of about 900-1000kbps is ok.<br />

            Buddy cheers!<br />
I have downloaded it about 9 days ago. Has lots of <b>improved </b>features.<br />
It is a significant version.<br />
<br />
But I wonder why both smartmovie and divx player stumbles to play the video continuously in my N91/8GB. (I didnt suffer from it on my 6630).<br />
<br />
E.g., either smartmovie or divx player stop at a certain point of any video for 1-1.5 seconds and then plays. Sometimes it even hangs.

Should I point out that I'm not really that familiar with all that video stuff? :) I know how to play it on Win PC, but this is as far as my knowledge goes...

Th fact is divx player does not come with the converter unlike smartmovie.<br />
I hope el_loco will provide a short encoding procedure to us.<br />
It is much needed.

            Hmm... I was under false assumption that it should be able to play (any) DivX movie?<br />

If I need to trans/re-code it, it probably won't be all that interesting for me :)

            I guarentee you the transcoding is much more like predetermined. You just gotta choose your model's screen rez and the codec etc.<br />
It is less hassling.;)

            Ah, yes, spoke too early.<br />
<br />
The DivX player can play DivX and "some" xVid.<br />
<br />
There are too many flavors of the DIVX, XVID codec that most likely you will find a lot of unsupported codecs.<br />
<br />
I tried different codecs of the DIvX family and most play reasonably well without any transcoding. BUT,<br />
<br />
if the bitrate of the file is more than 900 kbps then the phone processor will strugle to play it back. In those cases then you are back to transcoding either to lower the bitrate and still have DivX codec or change to MPEG-4 or AVC, as the transcoding will
 take the same amount of time anyways and MPEG-4 is a better codec in Nokia phones (consumes less power).<br />
<br />
As a rule of thumb (for N95 at least), it seems that if the video resolution is higher than VGA there are little chances that it will play correctly. If it's VGA it will depend on the bitrate, if it's less than VGA then it most likely will play correctly (assuming
 it's a supported codec).<br />
<br />
One thing I must stress is PRESUME NOTHING!, check the codec with DIVX player in your PC, maybe it's xVid and not DivX, xVid is almost identical codec than DivX but xVid is Open Source.<br />

Stage6 website has a lot of content, so it's a good start for testing what you can and cannot do with DIVX player on your particular device.<br />
<br />
As a side note I started playing around with Core player. It's too early to make a verdict, but one thing that's good is that you can play all formats in one player and play not just video but music and open pictures as well.<br />
<br />
Still the UI and options require lots of trial and error. And it's not free.

            Talking about coreplayer.<br />
Yes,<br />
but it is promising.<br />
And hope it will give us the best.<br />
The most important thing that the nokia multimedia developers note that the coreplayer lets us to play the videos with equalizer adjusting. Is is just important for me. I hope the nex nseries phones will have optimum processor to play higher bitrate video files,
 and will have the equalizer control option in video player.:)

            Thank You all for your answers, but it is too much hassle for nothing, as far as I am concerned.<br />
<br />
If it plays, fine, if it doesn't, I'll leave it at that.

<h2>            Latest Software update Lumia 730</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Lumia 730, and want to update the software. My all friends have latest update on their device. But I don't have that one.</p>
<p>I have enough space in my device and also set date and time correctly.</p>
<p>When i click on check for update that time always displays me "Your phone is up to date.", But this is not correct.</p>
<p>I also checked update using Wi-fi, but it is always showing me&nbsp;"Your phone is up to date."</p>
<p>How can i get the update?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook Gliches</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I began to experience glitches with my Outlook email. I have gone through the forums here and my exact issues were not mentioned, although others seem to be having their fair share of issues, too. First, on my desktop pc, when I go into my junk
 email (which lists 4 or 5 unopened items), the items do not show up. Instead, I simply get a link that tells me I have to click it to have Microsoft Exchange get the messages for me. When I click it, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, from my iPhone, when I attempt to retrieve mail, sometimes, not all of the time, it will not allow me to delete the mail I've looked at. It tells me it is unable to move the mail I've selected. Even more strange, I have four or five email messages
 that have no sender, no content, and the dates on them are 12/31/2000 and 12/31/1969. That's right - 1969. I have screenshotted them, but do not know that I can post them here. I go back into my mobile email awhile later, and those 'old' emails are gone and
 I can move other messages to the folders I was trying to move them to unsuccessfully earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something on Microsoft's end? I don't want to begin taking steps to fix something that isn't broken if it is. I have run several full virus and malware scans, which came up with nothing. Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>K. Garvey</p>

<p>Insert Symbol Problem</p>
<p>I am running Windows Vista Home Premium Service Pack 2 on a 32 Bit System.<span>&nbsp;</span>I am using Microsoft Office Ultimate 2007.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I attempt to insert a symbol I am unable to select a symbol in either Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel nor Microsoft PowerPoint.<span>&nbsp;</span>Since multiple apps are effected it seems that something affecting the suite is the problem.</p>
<p>I also have the following programs running that might be of concern</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Zone Alarm Security Suite</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Iolo System Mechanic Professional</p>

<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Registry Easy<span>&nbsp;
</span>(installed after the problem surfaced)</p>
<p>Please advise; I would happily re-install the suite if I thought that would address the issue.</p>

<span><span><span><span><span>1.1.1</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>How

<p>If that doesn't work, I'd try a custom install, and looking through all of the features to see if you can find the missing tool. Use the same instructions.</p>

<h2>            what the heck is going on with outlook&#63;&#63;&#63; it&#39;s been 2 days and I can&#39;t access my e-mail&#33;</h2>
                    I am so discouraged with Outlook!&nbsp; There's no way to have a dialogue with customer support on problems/issues.&nbsp; I have not been able to get into my e-mail now for 2 days!&nbsp; What the heck is going on?? Don't think I will renew my account next year...if I
 have to pay for e-mail I want a server who provides customer service!&nbsp; MSN should be ashamed of this shabby excuse for an e-mail service!

<p>Now, you ruled out all configuration issues. If the issues persists your phone is faulty. In that case, I would return it to my retailer. The retailer in turn sends it over to a local but&nbsp;authorised&nbsp;repair
 centre. By the way, which phone model do you use?</p>

<h2>            Build 10565 bricked my laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung Chronos Series 7 and was on the fast ring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After build 10565 downloaded and installed, my laptop began soft-rebooting continuously. &nbsp;It would boot to the logo screen with the spinning wait icon and wait for an inconsistent amount of time before rebooting. &nbsp;It's been doing this for over an hour before
 it finally crashed with a blue screen and an error: SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED. &nbsp;After waiting some time, it starting up again into the continual rebooting cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss as how to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I tried to boot to USB drive, but it won't do it. &nbsp;BIOS now only has one option under boot priority and that's Windows Boot Manager.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac Hangs on Email Upload to Deleted Box on Exchange Server</h2>
                    I have Outlook 2011 for Mac, version 14.2.3. &nbsp;My problem seems to have been created by myself. Plus, there are no answer out there specific to my problem. &nbsp;I accidentally tried to send a 124mb attachement. &nbsp;Well it never made it out of my outbox. It was
 turned into to a draft email and resided in my local computer in the Drafts mailbox. &nbsp;Seeing in my Drafts Box I deleted the email. &nbsp;Well, now my email is trying to push it to my Deleted Box on Exchange server. It fails of course. &nbsp;And my email tries to send
 it about every minute or so. No as that service kicks in my email hangs or gets stuck. &nbsp;I notice this in the progress window. &nbsp;That deleted email is no where to found. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I get rid of that email?</div>
                </div>

If you can try resending to put it back in the Outbox, there is a script that will delete it from the Outbox.<br />

</a>3)&nbsp; There is a way in the Finder to remove messages. You need to duplicate your Identity first since this could result in data loss. Make the duplicate BEFORE you do the steps below.<br />
<br />
1)&nbsp; Copy the subject of each message that won't delete if you can see the message.
<br />
2)&nbsp; Delete the Exchange account. This deletes the cache file in Outlook. Your messages are still on the server.<br />
3)&nbsp; Quit Outlook.<br />
4)&nbsp; In the Finder, enter the subject&nbsp; of the messages in Spotlight Search box. It will give you the .olk path. (These directions are for Lion/Mountain Lion. You can used advanced find in older versions of OSX. Under File in the Menu bar with Finder selected
 select Find.)<br />
<br />

In the example it shows xx00_76668.olk14message<br />

5)&nbsp; Using this, go to Data Records folder in your Main Identity folder. <br />
<br />

<h2>            Why Lumia 925 is declared non repairable after 16 month of use.</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 0">
<span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">I purchased Nokia Lumia 925 phone around 16 month back and paid INR 30,000 for that. I have been a loyal Nokia customer since the time of Nokia 3310 (around year 2002) and had
 been using only Nokia products (i.e. 3310, 3250, E63, then E72 and recent one was Lumia 925). I have been a true marketer for Nokia as a brand who has been telling the reliability of Nokia to all my friends and colleagues.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">Today, i am very sorry to say but i lost this faith from Nokia as a brand and as<span>&nbsp;</span><span>a company when my
 Nokia Lumia 925 got faulty with no physical damage (not even a single scratch since the day i purchased it) within 16 months from the purchase. Initially the Nokia service center executive told me that it can be repaired but will charge INR 8999 for motherboard
 which needs to be replaced/repaired. By hearing this i was shocked that within 16 month how can a Nokia mobile get faulty. But still, i got ready to pay this amount. After 10 days(today) i got to know that this phone is not repairable now and i can collect
 my faulty mobile from the service center.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">Though, i am not claiming that this phone was under warranty but, i never expected from Nokia that they will manufacture a device/hardware which would work for exact warranty
 time period and then will get faulty and will not be able to get repaired.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">I request everyone to not to purchase Nokia(now Microsoft) Lumia or any device of Nokia as they may get faulty and Nokia will never repair it. You will end up paying a hefty
 amount on phone just for 12-14 months.</span></p>

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d6b5eceb-8df6-4bde-b7b3-8c6f73911a89" title="VishalJain084">
<p>It is not economically advisable to replace the motherboard in an out-of-warranty phone, even if spare parts were available. The asking price for a 12 months old 925 in Denmark is around the quoted repair cost, so a second-hand Lumia 925 in good condition
 can probably be acquired at 5000-6000 INR after negotiation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest replace the phone with a second-hand one if you are otherwise happy with this particular model - and keep the old for&nbsp;a spare screen and battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a personal level I fully agree. It is a pity and a waste of resources, that modern electronic devices become obsolete in less than two years and not worth repairing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,<br />
Hans</p>

            I expected a response with repair (at reasonable price) from Microsoft fro more than two months... but it seems in Microsoft no one is concerned about customer issues. I have tried enough to get the phone repaired but it didn't happened. So now, i expect
 a replacement of my phone.

<p>
</p><p>I sincerely appreciate your suggestion of going for a second hand phone with same model.... but what about my phone for which i paid INR 30K.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't this is right a Microsoft's part that they can declare a phone non repairable with 15-16 month of use only.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel and Word are not printing the correct shade of blue</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to print using a light blue color (Carolina Panthers Blue). Everything looks good on the screen. But when I print I get a turquois shade of blue (San&nbsp;Jose Sharks). I thought that it was a printer issue, so I sent the file to be printed off of
 a different printer (different make and model) and I still get San Jose Sharks blue. Is there anything that I can fix on my end so that the printer will print the correct shade of blue? I also went onto Microsoft Word and tried printing in the same shade of
 blue and&nbsp;got the same results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that the printer's ink is low or needs replacement. However, we will still need to check if the issue is with the Office app itself. That being said, we will be performing a series of troubleshooting steps to isolate what's causing
 the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, we would like to know more about this concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this the first time that you encountered this issue?</li><li>Did you make any changes on the computer before you encountered this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, let us perform an online repair via Control Panel. Doing so will fix any issues you are experiencing when using any of your Office apps. Here's the
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> where you can find the instructions on how to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you have already tried a different printer. However, we would like to cover everything. That being said, we advise running the printer troubleshooter found in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027397/windows-fix-printer-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> if you are using Windows 10. In case you are using an older version of Windows, here's how you can do it:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Search Control Panel</strong>, type in <strong>troubleshoot</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, select <strong>Use a printer</strong>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Reply to us with the information so that we can assist you better.</p>

            Hi, I have tried the troubleshooting procedures and they did not change the printing color. This problem started back around 6 months ago. I'm not sure if changes were made to the computer or not, but it seems like a wide spread issue. I have used multiple
 computers and different printers to no avail. It used to print fine, and then one day (out of the blue it seemed) it just stopped working correctly.

re: correct color shade<br />
<br />
Color a set of cells with all the various blue colors available to you (and name them).<br />
(see an example in the image below - done with xl2010)<br />
Note:&nbsp; there are more blue colors than shown.<br />
Print it and see if any of the colors are close to what you need.<br />
<br />
If none are exactly what you want, you can adjust the RGB mix on a close color until it prints the color you want.<br />

<p>Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
I understand that you’ve been encountering the same issue as the previous thread owner Robert did, and I also would like to confirm if your situation is exactly the same as well. Are you using an Exchange 2013-based hybrid deployment, with mailboxes hosted
 from on-premises and archive from Exchange Online?<br />
<br />
If not, please let me know. And if yes, please see below:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In some cases, even running the <strong>Start-ManagedFolderAssistant</strong> command cannot remove the 7-day back-end process. It may only grant a higher priority to any newly created policies. Therefore, if it hasn’t been 7 days yet, please wait for
 it and see the result.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If it has already been more than 7 days, please try manually moving some mail items from the on-premises mailbox to the archive mailbox, and check if they can be successfully stored in the archive mailbox. This is to check whether the root cause is about
 the archive mailbox itself or the on-premises retention policies.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, run the <strong>Get-MailUser &lt;username&gt; | FL *arch*</strong> command by using the
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange Online PowerShell</a> to check the online archive status.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your updates.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

            As the delete confirmation dialog says "All channels, chats, files, and the Office 365 Group for this team will be deleted."  To test, i converted a group to a team then deleted it - the group was deleted. (It was a group that needed to be deleted anyway. :))
<br />
<br />As for converting the team - you should be able to allow anyone by changing permissions on the team. (The admin might need to do it.)

            I checked with my Office 365 Admin and we couldn't find any Teams settings, only Groups settings and there wasn't any Teams settings within the Groups settings. Do you have an idea of where Teams settings for Admin?

            You have management options in the Teams app and the browser version - you can change it from a private to public group and add members. click on the 3 dots next to the team name.

<br />I don't know if its better to create an Anyone team or just open the current team to 'public' (anyone in the org.) or just invite additional security groups. You will be able to use the same group address once the team is deleted. Wait a few minutes after deleting the team to recreate it.

<p>I don't want to invite more people. I'm concerned about 2 things:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Files from the Group, after promoting it to a Team, are not showing up in the Team.&nbsp;</li><li>The notebook that was created in the Team, a Staff Notebook, is not needed since we already have a notebook created in our Group. I would like to delete the Staff Notebook in the Team and use the one we are currently using in the Group.</li></ol>

    <title>Problem &#58; Blank Image when I try to insert it to word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aashleyy_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem &#58; Blank Image when I try to insert it to word</h2>
                    <p>I've searched about my problem, but most of the posts I found weren't specific enough to solve the problem. Whenever I try to insert an image, instead of showing me the actual image, it's just a blank box. Although if I tried to print it, then the image
 would show. Is there any way to fix this? If so can you write a detailed explanation because I'm new to the technical stuff.</p>
<p>Ex: Go to pictures found in the insert tab and click... (something along those lines)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this problem &nbsp;is explained in a lot of places, but sometimes they would say "go to tools and click this" but there's no tools tab soo yeah. Please and thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your wondering the computer is a Dell Desktop (sorry for writing so much)</p>

    <title>GPS settins - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pearson100---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            GPS settins</h2>
                    
<p>What are the appropriate settings to get GPS to work? I have an E71 and am on the T-mobile data plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Positioning &gt; Positioning Methods</p>
<p>What should be checked?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Positioning Server - What should the access point be?&nbsp; and server address?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenevern I check satellite status, I get no satellite. GPS doesn't seem to of much use if there is never a satellite when you need one!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>If you have a data plan, you should enable Assisted gps, network based and integrated gps. The positioning server should be supl.nokia.com or supl.google.com and the access point should be your service providers gprs/wap apn.</p>

<p>You don't need a data connection, it just makes the GPS get satellite lock quicker. AFAIK WiFi doesn't work for this, it requires a cell network data connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the first time you've used the GPS then without a data connection it can take a very long time to get a fix (depending where in the world you are). Once you've had an initial fix things should be quicker on the subsequent times you switch the
 GPS on as long as you don't move too far between uses (like go interstate or overseas).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my advice would be to leave the GPS active for up to an hour while you're outside doing the gardening or something to see if you can get that initial fix.</p>
