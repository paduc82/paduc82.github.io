    <title>Office Home &#38; Business 2016 for PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlnorthern  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Home &#38; Business 2016 for PC</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a new desktop computer from Dell six weeks ago.&nbsp; It also included a one-time purchase of Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2016 which I downloaded and installed from Microsoft.com.&nbsp; The computer has had several problems and Dell is in the process
 of sending me a new desktop to replace the&nbsp;defective one.&nbsp; Also from what I understand from Dell I will be able to install Microsoft Office on this new computer using the product key from the MS Office I purchased along with the to-be-returned&nbsp;defective&nbsp;computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:&nbsp; Is this correct?&nbsp; Can I use the product key to install my one-time purchase of&nbsp;Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2016 on this new computer?&nbsp; If so, how many times can I install/re-install MS Office using that one product key, and to how many different
 computers?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The information that I have been able to find from Microsoft on these questions was from 2010 about MS Office 2007 and said that the product key can be used up to three times, on more than just one computer.&nbsp; So I'm checking with you to learn the current
 policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hi Carl, if you purchased Office 2016, it is your for life, you can install that on the replacement PC and any device you purchase in the future . .. 
<br />
<br />You need to deactivate your previous Installation and then re-install Office 2016
<br />
<br />On the New PC, go to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a> and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted
<br />
<br />Select Install 
<br />
<br />Under Install information, locate the old PC which Office was installed on 
<br />
<br />Select Deactivate Install to deactivate the Office installation 
<br />
<br />Then, click Install to install Office

<p>
</p><p>Twelve days ago when reviewing your response and clicking on the link you provided to deactivate Office 2016, I recall seeing an option to deactivate Office 2016.&nbsp; Now that I'm actually ready to do this, I click the link and go to the same place and I don't
 see an option to deactivate Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, I'm looking at "Services &amp; subscriptions" in my account.&nbsp; I see Office 2016, the date it was originally&nbsp;installed, and the product key, but after clicking around on this page, and thinking I've searched every other possible place in my account,
 along with reading less than helpful information about how to deactivate Office 2016, I still find no option to deactivate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
<p>

</p><p>You cannot 'deactivate'&nbsp; one-time-purchase of Office 2016, that information is wrong.&nbsp; However, you do not use the product key you just sign into your Office Account at:
<a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://office.com/myaccount</a>&nbsp; and click on the install button&gt;Install. Note: you can only use Office 2016 on one computer so you must uninstall Office from your old computer before actiating it on your new computer.&nbsp; If you can no longer access your Old
 computer you will need to contact Microsoft to 'deactivate' the Office link to your old computer.</p>

</p><p>When I go through the activation process I get a dialog box which says that MS Office 2016 cannot be activated because the Product Key has already been activated, i.e. by the defunct to be returned desktop.</p>

</p><p>I uninstalled Office from the old computer, restarted the old computer, looked at my MS Acct and saw that the status of the old computer had been updated at a time after the uninstall.&nbsp; Then reinstalled Office on the new computer and then opened Excel and
 got the same dialog box when attempting to activate, which says:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>MS Office 2016 cannot be activated because the Product Key has already been activated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also under "Services &amp; subscriptions" it still referenced only the July 15 install on the old computer.&nbsp; I could go to "More Actions" and remove the computer from my Device List, but It doesn't seem logical that that would make any difference, plus I would
 then be without reference if I needed to call Microsoft.<br />

</p><p>See my first reply to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd Reply:</p>
<p>To activate Excel it gives you two options. (1) Activate over the internet; (2) Activate over the phone.&nbsp; As you recall with Option (1) I got "Product Key is already in use" tilt.&nbsp; With Option (2) it leads you to believe that you will be able to talk to
 a live person, so I went for it. The live person option never presented itself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I did option (2) which starts out on the phone then sends you a link via text message with takes you to a website, asks how many computers have been installed with this product.&nbsp; I keyed in "2".&nbsp; Then it took me to another screen where I keyed in
 the previously&nbsp;given eight sets of 7 digit codes and completed.&nbsp; I reopened Excel and Word both showing as activated on their respective account tabs.&nbsp; So I'm all set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and others who replied with help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. Not just in this case, but in others I've had, it seems fixes to Microsoft related problems have short expiration dates.</p>

</p><p>This appears to have caused the problem "<span>I uninstalled Office from the old computer, restarted the old computer, looked at my MS Acct and saw that the status of the old computer had been updated at a time after the uninstall.</span>"&nbsp; For
 some reason Microsoft Servers did not have your Office as uninstalled.&nbsp; Microsoft support should/would have fixed the problem for you without going through all the process you had to endure. Please you have it fixed.&nbsp; If at any time you get a message about
 'activation' or 'licence' just sign into your Office Account this should fix it.&nbsp; Once you redeemed your Office 206 for the first time you should not need the Product Key again.&nbsp; But keep it safe as it is your proof of purchase.</p>

<h2>            contacts and calendar not showing on phone or online</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had to move my emails and domain to exchange.&nbsp; My old email was set up as a pop account but I used a personal outlook account for my calendar as a quick fix as I couldn't get outlook to recognize the calendar on the old domain thingy.&nbsp; Also my
 contacts are also fine on my pc but are not in exchange??</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we are all set up on exchange, emails are working fine.&nbsp; I downloaded the calendar from my private outlook and uploaded to exchange and thought that was easy as everything was showing on my PC.&nbsp; But it is not showing when I log into office 365 and I can
 not get it on my phone either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Rhonda</p>

<p><span>Hi Corewa,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to the picture you provided, it seems that you are trying to create the new folders in outlook client not trying to import calendars/contacts to your outlook client.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In general, if you have configured your office 365 account to outlook client with Exchange Protocol ( use the office 365 account and password to directly sign into outlook client), you can follow the steps below and try to import the calendars/contacts
 into the outlook client:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Please make sure you have exported your personal calendars from your personal account in the outlook client. For your reference
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-or-backup-email-contacts-and-calendar-to-an-outlook-pst-file-14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You can try to import your personal calendars files into your office 365 account in the outlook. For more information, please refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import-email-contacts-and-calendar-from-an-outlook-pst-file-431a8e9a-f99f-4d5f-ae48-ded54b3440ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you have imported the pst file into the office 365 account in the outlook client, please wait for some time to make it synced to office 365 web app (OWA).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please note, if you want to view your personal calendars in other devices, you may need to configure your office 365 account to other devices with Exchange Protocol. If you configured it with POP/IMAP Protocol, you will
 not see them in other devices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any other concern, please feel free to let me know.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Well that's just weird I. Have a 930 so i know what you mean about choosing the phone for the camera 📷 I would first try a soft reset by turning your phone on then press and hold the volume down and the power buttons until it vibrates then release them
 and it will restart if that doesn't work you may need to hard reset it by going to the about setting and tap reset let us know how you go PS make sure you backup before you do a hard reset

            Maybe Intel should buy Realtek, since they're using Realtek LOMs on Intel mainboards....what, too pricey for Intel??? Intel tried to take the NIC market once with Intel Pro adapters, couldn't compete with Realtek.&nbsp;

<h2>            Word for Mac 2016 - How to Pick a Save Location on Computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On 2016 Word for Mac, how do save to a file location within my computer that is not on my favorites list?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to File to Save and annoyingly get defaulted to OneDrive instead of My Mac, which is already a time-waster.&nbsp; But then when I hit the On My Mac button, my only Where to Save choices are items on my Favorites List or else Recent Places.&nbsp; There is no way
 to click through to subfolders, so if I select Documents (a favorite), I can't click through to any subfolders of Documents.&nbsp; So basically I can't save correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Any suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You would need to make the change in the document template. If you are creating new Blank Documents, then the template would be Normal.dotm. If you know how to navigate to and open Normal.dotm, you can do so. If you don't have experience with that, then
 you may find this shortcut easier:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Word, press <strong>Alt+F11</strong>; the Visual Basic Editor opens. Press
<strong>Ctrl+G </strong>to activate the <strong>Immediate </strong>window. In that window, type (or paste)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NormalTemplate.OpenAsDocument<br />
<br />
and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Normal opens, but note that it may not be on top of all windows. You can close the Visual Basic Editor. Make the desired changes to the Normal file, and then save and close it. If the changes you have made have not been recognized
 as changes (the <strong>Undo </strong>button is not activated), press <strong>Spacebar</strong>, then
<strong>Backspace </strong>to "dirty" the file, thus ensuring that the template will actually be saved.

    <title>In Outlook 2013 - the &#34;From&#34; name &#40;the username&#41; does - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gulfbreeze  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Outlook 2013 - the &#34;From&#34; name &#40;the username&#41; does not change even though I changed it in the Account Settings</h2>
                    I'm trying to change the user name that appears an email to be "From" (in other words, when the recipient views the email, the name that appears the email came from). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I installed Outlook 365, it installed my default email account I purchased the software from, i.e. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; Once installed, I added another email account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).&nbsp; Apparently when I created *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 on the Outlook.com web app, I must have put mypersonalname in there somehow, because all emails from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** appeared to the recipient as being from "Personal Name".<br />
<br />
I was able to change the name successfully in the web app, outlook.com.&nbsp; There, when I logged into outlook.com as *** Email address is removed for privacy *** I changed the name from "mypersonalname" to "differentname", and when I send emails from the web app at outlook.com,
 the recipient sees "differentname" as the email "From" perfectly.<br />
<br />
But as likely expected (perhaps?), that didn't change the Outlook 2013 account info.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So when I went into the Outlook 2013 application, when I change the "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" account name in account settings from "mypersonalname" to "differentname" it continues to show the recipient that the email came from "mypersonalname".&nbsp; And this
 is after 24 hours and multiple syncs of Send/Receive folders.<br />
<br />
Again, just to be clear, I simply want my Outlook 2013 using my "differentname" account to work EXACTLY like it successfully does from the Outlook.com web app.<br />
<br />
I want the "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" account emails to show "differentname".<br />
<br />
Thanks for help in advance, as this is a critical Outlook 2013 usability issue for my needs, and should work fine considering it works fine from the outlook.com web app.

<div><br />
<div>And of course, I already mentioned that I went back into the Account Settings, Email Accounts, clicked
<br />
Change and changed the User Name to "differentname". &nbsp;But that didn't change how the emails appear to come from, they still show "mypersonalname".</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>My understanding is an alias would direct all of those differentname emails into my personalname inbox, correct? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If so, for my needs I can't have that in Outlook 2013.</div>
<div>I must have each email account associated with it's own inbox and folders.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I create a new profile, and add it to the profile that is already there with my email accounts, will that create any problems with the existing profile that must contain the same exact email accounts my current profile has? &nbsp;Will the new profile and
 the same associated email accounts create all new data files for those same accounts? &nbsp;If so, will creating those "duplicate data files"&nbsp;cause any functionality problems if I go back to my current profile?</div>

Obviously, I can't lose afford to lose what I have already in place.</div>

            I could not fix this problem, so I resolved it by simply creating new profiles with the same exact email accounts on every system we have.
<div><br />
<div>In more research, I did learn that if you have an outlook.com email address, the name that appears in the emails you send is determined by the name configured in the outlook.com web app. &nbsp;Changing the "Your Name" field in Outlook 2013's Account Settings
 &gt; Email Accounts does absolutely nothing. &nbsp;You have to change it on outlook.com.</div>

            <p>There's an issue at the Outlook.com server that if you try to send from an alias address through the Outlook.com server using a mail client like Outlook 2013, it will always change the sending address to be your primary address.&nbsp; It is a problem Microsoft
 has known&nbsp;about for some time now but hasn't addressed yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way to solve it is to change the outgoing server for the account in Outlook 2013, using a&nbsp;different service's SMTP&nbsp;server.&nbsp; Some services (like gmail) allow you to send mail through their servers using a non-gmail account.&nbsp; Since the recipient will then
 see the alias address, your Outlook.com account will receive any replies they make.</p>

                    Can someone please help me??I have been locked out of my LIVE account for 2 days and I'm simply going around in circles trying to have a password reset. You're asking me information about the account that I simply don't remember - previous passwords, emails
 I've sent, email addresses of people I know??? Why would I remember this stuff when it's all automatically at my finger tips when I can access my email. I leave myself signed in so I don't have to remember the password. There is no way of talking to a human
 being and people are just fobbed off in a system that works against the customer. Please send me a temp password to my hotmail account so I can access my LIVE email. This is ridiculous!!<br />

            <p>If I do that (right click and select the series format, then change the picture to fill) it changes both pictures to the same photo and compresses them to fill within each one respectively.&nbsp; Not sure I described it well the first time.&nbsp; One chart is essentially
 laid over the first or the values are assigned to different pictures within one chart.&nbsp; Sorry, like I said I'm not really an expert at excel.</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures below to troubleshot sync issues with OneDrive:
<br /> 
<br />Log into OneDrive on your computer and run the following commands to update OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key + R 
<br />
<br />In the Run window, enter: 
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe/reset
<br />
<br />Wait 2 minutes and then execute the following command: 
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\update 
<br />
<br />Click OK. 
<br />
<br />Make sure the OneDrive icon in the notification area of the taskbar disappears and then re-appears after a minute or two. 
<br />
<br />If the OneDrive icon doesn’t re-appear after a few minutes, open the Run window again and enter: 
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't solve the problem please try to reinstall the last version for OneDrive in the link below

<h2>            How do I access the browsing history in the Modern UI &#40;Internet Explorer&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Are there any plans to include browsing history in the Metro version of Internet Explorer 10?&nbsp; I really like the way the app looks, but while learning Windows 8 and having multiple tabs open, I really would like an easy way to go to my browsing history.&nbsp;
 I rebooted my computer and really wanted to get the list of sites back open I had before rebooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just think this should be a really basic function of the program and can't understand why it is not there.</p>

Hi there, thanks for the reply, I am doing fine, loving Windows 8 so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting to the Frequently visited sites does not work like you explained.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do right click in an empty space on the browser, but then I have to click in the address bar.&nbsp; After doing that I see the pinned sites along with the Frequently visited sites.&nbsp;
 This does not show what I am looking for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Say I am doing research on new features of Windows 8.&nbsp; I open several sites and enjoy reading what I find.&nbsp; Close the browser and move on to doing other things.&nbsp; The next day I want to review what I was reading the previous day because my memory is horrible.&nbsp;
 So, usually I could go to my browsing history and review the sites from the previous day.&nbsp; These sites do not list under Frequently Visited Sites because I have only visited them once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the new browser can calculate Frequently Visited Sites, seems reasonable that it should be able to list Browsing History.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this?</p>

I believe that an adequate response to your question would have been, "We apologize that the available features in the Modern UI&nbsp;skin of IE10 are incomplete.&nbsp; For now you must access your browsing history from the IE10 on the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It just seems like&nbsp;basic functionality&nbsp;was completely overlooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, something as simple as setting a homepage cannot be done from the new UI.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look under "Internet Options" under the "Settings" charm,&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a button to clear browsing
 history,&nbsp;and that is the only truly useful thing you will find there.&nbsp; To set your homepage you have to do it from the desktop.&nbsp; If Microsoft was serious about users adopting the new UI, why would they force us to switch to the desktop so often?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note to Microsoft: I use a popular&nbsp;non-Microsoft&nbsp;smart phone&nbsp;in combination&nbsp;with a web browser developed by a non-Microsoft software publisher, and I am able to set my homepage and access my browsing history right inside the app.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;my settings for this&nbsp;browser
 are synced with my user account, so I can access my history from any of my devices running a browser from that same developer.</p>

            <p>Agree with Frank, this appears to be a serious oversight. The metro version is nice to use, but it is pretty easy to lose your session - open new window, or system update. Shame you then have to struggle with the desktop version. 'Frequently used' is one
 of my least used functions, would gladly get rid of it for a useable history list. MS seem to be sorting out other little problems - why not this one?</p>

<h2>            Can refusing to upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 render your copy of Windows 8.1 inoperable&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm asking a question here, not implying anything improper has been perpetrated by Microsoft after I declined to upgrade my (legitimate) copy of Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, but since the last round of updates, Windows 8.1 doesn't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it boots, and yes, it reaches a point where I can see the Desktop, and its icons, but that's it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't do anything, right-click doesn't work (in the sense that right-clicking in the Task Bar to conjure up the Activity Monitor nets me nothing, for example), I can't access anything, nor launch programs, etc...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, it's stuck. Even Windows-X won't make the menu appear on top of the Windows button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's any indication, some programs that should start when Windows boots, such as Dropbox, don't appear in the notification area as they should.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to boot in Safe Mode, and it worked, but Windows is pretty much unusable when in Safe Mode. I thought booting in Safe Mode would more or less have the same effect it has in OS X, where Safe Mode clears several caches and sometimes helps solving issues
 with the OS. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not so here. I have to force-shutdown the PC after a while, and I'd like to avoid that...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have some of you guys experienced that kind of issue? </p>

    <title>Locked out&#47;Password keypad change&#61;RESET - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vivaciousc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out&#47;Password keypad change&#61;RESET </h2>
                    I purchased my Intrepid the first day it was available. Everything about the phone is great - except one MAJOR problem. I must use a basic password, and frequently the keypad reverts from the 6.5 transparent number pad to the 6.0 blue and white number
 pad and does not register keypad pressure beyond making a beep with each press. You can't turn the phone off or select any other function. The only option is to hard reset the phone - losing all customization - bluetooth relationships, exchange partnerships...big
 hassle!<br />
<br />
I reported this to Sprint after it happened three times in the first month and they replaced the phone. I've had my new phone two months and just had the third occurence - and third hard reset.
<br />
<br />
I'm getting really tired of hard resetting the phone. I've checked for the latest firmware, phone software, etc. and I've got the latest. Now that I've had two Intrepid phones, I find it hard to believe it was a fluke. Has anyone else experienced this? I'd
 hate to move to another model, but I can't constantly reset my phone.

            I understand your frustration over this and I have seen the same or similar behavior with other devices and not just the Intrepid.&nbsp; For this reason, I have not used the password option on my devices.&nbsp; Instead I found another means of securing my device.&nbsp;
 It has worked well for me and I'm happy to see that this software is finally available for WM6.x devices.&nbsp; If you are open to using another method of security, you might check out

    <title>Unstable Start Screen &#40;Home Screen&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lordtree123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unstable Start Screen &#40;Home Screen&#41;</h2>
                    <p>In the two devices in the insider program the start screen is very unstable. As one scrolls down the tile icons take long to reappear and get populated (L521, fewer pinned apps). On the other (L640)&nbsp;it just gets so overwhelmed that it jumps back to the previously
 opened app or screen, after a brief "loading..." message. I haven't been able to get down to the end of the pinned tiles.
</p>
<p>On the L640 I am using the backup settings that work perfectly when in 8.1 but W10 cant handle the pinned apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix.</p>

                    <p>Hi I have a very simple question that I haven't been able to find anything on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My skype does not ring, at all, ever, for any incoming call. It did when I had the older version of skype, but it hasn't since I got the integrated version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also can't find an option for it. At least not one that is obvious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be most appreciated. Thank you very much</p>

<p>Ah, but you can download the old one.</p>
<p>Get the OLD one here: https://skype.en.uptodown.com/windows/&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just did it and it installs fine.</p>
<p>It has a hiccup when it tries to start because Windows wants you to go to the NEW app - but you don't have to. Just ignore that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See how that works.&nbsp; I think the world just broke on all of the other Skype versions for some strange reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck with that.</p>

            There are 2 fundamental considerations:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Multiple file are being opened because of an OS X setting in Lion &amp; later not specific to Word. Among numerous other threads on the same issue see
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macword/when-i-click-on-a-word-file-word-opens-all-the/553f6360-720b-4482-83d9-c23bc3e69289">
When I click on a word file, word opens all the files viewed earlier and then opens the clicked file</a></li><li>Your installation of Office is seriously behind on updates. Your error message indicates 14.2.3, but 14.3.1 is the present version. Use
<b>Help&gt; Check for Updates</b> to get the software current. Run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions &amp; restart your Mac after updating.</li></ul>
<br />
If the above don't correct the issue you also may need to follow the suggestion posted by Ty_hell_heaven.
