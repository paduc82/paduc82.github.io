<h2>            Gallery &#38; Camera Update, New Homescreen Widgets And Nokia Suite Support</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I have reinstalled my Nokia 808 firmware using Nokia Software Recovery Tool. I had the firmware files downloaded on my laptop so the reinstallation went on smooth. After reinstalling the firmware, I went to Nokia Suite where Nokia
 Suite support installation failed to install on my phone. I tried to install Gallery &amp; Camera update, new homescreen widgets but all I am getting is expired certificate. I have been disappointed so much since I really need those updates. I have tried to backdate
 my phone's date and time and try to install the updates but I have not been successfull at all. I am aware that software updates have been discontinued but I have the sis files and intsalling them manually.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Forgetting Nokia Suite, presumably you have similar .sis files to these still available upon Nokia Revolution?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you rolled date back to about March 2013?</p>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I have the .sis files which I obtained from my laptop's C drive where Nokia Suite downloads and stores them. I have my installation settings just the same way like you specified above. I backdated to January 2015 and no success,

            Unfortunately only 808's to hand running Delight Belle consequently with Symbian Platform security disabled, so wouldn't get any "certificate errors"; although always feasible to disable this without flashing as a last resort.

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I finally managed to resolve it yesterday night. I factory resetted my Nokia 808 Pureview using *#7370# code and reinstalled firmware using Nokia Software Recovery Tool. After firmware installation completed, I backdated to 2015
 and all went good. Nokia Suite installed support software and I manually installed 34 system updates that I had the .sis files with me. I think the issue was caused by a bug in the previously installed firmware which I highly suspect did not install well.
 I am now sorted and a happy Nokia 808 Pureview user. Luckily I have the official firmware and .sis files with me which makes reinstallation a simple process.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Thank you all for those who helped me to try and figure out solutions. I appreciate your assistance. I can now finally mark this thread as solved.</p>

    <title>Issues with WIFI-connection in the Spotify app - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues with WIFI-connection in the Spotify app</h2>
                    
<p>I have a very annoying problem with my Nokia 5800 XM and the Spotify-app. I updated the app to v. 0.4.3.9 yesterday and it required that I uninstalled the old version first, i.e deleting all my cached tracks. Now today when I'm going to resync (on WLAN,
 since it's about 500 tracks) it just won't connect. I choose the correct WLAN from the list, but the app continues being blue (not green) and then the list pops up again. I read another discussion about almost the same thing a moment ago, so I tried to go
 to the menu and check the WLAN connection from its menu. So I did that, and it says my WLAN has full signal strength (I'm right next to the router) but then it loses the connection and asks me again which network I want to use. I have not had any issues with
 WLAN in any other app, and I have synced tracks with Spotify on my WLAN before, so I have no idea where the problem lies. Maybe something with the update and my WLAN? I don't know...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the attachments: The list that shows several times and then the WLAN list where I'm connected to my network and it has full strength. "Marsvinsfarmen" is my network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thankful for answer, I use Spotify every day!</p>

<p><font>Okay everyone! I struggled with this problem for a long time, and I was just about to send a complaint to Spotify when it worked for me! See, I did a little different than before; this is the list I was going to file:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>"1. I open Spotify from the application menu.<br />
2. I choose "Online" mode.<br />
3. My phone asks me how I want to connect to the Internet.<br />
4. I pick "Easy WiFi".<br />
5. I choose my WiFi network from the list.<br />
6. Application seems to be signing me in.<br />
7. My phone asks me again how I want to connect to the Internet.<br />
8. I repeat the procedure. Spotify can't connect with WiFi.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;-I have tried to connect using other WiFi networks, didn't work.<br />
&nbsp;-Before I updated last time I could connect without problem.<br />
&nbsp;-I can connect using 3G.<br />
&nbsp;-I can connect using WiFi in other applications than Spotify, for example Opera Mobile and the native browser.<br />
&nbsp;-I have reinstalled the application without difference."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>However, I did it a little different, which made it work: instead of choosing "Easy WiFi", I choose my network directly from the list:
<strong>see attachment</strong>. I never thought of that I could do so and I can't remember I did that before the update either. I have now synced my tracks and the app seems to be a little buggy, I still hope for an update</font>,
<font>though it now works at least. Sometimes it crashes.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Please, tell me about if this worked for you and if you have other, better solutions. This isn't good enough, I still seek a better way.</font></p>

                    I can't update my phone. I tried updating the driver but it said there's no better version to install. Should I try uninstalling and re-installing the driver? There's also an option to "rollback driver" to a previous version of the driver if the device
 fails after updating.

            Yes I did. I did everything and it didn't work. But I don't think it matters because now, for some reason, my phone isn't even being read by my computer when I plug it in. I don't know whats going on. I'm thinking about possibly not worrying about updating
 until I buy myself a newer computer next month.

            If the combo box is for data entry, you would set its ControlSource property to the name of the relevant column (field) in the form's table.&nbsp; The combo box's RowSource would usually be an SQL statement which returns a set of values from a column or columns
 in the referencing table.<br />
<br />
If the combo box is to be bound to a numeric foreign key column which references the autonumber primary key of a referenced table, then you would hide the numeric key column and show the relevant text column or columns from the referencing table.&nbsp; For instance
 this is how a combo box bound to an EmployeeID foreign key column in a table might be set up:<br />
<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp;&nbsp; EmployeeID<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName &amp; " " &amp; LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can concatenate the names so that the last name is first, which would be better with a large list of names as it allows the user to enter the initial characters of the last name and progressively go to the first match as each character is
 entered:<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT EmployeeID, LastName &amp; ", " &amp; FirstName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />

<p>There is a combobox wizard on the Controls section in Design view. That will lead you through the process of creating a combobox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you designed your tables properly yet? Most of the time, a combobox looks u against a lookup table for standardizing or easing input. What is your form bound to? What is the combobox supposed to populate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't plan this all properly, then you are wasting your time as you will probably need to rip it out and start all over once you understand things better.</p>

<p>I have a few tables for the information in the combobox and I am able to use it properly in one of the forms that I have created. I would like to have the combo box show values based on an above box that a user could type in. I am looking to have the user
 type in their section and then have the combo box display only the supervisors in their section.

<p>Ok, This is a standard concept called cascading or synchronized comboboxes. It is well documented if you search on either of those terms. However it requires a proper table design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you would need a Section table like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblSections</p>
<p>SectionID (PK)</p>
<p>SectionName</p>
<p>
</p><p>you would then need a Supervisors table or a personnel table that identified who the supervisors are. Finally, since it sounds like multiple supervisors can be assigned to a section, you need a section supervisors table;</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblSectionSupv</p>
<p>SectionSupvID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>SectionID (FK)</p>
<p>SupervisorID (FK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I have been stressing that you need to get your table design down first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the user then selects their section from a combo with a Rowsource liek:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT SectionID, Sectionname FROM tblSections;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the After Update event you will have to set the Rowsource of the Supervisors combo to something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT tblSectionSupv.SupervisorID, tblSupervisors.SupvName INNER JOIN on tblSupervisors.SupervisorID = tblSectionSupv.SupervisorID</p>
<p>FROM tblSupervisors, tblSectionSupv</p>
<p>WHERE SectionID = Forms!formname!cboSection</p>
<p>ORDER BY SupvName;</p>
<p>
</p><p>then the Supervisor combo will only show supervisors for that Section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disclaimer: This is aircode off the top of my head and may not be syntactically correct, but it should give you the idea of what needs to be done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again, you have to get your table structure in place before you start designing forms.</p>

            You might like to take a look at DatabaseBasics.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file includes examples of correlated combo boxes for data entry, or for 'drilling down' to rows in a form.<br />
<br />
The contacts form in the demo has correlated combo boxes for selecting a country, region, then city.&nbsp; An important point to note is that only the last is bound to a column in the Contacts table.&nbsp; To include columns for the region and country in which the city
 is located would introduce redundancy and the risk of update anomalies, as city determines region, and region determines city.&nbsp; The two unbound combo boxes are assigned values when navigating to an existing record by calling GetRegion and GetCountry functions
 in the form's Current event procedure.<br />
<br />
The region and city combo boxes are requeried in the AfterUpdate event procedures of the country and region combo boxes respectively.<br />
<br />
A new country, region or city, not currently represented in the database, can be entered by tying the name into the relevant combo box, which executes the control's NotInList event procedure to insert a row into the relevant referenced table.&nbsp; Note that this
 assumes that no country can have two regions of the same name, and no region can have two cities of the same name.&nbsp; There can be cities of the same name in different regions, and regions of the same name in different countries, however.<br />
<br />
If your situation differs from this in that a member of staff can be a supervisor in more than one section, you will need a table such as Scott's tblSectionSupv to model the many-to-many relationship type between sections and supervisors.&nbsp; As SectionID and
 SupervisorID constitute a composite candidate key of that table it would be legitimate for an Employees table to include both SectionID and SupervisorID foreign key columns, and consequently two bound combo boxes in the form.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, the model
 is a tree-structured hierarchy in which a member of staff is a supervisor in one section only, then supervisor determines section, and consequently there should be no SectionID foreign key in an Employees table.&nbsp; A table such as Scott's tblSectionSupv would
 still be necessary, but in this scenario would be modelling a sub-type of Employees.&nbsp; The relationship type between Employees and tblSectionSupv would thus be one-to-one, i.e. the SupervisorID column would be its primary key as well as being a foreign key,
 and there would be no surrogate autonumber key.&nbsp; In the form the supervisor combo box would be bound, but the section combo box would be unbound, as with the region and country combo boxes in my demo.<br />
<br />
In the same demo another form has three unbound correlated combo boxes in the form header.&nbsp; Again these are for selecting a country, region, then city, but in this case the selection of a value in each 'drills down' through the hierarchy, progressively restricting
 the rows returned in the form.&nbsp; This is achieved by referencing the three controls as parameters in the form's RecordSource query.<br />

<p>I have a spreadsheet with numerous hyperlinks. They are all linked to the same server. I got notification today that we will be moving everything to a different server. Is there a way to do a mass update to my hyperlinks? Can VBA code handle this? (I do
 not have much experience with VBA).</p>

<p>Easy for a macro.&nbsp; Say a typical hyperlink is like:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<span>\\serv1\jan\actual\income\first.xls</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>and we want to make all the serv1 into&nbsp; serv2:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub HyperFixer()<br />
Dim h As Hyperlink<br />
For Each h In ActiveSheet.Hyperlinks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h.Address = Replace(h.Address, "serv1", "serv2")<br />
Next<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>I suggest another approach:&nbsp; Assign a mapped drive designator to the server (like Z:) and have the hyperlinks reference the drive.&nbsp; The next time you change servers, you only need to change the mapping and can leave the hyperlinks alone.</p>

I have 2 COA's but I don't know which I used and which I didn't.<br />
She lives 1000 miles away from me so I can't just run by and try to install it.<br />

How can I check to see which is which?<br />
Is there a number I can call?

    <title>How to print Pure Black and White in PowerPoint 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joanng73  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to print Pure Black and White in PowerPoint 2016</h2>
                    I am using PowerPoint 2016. I have set the view to Black and White, and I am choosing to print Pure Black and White. However, when it starts to print, you can see it quickly changes over on the screen to Grayscale and it prints in Grayscale instead of
 the Pure Black and White. I have found many posts for previous versions of the program, but none for the new version and the directions don't seem to match up. (Incidentally, this problem seems to go back as far as 2010, so why hasn't the issue been resolved??)
 Can anyone give me directions how to print the Pure Black and White with the PowerPoint 2016? Thank you.

    <title>MY 20 YEAR OLD ACCOUNT IS BLOCKED AND I AM GETTING THE RUN AROUND FROM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariomothersil  say:</h3>
<h2>            MY 20 YEAR OLD ACCOUNT IS BLOCKED AND I AM GETTING THE RUN AROUND FROM MICROSOFT SUPPORT...</h2>
                    <p>I forgot my password for a 20 year old email account I have ben using for 20 years. During the past four days, I have chatted with many MSN&nbsp;support tech who guided me on ways to resolve this issue. It appears that I am getting the run around because the
 site that is supposed to give me a response has no response to show. In addition, I&nbsp;have completed the required form with all of the required information. I created a new email account specifically for this issue and&nbsp;I received a response that the form was
 received and a response would be given within a 24 hours tie period. The response received only lead me to an endless circle, with no relevant information.&nbsp;The phone&nbsp;that was used&nbsp;in the account many years ago,&nbsp;in case of such event,&nbsp;has changed for the past&nbsp;many
 years.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It seems to me that Microsoft has become very third world and hires the wrong support staff. Everyone is being lazy under the guise of protecting client's privacy. I only wish that I could have my accounts unblocked so that I may continue to try to log in
 with my&nbsp;past used&nbsp;passwords. Should I look for another system like apple products&nbsp;and forget about Microsoft altogether or will this matter be resolved. I am tired of wasting my time with this. Please advise me at your earliest.&nbsp; M. Mario.</p>

            <p>I would not expect much from MSN "support".</p>
<p>I tried for 15 days to get my&nbsp;paid&nbsp;MSN e mail&nbsp;account I had since 2002&nbsp;closed with no result.</p>
<p>They just send you in a endless circle.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So&nbsp;I&nbsp;opened a new e mail account at thexyz</p>
<p>Then transferred all my outlook contacts over to my new e mail&nbsp;&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>I got my e mail communications back to normal now and my new e mail provider works just fine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My old MSN account is now completely cleaned out and&nbsp;abandoned since I can't close it and now it&nbsp;just fills up with junk mail and spam.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Kind of sad as it used to work very well all those years&nbsp;until the switchover to Outlook.</p>
<p>I don't know what else to do.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Maybe this is some help.</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;recently created another live.com account hoping to resolve this issue with the blocked Microsoft account, but to no avail.&nbsp; I have some very important files in my email account that I cant get to, and now, this will be my very last purchase of any&nbsp;Microsoft
 product. No more windows based&nbsp;laptop, programs, email, etc... for me. I already signed in for a&nbsp;google email&nbsp;account that I will be using as my primary email account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Next year, I shall be looking for an apple product, a MacBook pro perhaps. I was advised by people who use apple products that their customer service is far more superior than Microsoft's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is something very wrong here, something is in the works with Microsoft that we know nothing of.&nbsp; It may be a take over or a sale of Microsoft to another company and it is being kept secret. Microsoft is not so unintelligent as to ignore the large majority
 of their client base. Neverhteless, as sad as it may appear, just as the fall of the Roman empire, this may be the beginning of the end for Microsoft. I shall also publish many these issues online for everyone to be aware of what to expect when using Microsoft
 products.</p>

            <p>I agree, it is sad to see a once great company go down hill.</p>
<p>I am old enough to remember the early days of Microsoft when it was considered the to be the standard other software companies was judged by.</p>
<p>Now it appears to be falling apart by the day.</p>
<p>I guess nothing good lasts for ever.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I just replaced Word 2013 with Open office 4.1 and have found it to be as good or better than MS Word.</p>
<p>My goal is to slowly replace all my&nbsp;MS products with better ones that are out there.</p>
<p>I guess I have, like many other people, become over reliant on MS products and really have not looked around for better products.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But no more. </p>
<p>Not after this fiasco.</p>
<p>No, because no company can survive for long with horrible customer service as I and others have experienced here.</p>
<p>History has shown even the biggest companies can crash down&nbsp;to the ground.</p>
<p>And this is usually how it starts.</p>
<p>Alienation of the customer.</p>
<p>Really, it is inexcusable and just deplorable to treat long time Microsoft customers this way.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since I switched my e mail to thexyz</p>
<p>The customer service there has been great and it works like a Swiss watch.</p>
<p>I am so happy with my new e mail account there.</p>
<p>So it seems that MS actually did me a favor after all.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks MS!</p>

<h2>            Unable to change settings in internet options.</h2>
                    I've got W7Pro and IE8. I'm trying to change some settings for browsing history, but they don't take. When I re-open the settings, they are back to where they were. I want to change"check for stored pages......." from automatic to every time I visit a
 webpage. Also, I don't show a "current location" file.<br />

<h2>            font size becomes small while forwarding and replying emails from outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While i reply to an email or forwards an email on outlook 2013, the font size becomes too small. While composing a new email the font size is normal.
</p>
<p>I tried checking -File-Options-Mail-Stationary &amp; Font- Replying or forwarding messages font. There it shows the font size is 10, but where as when i reply or forward an email, again the font size becomes less (10 becomes 8).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone advise some tips, this has been giving me trouble on a PC in our network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>JG</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've had the same problems in more versions - CAN'T CONNECT TO SERVER</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem comes up periodically and the I spend a lot of time finding solutions that

<p>2) have link to non-existent pages</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now running fully updated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 </p>

<p>I use Outlook as local client for my Gmail-account with "secure log-on" = that 16 char generated password from Gmail inserted in Outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last 4-5 day the problems have been worse and worse and it looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No mail is shown in Outlook for hours </p>
<p>Then suddenly a big chunck is arriving - 20-30 mails</p>
<p>Then long periodes where is doesn't work again</p>

            <p>As a start you would need to state whether the Gmail a/c is set as pop or IMAP</p>
<p>If pop, run the inbox repair tool, scanpst, against the data file</p>
<p>State what error msgs</p>
<p>If you restart the PC, when its fully loaded you start outlook using the safe switch (Hold the Ctrl key when starting OL) is the problem then replicated?

            <p>My wife and I have the same problems of 2 different machines ... and we have the same pattern = problems 2-3 time a year, starting up with no mail for some hours, then a big chunk, longer and longer periodes between the chunks and within 3-4 day not connecting
 at all - the same pattern every time on both our machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same setup and versions (OS too) on the two machines and fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the _BEEP_ is wrong with that crappy Outlook program - and it has been wrong in ALL VERSIONS for years - we have run them all, same pattern 2-3 times a year !!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ISP says it's NOT their fault and Google says the same (we have en G-Mail account), but I can see out there, that a lot of people have these proplems in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem keeps coming back - why isn't solved YEARS ago ?</p>
<p>How do we "work around" it when it's obviously not solved yet ?</p>

            <p>As the case before - it starts with THE SAME PROBLEMS on 2 DIFFERENT machines in the house and it evolves to something completely out of proportion !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm investigating one of them now and I:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) run SFC /SCANNOW and it reported A LOT of warnings/errors ... nearly BIG DATA - for me completely useless information in that log-file !</p>
<p>2) CHKDSK reports NO PROBLEMS AT ALL</p>
<p>3) I tried REPAIR Office installation - it will NOT run through !</p>
<p>4) I tried to DELETE the Outlook profile and start all over - how is that done in Windows 10 ???????????????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of methods to "renew profile" in Outlook is found out there but nearly all uses "MAIL from control panel" and that's NOT THERE anymore in Windows 10 ... or ??? (I beleave it's a new Mail-klient now - right ?)</p>

            There are already so many discussions about installation of NSU and PCSuite, that is better for you do a little search and see if you find your solution. But, just my guess, could be a registry problem...

<h2>            Guest access in Microsoft Teams - free version as well as paid</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are trying to use MS Teams for our non-profit organisation. I have set-up team in free version and added users. Couple of guys use MS Teams in their work so I was planning inviting them as guests so that they can use it alongside their normal work team.
 It was working fine. I was able to add one friend there and we were normally using MS Teams. However, we have been facing very strange issue recently (about week or so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>He no longer sees our team in MS Teams (PC and mobile client). I do not see him in the list of team members (only his personal account). When I search for him, I can still find his account and he appears to be online (green sign alongside his account). MS
 Teams app is reporting that our team has guests, but as I have mentioned his name (and no other guest name) is visible in list of members. I have tried to add him again and it is telling me that I'm not authorized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my personal account with paid subscription to Office 365 Business Premium which includes teams. I have tried to setup test team to try to add him there just for test. I have gone through all different settings from various manuals - from enabling
 Guest access up to Azure AD config. I cannot add neither him or anybody else as Guest to this team also. Same error - you are not authorized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - question is - what is wrong and is there any particular issue with Guest access currently on the platform?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Unable to launch InfoPath from SharePoint ribbon - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to launch InfoPath from SharePoint ribbon</h2>
                    
<p>i recently upgraded to office 2016 from office 2013. i had my laptop synced with my sharepoint libraries and used to work seamlessly before the upgrade. i somehow managed to get the folders synced again. this involved repairing office 2016 online. but even
 though all the files and folders are in sync, the infopath is not getting launched from the sharepoint ribbon like it used to earlier. note that office 2016 did not have infopath, so i had to install infopath 2013 separately. i am able to edit the sharepoint
 form using infopath, but am unable to publish all changes. some changes did get published! to be more specific, the new field i added got published but the button and corresponding rule did not get published. any idea what i might be doing wrong?</p>

<p>hi rajivvarghese，</p>
<p>about the issue, to clarify the scenario and find the root cause, could you confirm the following details?</p>
<p>1. about “the infopath is not getting launched from the sharepoint ribbon”, is there no responding when clicking on the

<p>hi rajivvarghese，</p>
<p>thanks for your update.</p>
<p>from you information, i noticed that you run into an error message when publishing the form. to troubleshot the issue, could you try the following steps:<br />
1. check if you have the “<em>sharepoint server enterprise site collection features</em>” activated via<strong> site settings &gt; site collection administration &gt; site collection features</strong>.<br />
2. check if you have the “<em>sharepoint server enterprise site features</em>” activated via<strong> site sittings &gt; site actions &gt; manage site features</strong>.<br />
3. go to <strong>sharepoint admin center &gt; infopath &gt; allow users to browser-enable form templates</strong> and
<strong>render form templates that are browser-enabled by users</strong>.<br />

<p>in addition, here is a thread having the similar issue for your reference: <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/office/en-us/ea8da113-fe9a-4878-9994-c1f24cc85c37/soap-error-when-publishing-infopath-form-to-sharepoint?forum=sharepointcustomizationprevious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soap error when publishing infopath form to sharepoint</a>.</p>
<p>if the issue persists, could you confirm the following details? <br />
1. does the issue occur to other lists or the new list in the same site? <br />
2. can you publish it via <strong>file &gt; publish &gt; sharepoint list</strong>? <br />
3. could you upload the form into the workspace in pm for our further investigation?</p>
<p>if anything is misunderstood, please let us know and we will continue to discuss the situation based on the update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Shirley,</p>
<p>All the above three features are active.</p>
<p>Issue persists with other lists in the same site.</p>
<p>FILE &gt; Publish &gt; SharePoint list also gives the same error.</p>
<p>Form is a very basic one. I am attaching it to the PM.</p>
<p>Tried in Chrome. At least it gives a dialogue box asking to use Internet Explorer. But on Internet Explorer, there is no result of the click.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>
<p>Rajiv</p>

<p>Hi Rajiv,</p>
<p>Regarding the error message, I suggest you check if there exists any error in the form via FILE &gt; Design Checker &gt;Double-Click each warning/error to be taken to the view column. If the error exists in your form, I suggest you remove the related fields and
 check if the form can be published successfully.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue ”can’t open InfoPath from SharePoint”, have you tried repairing InfoPath via control panel &gt; programs and features &gt; select InfoPath &gt; change? If not, please try repair first.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for further customization issues and client issue, I suggest you post a thread in our dedicated
<a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sharepointgeneral%2Cappsforsharepoint%2Csharepointdevelopment%2Csharepointcustomization%2Csharepointsearch%2Csharepointadmin&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=infopath+form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Rajiv,</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>To troubleshot the issue further, could you confirm the following details?</p>
<p>1. To confirm if the issue was caused by the browser on the computer, can you launch InfoPath from SharePoint ribbon on other computer with your current work/school account logged in?
<br />
2. Does the issue occur&nbsp;to other users?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>I tried the above two tests. The issue remains. I feel the issue is more around linking of Office 2016 and Office 2013 applications. Is there some software update that fixes this? It is definitely not a user issue as I tried on a system with Office 2013
 only and it works fine. It's only when I use InfoPath 2013 with Office 2016 that I have this issue. I am more inclined to believe that both of my stated issues are arising out of the same problem and might have the same solution.</p>
