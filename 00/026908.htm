            Leave it to Microsoft to takes basic text editing and word-processing features backwards at least 50 years!!&nbsp; Next thing you know they'll be no way to back-space or type text in upper case.

<p>I know this is old but it still comes near the top of the search results in Google when searching for "excel arrows don't move cursor when editing text".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem only happens when you start typing directly&nbsp;in to&nbsp;a cell, it doesn't happen if you click to edit text in a cell and then start typing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get the arrow keys working again while you are typing&nbsp;you have to either press F2 or click on the cell you are already editing - it's a simple as that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is intentional behaviour although it breaks every UI consistency rule in the book, but then Excel has never done things properly from day one. They could have easily maintained speed of data entry AND kept UI editing consistency by requiring
 the Enter key as a means of terminating text entry (instead of allowing arrow keys to terminate text entry under certain conditions). We already have the ability to have the Enter key automatically move us to the next cell so I can't understand how this UI
 anomaly has been allowed to remain in Excel for so long.</p>

<p>This behavior happens when typing text in a cell: if the text matches another cell the autocomplete text is displayed in gray. To move to the end of the grayed text I press the right arrow key but instead of moving through the text, it saves the cell and
 moves focus to the cell to the right. With the cursor at the end of text, pressing the left arrow key doesn't move left through the text, but saves the cell and moves focus to the cell to the left (or if it's in col A, it just closes the cell).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The arrow keys are [inexplicably] duplicating the function of the TAB key instead of moving the cursor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>David.M.Reed's F2 solution is just a habit I'll have to develop. Another Microsoft workaround.</p>

<p>Sorry in advance for the rant, but Microsoft products in general are no longer viable and this is from someone who has been using them for 35 years. We are witnessing the death throes of something that is the instigator of its own death, and rightly so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel looks pretty but is so unreliable that is no longer viable. The number of times I have come up against "File not saved" is ridiculous. If you want to do anything semi-advanced in Excel or Word you have to Google it. How ridiculous is that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 came up with the exact opposite of what a user interface should be - intuitive. Instead they created hidden gestures with zero UI explanation that you had to Google to find out what they were. The sort of&nbsp; organisation where this is even possible
 is surely contaminated with the opposite of what you need in a UI based company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE11 is basically broken when accessing a myriad of common websites (the error is in mshtml.dll CTreeNode AreAllFormatsValid and the error is caused by the ecx register having a zero pointer address value always) but they have said on Connect that they won't
 fix it (because they want you to use Edge even if it isn't possible for business reasons). You might see this as "IE has encountered a problem. Searching for solution" then the page reloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visual Studio 2017 crashes daily with regards intellisense trying to load relating to CSS but it gets worse in every release rather than getting fixed. This is a running joke with developers. Well I say joke...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 itself causes PCs to be unusable for hours on end after anniversary updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (very latest version) under certain conditions (which I frequently encounter) causes the backspace key to generate an error message every time you press it. I am not making this up even though you would rightly assume
 that this gross level of incompetence couldn't exist at this level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WSUS server basically has a built in self destruct mechanism once you reach a critical threshold of the number of updates you are pushing. They will not fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exchange server has an as yet unresolved bug regarding attachments at a particular byte threshold. The mind boggles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is no longer possible to print to scale now they have "upgraded" us to the Photos metro app. They removed this ability completely in the Photos app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a massive problem with trying to run Windows 10 as administrator in corporate environment with regards metro apps. You'll need to get familiar with secpol to even regain basic functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In IE11, they removed the security padlock icon from the address bar under certain circumstances (mainly intranet sites). Here's the kicker though, in general, if you right click and click the Properties button in IE11, then click the Certificates button,
 you are knackered. You can't click OK, you can't click anything. IE11 basically locks up and you have to kill it from your task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is still not uncommon for printing in Windows 10 to go badly wrong and require someone to delete the contents of the windows/system32/spool folder. Try talking someone elderly through that little gem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go on and on and on and on about this disaster of an operating system but the basic truth is that Windows 10 is not a viable operating system in this day and age. Their products are not viable and have contributed to massive corporate loss by facilitating
 viruses on an unforgivable level. How many of us need macros in a Word document? I never have but I've spent hours of my life restoring backups because a virus ran in a Word macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People need something that just works as a consumable product. Not something that you have to know how to work. Douglas Adams said computers should be as understandable as using a chair. Windows is the opposite of that and will always be so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows was badly designed from the start. It is based on DOS and still is. It uses a "registry" which was the single biggest mistake an operating system ever made. It is so ridiculously slow now that they have had to cheat to make you believe that is it
 usable. When you shutdown your Windows 10 PC, it doesn't actually shut down, it partially hibernates. If it actually shut down and you had to fully restart it, you would stop using it because Windows 10 is built on so much archaic trash that it would be unusable.
 We now have to instruct corporate users to click "Restart" and not "Shutdown" so we can actually roll out updates to the company. It is an absolute joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pick up an IPad or an Android phone a with a fraction of the power of a PC and marvel at how you can't break it, it always works, it is 100 times easier to operate and it never gets infected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is dying. It deserves to die. Their CEOs are clueless (or accidental in the case of William Gates) and the world needs to move on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, sorry for the (factually accurate) rant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ironically, Edge locked up three times while I was writing this. It's like poetic justice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long live the king (Android/Chromebook/iOs) the king (Windows) is dead.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Email Does not recognize mouse clicks on email--CANNOT OPEN EMAIL ITEMS</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I've a problem with my outlook email that just developed over the last day or two. I cannot open the emails.&nbsp; They are highlighted when I scroll over them, but the clicks are ignored.&nbsp; I cannot select other folders either. The only place the mouse seems
 to work is up in the header.&nbsp; But...when I select NEW, it reports "Almost done." and the page is then unresponsive.<br />
I can get to the email on another computer, and&nbsp;on my phone.&nbsp; I tried inPrivate browsing to see if that had an impact, but&nbsp; still have the same problem.&nbsp; I signed out of my account.&nbsp; I signed back in--same issue.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I tried deleting the cookie for outlook too.&nbsp; It did not seem to have an effect.&nbsp; I'm wary of deleting all cookies because I may lose some feature of some web sites I fear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

                    the messages are just stuck there. &nbsp;Outlook goes nuts trying to resend them. &nbsp;the stuck messages have a couple of faulty email addresses so that's why apparently this hideous thing developed. &nbsp;The messages are indicated to be in the outbox by the number
 (2) but there's no way to make them visible or delete them. &nbsp;I tried to change the filters or clear the filters but i'm not using filters, and none of that worked. i tried working offline, but the messages still won't appear or let me delete them. &nbsp;
<div>I'm using a gmail account as the sender address, Outlook 2011 Version 14.1.4, on an iMac with Lion software. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Why is Outlook such a nightmare to use?</div>

</div>

</div>
<div>I have two group emails with faulty addresses stuck in my Outbox. &nbsp;I can't access them or see them except the outblox shows (2) emails are stuck there and Outlook is going crazy trying to resent them every few minutes. &nbsp;I tired to use the filters to make
 the troubled messages visible but nothing worked. &nbsp;Should i just delete the email account that they're being sent from? &nbsp;this is a nightmare. &nbsp;i've tried working offline to make them visible but that doesn't make them show up easier. &nbsp;I can still send other
 messages from that email account. &nbsp;I don't want to delete all my messages in my google account to cure this. &nbsp;How do i get OUtlook to work properly?</div>

<p>You have to have a message in the Outbox in order to see it. Once you go into Offline mode, create a new email and send it. It will stay in the Outbox while in Offline mode. Then you can select the Outbox and view any emails in there.</p>

<br />
Is there a version specific to xp x64??&nbsp; AMD 64 processor<br />

I looked at past post that indicated it did not - HAS anything changed?<br />

            There is no support for XP-64.&nbsp; Only XP-32 and Vista/W7 32 and 64-bit.<br />
<br />
If you want the 64-bit version for Vista and W7, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.microsoft.com/security_essentials</a> and click on "locales and languages".&nbsp; There you will find the link for the 64-bit version for those systems.<br />

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to Palcouk suggestions, please check the following to fix this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.) If you have done a recent password change, you need to login to the correct updated password on Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.) Check on the lower right hand corner of outlook and check if your outlook is connected.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53e30b06-b1a8-4eca-9bb1-a39f38873afd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53e30b06-b1a8-4eca-9bb1-a39f38873afd" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.) Clear the stuck email to check if the issue is related to a corrupt mail or has a large attachment. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Outlook client, click Send/Receive tab, then click Work Offline.</li><li>Select the Outbox, then Move/Drag the message to the Drafts folder (now you can remove or resize the large attachment, before sending again)</li><li>Delete the message.</li><li>Go to Send/Receive tab and click again Work Offline to enable connection.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue still occurs, please provide the following information to further troubleshoot the issue:</p>

<h2>            reset new document format</h2>
                    I am getting a frame for every new document I open. I have to right click to remove frame every time. I have tried everything possible to correct the issue but to no avail. I even had a computer technician check it and he could not find the problem either.
 He tried to reset the new document settings but nothing worked. It's driving me crazy. HELP!

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Were there any recent changes or updates made on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Does this issue occur only for a particular website?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the complete and exact error message?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Use the <b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</b> mode</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To do this, click Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If this resolves the issue, follow these steps to isolate the browser add-on that is causing the issue:
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Tools</b>, and then click
<b>Internet Options</b>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the <b>Programs</b> tab, and then click
<b>Manage add-ons</b>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click an add-on in the Name list, and then click
<b>Disable</b>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Repeat step 3 until you identify the add-on that is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try to open the webpage in </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-do-some-webpages-look-incorrect-in-Internet-Explorer-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Compatibility mode</span></a><span>. For more information about Compatibility View,
 see </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-to-use-Compatibility-View-in-Internet-Explorer-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to use Compatibility View in Internet Explorer 9</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you refer the link and follow the steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>How to reinstall or repair Internet Explorer in Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318378</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>"Please note that resetting Internet Explorer (IE) settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed extensions, toolbars and other add-ons to IE Defaults. This includes all Security, Privacy and
 Zone settings. Also this will clear browsing history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 4</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you disable User Account Control and check if the problem persists.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. It works by prompting you for permission when a task requires administrative rights, such as installing software or changing settings that
 affect other users. We don't recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.</span></p>

<h2>            I&#39;m trying to sort alphabetically the data in report filters in an excel pivot table when information has been added after initially creating the table</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?toolid=10029&amp;campid=CAMPAIGNID&amp;customid=CUSTOMID&amp;catId=267&amp;type=2&amp;ext=190915446211&amp;item=190915446211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<span><span>F</span>ilter</span> section of the pivot. There are about 95 values in this drop-down.<br />
<br />
Problem: The list isn't sorted in alphabetical order. Or rather, for the most part it is, but not entirely.
</p>
<p>As I make additions after initailly creating the pivot table, it just adds them on to the bottom of the list.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>How can I force this Report <span><span>F</span>ilter</span> drop-down to sort values alphabetically?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An answer that I was given was:</p>
<p>The issue is that when you first create the pivot table a member list is created fore each dimension. As the source data of the pivot table changes
<br />
and new members are added they just get appended to the bottom of the list. To fix the issue just remove that dimension completely from the pivot table,
<span><font color="#3366cc">refresh</font></span> the table and then put the dimension back again. The memebers should now be back in Alpha order... or at least that is how it goes in previous versions of XL...<br />
<span><font color="#3366cc">refresh</font></span> the table and then put the dimension back again. The memebers should now be back in Alpha order... or at least that is how it goes in previous versions of XL...<br />
<br />
Is there an easier way than the above, as I am going to constantly be having additions to this pivot table.&nbsp; I refresh the data all the time and the new data appears, but it is not sorted alphabetically in the report filter drop down when trying to select a
 certain choice.&nbsp; </p>

<h3> louisepink  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Emails from Hotmail to Outlook &#40;Office 365&#41;</h2>
                    I have a hotmail.com account (the Plus type if it makes a difference) and a new Outlook/Office 365 account (I log in at&nbsp;login.microsoftonline.com). I would like to migrate my old hotmail emails to the Exchange account and then close the hotmail.com account.
 &nbsp;Is that possible?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Next, I have not been successful "connecting" the hotmail.com account to the Office 365 email. &nbsp;Is there a troubleshooting guide?<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, what will connecting accounts mean? &nbsp;Are the messages saved into the Office 365 system or are they only available as long as the account are connected?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Louise</div>
                </div>

            <span><font color="#000000">Hello Louise, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
1) Query related to transferring Hotmail account data into Office 365 organizational account will be better addressed in the following Office 365 Community:</font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://community.office365.com/en-us/forums/158.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font>http://community.office365.com/en-us/forums/158.aspx</font></span></a></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
</span><span><font color="#000000">2) If you're trying to connect Hotmail email account in Outlook 2013, you may follow instructions mentioned in the below article and see if it helps:</font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<a href="http://blogs.office.com/2012/11/15/put-the-power-of-outlook-2013-behind-your-outlook-com-email/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://blogs.office.com/2012/11/15/put-the-power-of-outlook-2013-behind-your-outlook-com-email/</font></a><br />
<font><br />
</font></span><font color="#000000">3) 'Connecting account' means that you will be able to access Hotmail (Microsoft) email account from Outlook 2013. The messages are not locally saved on your computer and can be only accessed until the email account exists
 in Outlook.<br />
<br />
I hope the above information helps. If you have any other questions related to Office products, reply and I’ll be glad to help you.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</font></span>

            <p>The easiest way to do this is via Outlook itself (the desktop application).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Configure both accounts in Outlook, and then you can move your messages from your Hotmail account to the Exchange account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Connecting accounts means that your Exchange account will also check for new emails on another mail platform via IMAP or POP3. The messages retrieved will exist within the Exchange mailbox (delivered to your Inbox) and&nbsp;within the connected mailbox as well.</p>

                    <p>I’m noticing more talk of Focused Inbox replacing Clutter in the near future.&nbsp; However, all my research indicates that this will be for Office 365 subscription version of Office only – those with Office 2013 or Office 2016 Home and Business (retail) will
 not get the feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is that true?&nbsp; And what will happen to Clutter once Focused is rolled out?&nbsp; Those with Office 2013 or Office 2016 Home and Business will not get any clutter or focused inbox? Will clutter be removed from Office2013 or Office2016 Home &amp; Business Version ?</p>

<p>Phone in NOT in the Insider program. Encryption is turned off. I have tried soft&nbsp; resets with absolutely no effect regarding this issue. I am not alone others have jumped through hoops trying to get this update released a month ago to install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI I just spent an hour doing a hard reset and like so many others having this same exact problem that accomplished nothing to fix this issue. This phone Lumina 830 has had no problems in the past installing mobile10 updates except for this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a 50Mbps/5Mbps internet connection should be more than enough to install this update. The result is always the same. It tried to install the update and gets to 7% and fails.</p>

            Hello walstromox, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having difficulty retrieving and reading your Outlook e-mails because it is loading too slowly for you. I know how frustrating this can be, and I will try my best to help you to resolve this issue.
<br />
<br />
1. Is there an error message? <br />
2. Had it ever been fast to you? <br />
3. What is your average ping in <code>ms</code> to Outlook.com? <br />
<br />
May I suggest you to delete your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and clear browser caches then restart the browser?
<br />
<br />
- selectively deleting browser cookies <br />
<a href="https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10/clearing-cookies-from-just-one-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10...</a>
<br />
- clearing browser caches <br />
<a href="https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/</a>
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can open in <em>private mode</em> (or "incognito mode") or try with a
<strong>different browser</strong> entirely. <br />
<br />
To ping Outlook.com with your Windows 10 PC, <code>Windows</code>+<code>R</code> then enter
<code>cmd</code> and key in this: <code>ping outlook.com</code>. My result is 194ms in avg and it is fairly fast for me.
<br />
<br />
If your result is similar or lower number, then it is a <strong>browser-related issue.</strong>
<br />
<br />
Please ensure that you have a <strong>reliable Internet connection</strong> in the entire process.
<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you soon, <br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear that. Although I am not part of Outlook.com development team and any decision-making since I am just an Independent Advisor, but I know they are very keen to make the service the best possible for everyone.

    <title>Morph Transition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christine_o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Morph Transition</h2>
                    I have Office 365 and have the Morph Transition tool in Powerpoint.&nbsp; The Morph tool seems to only work seamlessly when I use the resize handles on a shape.&nbsp; But if I change the shape using edit points, Morph does not work.&nbsp; What happens is the first shape
 fades out completely and then when it comes to the next slide and the new shape "appears".&nbsp; So it doesn't "Morph" so to speak.&nbsp; I have read that you should not change the amount of points, and I haven't.&nbsp; I've only changed the shape by editing points that
 were already there.&nbsp; I've gone through step-by-step instructions on the Microsoft website, and I still can't get this to morph properly.&nbsp; Oh, and I've also Updated Office with system restart, plus tried repairing Office with a system restart and it didn't
 fix the problem.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas? Is this just me? or is anyone else having this issue?

            You can also add "Convert to Freeform" to the QAT&nbsp; and use that with shape 1 instead of edit points.

<p><span>Hi jessica84,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>How
 long have you had this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 the issue occur only with the websites added as favorites?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the methods listed below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open Internet Explorer (IE) in no add-ons mode and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>To start Internet Explorer without add-ons,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, and select
<strong>All Programs</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Accessories</strong>, and select
<strong>System Tools.</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which
 add-on is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please see “Method 3: Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode” in the following article for further instructions:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If method 1 does not help in fixing the issue, follow the other methods listed in the order of appearance in the following article:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Please provide the following information for analysis:</p>
<p>1.Does the issue happen to different browsers?</p>
<p>2.Do other members in this group have the three dots (...) option and can they access files?</p>
<p>3.A screenshot about"<span>The three dots (...) to the right of the Plan name are not available for me to choose to edit or access the SharePoint, Notebook, etc</span>" &nbsp;of the affected plan.</p>
<p>4.Log into OWA -&gt; Groups -&gt; select the affected group -&gt; on the top, click Files or site to see if it works there.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the ports are blocked. I forgot to mention that this started happening after the Windows October Update (1809).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed to resolve the issue by implementing the solution on&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/screen-sharing-not-working-after-1809-update/d87bbb41-ea19-4e1d-b2b0-2fb8315071c7">this post</a>&nbsp;which
 was to set the <strong>MaxUserPort </strong>value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems more of a temporary solution though. Hopefully you will have a more permanent solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hosney</p>

<p>Definitely an issue with def updates for</p>
<p>today, because it's also popping the error</p>
<p>on my laptop that hadn't been updated since 12/7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Do not ask me what finally fixed it, but I just</p>
<p>got a def update to .227.</p>
<p>There were 2 things:</p>
<p>Sometime today it ran a scan and I</p>
<p>had also reported it to Jen and Jason.</p>
<p>If it was a fix on there side, it was fast.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are getting popup to open or save aa.js from q.adrta.com and I will be happy to answer your query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aa.js from q.adrta.com is from&nbsp;intrusive ad-supported application which has been categorized as PUP and Adware that brings users with poor online surfing experience and soddish system performance. It enters your PC by using free software packages and spam
 emails. If you install&nbsp;these with Custom Installation without canceling potentially unwanted options or open attachments from emails sent by spammer, aa.js from q.adrta.com sneaks into your system without your knowledge. Once it has been installed,&nbsp;your PC

<p>I am having the same issue. I am getting a notification bar when I am in internet explorer asking me if I wish to open aa.js&nbsp; from&nbsp; q.adrta. An internet research indicates this is malware or a virus. When performing a virus scan with my McAfee antivirus,
 which is up to date. it does not detect any viruses or threats. </p>

Depending on how you have set up your email accounts, some of your email messages will not be synced. For example one of your accounts is set up a
<strong>POP</strong> (Post Office Protocol) from one device and <strong>IMAP</strong> (Internet Message Access Protocol) from another, you will not be able to see the messages if the device that is using POP that already downloaded the message from the email
 server.<br />
<br />
You will need to make changes to the device that is using POP to leave a copy of the messages on the mail server so the device that is using IMAP will be able to view the messages.<br />
<br />
The best solution for your concern is to configure all of your email accounts as IMAP across all of your devices. This way all of your messages can be viewed on any email clients that you are using.<br />
<br />

                    <p>Whatever changes were made to outlook, please revert them.<br />
<br />
We are getting the same emails repeated thousands of times. They go to junk but when we delete them, they end up in a different deleted folder.</p>
<p>Now our storage is practically full and we cannot delete all the emails.<br />
<br />
Logged into the online version to clear them but nothing works. <br />
Empty the folder, delete the emails, next refresh they're all back.<br />
<br />
Makes running a business almost impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I clear these permanently?</p>

<p>I have already tried all those steps and they are not the problem and did not fix it.
<br />
<br />
The problem is outlook generating insane amounts of copies of emails.<br />
<br />
I went from 10K in my deleted to over 350K</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t remove transitions from a presentation.</h2>
                    I have modified a ppt file for another presentation. I can't get the transitions of the slides. I've used the instructions from help but it does not work. It's making me crazy. Help!!!

<p>In your title you say you can't remove the transitions.&nbsp; In the body of the post you say you can't get the transitions.&nbsp; Which one are you trying to do - remove transitions or add transitions?</p>
<p>Add transition to Slide 2:</p>
<p>Pick Animation and from the Transition to This Slide gallery pick a transition.</p>
<p>to test it press F5 and click once on the slide.</p>
<p>Remove the transition to Slide 2:</p>
<p>Pick Animation and from the Transition to This Slide gallery pick a No Transition (the first option).</p>
<p>test as above.</p>

<p>Not sure I know what you mean but maybe:</p>
<p>Animation tab &gt; Choose the first icon in Transitions (None) then Apply to All.</p>

<p>Hope I'm not repeating myself. My dog just unplugged my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Office 2007 Powerpoint, I can't find the "no" option for transitions. I have slow, medium, fast.</p>
<p>What should I do? Set to "fast" there is still noticeable transition.</p>

            I found out that I was trying to use Transition Speed.
