<h2>            Blue Screen problem,  Internet Explorer not Responding, After Windows 10 update</h2>
                    I recently tried to update to Window 10.&nbsp; With no success still running windows 8.1. I now have several problems and am not sure which one I should address.&nbsp; I researched the Blue Screen problem which I have.&nbsp; I also have the Internet Explorer from my
 desk top is "Not Responding" I also have the freezes up for 5 minutes and will not respond.&nbsp; It also is indicating that I have an windows update and to restart the computer which I have done several time to no avail.&nbsp; I'm not sure what I should do.&nbsp; Any help
 anyone can offer would greatly be appreciated.&nbsp; Frustrated and wishing I never hit the update now button.

            <p>Thank you for your advice. I started with the sfc /scannow and got the error message
</p>
<p>"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some..." So I went&nbsp;to the next step and ran &nbsp;"DISM
<span>/</span><span>Online</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>Cleanup</span><span>-</span><span>Image</span><span>
</span><span>/</span><span>RestoreHealth" after running that and receiving "The restore completed successfully." Restarted, test PC same thing, reran sfc /scannow gave me the original error message.&nbsp; Ran the DISM... 2 more times and then ran the sfc/scannow
 and this was the message. "Windows&nbsp; Rsource Protection Found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.&nbsp; Details are included in the CBS.log.windir\logs\cbs\cbs.log example.... Did I do something wrong? Did I somehow cause this big mess?
</span></p>
<p><span>Not sure where I should go from here. Thank you in advance for your help.&nbsp;

            Obviously there is an issue with win 8.1 and that is the reason why the upgrade failed.&nbsp; Can you&nbsp; upload your CBS.LOG file to onedrive and give us a link to it so we can take a look at what is corrupt.

<h2>            An app default was reset....</h2>
                    <p>Since last week, everytime I start up my PC Windows 10 starts spamming me with Notifications on the right of screen, they all start with above message and then say something else like TV and Movies, Music, Photo, Browser.</p>
<p>I reselect things like Chrome to my default and it immediately pings out another message on the right hand side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have googled this type of error and the only solution IVe found is to remove the most recent installations I hae done. The only things on my Add/remove programs this whole month are Microsoft things like "Sport", "photos", "word Mobile" "Get Office", "Skype",
 "Store", "One Note"</p>
<p>
</p><p>All have been deleted except OneNote, which I click on Uninstall and nothings happens. THe error is still happening too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Im assuming that means the this OneNote thing is the problem, does anyone know how to uninstall this, or fix the constant changing of all my defaults?</p>

<p>Hi thanks for helping, sorry but &nbsp;I cant get a screenshot of the notification as when I select Snipping Tool the Action Centre on the right closes immediately.</p>
<p>The notification states " Settings, an app default was reset, an app caused a problem with the default app" and then the time. It then changes my default browser to Edge, the next changes my default music player to Groove and so on, everytime I choose to
 put them back to my preferences it pings up the same notification again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for altercations no, Ive not done anything but those things listed above all of which are gone apart from this OneNote which seems to be installed on the first day I noticed this notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the screenshot, not too techy, but as soon asi do something else the action centre box disappears again :(<br />

<p><strong><br />
</strong>Hey fellas, I'm trying to <strong>change</strong> my <strong>NAT type</strong> from
<strong>moderate</strong> to <strong>open</strong>. I've basically tried everything I've found on the web. Firstly
<strong>I gave the console a static IP, changed the DNS to 8.8.8.8. (Primary) 8.8.4.4.(Secondary), did the DHCP reservation, forwarded the recommended ports, tried with the enabled DMZ (its disabled now).</strong></p>
<p>I also get an error when I run the multiplayer connection test, as in it stops and gives me the error
<strong>"0x7f43"</strong> saying the test cannot be completed. On the NAT side of the things I get an error saying
<strong>"Your network is behind a&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>UPnP port-restricted NAT"</strong> but since I turned off the UPnP now it says
<strong>"Your network is behind a&nbsp;port-restricted NAT"&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I've been trying to fix this problem for a few days now and I'm tired and completely frustrated. If you need more info, please let me know.</span></p>

<p>I not sure you can resolve this being that its satellite , but I would unplug the Dlink from the Hughes modem and plug the xbox into the Hughes modem , restart everything and run the test again and check NAT , if its still not open , then its on Xplorenets
 end and you need to call them and ask if they can open ports and see if you have a public or private ip (if private , ask to get public ) &nbsp;if your Nat is open when you plug into the Hughes modem , then we know the Dlink is the bad guy ...</p>

<p>@Ceaser , you are using 2 routers it seams , the Telsec and the Dlink...that usually causes problems unless the first device is in "bridge mode" ... you should also try and plug the xbox into the first device or the Telsec and see if things improve ...</p>

<p>@bimnog. Thanks for the reply. If I unplug the Dlink from the HT1000 I'll have no internet since Dlink provides the internet to all my other devices and the HT1000 has no ethernet ports, just the internet port which goes to my Dlink. But I will plug the
 Xbox straight to the HT1000 and post the results.</p>
<p>However, I want to share something weird that happened last night as I was trying different things to get an open NAT. As I mentioned in the OP, I had UPnP disabled and the ports forwarded with the DHCP reservation. I upgraded my router firmware (2.11) and
 enabled the UPnP, rebooted my router and BAM!! my NAT was OPEN!! </p>
<p>I did the multiplayer connection test and this time I got the TEREDO error, but I ignored that since my NAT was open. So I opened CoD Black Ops 3, and there I was getting a "moderate" NAT, after doing some research I found you need to open UDP port 3075
 to get open NAT on Black Ops 3 (I had UDP port 3074 open.) SO I go back into my router settings and port forward UDP 3075, reboot the router, and I'm stuck in moderate again and back to square one. Anyone know why that happened?</p>
<p>Now since I have my UPnP enabled, I have removed all the forwarded ports (that's what I have read online you should do), DHCP reservation is still on though. What do you guys think?</p>

<p>So as it was suggested, I plugged the Xbox straight to the HT1000. </p>
<p>At first it gave me the NAT type as strict and on the multiplayer test I got the TEREDO error, saying I was behind a firewall with a packet loss of 100%, yet the network connection test said everything was good.
</p>
<p>Then I changed the IP and DNS settings to automatic......and that changed the NAT to open.
</p>
<p>However, the same thing occurred after I restarted the system. After the reboot it went back to moderate.
</p>
<p>Now I'm connected to the DLink and I changed the IP and DNS settings to automatic (only the DNS changed since I'm still on DHCP reservation) and its still on moderate NAT.</p>
<p>Btw my DNS now is 192.168.1.1 (primary, gateway being the same) and 0.0.0.0 (secondary). Is that a normal DNS?</p>

<p>If while plugged into the modem only and still cant get open nat , your isp must have something going on , that would be the only thing I could think of , you could call them and ask if they happen to block any ports or have anykind of firewall (others on
 here have had problems with a satellite connection also) .....you may also try and restore the modem and router to factory defaults since you have made changes (should be a little reset button on the back , hold in for 30 seconds ) , UPNP should handle all
 port traffic unless its blocked from the isp </p>

<p>My past experience with ISP's has not been too great. It's usually a bunch of idiots who tell you to do things you've already tried 10^5 times.
</p>
<p>Asking them to put the HT1000 into "bridge mode" would be pointless since I'm certain its only a modem.</p>
<p>If I do decide to call my ISP, what exactly do I ask them?</p>

<p>Bridge mode was for the other guy up there....I would ask them if the block any of the ports that xbox uses and can they open them...I would also try the resets I mentioned above....but if you can't get open nat when hooked to just the modem , you have NO
 chance when you hook up the router.....and I'm no familiar with that Hughes modem , it may controll nat somehow...</p>

            <p>@Panchod - Do you know if you're assigned to a public/routable IP address? Or if your ISP is actually using NAT themselves within their network realm?</p>
<p>There's a feature on the HT1000 that are known to cause connectivity problems with Xbox Live. Follow the steps up front on how to:<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.systemcontrolcenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.systemcontrolcenter.com</a></li>
<li>To the right of System Information you will see an italic "i" in white, with a slightly off-white&nbsp;box around it -&nbsp;it may be difficult&nbsp;to see this icon. Click the "i" icon.</li>
<li><i>(Another way to see the icon because&nbsp;it is almost invisible is to crtl+a and that way it highlights the icon)</i></li>
<li>Click on Web Acceleration.</li>
<li>Click on Control.</li>
<li>Place a check in the "Disable Web Acceleration" box.</li>
<li>Click Submit</li>
</ol>
<p><br />It is usually recommended to reset the router after its firmware has been updated.<br /><br />The secondary DNS doesn't matter as long as it can resolve DNS lookup through the primary DNS.<br /><br />This router (make and model) should work with UPnP. So there shouldn't be any need for configure network ports used by Xbox Live manually.</p>

</p><p>The crash points to a file system error, but I believe the underlying issue of a conflict between Microsoft Security essentials and a webroot module,

<h2>            Connectivity Issues regarding Logitech C920 Webcam and Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Recently, I purchased a Logitech C920 &nbsp;webcam. Successfully downloaded Skype (most recent version 77.85) &nbsp;and passed the microphone and speaker test. &nbsp;My current version of Windows is &nbsp;8.1 (64-bit) The speaker and microphone application for Skype is online
 and passed. However, the webcam application for Skype does not connect. &nbsp;In addition, the Windows Camera application for Windows 8.1 successfully works. All three capabilities of the Windows camera application works:<strong> sound, recording and camera</strong>
 connectivity. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I was able to sucessfully to download the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.logitech.com/pub/video/lws/lws280.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">latest
 version of the Logitech Webcam Software</a><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>&nbsp;for the HD Pro Webcam C920. After rebooting Windows, I was able to load the Logitech
 C920 icon and&nbsp;corresponding&nbsp;executable to the desktop. However, all webchat applications besides the Windows supplied Camera application have issues with the Webcam connectivity:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>Yahoo Messenger</span></span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>Skype</span></span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>Paltalk</span></span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>Logitech</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
After downloading the Logitech executable, The Windows 8.1 is still unable to detect C920 webcam</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
With the Logitech Webcam Software, it just doesn't detect it at all. The whole thing is just black or blank.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I know the camera is functional though, because it works perfectly fine in the Windows 8.1 Camera app.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Any assistance and help regarding this issue will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            No ringing of caller&#39;s phones.</h2>
                    <p>When I call a nonSkype user's landline or smart phone number, their number does not ring.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tested this today with four people.&nbsp; &nbsp;None of them heard a ring sound.&nbsp; &nbsp;I left a voice mail.&nbsp; &nbsp;The voice mail caused a ding on their phone.&nbsp; One person said their
 phone did not ring but they heard my voice as I was saying.. "answer..answer"&nbsp; lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's up with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an annual subscription and I have used Skype for forever it seems..... 9 years or more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called using both desktop Skype and my smartphone app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Could identify the region you are trying to call?
<br />
<br />Unfortunately Skype does not support calls to all number ranges in every country. There are certain premium-priced or geographic/country specific numbers which are forbidden and cannot be reached using Skype.
<br />
<br />Due to fluctuations in the public switched telephone network (PTSN) we cannot always guarantee the quality or reliability of calls made from Skype. Such issues are usually temporary, so if you have problems calling a specific number, we suggest trying again later. If the problem persists, please report this, stating the destination and your Skype Name, to Skype Customer Service.
<br />
<br />Make sure you have a strong Internet connection when you attempt to place the call. If you're on Wi-Fi, move to an area where the signal is stronger or connect to another network.
<br />
<br />You can also try uninstalling then reinstall Skype to see if it works.

<h2>            &#34;This copy of Windows must be activated before you can log on.&#34;</h2>
                    We have a Laptop with Windows XP that we have used for some time without problems.&nbsp; Suddenly we are getting a windows product activation box we never got before, requiring "This copy of Windows must be activated before you can log on."&nbsp; No new software
 has been installed recently, so this seems very odd.&nbsp; Is this a virus, or is it real?

            These steps will work as long as the PC only has one User Profile, and has Internet Explorer 8 installed.
<div><br />
<div>In my case, I:</div>
<div><br />
<div>(1) Followed the steps already listed here, with one adaptation: Safe mode: Command Prompt</div>
<div><span>" Boot into "Safe Mode".&nbsp; To do this, turn the laptop on and press F8 as it is booting up.&nbsp; Go into "Safe Mode" by choosing the "Safe Mode" option. *Safe Mode Command Prompt*<br />
Once you are at the desktop in "Safe Mode", Click "Start" then click "Run".<br />
At the run command prompt type the following EXACTLY<br />
<br />
rundll32.exe syssetup,SetupOobeBnk</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>(2) Restart the PC, and boot it back into Safe Mode Command Prompt.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>(3) On a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;PC, download
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=341c2ad5-8c3d-4347-8c03-08cdecd8852b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IE8 for WinXP</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;and put it on a thumb drive. I renamed the file
 to IE8install to make it easier later.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>(4) Plug the thumb drive into the&nbsp;problematic&nbsp;PC&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>(5) I</span><span>n command prompt install IE8. Your thumb drive's letter may be different. If e: doesn't work, try f: etc until you find the right
 one.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>type e: *enter*</span></div>
<div><span>ie8install.exe *enter*</span></div>
<div><span><span>(</span>6) Complete the install, restart the PC, and you should be good to go.&nbsp;</span></div>

*NOTE: The "Oo"'s in Oobe are "oh's" - not "zero's"&nbsp; There is one space after rundll32.exe.&nbsp; It is case sensitive as far as I know.<br />

Click OK<br />

Wait a few seconds - the screen may blip a few times or so.<br />

This just reset Windows Activation for 30 days.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 stuck at boot screen.</h2>
                    Alright so about 1 month ago I used an ISO to get windows 8, it's been fine until about 30 minutes ago when it started lagging, so I force shut it down, and started back up, it says stuck on the screen with the blue windows logo and a loading circle, the
 boot screen. So after it wouldn't start after about 10 minutes, I force shutdown again, and started backup then pressed F12, then it showed Automatic Repair, then THAT gets stuck at, "Diagnosing your PC". &nbsp;Please help.

http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/04/refresh-and-reset-your-pc.aspx</a></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Refresh</strong><br />
<strong>"The Refresh option reinstalls Windows, but keeps personalized settings and files</strong>. It does, however, reset PC settings to their defaults, but keeps apps downloaded from the Microsoft App Store and places a list of removed apps onto your desktop.
 A refresh does not require the Windows product key to be re-entered. Refresh is a good way to recover system performance, while keeping your data intact."</p>
<p><br />
"Only Metro style apps when customers refresh their PCs, and require desktop apps that do not come with the PC to be reinstalled manually. We do this for two reasons. First, in many cases there is a single desktop app that is causing the problems that lead
 to a need to perform this sort of maintenance, but identifying this root cause is not usually possible. And second, we do not want to inadvertently reinstall “bad” apps that were installed unintentionally or that hitched a ride on something good but left no
 trace of how they were installed.</p>
<p><br />
Refreshing your PC goes like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC boots into Windows RE.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE scans the hard drive for your data, settings, and apps, and puts them aside (on the same drive).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE installs a fresh copy of Windows.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE restores the data, settings, and apps it has set aside into the newly installed copy of Windows.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC restarts into the newly installed copy of Windows."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reset your PC to start over<br />
"Reset, reinstalls Windows and blows out everything, even allowing you to securely wipe your data, so you can donate or sell your machine. At the end of a Reset, you'll need to re-enter your Windows product key."</p>
<p><br />
"In some cases, you might just want to remove everything and start from scratch manually. But in other cases, you’re removing your data from a PC because you’re about to recycle or decommission it. For both of these situations, you can easily reset your Windows
 8 PC and put the software back into the same condition as it was when you started it for the very first time (such as when you purchased the PC).</p>
<p><br />
Resetting your Windows 8 PC goes like this:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC boots into the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE erases and formats the hard drive partitions on which Windows and personal data reside.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE installs a fresh copy of Windows.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC restarts into the newly installed copy of Windows."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failing the above solutions you can re-install Windows 8 and activate by phone.</p>

<p>It has been a few days since you posted this but here goes. You didn't place the last ender eye correctly. The final eye, in creative mode, must be placed from the center looking out at the ring. Likely you will be instantly spawned into the end. That's
 what happened to me the other day at least. I couldn't get it to work at first either, but then sorted out the whole directional thing from the wiki.</p>

<h2>            What is KB3020369&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just received this update along with another one that I was reading was to be included in the last "big update" that went out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other update I got today was explained in an article that I Binged to, but when I went to the page that had the KB3020369 I got a message that said, "DNS Failure".&nbsp; Wasn't sure about that so decided to ask here about the KB update. Thanks.

            <p>canadian tech,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd personally advise for you to install the update but only if you have the already installed a .NET framework, which are used on a variety of Microsoft's applications like Windows Server 2008 R2 for example. One thing is for sure though if you've read
 the information/help section pertaining to this particular update it is clear that the update "MS update #3020369 is an update to correct a previous update (#2819745) for failing to update on read-only domain controllers running Windows Server 2008 R2", (Microsoft.com,
 2015). It too, the previous update (#2819745), also deals with MS Server applications. If you have a MS Server application installed than it wolud not be able to update or install updates and you would need this update to continue normal operation/use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I have two .NET frameworks installed: version 4.0 and 4.5. Personally, I have experienced no outstanding issues. The optional update (#3020369) installed without delay at my promting it to do so.However, a reboot is required.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, and I cannot say with absolute certainty, but Windows update (#3020369) is consired to be an optional update because not every Microsoft Windows users has a server application installed on their machine. Therefore, if a user is prompted to download
 the update it is a harmless installation and may not even outrite install at all. It is more likely that the update (#3020369) would install, show in your list of updates, and could be removed at a later time. If you then chose install the update and then
 later installed a Microsoft Server application onto your pc you would not need to install the file as it has already been downloaded and installed. However, the update itself (#3020369) may need require updates, as needed.&nbsp;

    <title>How do I remove or clear custom keyboard shortcuts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#39;yongkalep  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove or clear custom keyboard shortcuts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love the feature of being able to create my own CTRL+ALT+(key) shortcuts and have used it heavily since learning of it way back in Windows 2000!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Early this week, system maintenance decided to delete all the shortcuts on my desktop since there were more than 4 of them pointing to folders/files on our server. &nbsp;It's a hassle but no big deal to recreate the shortcuts. &nbsp;However, the CTRL+ALT combos that
 I used to access some of those shortcuts no longer work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In particular, CTRL+ALT+N used to open a folder on the server that I use all the time. &nbsp;Of course the shortcut to that folder was lost in the automated clean-up. &nbsp;I created a new shortcut and set the hotkey combo to CTRL+ALT+N but it won't work. &nbsp;I used
 comma for now and removed the keyboard combo from the properties of the folder shortcut. &nbsp;So, to my knowledge, nothing uses this combination anymore except for a deleted shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press CTRL+ALT+N, the focus is removed from the active window but nothing else happens. &nbsp;So apparently, Windows remembers this but can't find the target??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I clear that one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be willing to clear them all if necessary and start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!!</p>

            <p>Thank you for that link. &nbsp;However, it looks very technical and complicated and not related to my question. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only talking about the built-in ability in Windows to create keyboard shortcuts to programs, files &amp; folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to remove the shortcut key, created in the shortcut properties dialog, after that shortcut no longer exists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it is confusing because there are two different uses of "shortcut" here and unfortunately, I can't think of any other way to talk about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. an icon (usually on one's desktop) that is a link to a program, file or folder that resides somewhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. a combination of keys on the keyboard which, when pressed, do something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my particular question, the second type of shortcut is used to open/activate the first type of shortcut mentioned in #1 above.</p>

            <p>Thank you again for your reply. &nbsp;However, my problem is that the icon was deleted. &nbsp;I cannot go into the properties and set the shortcut key to "None" because there is no icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However (and this is my problem), that particular key combination that I used for the icon which has been deleted no longer functions for anything. &nbsp;It is obvious that Windows still recognizes it because when it is pressed, the focus is removed from the
 active window. &nbsp;It seems that Windows is trying to find the original icon but cannot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to assign that same combination to a different icon and nothing happens (other than the removal of focus).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So, back to my original question: &nbsp;Is there any way to clear these shortcut keys AFTER the icon no longer exists?</strong></p>
<p><br />

</p><p>I guess I'm just not able to communicate clearly what my issues and needs are. &nbsp;I'm sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;<strong>*NOT*</strong> found any resolution to my primary issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My <strong>*</strong><strong>primary*</strong> issue is the non-functioning CTRL+ALT shortcut key.</p>
<p>My <strong>*primary*</strong> need is to remove the connection between CTRL+ALT+N and an icon that no longer exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has nothing to do with domain or no domain. &nbsp;It is purely Windows 7 on my local machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You yourself referred to the method by which a shortcut key is created, by right-clicking an icon and adding the desired key in the properties dialog box. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That has nothing to do with being on a domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to remove that shortcut key but the icon no longer exists so I cannot right-click it to modify its properties in this way. &nbsp;But it is apparently impossible to remove the connection between the shortcut key and the deleted icon. &nbsp;If it were possible,
 it would have nothing to do with being on a domain or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings on my computer are not controlled by any network administrator. &nbsp;We don't have a network administrator (in fact, I myself am the closest thing to one that we have). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I modified the settings myself using features in Windows 7. &nbsp;I assumed that was done could be undone somehow.</p>

            <p>Well, the solution was painfully simple. &nbsp;Easier than anyone even guessed??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the scoop (from: &nbsp;https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums &nbsp;-- thanks for the link Jayant!)</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1); margin-left: 30px"><em>The shortcut key combination is stored in the shortcut link (.LNK file) itself; once the&nbsp;link&nbsp;has been deleted the shortcut&nbsp;key&nbsp;should be gone.&nbsp; It's my (somewhat vague) understanding
 that explorer.exe (which maintains your desktop) scans your Start menu and desktop icons looking for shortcut keys, and thereafter keeps them in memory until you log off or change them (or until explorer forgets them, as occasionally happens to me).</em></p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1); margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1); margin-left: 30px"><em>Have you logged off and back on since you recreated and deleted your desktop shortcut?&nbsp; This will close and restart explorer.exe, which should reset shortcut keys to those that are actually
 defined in a shortcut link somewhere.</em></p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1); margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I would have *SWORN* that I had logged off/rebooted and still had the issue. &nbsp;But apparently I never had because that immediately fixed the issue and CTRL+ALT+N is now once again functioning as desired.</p>

<h2>            Spinning dots when using finger in Windows Sketchpad</h2>

</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Wondering if anyone has this problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a brand new surface pro - out of the box - no apps installed.</p>
<p>Also just got the brand new surface pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Whenever I click the surface pen button, which I programmed to bring up Windows 10 Sketchpad, it works wonderfully the first time.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;If I click the trash icon to delete the sketch, then the x to close Sketchpad, and then press the surface pen button... &nbsp;not so much.<br />
3. &nbsp;The second time it launches Sketchpad, it shows the windows spinning dots of doom.<br />
</p>
<p>And I can't figure out how to restart the process via task manager, so basically I can't use the sketchpad for more than one sketch.</p>
<p>Anyone else have this issue?</p>
<p>Thoughts on how to restart the sketchpad process? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: &nbsp;This is new Surface Pen specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I repeat the same steps above using my finger, and manually launching the app instead of using the pen - no problems at all. &nbsp;Problems only come up when the Pen is involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem too, but it doesn't appear to be associated with the Surface Pen. &nbsp;If I do it using my finger, I still get the spinning dots of doom.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really makes Windows Sketchpad useless when you really need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have all the latest updates installed.</p>

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are experiencing this issue with a specific application only, we suggest that you use the Feedback Hub to report it as suggested by Barb Bowman. If you are new to it, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select &nbsp;<strong>Add new feedback</strong> next to the search bar.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Tell us whether you’re sending a problem or suggestion.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>In the <strong>Summarize your issue</strong> box, provide a concise but clear title for your problem or suggestion.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>In the <strong>Give us more detail (optional)</strong> box, you can give us more specific information, like how you encountered the problem.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select a category that corresponds to your feedback. For example, if your printer stopped working, you’d select
<strong>Hardware, Devices, and Drivers</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select a subcategory—like <strong>Print</strong> for problems with printing.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>(Optional) Step through the problem while capturing the steps so we can see what happened.</span></span></span></span></span></span>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Recreate the problem (recommended)</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the type of problem you’re having, and select
<strong>Start capture</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Do the steps that led to the problem.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>When you’ve completed the steps, select <strong>Stop capture</strong>.</span></span></span></span>
<div>
<div>
<p>Notes</p>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>You can close Feedback Hub if you need to and the capture will continue.</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Even though capturing is optional, it’s a good way to help Microsoft determine the cause of the problem and address it for you and others having that problem.</span></span></span></span></span></li></ul>
</li></ol>
</li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>(Optional) Send a screenshot to help show the problem.</span></span></span></span></span></span>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Go to where the problem happened, press the
<strong>Windows logo key + Print screen</strong> to take a picture of your screen.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Attach a screenshot</strong>, go to the Pictures/Screenshots folder, select the screenshot you want to send, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ol>
</li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>When you’re satisfied with your feedback, select
<strong>Submit</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update from Win 8.1 stuck at &#126;30&#37;</h2>
                    I have been very unlucky with my three attempts to update to Win 10. My first try I got to 36% done overall and 6% done in installing properties and drivers. After that there was no progress made for an hour or so I booted my PC and tried it again. That
 time it got to 32% overall and 6% installation. I decided that I would give it more time, but after eight hours it had not made any progress whatsoever. After another hard boot I checked if I had enough space on my drive: 25 G (enough right?). Then I somehow
 troubleshot Windows Update and it deleted all the failed/old updates there. I then downloaded the update again and was confident that this time the update would work. But, as my luck would have it, I got no further than I did on my second try. Oh and my PC
 picked up some weird Windows file a few days back. I looked it up and apparently it was safe to delete so I did. Then, after I reinstalled the update, my PC notified about this same file again, but before I could react, some **** p

<p><span>To start the upgrade, insert the DVD or USB drive, or right-click and mount the ISO file in Windows 8.1/7. Then browse to the drive and start Setup.

<p><span>Once the upgrade is complete, please be aware that it may take some time for Windows 10 activation to complete. If you see that Windows 10 is not activated for a few days after the upgrade it is not a cause for concern.
