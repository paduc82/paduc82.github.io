<h2>            Memory Full N95 8GB - Help Please&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>My Nokia N95 8GB has started acting strange. I can not save a new contact, I can't recieve sms, I can't take photos or shoot videos, missed calls dont appear, the whole call log doesn't get saved, etc... I can't even change the profile so that i can put
 the phone on silent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I try to do one of these things a message like these would come up:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Notes: Not enough memmory to perform operation. Delete some data first.</p>
<p>-Memory full. Delete some data</p>
<p>-Not enough memory to receive message(s). Delete some data first.</p>
<p>-Carousel: not enough memory to perform operation. delete some data first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted virtualy everything that i could have and still nothing.</p>
<p>my memory summary states:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>134MB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in use</p>
<p>0b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free memory</p>
<p>2kb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calendar</p>
<p>43kb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contacts</p>
<p>0b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; messages</p>
<p>0b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; images</p>
<p>0b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound files</p>
<p>0b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; video clips</p>
<p>2kb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; documents</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes up the 134 MB that are used?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried backing up through the Nokia PC Suite but it too crashes saying there is not enough memory on the phone to perform the backup, please delete some data from your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how i can fix this please? Will i need to reset the phone memory and will i lose things such as Maps subscriptions, ngage games and high scores etc... if i do this? is there any other way to fix this?</p>

<p>Turn off the phone, remove the battery and SIM and leave them out for 5-10minutes. Then put everything back in, and turn on your phone. Most probably it'll work. If it doesn't, proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restore factory settings. Type *#7780#. This will take your N95-8GB to the original settings and you won't lose the data in the phone memory.</p>

<p><font>Thanks Depestblue.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>I tried the first thing and it didnt work.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>The second thing didnt help either. I still get those messages. Im not sure if it restored the phones settings. The phone restarts when i enter the code and as soon as it comes on the "memory full" message comes up and it appears that
 the settings haven't been restored. (my active standby is still the same, my ringtone is the same etc...).</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Is there anything else i can do? I Really appreciate the help.</font></p>

<p>That was unfortunate. Alright. So let's go on the offensive. First, backup your phone memory. I doubt if you can do it from your phone. Therefore connect it to your PC and take a backup. I think you tried doing this and PC Suite crashed. I would advise you
 to try it again. Because a hard-reset would erase your phone memory and you'll lose all your contacts and messages and mails. After you have the backup, try a hard reset - *#7370#</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you go for the kill, have a look at this thread:</p>
<p>/discussions/board/message?board.id=smartphones&amp;thread.id=120841</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have lifeblog installed in your phone, it can be the cause of this problem. So, try the steps mentioned out there. It MIGHT work. If it didn't, then your only option is a hard reset.</p>

<p><font>Thanks for your help deepestblue,</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><span><font>I could not back up the phone using the Pc suite. The “unable to create back up, memory full, delete some data first” message kept on coming up.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>I then tried backing up the device memory to the phones mass memory. Once the process seemed it was over the same message would come up only this time saying that the mass memory is full, even though I have 7.5GB
 free.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>I downloaded the Jbak Taskman and when I tried installing it the “not enough memory to complete operation, delete some data first” message would come up so I couldn’t install it.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>I tried downloading the program directly through the barcode scanning link&nbsp;but the phones’ browser would not open the link.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>I then did the hard reset, installed Jbak taskman and x-plore and terminated and deleted the lifeblog files. This didn’t help much. Now I have 8mb free on my phone memory and 125mb used.
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>What is taking up all the memory and how can I fix it?</font></span></p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>one of my friend was facing similar kind of issue, so i borrowed his phone (N95 8GB) and started my RnD. i founf that folder named private in the phone memory was eating up a lot Phone space (Approx 100Mb). i set my goal as to understand how to free up memory
 .. i found there were lot of games installed but that was in Memory drive and NOT phone memory. after uninstalling few of th games (including few n-gage games) the memory was freed up. mean while i also found folders are created during the process installation
 of softwares and game. After which i started looking for files that were received as MMS or either through bluetooth (Eg videos, music, etc..) even those files were residing in phone memory. i just saved all the attachements into my memory drive and deleted
 the msgs.. and guess what i managed to free up some more space in the phone memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information helps!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>NOTE:</strong></u> PLEASE BACKUP ALL THE GAME DATA, GAME KEYS, GAMES FILES BEFORE UNINSTALLING AND ALSO MAKE SURE BEFORE DELETING ANY MESSAGE. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS CAUSED.</p>

<p>Well well well... Crazyness, now the only option for you is to update your firmware. Use Nokia Software Updater and update/reinstall the firmware. If it doesn't solve your problem, you will be left with nothing else but to take it to a Nokia Care Point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to your query, I don't have any idea as to what could be taking up space on your phone memory. Because, the stats that you provided in your first post here says there isn't anything big stored in your phone memory. And a hard reset would wipe your phone
 memory clean.</p>

<p>MABUHAY!!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi guess!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the hard reset (*#7370#) is not working............</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the 3 finger reset!!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The procedure is, you have to turn off your phone, then, press and hold down the keypad *, keypad 3, and the Green Call button while turning on the your phone. Do not release them until you see signs of life in your N73. Your phone will be back to factory
 condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should work on other n series phones since i have this same problem with my N82....</p>
<p>***but*** YOU SHOULD BACK UP ALL YOUR DATA FIRST OK!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And lastly this idea is from "DEEPESTBLUE" he deserved all the credit not me...</p>
<p>and to "deepestblue" thank you man! you are briliant! cheers!!!!!!!</p>

<p>it sounds like the messages are using all of the internal memory even if this does not show.</p>
<p>go to messages - settings and choose mass memory to store your messages, it will then ask if you want to move all previous messages, select yes and you handset should be fixed (fingers crossed)</p>

<p>try option 3 with phone turned off read carefully. sounds like this might be your only option now that you have tried other things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
1. *#7780# - Restore factory settings - resets all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data)<br />
Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list. The default code for ALL operations listed here is 12345<br />
<br />
2. *#7370# - Reformat your phone (out of the box, tho keep in mind that most newer nokia phones at least n series, e series and s60 based phones have udp - user data preservation so not ALL data may be lost. still it is a good idea to always do a back up of
 your stuff.)<br />
<br />
3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with hard formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the default code is 12345)<br />
hard reset - hold the following buttons *, 3 (number button) and talk/green key. turn on the phone and do not release those buttons until you see the Nokia boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding
 all three buttons ( for Nokia 5800XM - use the following buttons to do a hard reset, GREEN/RED/CAMERA keys pressed all at once on power up. this will only work on 5800's that have firmware version 20... and up. )<br />
<br />
<p>If these codes are not working the only thing for you to do is contact your Nokia Care Center/Service for assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>i suffered this issue also.</p>
<p>i tried everything in this thread but the flashing envelope kept coming back.&nbsp; not sure if i missed any messages but it was anoying either way.</p>
<p>the fix for my N95 8gb, after i tried the various resets, upgrading the firmware, deleting everything, deleting sim messages etc etc was:-</p>
<p>I swapped SIM cards - my original sim into another phone and deleted all messages including sim messages in there and did the same with the other sim in the N95 8gb phone.</p>
<p>It worked for me so thought I'd share.</p>
<p>Thanks all for your input and help !</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming your data is given in cell A1 in this form 117:36 (so cell is formated as
<strong>[h]:mm</strong>). Then in cell B1 type this formula:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=A1*24*9</p>
<p>
</p><p>cell B1 is formated as General or as Currency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result should be 1058.4 Dollar for 117 hours and 36 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In formula 24 are day hours, 9 is wage per hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

                    <p>Exported my Notes and Contacts on Office 2011 for Mac to an OLM file. Made a big mistake by stopping the small import (its a small file) and when I try to import now it won't let me. Error message I get is: "Outlook did not import all your data. You stopped
 the import process before it was completed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched the web and found a few pay recovery services (around $100). Using the trial it shows me that my data is there and if you want to export it you have to pay. If it was a large file I would have no prob paying, but since its only 20 notes and 100+
 contacts or so I have to assume there is another way. I made 2 mistakes I won't make again: 1) don't stop an import and 2) make 2 or 3 exports incase you fail to listen to my first mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions to perform CPR on my little ole OLM file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>i had a onprem user account (we will call it test2). &nbsp;before it was migrated i tested accessed to owa and activesync any they both worked fine. &nbsp;i also have a archive amailbox tied t this account. &nbsp;i went through the migration process to move the mailbox
 from on-prem to office 365 and now when i try and go into the users mailbox in owa i get the following message.</p>
<p>i haven't tried activesync yet, because i would prefer to get owa working first.</p>

<p>what is the problem?</p>
<p>do i just need to wait longer for something to sync up? &nbsp;if so how long do i have to wait? &nbsp;how can i speed up this this sync process?</p>
<p>won't the assigned licensing happen automatically when the mailbox is migrated?</p>

<div>**********************************************************************************************</div>
<div>:-(</div>
<div>something went wrong</div>

<div>we couldn't find a mailbox for this recipient. either they don't have a mailbox or don't have a license assigned.</div>

<div>"Cannot Send Mail..The username or password for "Hotmail Account" is incorrect". I have tried deleting and reinstalling the the Hotmail account on her phone but to no avail. I took her iPhone to the Apple Store and diagnostics show that there are no hardware

    <title>Overtime Hours Spread on Non-Overtime Days - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael_project  say:</h3>
<h2>            Overtime Hours Spread on Non-Overtime Days</h2>
                    <p>If I have a base calendar that is set Monday - Friday, 8 hours a day, that will total 40 hours of ST/regular work</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I schedule a task that I know will take a resource 50 hours in a 5 day period (fixed duration) to complete, then there will be 10 hours of overtime. I add this 10 hours to the ovt. work column in the work view of the task details form. However, when you
 look at that the task usage sheet, overtime is spread evenly over each day Monday - Friday. Even if the resource worked 10 hours on Monday, this wouldn't be on overtime. Overtime kicks in on hours over 40. Why doesn't the task usage view just show the 10 hours
 worked on Friday as overtime?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if this resource worked 8 hours a day, Project evenly divides the overtime over all working days. If the resource starts a new week on a Monday and only works 8 hours, then there is no overtime on that Monday. But Project might show overtime hours on
 that Monday because all Project has done is taken the total overtime hours and divided them across the duration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to change this?</p>

            Unfortunately, there is no way to import the contacts and appointments that are stored in My Phone directly to Outlook on your computer.&nbsp; If you are not able to create a partnership between your phone and your computer, then post exactly what happens when
 you try to set up a partnership in this thread and we'll try to help you work out a successful syncing partnership so you can sync this data from your phone to your computer.

<p>Dear Prof Julie</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>What happens is that the windows mobile device center keeps ''syncing'' for an hour and a half and then i find that NO contacts have been copied to outlook. I am sure i have done everything right in regards to marking contacts and calendar to be syncronized
 but simply nothing happens after about 1.5 hours.</p>
<p>Is there anyway that my contact database is emailed to me from myphone?</p>
<p>THanks</p>

<p>That's a lot of contacts, but I don't think that's why you're having a problem syncing your phone to your computer.&nbsp; What you describes sounds like an issue with your computer's firewall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What windows mobile device do you have?&nbsp; Usually you can turn off the "Enhanced network functionality" (if you have a windows mobile 5.0 or more recent windows mobile device) and then you can sync.&nbsp; To turn off this option, go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connections
 &gt; USB to PC &gt; remove the checkmark in the box next to "Enhanced network functionaity" (or something like that).&nbsp; Then see if you are able to sync.</p>

    <title>OneDrive for Business on Windows 10 - Cannot delete a folder with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> invadervega  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive for Business on Windows 10 - Cannot delete a folder with characters that aren&#39;t allowed</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an unusual sync issue with OneDrive for Business that seems to have no end. I accidentally created a folder that had a space at the end of the name. When I tried to change it, either Windows or OneDrive would not allow me to. I tried to delete
 the folder multiple ways, and generally I get the same result: "Could not find this item" and a warning that the folder could not be found in the file location. When I go into Command Prompt and enter DIR for the subdirectory the folder is in, it shows as
 if it is there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After reviewing cases of those who have had this issue before, I have tried running Windows File Troubleshooter (it won't scan OneDrive), and I have also tried manually deleting the directory and its attributes through Command Prompt using this
<span>attrib -r -s -h -a . /s /d&nbsp;</span><span>Enter<span>&nbsp;and</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>rd 18497678131380 /s</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Enter&nbsp;</span>with
<span>attrib -r -s -h -a . /s /d&nbsp;</span><span>Enter<span>&nbsp;and</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>rd 18497678131380 /s</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Enter&nbsp;</span>with
 no luck. I have also manually deleted the folder off the OneDrive account on the website, so it isn't showing up there. I tried to remake it to see if that was the sync issue, but that just produced a second folder without the space at the end. I also cannot
 disable sync for any of my directories. Unfortunately, this is leaving my computer in a constant state of trying to sync this file which is draining resources. How can I delete this problem folder?</p>

<p>Okay, I finally found a fix for this. It wasn't quite as simple as deleting or renaming it as a normal computer file (that always caused the following error):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3176710-cf71-4c4a-8bdc-95a99879d76c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3176710-cf71-4c4a-8bdc-95a99879d76c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I took that fixed the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I unlinked the OneDrive for Work account in question so none of the files were trying to sync any longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Attempting to manually rename or delete the folders still resulted in the same error, so I opened Command Prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) First, in command prompt I typed cd and the name of the parent folder (not the one causing the issues but the one above it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) From there, I typed DIR /x to pull up the list of shortened DOS names for the files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Once I located the DOS name, I typed rmdir "DOSNAME" (replace DOSNAME with your file's shortened name from the directory". If it is a single file, you can also try del "DOSNAME" . Don't forget the quotes or this might not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) At that moment, the folder finally disappeared for good. I had to repeat the process for the parent folder which had also been corrupted, but it worked.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So far things are looking good for this fix, but we'll see if any further sync issues pop up. If they do, I will reply back here.</p>

<p>Hi Invader,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience on our forum.</p>
<p>First, I advise performing a <strong><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></span></strong> on your computer. Doing so
 your computer will start using a minimal set of drives that will help us identify if there are components that are hindering you from deleting the file. While in clean boot mode, try deleting the file and checking if the same issue will occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I suggest you try the following steps to check if you can delete it:</p>
<p>1. Right click the OneDrive icon.</p>
<p>2. Select Settings&gt;click Unlink the account.</p>
<p>3. Check if you can deleted the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. The screenshot of error message.</p>
<p>2. The screenshot of the file name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

<h3> nana_7273  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yahoo and Yahoo business mail to Outlook 2010 problems</h2>
                    <p>I've looked through some of the old posts and the answer may be there, but I couldn't find it.&nbsp; I moved my regular Yahoo email address and 2 Yahoo business emails over to Outlook 2010 using POP3. Then I read where I should have used IMAP so I could bring
 my folders over.&nbsp; Some how I ended up with 2 of the same Yahoo emails, one with a (1) at the end. Then I tried to delete all profiles and start over. I was able to delete the business email profile and one of the regular emails. Now, I have one regular email
 and one that says "Outlook Data file", but nothing in the folders.<br />
</p>
<p>When I go into Account Settings, there shows my regular Yahoo email that I can't delete because it's considered my "default."&nbsp; Under the Data File tab, it shows the "Outlook Data File" as a default and then my regular Yahoo email. It will not let me make
 the Yahoo email my default. It grays out when I click on it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, how can I wipe all of these out and start over????&nbsp; And even setting them up with IMAP, it seems it only moves my folders over. Is there any way to sync Yahoo and Outlook 2010? Say I read and delete an email through my Yahoo account, I'd
 like it to be deleted from my Outlook accounts and vice versa. Is this possible?</p>

</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that removing a POP3 or IMAP email account doesn’t delete the items that were sent and received by using the account. If you were using a POP3 account, you can still use the Outlook Data File (.pst) to work with your items.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To remove an email account from a different profile refer the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Exit Outlook.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In Control Panel, click or double-click <strong>Mail</strong>. (Open Control Panel in Windows, and then in the
<strong>Search</strong> box at the top of window, type <strong>Mail</strong>.)</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The title bar of the <strong>Mail Setup</strong> dialog box contains the name of the current profile. To select a different existing profile, click
<strong>Show Profiles</strong>, select the profile name, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>E-mail Accounts</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Site Newsfeed Not Displaying for Some Users</h2>
                    
<p>hello! i am really hoping someone will have some insight into this issue.</p>
<p>a user on our sp site told me she cannot see the newsfeed on a site and provided a link. i clicked the link and was confused because i see the newsfeed just fine, with even some of her comments on it. asked her to pull up the page on her computer and was
 confused yet again because the web part is not there.</p>

<p>below is the screen&nbsp;<strong>i see</strong>, she only sees the project discussions and no newsfeed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9ced33ed-79f7-47a3-a0b3-85fa7431747b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9ced33ed-79f7-47a3-a0b3-85fa7431747b" /></a></p>
<p>i have checked the web part maintenance page on both her and my computer, both display a "yes" for showing. i verified she is not in a personal view of the site. had her try multiple browsers to see if it was a browser issue. as far as i can tell there are
 no permissions that would cause her to not see the web part (especially since she has had the same permissions since she last used it and saw it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>since she seems to be the only person at this time that cannot see it, i am concerned something in her user settings was changed?? but she can see other newsfeeds! she did say, they have been randomly disappearing every now and then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>absolutely any insight into what could be causing this, possible fixes or things to try would be amazing!&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you in advance! any feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I did delete the user from all groups on SharePoint, including the AD which also removed her from Office 365. I waited until the "Check Permissions" showed as "None" (Not even given permissions through the "Style Resource Reader" group) and then added her
 back by recreating her O365 profile, SharePoint profile, and then adding her to the groups. Once I did this, she was able to see ALL the newsfeeds. NOW, all the tasks she was assigned still were assigned to "her" but it was her old profile so I had to go through
 and reassign all those tasks so they were assigned to her new profile. Not a fantastic or easy solution but IT WORKED!
</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for you feedback on this issue. I wish one of your suggestions worked because this solution was quite a pain but at least it solved the issue!

<h2>            How to stop Outlook for Mac 2016 emails from being downloaded to Trash &#38;&#47;or Junk  rather than Inbox&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook for Mac 2016 (Office 365), ver. 15.35. Since the last update, incoming emails are being sent directly to Trash and/or Junk rather than the Inbox. This is happening for all of my email accounts.&nbsp; These are IMAP accounts. I do not have any
 conflicting Rules that would cause this. When I drag the emails to the Inboxes, they almost immediately disappear from the Inboxes and reappear in the Trash folders. I am able, however, to click on "Move" and send the emails to Inboxes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I remedy this?</p>

<p>Hi Monique,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not checked all of my email accounts, but for the 2 I have checked, it looks like the most of the items in&nbsp; "Trash" on my servers is about the same as in my Outlook, despite senders being on my Safelist in Outlook as well as being specifically filtered
 on my server (AT&amp;T-Yahoo). However, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>some
</em></span>of the emails in my Trash on the server actually appeared in my Inbox!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 accounts with a "prodigy.net" address and one Apple "me.com" account. They are all imap accounts.</p>
<p>I am not running an anti-virus program or Web-Ex. I have been working on this issue, as well as some others, by running in Safe Mode, I cannot really tell a difference between operating in Safe Mode and operating in full mode, other than it's running perhaps
 a little faster in Safe Mode, without seeing the ever-present spinning "beachball" constantly. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Outlook 15.35.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create a new profile, do I create a new email account to test it or move one of my current accounts to the new profile? Hoe do I move one of my current accounts to the new profile?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Pat</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p>

            Hi VelvetSetter,<br />
<br />
After you create a new profile, set it as default, then configure one problematic IMAP account under the new profile. Do not remove or delete the existing accounts or profile. You don’t need to make any change to the existing profile.<br />
<br />
In case any data loss, please back up all the data of the accounts before taking any action.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Monique<br />

<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We're glad to help you! <br />
<br />
I understand that File Explorer is not opening in your new Lumia 550. Have you tried to perform a soft reset? If not please do so.
<br />
<br />
You can perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then, press and hold the
<strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</span></span><span><strong>Power</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts.
 Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing soft reset try to open File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if this helps. Thanks! </p>

                    <p>Dear All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the Office 365 2016 outlook users are getting the following error. Please find the attachment I captured this from the system.</p>
<p><em>“Outlook cannot log on. Verify you are connected to the network and are using the proper server and mailbox name. The Microsoft Exchange information service in your profile is missing required information. Modify your profile to ensure that you are using
 the correct Microsoft Exchange information service.”</em></p>
<p>Usually I delete the profile and recreate then it will work for another a week. But again it will come.
</p>
<p>Client is using window 7 64 bit edition all the windows updates are up to date.</p>
<p>Can anyone help on this issue. <span>&nbsp;</span>because of this reason some of the users I downgraded to Office 365 2013 edition,
<span>&nbsp;</span>this edition no issues it works perfectly.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>this edition no issues it works perfectly.</p>

            <p>You say the PC tech reinstalled win and Office Pro 2003, if they did not install using an oem office disk, your office key will not activate the version they installed.(nor will your disk overwrite that installation)</p>
<p>Uninstall any Office version, reboot the PC, then install from your oem disk.</p>
<p>You use phone activation but do not say/enter anything untill you get the option to speak to a real person, then explain you are reinstalling on the origonal PC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW When MS takes you cc details, if it transpires that its a valid installation issue you will not be charged. However an oem version is supported by the origonal PC supplier, not MS, so you probably would be charged.</p>

<h2>            Error message when signing in to use purchased Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I purchased and have used Office 365 since 2017. However, today when trying to create a new document there is a message that says to Activate Office to Create and Edit. When trying to activate it and after entering the correct account information, a message
 pops up saying that it is searching for licenses. After that the following message appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p>An unknown error has occurred. The error code is: 0x80004005</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Francisco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are multiple reasons why you're encountering the activation error. It is possible that there is an issue with the system files of Office or your computer is having an issue connecting to the activation server of Microsoft. We recommend that you run
 the <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">repair tool of Office</a></strong> to address the possible issue on the system files of Office.
 If you're using a third party antivirus software, we also suggest temporarily disabling it to see if you'll be able to sign in to one of the Office apps. Please take note that disabling your antivirus will make your computer vulnerable to threats. If you've
 found out that you can or cannot sign-in to one of the Office apps, kindly re-enable the antivirus program right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
