<h2>            Email marked as safe going to junk mail</h2>
                    We are running Office 365 for business.&nbsp; We have a user that receives email from a specific domain that continually ends up in his junk folder.&nbsp; He has marked email from that domain as not junk and added the domain to his safe senders list.&nbsp; The server
 continually marks it as spam when it is going to him.&nbsp; The outside client can send email to others within our organization and it does not go to their junk mail.&nbsp; Any thoughts/help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.

<div>Hi Jon,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for posting. However, Exchange Online or EOP will honor your users' Safe Senders and Recipients, but not Safe Domains. This is true regardless of whether the domain is added through the Outlook on the Web, or added in Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Only blocked domains, blocked sender addresses, and safe sender addresses are recognized. If you use a Microsoft Office 365 or Exchange Server account, all names and addresses in the global address list (GAL) are automatically considered safe. The Safe
 Sender limit is 1024.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Moreover, as an admin you can add domains or individual email addresses to an allow list by using the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) to configure spam filter policies to check this issue. For your reference:

    <title>O2 UK PAY MONTHLY SUBSCRIBERS READ THIS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            O2 UK PAY MONTHLY SUBSCRIBERS READ THIS</h2>
                    Today I received a text message from O2 which I quote<br />
<br />
"O2: from 28 Sept 2007 making calls starting with certain numbers e.g 0844 &amp; 0845 will cost 20p/min. Visit o2.co.uk/specialnumbers for details."<br />
<br />
0844 and 0845 numbers are currently billed at local/national rate which means if you have a pay monthly phone with inclusive free minutes then dialling these numbers will count as free minutes up until 28 Sept, after that O2 will charge 20p/min. If you make
 use of 0844 and 0845 numbers (banks, access numbers for cheap calls e.g <a href="http://www.phonecheap.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.phonecheap.co.uk</a>) then contact O2 Customer Services ASAP and say their recent change in their Terms &amp; Conditions regarding the 0844 and 0845 numbers is putting you at a significant disadvantage and you want to terminate the contract, depending on how
 much you use the "special numbers" you should be able to get out of your contract penalty free. I just got out of an 18 month contract that I've only been in for 3 or 4 months and I get to keep my N95 :)<br />
<br />
Hurry as you only have so long to lodge your complaint with O2

            The Customer Service person I spoke to did tell me that, however I was using access numbers on
<a href="http://www.phonecheap.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.phonecheap.co.uk</a> for cheap calls to Russia, 1p/min to landlines 2p/min to mobiles, unfortunately there was no cheaper or free number for this service, but yes I use the saynoto0870 website alot for
 other things :)

            Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
I noticed this:<br />
<br />
"The 20p/min rate applies on all Pay Monthly plans where customers have connected or upgraded from 27 April 2007 onwards. Calls to these numbers are not included in bundle minutes for these Pay Monthly plans."<br />
<br />
I upgraded and changed my tariff in May so I'm guessing that i've been on the 20p rate since then?<br />
<br />
Could I still get out of my 12 month contract?

            It sounds like it, I cant remember when I took out my contract but it was about then, what have you got to loose? just the price of a phone call to O2 I would say you have a good chance

            I gave it a go and O2 are going to listen to the call from when I changed my tariff and call me back.<br />
<br />
I said that no one had informed me of any changes in terms when I changed my tariff and upgraded my phone.<br />
<br />
Fingers crossed!

            Carphone Warehouse are not technically involved after they sold you the package.<br />
<br />
The contract is with O2, if you cancel the contract within the fixed period they may charge you a fee to buy yourself out of the contract or they may insist that you pay the full amount due for the number of months you were contracted to remain with them.<br />
<br />
The only way to get out a contract without facing charges is during the 14-day "cooling off" period following your signing of the contract, unless you can persuade the operator that you have special circumstances in which case they may show some good grace.

            It's also worth noting that 02 are still currently the only UK network that includes 0845/0870 numbers in any of its packages. These numbers are not included in the free minutes in all 02 contracts, but at least in some!

            Use the method described here to recover. I do this all the time for clients and it has never failed. Required 14.1.0. The article was originally written for a&nbsp;specific&nbsp;problem after rebuilding but has since proved to recover all types of&nbsp;database issues.
 It does require you to also have enough free space on your drive.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the frustration, when things don’t work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A site's certificate allows Internet Explorer to establish a secure connection with the site. Certificate errors occur when there's a problem with a certificate or a web server's use of the certificate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer helps keep your information more secure by warning about certificate errors.</p>
<p>Sometimes certificate errors also appear due to incorrect time settings on your computer, I suggest you to check the time on your computer if it is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like to know few information, so that I can assist you accordingly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Were there any significant software or hardware changes made prior to this issue?</li><li>Does this issue occur, when you try to access Outlook.com on different computer?</li><li>Which browser do you use, to access Outlook.com?</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Which operating system are you using, Is it Windows 7 or Windows 8?</span></li></ol>
<p>If you are using Internet Explorer, I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps below to change the security settings in Internet Explorer.</p>
<ol>

Internet Options</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Security tab</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Trusted sites</strong>, then click the <strong>Sites</strong> button.</span></li><li><span>On the "<strong>Add this website to the zone</strong>:" URL bar, type the complete
<strong>URL address</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Add button</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Once you already added all <strong>URL addresses</strong>, click the <strong>
Close</strong> button.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Apply </strong>or <strong>OK</strong> button then close your Internet Explorer browser.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue persist, follow method 2.</span></p>

    <title>inbox column size change on its own - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kev123irl  say:</h3>
<h2>            inbox column size change on its own</h2>
                    <p>Hi, My outlook has always stayed the same, the inbox column is wide enough to see most of the email title and the time. However, today when I loaded up my computer and outlook the inbox column was a lot narrower (only enough for one or 2 words of the email
 title to be seen - and no time stamp). I know this can b made bigger or smaller using the mouse by clicking on the column but I never did this. Could this have happened on its own?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried making the column a lot wider than it normally is, closed the computer, rebooted it with outlook and the inbox was wider than normal, just like I had left it...this would suggest that any changes made before outlook is closed will be kept after.
 However at no point yesterday before closing my computer did I make the inbox column smaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another day I logged on and the inbox was sorted by 'type' and not date like it normally is. At no point have I ever changed the way things were to be sorted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist thanks</p>
<p>

            What type of email account do you have configured in Outlook? Do other people have access to your computer? Outlook will occasionally reset the view to the default, but neither of those are default views.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, it is a work computer so on some days it is shared, however we all have our own login etc. Since I closed the computer yesterday until it was turned on today, no one else used it. Even if someone did log on, it would have been under their own profile
 and they would have outlook set up in their own way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has never happened before which is why this is weird, I definitely didnt change the width of the inbox column.Any ideas? thanks&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nothing working after losing two nights sleep&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi ALL,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a bad experience with adware and malware.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was successful in stopping the intrusion and cleaning up the disk but unfortunately not soon enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can no longer use restore on either Windows or HP.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot refresh or take my computer or
 software back to a clean restore state.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing is getting through.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried turning on the services manually after two days of straight work, but it will not allow a Windows update or a Windows Defender update.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot schedule any updates because it will not even open the programs...&nbsp;&nbsp; It
 will not update spyware or virus info.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried third party&nbsp;software, as well and they worked in cleaning, but not restoring or updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I no longer have access to my Word 2010 Starter program or any bundled software including the HP system software.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can only use those that I downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Google Chrome took a hit with a ghost/worm that is called GoogMod.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had over 1000 events that had to be cleaned and it probably took good software protocols with it .&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the events were ad-related.&nbsp; It deleted my Chrome and re-installed
 a fake Google.&nbsp;&nbsp; It then went nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in Internet Explorer and the threats came through Bing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a coupon toolbar I never installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it came from an email, but I can't tell because the event logs are distorted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My big problem is that HP bundles everything and you don't get a restore disk.&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought this computer a year and a half ago and I have never had a problem with it before.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no restore disks and HP doesn't offer one other than to check the hardware
 which I did download and it all tested 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp; The software and updates are the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; My Computer and Control Panel buttons are gone from the Start Screen in Windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; I updated from Win 7 and that too was done by a download from HP, which will not
 provide support.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent $1200.00 on this computer and should get more than a year and a half&nbsp;out of&nbsp;it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now it is a really expensive doorstop.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have read everything and tried most of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not computer ignorant...I am old but used to teach computers and
 was a MCSE, MOUS, Net+I and Microsoft Certified Trainer with Expert&nbsp;level certs&nbsp;15 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know a lot has changed, but I have tried so much already, I don't know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without disks and a way to use the services like back-up, restore, refresh...I
 am lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so upset and tired.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need help BAD!</p>

            <p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding so quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really appreciate it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed the malware actually and the damage to the software is the result of the removal tool I think.&nbsp;&nbsp; I quarantined the 1043 events and removed them, and going through them one at a time took forever.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that some of them took bytes from
 healthy programs and I have tried everything to try the repairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have uninstalled a lot and re-installed but the registry is probably corrupted badly.&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks as though I will have to wipe the hard drive after trying to save a lot of documents and work,
 if it will let me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't do scans or resets of any kind, they are all&nbsp;missing bytes,&nbsp;which is the effect of the Trojans, Worms,&nbsp;Malicious adware&nbsp;and Viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so upset.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been up 24 hours straight when I finally submitted to the community.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need everyone to be aware of the GoogMod.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp; It acts like an update to your Google, but it takes over the system and wipes out all priviledges to the administrator
 and creates an administrator only it can access.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was clicking to close the ads as fast as they were appearing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn't shut down as it took the permission away from me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was at WAR!&nbsp; I have had intrusions in the past that I could close by clicking
 the taskbar and "closing all" and then getting out, but I couldn't do that in Win 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was effecting everything at once and I am still opening things and finding data missing from the attack and removal.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have privileges back at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again Ian.&nbsp; The Malware is finally gone, but I am grateful for your help.</p>

            <p>The only way to shut one of these things down is to hit ctrl+alt+del which opens a menu that includes "Task Manager" then you select "Task Manager" and tell it to shut down your Internet Connection whatever browser you happen to be using...you mentioned
 Windows 8 so I assume you were in Internet Explorer 11. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In future make sure you have your Active X filter ON as well as your Smart Screen Filter...not to mention the "Enhanced Protection Mode on. These are all additional security measures available in Internet Explorer which supplement your antivirus program
 and antispyware programs and if more people would take advantage of these options we'd see far fewer cases of virus and malware infections.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we want to click the gear icon next to the smiley face on the Internet Explorer toolbar.</p>
<p>Then we select "Safety" and click on "Active X Filter" this will stop drive-by Trojans from using your active x tools to launch an attack against you.&nbsp; Now, if you CLICK on any suspicious files you are bypassing this protection and giving the Trojan permission
 to attack you. Even if you click that little x that is supposed to close it. What it does is open it.</p>
<p>Also for every pop up you try to close you open about a dozen more. NEVER try to "fight" automated programs it makes you feel like John Henry battling the steam steel driver. He won, but it killed him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>USE TASK MANAGER and shut Explorer down. Then scan for viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To enable enhanced protection open Internet Options (you get there via the gear icon again) click on the "advanced tab" after you open Options...then scroll down to security.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much!&nbsp;&nbsp; This was extremely helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was on a new Fios connection and it runs faster on Explorer than on Chrome.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to teach this stuff and had not had time to set up the security on Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the correct settings on Chrome.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I thought it would be the same but obviously not.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know what they say about assume?&nbsp; Anyway, I made the changes and it should prevent it from happening in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using Task Manager to shut down, but that is actually what I was fighting.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the help you provided I shouldn't have to do this again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept having to open TM and then end task the processes and threats coming in.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was at it for about three
 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; I lost access to the security scanning and still do not have access to Scans, Repairs, Restores, Refreshes, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I lost my Microsoft and Windows error checking and some programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The GoogMod, Bubbledock, WowAd and BoBrowser were the main culprits.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the worst I had ever had.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not on sites that leave these footprints but like you said, I was totally unprotected.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I had unistalled Chrome as a preventative and it stopped the intrusions since I had said yes to an offer to update my browser.&nbsp; It downloaded a fake Chrome and Google and man-o-man!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wish I could run a Windows update and scan now, but I lost it somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp; It tells me it cannot complete the action because I am not online, but I am.&nbsp;&nbsp; No idea now what it is doing now.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will not recognize any restore points or back-ups.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am
 totally confused.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can usually solve these problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am the person my family comes to for repairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am embarrassed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again.&nbsp;&nbsp; This solved the problem of it ever happening again.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I have to get a new computer, I will make these changes in the first minute online.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to teach this stuff but I assumed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw...I may have to change my user name now because of your help.</p>

            <p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't like that you cannot run a virus scan. It means that your antivirus program has been disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of ways of dealing with this (after the cussing part).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One is to go to Microsoft's own on-line "fix it" tool and attempt to download that.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of on-line scanners that Microsoft has that may be of use here as well as the tool just referenced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first is the Malicious Software Removal Tool (I suggest you run a FULL scan).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The second is the free Kaspersky Virus Scan&nbsp; <a href="http://usa.kaspersky.com/free-virus-scan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://usa.kaspersky.com/free-virus-scan</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are those who do not love Kaspersky but they are pretty good at this antivirus business and this scanner is quite efficient. A little TOO efficient, at times. You have to watch what they mark as "suspicious" and try to remove. Third party e-readers
 like Calibre are vulnerable (but can easily be reinstalled) and Kaspersky doesn't target essential Windows files the way some of the other Third Party antivirus and antimalware programs do. (The ones you will find highly recommended by people who repair computers
 for a living and who urge the average user to use these knowing they'll be back for more help which they can provide via "remote assistance" for a fee).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck!</p>

<p>Each rescue scanner will miss things – because none of them will have a perfectly complete and up-to-date set of definitions; so you might need to use several of these rescue scanners, or something like
 the Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility, which creates a custom bootable CD or flash drive that includes multiple rescue scanners:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sarducd.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.sarducd.it/</span></span></a><span> --
</span><span style="font-style: italic">be sure to
</span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline">decline all of the additional junk being offered when you install</span><span style="font-style: italic"> the download
 for SARDU. I tested this install some time back and the first offer was for the hated and difficult to remove Delta Search Toolbar. The developer noted that the latest version no longer has bundled installers, but be careful.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another boot CD (similar to Shardana) to consider is
</span><a href="http://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Hiren's Boot CD</span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>

            Tom: Thanks. I did that and it does what I want as long as I set the form to Popup. It seems like there should be a way to execute a query and have it come out on top. Maybe not??

<h2>            Microsoft Project Online - Control view&#47;edit access by Enterprise Project Type for Portfolio Managers</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a client requirement to separate access to projects for two Portfolio Managers in the same PWA instance. The way we want to do it is to control the access by Enterprise Project Type i.e.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Portfolio Manager 1 only has view/edit access to all projects created with Enterprise Project Type 1 (via Project Centre)</p>
<p>Portfolio Manager 2 only has view/edit access to all projects created with Enterprise Project Type 2 (via Project Centre)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the best way of going about this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue we have currently is that the 'My Organisation' category allows them to see all projects for all EPTs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Damian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I'm afraid we cannot give the different permissions to the corresponding EPTs. Since the permission level in PWA is based on users' permission level instead of Project Types.
<span>There is no the corresponding permission allowing to control the single EPT.
</span>Here is<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/project/sharepoint-permissions-mode-default-permissions-for-project-server-2013-sharepoi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> the article</a> indicating the permissions in Portfolio Managers for your reference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Given the situation,</span> we kindly suggest you deliver the idea in <a href="https://microsoftproject.uservoice.com/forums/914203-project-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Project Online UserVoice</a> which is the best platform for us to listen from you and others to involve more attention from the development team. Thank you for your understanding and feedback.</p>

            I suspect we might see another build before November since Threshold 2 is supposed to come out in November. Only internal Microsoft staff&nbsp;knows the exact schedule. It would be useless to&nbsp;speculate&nbsp;when the&nbsp;next build will be released.

            Keep checking your Insider Hub. &nbsp;Microsoft posts latest news about new builds there. &nbsp;Currently, the news is about a new build for Mobile that has been delayed because of discovery of blocking issues and the effort to get a new Insider Mobile build out.

At its most basic:<br />
• open your document<br />
• copy the code from the listing<br />
• switch to your document<br />
• press Alt-F11<br />
• paste the code into the large window<br />
• press F5<br />
• press Alt-F11 to switch back to your document<br />
• find the page that now shows the picture and do whatever you want with it.</p>

            If it's not something your printer adds, it'll be something in your document. If you can upload the document to one of the free file hosting sites and post a link here, we could take a look at it. (delete any sensitive info first - and confirm that the
 watermark/graphic still prints afterwards).

<p>Generally, if our Office 365 plan includes the SharePoint Online services, we do not need to pay extra to add a SharePoint site within the limits in SharePoint Online. For detailed information, you can refer to the following article.<br />

</p><p>Thanks for the reply, but that looks like a Feedback forum, not technical support, from which I infer this is indeed a problem. I guess it's back to Giant Goddess Google cackling at cauldrons of collocated cookies. Once you're signed in Google applies your
 search preferences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll 'feed it back' to Bing anyway, no sweat in that. Maybe too that where I am (Glasgow UK) a bing is 'a heap, especially of metallic ore or of waste from a mine'.

            Update - I noticed I had Edge set to delete cache and cookies each time it closes. When I change that Bing is OK with search settings. I believe a search engine needs a cookie to keep settings, so Bing, you're marvelous, except I notice you haven't implemented
 my order to change your name yet.

    <title>Bing is too BUSY - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bing is too BUSY</h2>
                    


I highly prefer a simple search page. Just input your query into a box and go. 


Is there any way to get rid of all of the **** going on around the rest of the search page.  


Maybe Bing has superior results but I won't use it because I hate the flashy swirlys going on all over the page. 


Can I turn it all off and have a plain search page with the same feature set as Google?

            <p>I believe that by its design nature, Bing is intended to be 'busy' and is targeted toward a demographic that desires that approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest thing I could suggest would be to start at a Bing results page with an innocuous search string. Something like,</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=%160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bing.com/search?q=%160</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you would want to start with your own search criteria with a date filter so you can keep abreast of something that is important to you.</p>

    <title>MS Access 2010 report in label format loses label alignment when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david betson  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2010 report in label format loses label alignment when exported using RTF format.</h2>
                    Using MS Access 2010 I created a report containing a label format (Avery L7160 - 21 &nbsp;per page). &nbsp;If I print the report directly using the Access report I have no problems, however when exported to MS Word via RTF format, the label content becomes displaced
 so that when printed the content does not line up within the label "boxes". &nbsp;In essence as one looks down the layout of the RTF page, the label content is shifted upwards so that it overlaps the label margins on the bottom half of the page. &nbsp;It used to work
 successfully for me but in the last couple of months this problem has occurred and now is the norm for all RTF export to MS Word.

            RTF exports have always been problematic. All graphics get lost and allignment suffers. I'm surprised that it worked in the past. You might try decompiling the database to see if that makes any difference.

            Is there a reason why you need to be able to open this in Word for editing?&nbsp; If not outputting the report as a PDF file is generally a far better means of retaining correct formatting.

            Hi Ken, Thanks for your swift response. &nbsp;I need to be able to extract reports in label format to email them to a remote location for printing. &nbsp;I have just had a look at the option of outputting in PDF format and it certainly is much more acceptable. &nbsp;The
 first two rows of labels are very close to the bottom of the label boxes but there is no print overlapping the label edges which is great. &nbsp;Looks like a good solution thanks. &nbsp;As for your demo file LabelPrinter.zip - I will have to await the availability of
 a techhy son of mine to have a go at that one! :-) &nbsp;Thanks again.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We need the following information below to provide the proper resolution for the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which operating system are you using, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10?</li><li>What is the model of your phone?</li></ol>
<p>We suggest to try performing a soft reset by pressing and holding the <strong>
volume down</strong> and <strong>Power </strong>buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts. Please
<strong>note </strong>that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also want to try turning on the Batter Saver. This will disable all your application to run in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you need more assistance.</p>

<p>Check for apps draining your battery, and disable those that do not need to run in the background,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try a softreset first (volume down + power button), this&nbsp;will not remove your personal data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A factory reset will remove all your personal data, installed apps, foto's, video's&nbsp;etc... in fact it will be as if you first started your phone. But now with Windows 10 Mobile. Your contacts are synchronized with your Microsoft account (see people.live.com).
 You can insert an sd-card and setup your phone to keep your photo's, videos, music on your sd-card.</p>
<p>The process will copy all those files to the sd-card. When you don't use an sd-card, connect your phone with your computer and copy all necessary files to the computer.</p>
<p>You can also make a backup of your phone, but in general, restoring from this backup, could bring some 'bad' settings back to your phone resulting in the same problems. Meaning you will have to re-install the apps you need.</p>

<p>I'm using Lumia 640 XL with windows 10 in it......</p>

<p>Hello, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9018ba6d-377a-48ca-8fed-47a138d3b42e" title="SaneeshNair">

<p>
</p><p>If you're referring to the <strong>Soft Reset</strong>, the answer is no. It <span>
is the same thing as pulling your battery</span>. This will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you might want to check some common battery saving tips that can help you improve your battery life:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Set a shorter duration before your screen times out.</span></p>

    <title>Office Enterprise 2007 problems after Windows 10 self-installed and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bikette&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Enterprise 2007 problems after Windows 10 self-installed and repeated updates</h2>
                    <p>1. Save Me!</p>
<p>Right in the busiest part of the tax season, overnight on a Sunday overnight last March 21st, Windows 10 installed itself overnight without my knowledge or permission. I've been trying to acclimate to the new OS ever since and can't seem to get my Excel
 and Word programs to work efficiently anymore. &nbsp;That is, the only way I can save the work I've been entering all day on any Word or Excel project is by using the Control + S feature. Trying to access the "Save As" menu and rename the newer project (even at
 the outset of the new project) invariably jams up the software and I must restart the program and my work from its saved version - which is invariably not at the same point as I originally wanted it to be saved.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have the Office system set up to save my files every 10 minutes automatically but I type just under 100 wpm so 10 minutes or even 5 minutes of data loss can be rather large and costly in terms of remembering what I typed in the first place (which
 is NEVER the same or as good the second time around). And it's consistent. It jams EVERY time I want to save my work with a specific filename and/or in a specific place. All I can do is Cntl + S and copy over the file I originally accessed to use for the new
 work. I'm not normally willing to forfeit the original file either, but something gotta give when I've spent all morning on a spreadsheet and the system freezes up when I try to save it to a new filename. &nbsp;I should be able to save my work via the Office Button
 and/or the "Save As" button on the task bar. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even before I touch the Word or Excel taskbars to save my work, I also copy and paste it all to a Notepad which I keep open on my desktop for these emergencies. But I lost much of my formatting in Notepad
 and it doesn't save spreadsheets well at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Update! Update! Update!</p>
<p>A couple months after Windows 10 installed, it then installed updates for Office. Then it wanted to install them again and again. &nbsp;I didn't realize it was the same updates each time so it was a few installations before I realized I had multiple copies of
 these updates on file. &nbsp;I then tried to delete some of the older updates but that too blew up and I lost part of the original updates as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I started back from 'scratch', loading Office 2000, then 2003 and finally my most recent version of 2007, but none of that did anything to help my freezing software pains. And something I adjusted in there now saves my Word document into something designated
 as Read Only, so that makes my saving data problem even worse when I can no longer alter the project once it has been 'frozen' and reloaded from the backup data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I need some sort of fix for this AND my Windows Live Email problems (from a separate query called "Windows Live hates attachments and embedded images" before the mountain of manilla files lands in my office over the next couple months!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, all.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>O2000 &amp; O2003 are not fully compatible with win10</p>
<p>There is no need to install all versions and 'upgrade' you should just have installed the 2007 version on its own.</p>
<p>Even if your office 2007 version was an upgrade version there is no requirement to install any earlier version first, you just need the earlier version cd to validate the install.</p>
<p>And as such its difficult to ascertain what problems you created by installing all versions</p>
<p>WLM is no longer supported</p>
<p>You could try the system file checker, sfc, then repairing office 2007</p>

            <p>Thanks Paulcouk</p>
<p>I realized I was installing the wrong Office version just AFTER I clicked the 'install' button. &nbsp;I hoped the Enterprise 2007 would replace the 03 but apparently the earlier version just caused more problems. Now, on top of the time it takes me to restart
 the software MANY times and reboot the system a couple times, Just to Save my work, it now takes another couple minutes of my wasted day to "Convert" each file I open in Word or Excel - adding more time to my futile endeavours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I resorted to moving a similar filename to another folder, and using the CNTL S feature to keep saving my work under the wrong name. When I finished, and printed out the documents, I then renamed it to the appropriate filename and moved it back
 to the folder where it belonged with its corrected name. Convoluted? Yep! But it's still a bit quicker than using an even older Win XP on my laptop to create worksheets and reports and hope those older versions will 'convert' properly when I save them on a
 stick and reload them on my desktop. &nbsp;My laptop hasn't got enough room to support the newer Office '07 or Win 10, or my tax software etc etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the system file checker today but the "Restore" feature didn't accomplish much the last time I tried that 'trick' before Christmas. It just keeps getting worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible/helpful if I uninstalled Win 10 and put back Win 7? &nbsp;Might that at least get me through the upcoming accounting year ends and busy tax 'season'?&nbsp;<br />
Thanks again</p>

    <title>Phone Storage Issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Phone Storage Issue</h2>
                    I do understand that the total capacity of my phone storage is 8GB and 2 something GB is for the system. Now I downloaded some apps that occupied the storage for about 4 something GB. I calculated the spaces in the said storage including the MB's and bytes
 and total is 5 something GB only. So it means that supposedly I still have a remaining space of 2 GB something. But it shows in my phone that the remaining space is only 300 something MB. What happened? Did I missed something?

<p>Did you calculate the storage occupation from sizes given in the marketplace? The size mentioned in the marketpace is the size of the download, which basicly includes packed installiation files.</p>

<p>Dear,&nbsp;</p>
<p>No it didn't solve my problem.&nbsp; In fact&nbsp;it seems all these steps need to have direct connection. either VGA or HDMI.</p>
