            <p>Hi Sandra,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back and for the information you have provided. Let us try to isolate if the issue was caused by the usage of an outdated Photo Gallery. Kindly check if you meet the requirements to install the latest version of Photo Gallery through

<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a>. In case your system did not met the requirements,&nbsp;I would suggest that you repair Photo Gallery by following these:</p>

R</span>, type <span style="font-weight: bold">AppWiz.cpl</span>, click <span style="font-weight: bold">
OK</span></font>.</p>
<p>2. Select <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Essentials 2012/Windows Live Essentials</span>, click

            This looks like a&nbsp;bug in Windows Live Photo Gallery 2011. I got it on two machines when I try to stitch a couple of specific pictures together. Upgrading to Windows Live Essentials 2012 solved the problem

            <p>Not just a bug in WLPG 2011, but also the version i'm using: 16.4.3522.0110 (2012) - the latest version as of a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to happen mostly with large photos (like composits) that undergo some sort of adjustment (e.g., fine tune, crop, auto adjust). what's REALLY annoying, is it gives you the error, and rather than returning to the adjusted image so you can try again
 or export or whatever, it just aborts all the changes and returns to the library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i find helps is to close and restart WPG and redo the changes fresh. Therefore i think it could be a RAM or other type of memory problem. Seems to still be a bug, however, since my system is a Windows 8.0 64-bit with 8Gb RAM - one would not expect memory
 issues on composite image processing (the images i'm talking about would be &lt; 20 Mb as a JPEG).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that said, WPG is still my favourite and go-to program for image managment and editing (paired with the Image composite editor ICE plugin - which also works standalone). i've recently switched to WPG from Picasa, which i was using for years, but i find
 WPG much more user friendly and still does most things i need (some retouching/editing i still use GIMP).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<p>No all the app and command line entries show me&nbsp;the current&nbsp;IP address. Useful but not what I want.</p>

</p><p>I wonder if the computer stores the IP address of a router or machine I connected to recently but am not connected to now? Is it stored Ina file somewhere?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check the following registry key to get required information:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Network\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\&lt;ID for Adapter&gt;\Connection</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Name value in these keys provides the friendly name for a network connection that is used in the "Network Connections" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.
 For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br />

            Hi, codeniner
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair later.
<br />
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<br />
<br />
<br />If this was caused by October Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 upgrade- Mail, Calendar not synchronising</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have upgraded to Windows 8.1 yesterday and gone through all the installation steps successfully. Windows 8.1 started 100%.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Mail, Calendar: When I opened Mail and Calendar for the first time, I logged on successfully and all the content there was synchronised. However, shortly after I realised that it does not show any new emails arriving. I have been using WLM 2012 (as a backup
 for situations like this) and can receive and see emails there, as well as manage the calendar.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Mail, Calendar whenever I try to synchronise after launching the respective app, I get the message: "*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is unavailable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am very stunned about this, as all my other app are working well. Best of all Gmail is working perfectly, while Microsoft's own apps doing the same job are not synchronising with my outlook.com account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tom</div>

            I'm having this same issue after just updating from 8 Pro to 8.1 Pro. I'm using a desktop PC by the way. All other tiles seem to work the way they did before but the Mail tile no longer shows unread email and the Calender tile no longer displays the time
 or date.<br />
<br />
I've done both methods as suggested and it continues to stay the same. I can click on them and they work properly. I noticed they are no longer a live tile like the others are. I'm assuming it's an issue on the app's side as I have uninstalled, restarted and
 installed the app numerous times.<br />
<br />
I just find it odd that the Mail, Calender and People apps are in the same bundle but only the Mail and Calender seem to have a problem.<br />

Weirdly, uninstalling and reinstalling fixed the Calendar tile but Mail&nbsp; doesn't give any updates. :-(
<br />
(People tile wasn't, and still isn't, a problem)<br />
<br />
8.1 update works fine for all 3; Mail, Calendar and People, on Surface Pro but has been flaky on Surface RT.<br />

            The one I am currently using on 2 different Windows 8 systems is AVerTV Combo PCI-E M780. They are no longer manufacturing it, but you can buy it used. I would guess other AVerMedia cards would work as well.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 can&#39;t activate. Try again later&#63;</h2>
                    I have recently updated to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8 Pro with Media Center, it kept bugging me until 1 am last night. Today, I noticed that I could connect to all but my home wireless network, so I fixed it with a driver update. Once I finally got it
 to connect to the Internet, Windows notified me that it isn't activated. I've tried to activate Windows for umpteen times since 7 hours ago and I've restarted it thrice. The error code is: 0xC004FC03. A networking problem has occurred while activating your
 copy of Windows. I've tried to enter a new product key, I've tried my store-bought Windows 8 Pro key, which "doesn't work for this edition of Windows", I've also scoured my inbox to find my genuine Windows Media Center key, and it says "this key doesn't work".
 I've typed up slmgr /dlv on Command Prompt to see what the status of my license is, and here's what it came up with:
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05c73e6e-3c6a-489a-b7c1-ccc0aec5e057" /><br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It says that my license is "non-genuine" even though it's been activated once before. I can reach &lt;?&gt;-v2.sls.microsoft.com on Chrome, so I don't know why my local machine can't. I have a theory that I could activate my computer if I downgrade back to Pro
 somehow, any suggestions on how I could do that would be appreciated. The&nbsp;last thing I want to do is to activate via phone, as my Internet and firewall are currently working properly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>UPDATE: I have bigger problems right now. Please see <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-system/winloadexe-is-missing-again/feeca241-e546-45b5-9fb4-7121d2d43814?tm=1382171217270">

            Windows 8.1 will never activate on wireless network.<br />
This is a part of the plan to get your information.<br />
When you connected to wireless network, you can be anywhere, but they want to know your network provider as well as all personal information associated with it, so you must be connected to LAN with a cable.<br />
This is a privacy violation, thats all it is.<br />

<p>So I tried the key but to no avail.</p>
<p>No idea what to do next but certainly dont want another month of busted laptop -- already lost loads of files.</p>
<p>When I enter the key it says "Windows cant activate. Try again later" ... when is later??</p>
<p>I have tried disabling firewall and also hardwired to my router...</p>

            <p>Well I have tried everything so far and still not activated.</p>
<p>I had a curious chat with microsoft person who said that the key i have should not have been used to create a windows 8.1 pro iso file when i had to completely reinstall after a winload.efi error and lots of data loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my situation is that i am currently using the laptop but with un-activated version and cannot seem to get any advice as to how to sort this out. Apart from anything else i cannot personalise the laptop and i daresay there will be other aspects of functionality
 that i will not be able to do --- so if you can help then please let me know what i can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way when this first happened i was advised to purchase a new set of recovery disks but now that i have windows running again the disks appear to not be aligned to my system and thats fifty pounds worth of plastic worth nothing.&nbsp;</p>

            I am having the same issue. I just tried this and your steps worked perfectly and brought up the Windows Activation dialog but my activation key is not working still. I just talked to Dell and they are sending a new activation key so maybe that will help.

<p>I did a few races in career mode. Then after a race started I hit the menu button. Then select quit race. You can't quit the first race for some reason. This takes you back to the career mode menu. Then hit B to go back to the main menu that you couldn't
 get to in the first place. &nbsp;Pretty messed up way to get there huh? Anyway, from there I was able to find the multiplayer split screen setup. Problem was that my son and I could not get it to start up in split screen &nbsp;even though we had two controllers connected.
 Make sure each controller is on a different account. If you accidentally select both controllers on the same account &nbsp;then the game won't let you select a car for each player, only one. Again, we were able to select cars for each player, but couldn't get the
 game to proceed past that. At some point it reverted us back to the start screen and made us play the intro race with the Mclaren AGAIN. We gave up at that point since it was late. Hope this helps somewhat.</p>

<h2>            Upgrade Windows 7 from the RC Build 7100</h2>
                    We installed the Windows 7 RC Build 7100 a while back.&nbsp; We are preparing for the February 15th notifications that will begin.&nbsp; My question is we had XP Pro on the machine prior to W7.&nbsp; we have COA's,key's and DVD's for XP Pro OS.&nbsp; Will I need to install
 XP, then install the fresh 7 upgrade copy?&nbsp; Or can we just buy the 7 upgrade and supply proof to the installer that we own XP?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<blockquote>Will I need to install XP, then install the fresh 7 upgrade copy?&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote>
Yes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Upgrade from Windows 7 Release Candidate to Final Version</strong> <br />
<br />
Sorry, Microsoft does not support an upgrade from Windows 7 RC to the final version. Have XP or Vista installed first, then move to Windows 7 with an Upgrade disk. Or you can buy the Full version if you don't meet the upgrade requirements and do a clean install
 on your computer.<br />
<br />
From Microsoft:<br />
<br />
In order to install the upgrade version of Windows 7, you must have a qualifying Windows operating system installed and activated.&nbsp; You cannot install an upgrade version of Windows 7 on a blank hard drive.&nbsp; The installation procedure does not ask you to insert
 a Windows disc in the drive for verification, the actual qualifying operating system must be installed.<br />
If you do not have a qualifying Windows operating system installed with a genuine license activated, then you cannot use the upgrade version of Windows 7 - you would need a "full version" Windows 7 license.<br />
<br />
In summary:<br />
<br />
1. A qualifying Windows operating system must be installed.<br />
2. The qualifying Windows operating system must have a genuine license (product key) and it must be activated.<br />
3. To upgrade, boot to the qualifying Windows desktop, insert the Windows 7 Upgrade disc in the DVD drive.<br />
4. When the setup menu appears, select Custom (advanced) to initiate a clean install procedure, or Upgrade if you are upgrading.<br />
<br />
From Microsoft Regarding the Release Candidate:<br />
<br />
Please note: All users of the Windows 7 Release Candidate (including Windows Vista users who have upgraded to the Release Candidate) must do a clean installation of Windows 7 RTM. Please keep this is mind as you consider downloading the Release Candidate as
 opposed to waiting for the general availability release.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help in reaching this important milestone. We hope that you will join us in testing the RC and finishing Windows 7!<br />
<br />

            Учетная запись моя, подключала её я сама. Так как ранее это была учетная запись скайпа,она автоматически стала учёткой Микромягких. Учётка запросила дополнительный адрес электронной почты. И после этого при включении ноутбука идет попытка подключения в

<br />у параметра AutоАdminLоgоn установите значение 0 (это отключение автоввода логина и пароля при входе)
<br />И у DefaultUserName установите имя текущего пользователя(с которым нет проблем), а у  DefaultPassword (если есть такая строчка) пароль текущего пользователя.
<br />Или можете пока их не указывать, главное AutоАdminLоgоn  в 0 установить)

            Если к Вашей учетой записи будет подключен аккаунт Майкрософт, то Вы будете вводить в любом случае пароль.
<br />Посмотрите вот эту тему <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/forum/windows_10-security/%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5/889f4943-ef5b-4b09-a242-10f743154e33?msgId=abf7aafd-9a9f-479e-ac16-bbd4abb10a36&amp;page=2&amp;auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/for...</a>. Вообще, лучше не использовать отключение пароля таким способом.

<p>Hello verncan,</p>
<p>Since you are getting the error Windows has detected a problem with the Winsock Provider Catalog on your computer, follow the directions below to reset the Winsock.<br />
Click "Start" and type "CMD" in the search box. Press the "Ctrl," "Shift" and "Enter" keys simultaneously. This action opens a Windows Command Prompt with administrative privileges.<br />
Click "Yes" on the permission dialog screen and the Windows Command Prompt opens. You should also see "Administrator" at the top of the window.<br />
Type "netsh winsock reset" next to "C:\Windows\System32" and press the "Enter" key.<br />
Restart your computer after you see the message "Successfully reset the Winsock Catalog."</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            Regarding playing Multiplayer..&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So on multiplayer on GoW 2 it's pretty dead by now.And GoW 3 beta is over.So i'm gonna try and do some unity over here so we can enjoy some gears of war 2 ( For those who're die-hard fans,like me)</p>
<p>So i've made this post for playing GoW 2 multiplayer with good,fun and people with a decent connection.What you simply have to do is just right down your name or add me as a friend,I've got many friends right now that i usually have 3 or 4 players who're
 online and ready to play Gears of war 2.So what i'm basically trying to do is to do a good community so we could play with each other.We will link the GoW 2 players to each other etc.For horde,Multiplayer and co-op :D.</p>

...warum wartest Du es nicht einfach mal ab?<br />
<br />
Normalerweile werden Spielmodus, Karten, etc. immer wieder gewechselt damit für jeden was dabei ist und kein Frust aufkommt.<br />
Ausserdem müssen wir uns auch danach richten, wer welche Karten hat etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Wieso meinst Du denn, dass Rush der beste Modus sein soll? - Eroberung bietet ebenso für alle was, selbst für Picknicker

<p>I have 2 friends that use their X1 in hotels, one of them enables internet connection sharing on his laptop, my other friend signs in the WiFi on his phone, then changes the MAC address of his X1 to his phones MAC address and gets online. I personally haven't
 taken my X1 and have not tried.</p>

<p>One thing you may want to be careful of... keep an eye on your data usage. The X1 uses a lot, especially certain games (like Destiny fe). It can eat up data fast.</p>

<p>Yes, when your phone (any device actually) connects to the hotel wifi, it identifies that device by the MAC address and assigns an IP address, so when you connect your phone to the WiFi and is granted internet access, you change the MAC address of your Xbox
 to your phones MAC address and disconnect your phone from the WiFi, and then the hotel WiFi can't tell the difference between your phone and the Xbox, all it knows is that this MAC address gets this IP address and is granted access to the internet.</p>
<p>But make sure that you disables your phone WiFi, or it will cause a conflict having the same MAC address showing up on the network. Also, you will most likely have to do these steps every time you connect because after a short period of time of not being
 connected, the system will forget the MAC address and IP assignment and will make you sign in again.</p>

<h3> joep30  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to fix programs that are constantly &#34;not responding&#34;</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Windows Vista to Windows 7-64 home premium.&nbsp; Since the upgrade I have had a lot of issues with programs hanging and getting "not responding" message.&nbsp; Everything from World of Warcraft to Firefox to Windows menu options has froze.&nbsp;
 Sometimes I can go 30 minutes to an hour without any freezing, sometimes it happens every couple of minutes.&nbsp; I have updated all drivers.&nbsp; I'm not the most computer savvy person, but is there anything I can do to fix this?<br />
<br />
System specs:<br />
<br />
Intel I7-950 3.06 Ghz 8m lga 1366<br />
Gigabyte x58 GA-EX58-UD4P <br />
12 gb kinston hyper x ddr3/1600mhz<br />
Nvidia GEforce GTX 295<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help<br />

            Having the same problem with a Gigabyte GA-P55-UD3R. Don't actually get any pauses in World of Warcraft, but that's stored on a different HDD. Get "not responding" pauses in Firefox/Operating System, usually with my HDD activity light on. Obviously, this
 is a new PC that I bought for Windows 7. Have switched from the P55 Express SATA controller to the Gigabyte SATA controller. No change. Have changed cables. No change. Have uninstalled AVG, still running Microsoft Security Essentials. Some improvement, though
 still "not responding" every now and then - could move my mouse, but clicking on start menu doesn't happen and alt+ctrl+delete doesn't work, not until the "not responding" thing is over.

            Transposed this HDD into my old PC, and am glad to say that it's still freezing (Not Responding) which leaves the problem either to software or the HDD itself.

            Used Paragon's Backup &amp; Recovery software (it's free - linked @ http://www.paragon-software.com/home/db-express/index.html) to make a back up image of my HDD with Windows 7 on, and then copied it to my old old HDD (SATA1, 120Gb) which worked mostly okay.
 So now Windows 7 is on a different HDD and...... no problems actually.

            I used to have exactly the same problem. i tried lots of different ways to fix it like reinstalling windows.But then on my task bar i saw that i had 2 security programs running my chosen one Mcafee and norton which i didnt remeber installing so i uninstalled
 norton and finally that solved my roblem. To see is you have to security programs go to your controll panel and go on uninstall programs and uninstall the unwanted security program. I hope this helps it definately helped me.

                    I'm trying to determine which Skype number and package to purchase. I want a local US number that I would forward to my UK based cell phone. From everything I have read, I would purchase a unlimited US based Skype number and forward to my UK cell. Would
 this be correct ? I'm trying to insure I purchase the correct plan so that family in the states can communicate with me and not incur international charges on their phone plans.

            Hi there!<br /><br />You have to buy a US number and a UK subscription because you want the others call you to an US number but you would be forwarding to the UK. <br />Then when you receive a call to your US number you have to pay for the call to the UK (your cell phone)

        </p>

            <p>I've received that same error exactly after plugging in the a6200 Netgear usb AC Wi-Fi adapter.</p>
<p>Searched my C drive for that file and its not on my drive... it appears to have something to do with Bluetooth which that adapter apparently doesn't have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because there is no file, to fix the error I opened a <strong>command prompt admin</strong>, and disabled the service;</p>
<p><strong>sc config BCM42RLY start=disabled</strong></p>
