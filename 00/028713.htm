<h2>            Quickest education on managing Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I am searching for the quickest, most complete method of learning how to manage Office 365. I am starting from Ground Zero with Office 365 for a NP. I have tired searching the Knowledge Base - and - watched a couple of "video" that are really high level.
 I am looking for a step-by-step process...so I feel just a little smarter than a "post"...might what I am looking for be found in a book? If anyone can make a recommendation...it would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive - no more icon&#47;cloud symbol in taskbar, no more syncing of files and folders</h2>
                    <p>I subscribe to Office 365 personal/OneDrive (1 TB storage), for which I am paying $9/month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OneDrive on my PC no longer syncs with the cloud (under the "Status" header - there is no symbol besides my folders and files indicating their sync status).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OneDrive icon/cloud symbol on my taskbar has disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking "OneDrive" in the start menu, I receive a message <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">
"Missing Shortcut"</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 21, 112, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">, "Windows is searching for OneDrive.exe. To locate the file, click Browse".</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reinstall OneDrive: </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - First from the Microsoft store - but that OneDrive app only shows me my files and folders in the cloud; no restoration of the OneDrive cloud icon on my taskbar; no syncing of files</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Then I tried to download and install OneDrive from the web&nbsp;(&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-ca/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-ca/download/</a> ) - I get a message a newer version
 of OneDrive is installed; I need to uninstall the newer version first.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I tried to uninstall OneDrive from the control panel ("Uninstall or change the program") - nothing happens!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft tech support - they told me I don't have the right to phone support for OneDrive because OneDrive is
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">"free"</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">,</span> as part of my purchase of Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have Windows 10, April 2018 update. What happened to my OneDrive?</span></p>
<p>Why is my OneDrive suddenly not working? Why do I no longer have the cloud icon on my taskbar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>After every Preview build, the next thing downloaded by iTunes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pepperdotnet  say:</h3>
<h2>            After every Preview build, the next thing downloaded by iTunes triggers an email from Apple.</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure exactly how to report this in feedback so I'll try to describe it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ITunes, latest version, x64 installed on my Windows 10 Pro x64 machine. After doing an install of the latest Windows build, the&nbsp;very next time iTunes downloads a new or updated app, song or other content, I get an email from Apple (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)
 with subject <em>Your recent download with your Apple ID</em> that looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Dear [my name],</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Your Apple ID, [my email address], was just used to download [name of item downloaded] from the App Store on a computer or device that had not previously been associated with that Apple ID. You may also
 be receiving this email if you reset your password since your last purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">If you initiated this download, you can disregard this email. It was only sent to alert you in case you did not initiate the download yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">If you did not initiate this download, we recommend that you go to
<a href="http://iforgot.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">iforgot.apple.com</a> to change your password, then see
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Apple ID: Security and your Apple ID</a> for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Regards,</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Apple</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, something is happening during the build-to-build upgrade process that makes iTunes think it's a new computer. It's been happening ever since I joined that machine to the Preview, after every build so far.</p>

<p>Let me clarify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a week or so, I launch iTunes and check what's free in music and apps, and download it if it's something I might be interested in. I also let it download any app updates that might be available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I do this after installing a new Windows 10 build, I get the email from Apple, and yes, it is actually from Apple, specifies one of the things that was downloaded and has my correct information.</p>

<p>That's pretty much what I was expecting, though perhaps Microsoft can clean up the migration process so that this doesn't happen, if they are aware of it.</p>

<p>Has anyone encountered issues with licensed software and the vendor getting nervous because</p>
<p>their expensive package is being installed multiple times.<br />
I can suffer that in the preview context but wonder how updates to Win10 will arrive to customers after the big release.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Apple, iTunes allows five machines to be allowed access to the DRM part of the&nbsp;library</p>
<p>and a running machine can deauthorize itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an update breaks Apple authentication then</p>
<p>the deauthorize would not be done and in no time the five slots would fill.&nbsp; For a family with 2.5 kids</p>
<p>one update could lock out all users and trigger the twice a year only recovery path.</p>

<h2>            Excel Filtered Pivot Table Sum is Wrong</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first time on this forum so please bare with me. I am having trouble with summing filtered data in my excel 2013 workbook. &nbsp;I have tried formatting the numbers in different ways but nothing seems to work. Any ideas of what is causing this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshot below is of a pivot table I created; everything else matches up perfectly except the sum.</p>

<p>Hello Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A PivotTable doesn't actually change the spreadsheet or database itself. The Sum function is used by default for numeric value. For basic Sum values in a PivotTable you may check this

            <p>Yes, it was only the MSN site.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that the homepage url was msn.com ... normally it says dell.msn.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I accidently clicked compatibility mode and it changed the home page to dell.msn.com and the page now shows current news of the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be fixed having put it into compatibility mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure how this happened and why it fixed it but I'm back current.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>I understand that you want to use your wifi enabled smartphone, connect it to your PC so the latter can access the internet, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an application on your device called Internet Sharing that lets you use your smartphone as a modem for your computer. But that requires that have a data plan. It does not work with Wifi.</p>

    <title>Using a macro to set filename based on a paragraph style - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marybellamy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using a macro to set filename based on a paragraph style</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a large mail merge which generates letters. I have come up with a macro that splits the final document into individual files, but I'm having difficulty naming the individual files when I save them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set the Mail Merge so that I can auto-generate the desired file name as the very first line of each letter. Using styles, I can make this line hidden or white, thus not visible. But I can't figure out how to add to the macro so that the filename is
 created using the text in this paragraph style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the format of the name appears like "<span>76K-30074706", I can't just let Word do the Save As for me, because it creates 76K1, 76K2, 76K3, etc. (It doesn't pull the full text from that first
 line, just up to the hyphen or underscore).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is there a way to set the filename using a paragraph style when saving?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the record, this is the macro I am currently using. Everything about it seems great except for the file name.</span></p>

<h2>            How to resolve a &#34;read-only&#34; message for file located in OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just after today's update 03/07/2018, my access to my OneDrive accounts changed, I have loads of documents that are now "read-only". &nbsp;They can be all types, Word, Excel, etc. &nbsp;I thought it may be that I needed to change the account under which the Office
 for Mac Word was open to the same account, but that didn't work. &nbsp;I also reset all of my OneDrive folders on the Mac (tedious, but done) and that didn't help either. This issue happens when opened in Office for Mac (Word) via Office 365 account after update
 of Office apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it would seem that this seems very old bug for MS is back and perhaps causing this issue.</p>

<p>My Facebook for E71/E72&nbsp;crashed/broke today. I can't redownload. Actually, I can't redownload anything from Ovi that I've previously downloaded - even if the application is broken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this because Facebook for E71/E72 is exclusively for E71/E72. Or some other problem?</p>

<p>Figured this one out. Here's the solution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>Facebook for E71/E72 died on my E90 - Ovi too.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>This cool application died yesterday on my E90. I couldn't download it again from Ovi. Deleted Ovi, then couldn't download Ovi Store from Download! folder.
</font></span></p>
<p><span><font>The solution is thus: <strong>Create NEW OVI ACCOUNT</strong>. Try again.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font>As far as getting Ovi back on my phone, I installed '<em>Download! -3.2.818-sdk31-EMEA-Production.SIS</em>' (a temporary Download! application Nokia set up went they transitioned from Mosh to Ovi - luckily, still on my highly unstable
 harddrive&nbsp; <i>😋</i>&nbsp; ). </font></span></p>
<p><span>So glad it's back!! Woooohoooo!!! </span></p>

<p>A access Hotmail with my web browser. Guess that's sort of outlook based.</p>
<p>https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/mail/inbox/rp</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up a no rules that I can remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have office 2010 home and student, but do not use it for email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scam/spam email is gone until I close Hotmail and reopen it. Tried it 5 times in 2 minutes</p>
<p>came back each time. I can delete it and it goes to deleted folder but if I then send it to junk</p>
<p>it always comes back to the deleted folder.&nbsp;Count in spam folder never increases. Hotmail filtered spam does go there</p>
<p>but not the stuff that is missed and ends up in my inbox.</p>

<p>If you have not set up any&nbsp; rules, do you mean to say that when adding emails to the folder, you just click on the message and place it on the Junk folder manually? To send the spam emails automatically to the Junk folder, we suggest configuring your email
 settings so it would check incoming messages automatically. Please check out this link for reference:

<p>
</p><p>By the way, are you using the Beta version of Outlook.com? You can check it by looking on the top right portion of the Outlook.com page. Please check illustration below:</p>

<p>Does no good to make spam filters as each one comes from a different Email address. Hotmail catches 10-15 per day but a few get</p>
<p>through to my inbox. I used to be able to select message and mark as junk. This no longer works as of earlier this week. Hotmail is broken.</p>

            <p>Hi.&nbsp; Sounds to me like you set up Solver correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The method you really want is "Simplex LP"</p>
<p>That will be the fastest for this problem.&nbsp; I got the correct solution immediately.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why it didn't do the same for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that the values in A1:A10 are values, and not the result of some calculation.</p>
<p>This will affect the accuracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they are calculations, Round the solutions to 2 decimal places.</p>
<p>Due to machine precision and accuracy,&nbsp; x = y may not flag true in Solver when it looks at a solution at machine precision.</p>

<h3> stomms---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E65 and BT headset</h2>
                    I bougt E65 smatphone, everything seems great with it, exept one thing. When I connect my Logitech Freedom Hedset and NextLink Bluespoon AX2 on it it drops volume to the minimum, so every time I have to put it to maximum manually on headset...<br />
Another thing when you answer the call using the headset, first second you hear callr's voys on max. level and than it drops to minimum... Pretty annoying, especially when you drive. Enyone have the solution for theese probelms? Also it is not possible to chenge
 volume of a headset from the phone itself...<br />
Theese headsets were working properly on my old Nokia 6230i, so i suppose they are not broken or anything.

 party does not hear you at all anymore. Only way to solve this is to reboot (switch off and on) the phone. The headsets work perfectly on my 2 other Nokia phones, one 6021 and one other I don't remember the model number.<br />
<br />
My only resolution is to buy a new headset, any recommendations for troublefree use?

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>I read this&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One common reason meeting invites are not populating in your Outlook calendar is incorrect auto archive settings. If meetings are not displaying on your calendar, they have been archived automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the Auto Archive settings by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click&nbsp;<span>File</span><br />
</li><li>Click&nbsp;<span>Options</span></li><li>Select&nbsp;<span>Advanced</span></li><li>Under&nbsp;<span>Advanced</span>, click&nbsp;<span>AutoArchive Settings</span>.</li><li>Ensure that&nbsp;<span>Run AutoArchive</span>&nbsp;<span>every&nbsp;</span>is unchecked.</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I just want to know:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>why Auto Archive is related to this problem?</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>and also if I dont want to enable Auto Archive and still fix this problem</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>what should I do?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Keyboard arrows keys don&#39;t work when clicking or going over a PivotTable</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm using the last Office Insider Slow version of Excel for Mac and have the following problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I click into a PivotTable from out of it (just from out of it), or</p>
<p>when I move the selected cell over a PivotTable and stop there</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the moment the PivotTable Analyze and Design menus appear the keyboard arrows don't move anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click again over any cell of the PivotTable (i.e., when the menus are already loaded) the problem is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else with the same problem? Is there something I can do to solve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Felipe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested in all 16 version and even version 15.41 and I find that the behavior you mentioned are the same in all these versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the tabs appears (click in the pivot table area), click keyboard arrow to go out of the pivot table and then go back, next time when I move to the side of the pivot table, I cannot press keyboard arrows to move cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to suggest you leave a comment to <a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304933-excel-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
