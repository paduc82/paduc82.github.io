<h2>            surface pro 2 type cover shift key doesn&#39;t work for certain characters</h2>
                    <p>I have been having glitchy issues with my typecover keyboard. It fails to produce dollar sign, and hash symbols, and now capital "v" when the shift keys are pressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The onscreen keyboard works, and I have yet to try attaching a USB keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled the type cover driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 8.1 installation is fully updated</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see how it can be a mechanical issue, as they keys work, and every other key functions, including the 2, 3 and v if they are not shifted, though I have cleaned the keys as thoroughly as I can, just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen other questions which addressed this, but they only recommend reinstalling the driver and checking windows update history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One mentioned some processes that he shut down which resolved the issues, but I don't think I have the same Nvdia processes running, at least I couldn't find them in the task manager.</p>

<p>Hi PaerScott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be resulting from a corrupted keyboard language. Have you checked if the same behavior occurs while using a different keyboard language? You can follow these steps to test a different keyboard language or reinstall the current one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>PC Settings</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Time and language</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Region and language</strong>.</li><li>Click on the language in use and choose <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>You can <strong>Add a keyboard</strong> or <strong>Remove</strong> the current one then add it back.</li></ol>
<p>

<p>I changed the keyboard configuration as per your recommendation, and it didn't change. I have been using a USB keyboard, which works fine, and, in a pinch, the onscreen keyboard also works... which I think would both get mapped by the same function. Additional
 issues have occurred, in that now I cannot type a capital "v" and I cannot get a "!" with the right shift (where $ only works with the right, and "number" works with neither, which makes writing code a little challenging a times when I don't have the usb keyboard
 with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas would be appreciated, as this still seems like a software issue, unless there's a lot more going on under the hood of the type covers than I thought.</p>

<p>Hi PaerScott,</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>This issue can be software or hardware driven. To further isolate the issue, if you know someone who has a Type Cover, try it on your Surface. If there is a

<br />    Type the following command NETSH WLAN show drivers and press Enter
<br />    In the results look for a line Hosted network supported, and see if it says Yes or No.
<br />
<br />If it says No then this is at fault, since your WiFi adapter does not support this feature, and there is not much to do about it (except buying another WiFi adapter that does support it.)

    <title>Share Printer from XP machine to Win 7 machine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nomisma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Share Printer from XP machine to Win 7 machine</h2>
                    I would like to share a printer attached to a Windows XP machine from my Windows 7 64-bit laptop.<br />
<br />
I have enabled printer and file sharing on the XP machine and created a home network, "MSHOME." I have changed the workgroup name on the Windows 7 machine to "MSHOME." I cannot see the Windows XP machine. Obviously I'm doing something wrong. Any help is appreciated.<br />

<p>Hi nomisma,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p>First make sure both machines are members of the same Workgroup which by default is named Workgroup. If both are administrator accounts and<br />
if you are unable to login from only one administator account, then you may have to change some settings to to get access to printers in workgroup.</p>
<p>Check if you have followed all these steps while setting up file and printer sharing from Windows 7 to Windows XP.</p>
<p>Steps to setup file and printer sharing from Windows 7 to Windows Xp:</p>
<p>1. On the Windows 7 machine go into Control Panel \ All Control Panel Items \ Network and Sharing Center then click on Change advanced sharing settings.</p>
<p>2. You will want to verify the following settings under Advanced Sharing Settings for the Home or Work and Public profile.</p>
<p>· Network discovery – on</p>
<p>· File and printer sharing – on</p>
<p>· Public folder sharing – on</p>
<p>3. If you want any user to have access the public shares turn off password protection.&nbsp; This is located in Advanced Sharing Settings toward the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom of the list.</p>
<p>4. Now if you go into Network in Windows 7 you should see your XP machine and the Windows 7 as well.</p>
<p>5. To share the printer on the Windows 7 machine go into Devices and Printers from the Start menu and double click on the printer icon.</p>
<p>6. Next double click on “Customize your printer”.</p>
<p>7. In the Properties screen click on the Sharing Tab and check the box to share the printer and type in its share name.</p>
<p>8. You can install Additional Drivers before setting up the XP machine. To find the shared folders and devices double click on the Windows 7 machine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;icon under Network.</p>
<p>9. Continue into the Users folder and Public to see the shared folders.</p>
<p>10. Over on your XP machine open up My Network Places to find the Windows 7.</p>
<p>11. Double click on the Share folder to find a list of shared folders in the Public folder on Windows 7.&nbsp; If you have password protection enabled you will
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need to type in the username and password of the user account on the Windows 7 machine first.</p>
<p>Setup XP With Shared Printer</p>
<p>1. To set up the shared printer in XP you will need to go into Printers and Faxes from the Start menu and kick off the Add Printer Wizard.</p>
<p>2. Now select “A network printer, or a printer attached to another computer” then hit Next.</p>
<p>3. Next select “Connect to this printer…” and type in the path for the printer connected to the Windows 7 machine and click next.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Now click Yes to the confirmation message.</p>
<p>5. Then click Finish the printer to install and complete the Wizard.</p>
<p>NOTE : In some cases you will need to install the x86 XP drivers for the shared printer because the Windows 7 drivers are not compatible with XP.&nbsp;
<br />
When everything is installed open up Printers and Faxes to find the shared printer.</p>

            Hi Jo,<br />
<br />
Switching to Pro is one-way. If you make the switch, you won't be able to go back to Windows 10 S. To know more about requirements and how you can switch from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro, you may check this article:

<h2>            Windows freezes momentarily and causing lag after recent Windows Update</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title: Update Causing Lag</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed the windows 8 update last night, I think there were between like 15 or 19 things updated, and when i turned on my laptop today, there was a lot of lag. At first, I thought it was just because I was on public wifi, but once I got home, I
 realized the mouse literally freezes and takes a second or two to load where it actually is. It's currently fluctuating between being fine and seemingly freezing. This computer is only 2 and a half months old, it's a Toshiba Satelite C55-B. I know it's not
 an issue with space or anything and it only began occuring after the update. I've restarted twice with little to no improvement</p>

You be able to recover your files unless the drive has totally failed even if you can't get Windows running on it again.&nbsp;And even then they can be recovered by a professional recovery company though it is very expensive. Just be careful about what you do to
 attempt repairs so the data files are not over-written.<br />
<br />
Let's try to get Windows running again :<br />
</p>
Try running StartUp Repair from a Windows 10 boot disk or USB drive. <br />
That often will work when running from the recovery environment does <br />
not. You can try Option 5 here and run StartUp&nbsp;Repair to see if it helps. <br />
You would need to make a bootable USB or DVD using the Media Creation<br />
Tool.

</p>
<p><br />
You can make a Windows 10 Install disk and try to use it to repair the present<br />
installation. Do not try to do a clean install with it however because if the upgrade<br />
was not fully activated for a few days then the clean install will not activate.<br />
<br />
Make a Windows 10 Disk using the Media Creation Tool - select to install on<br />
another computer and the same version you have now. You can make a USB<br />
or DVD to boot with. Select Troubleshoot - Advanced Options&nbsp; - Automatic<br />
Repair.<br />
<br />
Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool - create media then<br />
boot with it - use method I outlined above.<br />

<br />
If the issue is drive related the best way to back up your data would be to put the hard drive into another computer as 2nd drive (best method)&nbsp;or "possibly" into an External USB case (less likely to work in this case). Either might allow you to copy the data
 to removable media such as CD, DVD, and other USB drives. Of course a real computer shop or the system maker can help with data recovery. There are professional data recovery companies though those services are usually expensive.
<p><br />
Or you could use an Ubuntu boot CD to back up the data.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
REGSVR32.EXE is&nbsp;Windows component however it could have been affected&nbsp;by malware.<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect
 as the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with
 these to an extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not
 does not mean you should not check with the other methods below.<br />

<p><span>Hi Nissan_350Z,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we troubleshoot, we need some more information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Is&nbsp;</span><strong><span>APC
 Biopod&nbsp;</span></strong><span>connected through USB port?</span></li><li><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></li><li><span>Have you installed all the software for the Biometric device?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would first suggest you to contact the Biometric device manufacturer check if the device is compatible with Windows 7 and if you need
 to install any additional software or update to work with Windows7. You may also check with them if you need to change any settings for the software or the device to work with Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try connecting the device to a different port on the computer and check if it works when you try to access through control
 panel. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any third party security software or firewall installed on the computer, I would suggest you to&nbsp;</span><span>temporarily
 disable security software from the computer and check if&nbsp;</span><strong><span>APC Biopod</span></strong><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>works
 with </span></strong><span>your computer. If it works, you may contact the security software Manufacturer and check if you need to change any settings. Later re-enable the security software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks and Regards,</span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm glad you found it.&nbsp; I appologize for not asking if it was still showing there, I was thinking it was missing from everywhere.&nbsp; If you want, you can right click on the Games Explorer link above the computer link and drag it to the Games folder if you
 want to still see it in there.<br />

    <title>Problem with Network USB Server and Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sallyscott792  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Network USB Server and Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Network USB Server (Driver from: Elite Silicon Technology Inc) to connect to my XYZprinting Da Vinci 2.0 Duo 3D printer which is in another room from my PC. Before I upgraded to Windows 10 the server worked well with no problems sending print
 files to the 3D printer. Since the upgrade I am not able to send any prints although I do get status messages back from the printer. I have tried to upgrade the driver but windows says I am using the best one. If I take the PC to the printer and connect directly,
 I have no problems.</p>
<p>So my question is, is there a solution to my problem?</p>

<p>Hi Kiran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem with my native USB ports. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer I am trying to use remotely is <strong>not</strong> a traditional paper printer but a
<strong>fused filament fabrication</strong> machine commonly called a <strong>3D Printer.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I take my PC from my home office to the room where I have the 3D printer and connect directly to it using a native USB port I have no problem at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC connects to the 3D printer using USB Serial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is only when I try to connect to my 3D printer remotely using my Network USB Server (Driver from: Elite Silicon Technology Inc). The&nbsp;Network USB Server worked perfectly well when I was using Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is only since I upgraded to Windows 10 that the problem has occured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this cannot be resolved I will regretfully have to revert to Windows 7 or even drop Microsoft altogether and install Obuntu Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Sally</p>

            <p>Are you able to help further on this topic Guru Kiran?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pages you have pointed to are standard troubleshooters which are not even for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Network USB unit that was working perfectly under Windows 8.1 along with a printer that was connected to one of the USB ports. After upgrading to Windows 10 the USB drive I have attached works, but the printer cannot be recognised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anything changed in Windows 10 from 8.1 that would prevent the printer being recognised by the network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to outline the steps to use to configure a network printer via a router for Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi, I have the same problem !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10, makes the Networking USB driver not to operate, there are many Hardware vendors</p>
<p>using the same drivers, versions 1.22, 1.29... etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>See for example one vendor : &nbsp;http://www.win-star.com/eshop/article.php?id=41&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Networking USB HUB (USB Server) section of the document</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What you get is the Printer Gets stuck, or do not get the printing at all</strong></p>
<p><strong>While the driver starts to operate, switches the printer, the printers is provided with the file to print</strong></p>
<p><strong>but overall this does not operate</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>On clean installation of Win10Pro with 1.22 driver version 1.2.04rev1 Sep. 28 2010</strong></p>
<p><strong>the system does operate ! &nbsp;but how do you get it to work with all upgrades?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Actually Win10 became a worse product than former versions &amp; with autoupdate which is not controllable - you can't even know when does the system become&nbsp;malfunctional&nbsp;/ uncontrollable</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Who trys to use microsoft products for the last years "gets" strange problems, which one would expect a company with so many installations, programmers, experience
 - not to have at all !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help make these product work, don't send general "cookbook" solutions</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is specific, so does the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should try it her self first, just go &amp; buy these devices &amp; check on all your distributions.</p>
<p>It would be more easy if you had had one version of Win</p>

<h2>            Is Microsoft planning to get out of the operating system business&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've read that Windows 10 will be Microsoft's last version of the Windows operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I much prefer the Windows 10 user interface to the Windows 8/8.x debacle (metro sucks!), the privacy, confidentiality, and security issues introduced by Windows 10 (and the Win10 EULA) make Windows 10 an unacceptable solution for anyone who deals with
 confidential information (intellectual property, patient information, trade secrets, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to request that Microsoft release the Windows 7 source code as open source (or sell it to a vendor who wishes to support it) before exiting the operating system market.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>No, they are not coming out of the operating system business, in fact, they are accelerating development.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, the Windows 10 Enterprise E3 and E5 editions offered through a subscription are part of a broader program for large enterprise businesses which includes Office 365, Dynamics, Azure and unique offerings like Windows Defender Advanced Protection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to your main question.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is Windows 10 really free and do I have to pay for it after the first year has passed?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users. This means, as long you upgrade within the first 12 months (July 29th 2015 to July 29th 2016), you will not have to pay for Windows 10 at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6cc82b2e-e2d7-4d84-ad6d-d5dc9568827f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</em></span><span><em>–</em></span><span><em>at no additional charge. </em></span></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.

</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</span><span>–</span><span> at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>–</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>
</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I have to pay for updates and fixes for Windows 10?</strong><br />
No, updates, fixes, security updates, features all remain free. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What does lifetime of the device mean?</span></strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;logical conclusion is as long as the machine is operable, Microsoft will continue to support it with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates to Windows 10 will be made available to it. Please note that Windows
 10 uses the same life cycle policy of 5 years mainstream support and&nbsp;5 years extended support.</p>

<h2>            Hyperlinks in Mail and Calendar Apps</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot get hyperlinks sent in an email or in my calendar app to work. I see the full path and have to copy and&nbsp;paste into a browser but the links in the mail or calendar app do not allow clicks. Any way to fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>360 Slim Freezing Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doominatorx6  say:</h3>
<h2>            360 Slim Freezing Problem</h2>
                    
<p>I've got a bit of an... odd situation here.</p>
<p>After less than a year, my brand new 360 Slim (the 4GB model) decided to die. More specifically, it freezes every 20 minutes or less.</p>
<p>Now, since it was still in warranty I sent it in, but much to my horror, I got it back...</p>
<p>...and it was the EXACT SAME PROBLEM. I've tried several different things, like playing offline, with/without a hard drive, clearing the cache, etc...</p>
<p>No such luck. The only other conclusion I can think of is the power supply may be faulty. Is there any way to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem could be that your Xbox is over heating. This happens to many people because they believe that even though they can hear the fan running that it is sufficient, but that’s not always the case. It all depends on not only how long you use the console
 for but also the environment in which the console is placed.</p>
<p>If your Xbox is placed in a cabinet, near a heater, or surrounded by other heat sources it could not be getting proper ventilation. Try disconnecting the Xbox and moving it to an open shelf or at least in an area that is open. Putting it on a soft surface
 such as a couch or bed is not recommended because it could block some of the vents.</p>
<p>If your Xbox is in a properly ventilated area but still overheats due to prolonged use, you could go out and buy an external fan that hooks right onto your console.</p>
<p>Another possibility would be that your Xbox cache or your save game file has been corrupted. Cleaning out your cache could help (note that this is safe. It will not delete any of your game saves, profiles, demos or videos or anything else you have saved
 on your Xbox. It will however delete your game automatic updates. These will have to be re-downloaded after the process is complete). To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>To clear the system cache</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on your controller, go to Settings, and select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Storage or Memory.</p>
<p>Highlight any storage device, and then press Y on your controller. (It doesn't matter which storage device you select; the cache will be cleared for all storage devices.)</p>
<p>Select Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>When prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select Yes.</p>

<p>^RC GHOST, Did you read his question? and his attempts at resolving his issue? "I've tried several different things, like playing offline, with/without a hard drive, clearing the cache, etc"</p>
<p>I did a bit of 'Googling' and found this:</p>

<p>Anyway, why not go to that^ link (the one that RC GHOST just &nbsp;copied and pasted from haha) there is some pretty useful info in it. Or, send it back.</p>

<p>My console was freezing like crazy and the shut off one day. Thr power brick was red hot and clogged. Cleaned it out with a duster and the problem stopped. And now it really only happens with COD Elite. 3/4 of the time, the whole system freezes within 10-15
 seconds of getting o my career summary after logging in. It's frustrating beyond belief.</p>

<p>Hey Doominatorx6, let us know! :)</p>
<p>@SILENCOM this sounds like a slightly different issue now, if you'd like help with this could you please create your own thread so we can troubleshoot with you and the OP of this thread individually. :) Thank you!</p>

    <title>Which JRE should I install&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> okieseeker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which JRE should I install&#63;</h2>
                    I downloaded a small, free JAVA application that came with instructions that I should go to the Sun site and download the JRE. Problem is, when I got there I found two possibilities and don't know which one to install. One is described as the "offline"
 version and the other is described as the "kernel" version. There were others at Sun, but these two seemed to be the most likely. Any tips?

            The offline version is the complete package of java with all libraries inside it so there wont be any need to download anything else after installation, and as a result it has a larger size.<br />
<br />
But the online kernel version divides JRE libraries into small bundles which has a smaller size so lets first time Java users run applets and Java Web Start applications quicker without waiting for the whole Java Platform to be downloaded. and those additional
 libraries that may be required will be downloaded automatically via the download manager in the background later on.<br />
<br />
No matter which one you choose, upon completing the download and installation of all the bundles, both of them should be identical.

            <p><span>Hi Ashleyf,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To better understand the situation, can you please confirm the following information?</span></p>
<p><span>1. Do other users in your organization have the same problem?</span></p>
<p><span>2. If you use other Skype for Business client, can you hear the sound?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click More Options for the voice and open it in Outlook to see if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>4. To test whether the issue is related to the specific voice, can you please send another voicemail to the same user?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Robert</span></p>

<p>Calling the business skype&nbsp;PSTN number:</p>
<p>I can leave a voice mail that can be heard calling with consumer skype .</p>
<p>My wife can leave a voicemail that can be heard calling from her att iPhone.</p>
<p>My home phone, provided by Sonic, leaves a voicemail and it is silent and cannot be heard at all.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ashleyf,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the voicemail can be heard normally from other devices, the issue might be related to the affected phone itself.
</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, as you can hear the voicemail by turning it up, if you want to continue troubleshooting the issue, I suggest you contact the phone provider for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>If there is anything that needs to be done from Office 365 side, please feel free to let us know. Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            <p>I tested it from the same phone calling my wife's Office 365 Skype PSTN number and my Office 365 Skype PSTN number we get different results. Mine are very quiet, hers are fine. I haven't had this problem with any one else calling me but this repeatable phenomenon
 concerns me. Yes i can hear it if I turn it to max in a very quiet room and put my ear to the speaker. Same quiet on a desktop system or on an Ipad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely we have to gather more reports of this phenomenon or mark it as unsolvable.</p>

<p><span>Since your wife’s Skype for Business account has no issue, can you please sign your account in your wife’s device and send new test voicemail to check if the issue persists? This is to test whether
 the issue is related to the specific devices.</span></p>
