<p>Same here on 2 different computers, one with an internal HDD for backup purposes, the other with an external one.</p>
<p>Backup stops with error code 0x80070013 on both machines at every try.</p>
<p>Neither of the dedicated backup drives is write protected.</p>
<p>Very frustrating, since everything was working flawlessly before the latest update (1809, 17763.1).</p>
<p>Please fix this sooner than later.</p>

<p>Dear Windows users, welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the OP of this thread and have discovered the sad reason for my frustration. For background I bought a brand new USB external Toshiba HDD to use for<strong> backups only&nbsp;</strong>(formatted correctly and no other data on the drive), and had
<strong>full access control</strong> as well as <strong>Ownership of the drive in Security permissions</strong>.
<p>
</p><p>Then on October 2, 2018<strong> I updated Windows 10 to version 1809 </strong>
and <strong>the Backup procedure would no longer complete as I would get to about 97% and then get the 0x80070013 error</strong>. I did extensive research and
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">tried multiple solutions offered both here in the Community as well as with other IT friends.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The sad truth is that <strong>yet again</strong> here is a classic example of <strong>
an improved Windows version</strong>&nbsp;that degrades or disables a particular useful Windows native function for its users that is now unable to do what it did
<strong>prior to the update</strong>. Maybe it's a bug, maybe it's a temporary flaw and they will fix it, but I am discovering more and more users
<strong>are having this issue <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">after they upgrade</span></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></span></p>
<p>I purchased the Home Version of <strong>Macrium</strong> and it does what I need done flawlessly. Image, file backup, everything. Backup was a great feature of Windows, too bad improvements to the OS are at a cost to such advantageous and vital native functions
 such as this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not wish to go on endlessly trying to work with this thread for the next fifteen months while everyone and their brother offers ideas as well as occasional Microsoft employees offering out of context advice or suggestions. Macrium works, plain and simple
 and the license is perpetual. As long as the company stays open, I'm good. Just sad that I had to turn to another software company to do something my OS once did flawlessly and native to its system. As a consumer, it makes Apple and Chromebooks look really
 appealing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Francois, I went with Macrium, they have a free version which will do what you need.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem with Backup and Restore (Windows 7) on my Windows 10 computer running the latest 1809 version (October 2018 update). After reverting to the previous Windows 10 version (1803, April 2018 update), that backup program works again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The free version of Macrium Reflect seems like a good program, but I don't want to just make system image backups, I also want to back up and restore individual files (kind of like Time Machine on Mac OS, I choose the folders to back up, the backup program
 syncs the contents, and I can restore some or all files, even on other computers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure third-party backup programs work well, but I don't know how much I should trust the free ones, and I'd like to avoid paying upwards of $50 for an alternative to something that is included with Windows for free, and stopped working because something
 else in the operating system has changed and broken this deprecated feature.</p>
<p>I don't want to use File History because it's too limited. Microsoft discontinued a feature without offering a suitable replacement. I think a small fix for this program could be made, but I'm afraid it's not happening.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly recommend that you use File History to back up or restore your files, but if you STILL wish to create system images:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button, and then click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> /
<strong>Windows PowerShell (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command and press ENTER; for example:</li></ol>

<p>I see the same problem on both of my Windows computers after updating from 1803 to 1809.&nbsp; One machine uses a directly connected USB drive, the other backs up over the network to a NAS drive, but the failure is the same on each.&nbsp; It's clearly just a bug and
 one that needs to be fixed ASAP.&nbsp; It seems like 1809 shipped with a bunch of issues ... there was a Cumulative Update today (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464330/windows-10-update-kb4464330), but this issue was not addressed in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bugged this on Feedback Hub ... I encourage everyone affected by this bug to do the same.</p>

    <title>Skype for Business Sign-In Hangs after Password Change - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype for Business Sign-In Hangs after Password Change</h2>
                    <p>We are trialling Skype for Business via O365.&nbsp; We are using AzureAD Premium with password sync (no ADFS).&nbsp; All clients are up to date and this problem is affecting all our pilot users.&nbsp; OS is Windows 7 SP1 32-bit fully patched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When signing in the first time, users tick the box to store their credentials.&nbsp; After a password change on-premise, S4B hangs during sign-in with no error message, it just keeps going until we cancel sign-in.&nbsp; We then have to click the option on the sign-in
 page to clear saved account details which then enables the prompt for a password.&nbsp; Once the new password is entered, we can login successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, this is not a satisfactory user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; The client should be automatically prompting for the new password when the cached credentials fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing this?&nbsp; Is this a known issue and most importantly, is there a fix?</p>

            Hi IsaacHG,<br />
<br />
When we sign into Skype for Business, the credentials are stored on the client.&nbsp;If we change the password, we will need to update the stored password in the Skype for Business after clearing old the sign in information.&nbsp;<del>Regarding your requirement of automatically
 prompting for the new password, I suggest you <a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/category/119998-client-windows-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
submit your feedback </a>to the relevant team. Many features are designed and improved based on customers' valuable feedback.</del><br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />

            <p>Hi ISIsaacHG,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the misleading. </p>
<p>
</p><p>No, what you are encountering is not an expected behavior.&nbsp;Generally, if you have stored the old credential, Skype for Business uses it to sign in.&nbsp;It could take few time before Skype for Business detects the change and prompt for the password depending
 on the connectivity to the Skype for Business server.<br />
<br />
For the problem you are encountering, I would like to know some more details: 1.The detailed version of Skype for Business client. 2.How long time after you changed the password did you sign in to Skype for Business again? 3.How long did it hang before you
 click cancel sign in and update the new password? 4.&nbsp;Do you have any pure online users? If they change the password in the cloud side, does the issue occur?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Alex</p>

<p>You need to remember that makers of applications must make them compatible with Windows standards and not the other way round. If the problem is the result of a recent Windows update then the supplier took some shortcuts that defy these standards.</p>

    <title>ELOD and refund - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arun_1412  say:</h3>
<h2>            ELOD and refund</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div>During purchase of windows 8, I was debited twice from my credit card. I called the customer support in India. From there I was transferred to some unknown region. &nbsp;After waiting for half an hour in call, I spoke to customer care executive and told my
 issue. She told me to cancel my order by singing in ELOD. I did that and didn't receive any e-mail confirmation for my cancellation. She told me to call the number 18778303165 after some days. She provided me a service request too . I searched in online to
 check the status of the same but couldn't.&nbsp;</div>
<div>How long do I need to wait for the refund? She informed me that I will be refunded in 14 days. Will it be refunded within those days? If I don't, what I need to do for getting the refund. Is there any e-mail address or phone number to check my status??</div>

<h2>            Asphalt 8&#58; Airbone lag when I connect to internet via Huawei E3131 &#40;USB modem&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have HP ENVY dv6-7300sa with Windows 10 Home x64 (all updates installed). I have Asphalt 8: Airbone with latest updates from Store installed. When my laptop is connected to network via Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable game runs smoothly without any problems. But
 when I connect to internet via Huawei E3131 (USB modem) game starts very slowly, it runs very slowly (lags), all my operations (button pressing, selecting) does very slowly. I can't play that game. But it happens only when modem connects to internet. If I
 plug modem to laptop but don't connect to internet, game runs smoothly. But I can't play that game without network.</p>
<p>I don't have lot of metro games, but I tried play Blitz Brigade and Cut the Rope. These games runs smoothly even I connect laptop to network via Huawei modem.</p>

Can some one tell me if the soundmixer.exe is actually a virus? If yes how to fix this problem?</div>

<p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is solved. Neither windows defender nor McAfee resolved this problem. I uninstalled the McAfee antivirus and installed</p>
<p>Quickheal total security antivirus and it resolved that issue completely after scanning. Thanks for your help Dennis.</p>

 it does show up in the filtered list. Is there something additional I need to do?</p>

<p>Hey Rodney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us today! I'd be happy to help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That may be due to a technical issue as the Orange Box is One X enhanced and there's nothing else you need to do for it to appear in that filter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked your Updates for games under My games and apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest to start off with performing a complete<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> power cycle</a> to fully reboot your Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try that out and let us know if it's still not in that filter.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask you:</p>
<ul>
<li>When does this pop-up appear?</li><li>Is it specific to any application?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You may try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Try
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To know more about
 safe mode, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></p>

<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate
 software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></p>

            I'm not very computer savy so I'm afraid to do any of the things you suggested except run my Norton virus scan (which I did). The little box keeps popping up usually when I first turn on computer but I notice that it will pop up when I have been on computer
 for awhile too.

<h2>            Tunnel Adapters gone wild on Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>On my windows 7 machine, ipconfig shows lots of tunnel adapters (few are shown below).<br />
<br />
I have disabled ipv6, tried netsh cmds to disable isatap router etc and rebooted.. but it does not help.<br />
<br />
Is there a reliable way to remove those tunnel adapters to show up in ipconfig?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

    <title>Minecraft freezes gaming PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandoncrawford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft freezes gaming PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Today I come to Microsoft's site hoping to get some help because I cant find a solution to my problem anywhere else. First let me give the specs of my PC:</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU/GPU: AMD A10-7850k Radeon R7, 12 Compute cores 4C+8G @ 3.8 GHz</p>
<p>Installed memory: 16GB (14.9GB usable)</p>
<p>Operating System: Windows 10 pro (x64) with latest updates</p>
<p>1TB HDD</p>
<p>Java Version: (build 1.8.0_111-b14)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is a random whole computer freeze at about 30 minutes into playing Minecraft Vanilla 1.10.2 or any version. This freeze only occurs on this game, meaning I am able to play more graphic and CPU intensive games without a problem. When the computer
 freezes, you're unable to do anything, you cant "tab," out, (ctl+alt+del) doesn't work, absolutely no input is received. The only way to unfreeze the computer is to "hard reset," which isn't healthy at all. This is not a memory problem, Ive tried giving java
 up to 4GB of memory but still experience the freeze up. Even before giving Java the memory, minecraft didn't use or allocate much memory anyway and its CPU usage was fine as well. When freezing, the PC just stops on the last frame it was on during the game,
 and some pixels end up looking buggy in that frame, but after a hard reset, everything is back to normal, I just cant play Minecraft. Also there is no log or event in the event log when I check it afterwards, it doesn't even say that the computer crashed or
 froze. Ive also tried reinstalling my video driver, and reinstalling java and minecraft, but I still experience the freeze up. Can anyone help me? If more info is needed just ask.<br />
</p>

<h2>            Changing a game&#38;&#35;39&#59;s language</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I bought the game Portal 2, and on the box it says that it would have dutch subtitles.<br />
But in the game I see nowhere an option to change the subtitles to dutch, only english.<br />
My locale on the xbox is set to The Netherlands and the language to English as we dont have Dutch language to choose.<br />
I bought the game in a store in The Netherlands, its a PAL game. Does somebody know how I can change it to dutch?</p>

<p>The only way to get subtitles in Portal 2 is by going into Audio Settings --&gt; and then selecting Closed Captioning. If the desired closed captioning language is not there, i believe the game does not support the closed captioning you are looking for. Sorry.</p>

You can contact them for support here: <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php?id=68" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.steampowered.com/kb_cat.php</a> . I hope you are able to resolve it, however! Portal 2 is an amazing game, well worth the effort. :) Cheers! </p>

<p>You've downloaded Skype, but have you installed it? &nbsp;To do that, look for the Skype,dmg file in your Downloads folder. &nbsp;Open it, then drag/drop the Skype icon onto the Applications folder icon in that window to install Skype. &nbsp;Thereafter, you'll find it
 alive and well in your hard disk's Applications folder.</p>

    <title>Computer won&#39;t let me run .exe files. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thx phoenix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer won&#39;t let me run .exe files.</h2>
                    Or any other files for that matter. My computer is not letting me access that registry, nor does it let me run any new downloaded files. Files that have always been on the computer run fine, however, and newly downloaded material can only be extracted.
 Actual execution of the files has proven impossible. My father had a similar problem a while back, and said that he had to erase some kind of malware in the registry. Assuming I even can access the registry, what files do i need to delete in order to stop
 this problem? Thanks in advance.

            This could be a problem caused by malware, but the way to go about fixing that is through anti-malware programs (not by revising the registry where the malware could be anywhere unless we know the specific malware involved and a registry fix is available).&nbsp;
<span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>www.pandasoft.com</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at
</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options because thatâ€™s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).<br />
<br />
If it is just a few file types, they may have become corrupted or inadvertently changed and you need to change them back.&nbsp; Here is a list of most of the typical Vista system files (including .exe) with REG files to restore them to their normal default status.
<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/105/1/File-association-fixes-for-Windows-Vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/105/1/File-association-fixes-for-Windows-Vista.html</a>.&nbsp; I don't know if this is the problem (as you seem to indicate it is many file types) but it may actually be a smaller set than you recognize and this may help repair
 the problem(s).&nbsp; You may need to run this process before you do the malware detection if you are unable to install new programs.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, let's try some generic repair procedures to see if we can fix the problem as it may have to do with system files.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking â€“ or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning startup (Start
 / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer â€“ or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>
