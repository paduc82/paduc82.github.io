<br />
I do NOT supply: file name; file type; drive letter; etc.&nbsp;- nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

I tried searching for this - just can't find any discussion.&nbsp; And of course, not having this search would be insane. It is precisely what we have a computer for.&nbsp;

<p>I've been looking into this because I know the search has been failing for me.&nbsp; I think the difference in whether Windows search works or not depends on the FILE EXTENSION which contains your search text.&nbsp; For example, if you look for the word "spam", it
 will be found if it is in a whatever.doc file, or whatever.txt file.&nbsp; However, if you were to rename the file to whatever.xyz, it will no longer find the word.</p>
<p>Here are all the steps I think you need to follow to actually search:</p>
<p>1. Make sure that Windows 7 is actually going to search files with your extension, and it appears that using this list properly is important *whether or not you are looking in an indexed location*!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Hit the start button and type "search" in the search box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Select "Change How Windows Searches"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Hit "Advanced"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Select the "File Types" tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp; Make sure the file extension for the files you want to search in is on the list *and* is set to "Index Properties and File Contents" (yes, pick your jaw up off the floor).&nbsp; I know this appears to be for file indexing, but it does seem to make a difference
 on whether you find the file in non-indexed locations as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp; Say "Ok" and exit all the dialog boxes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Actually perform your search on the folder in question.&nbsp; Depending on some other settings you may have to type "content: spam" to find "spam" *in* the files instead of files with the word "spam" in the name.&nbsp; Alternately, if you press the "Alt" key when
 you're exploring in the folder, you can choose "Tools / Folder Options" go to the "Search" tab and select "Always search file names and contents".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If what I have written is actually correct, then IMHO Microsoft has coughed up the ball bigtime on this one.&nbsp; Personally, I now recognize that I can't use the search feature, and I'm installing Cygwin so I can use "grep" to search the contents of files.&nbsp;
 Not cool and not amused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck to all the searchers.</p>

    <title>How can I stop the volume from skipping numbers by 10 when turning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I stop the volume from skipping numbers by 10 when turning down&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello - maybe someone can help. When I turn the volume down in Windows 10, say from level 60 down to 40, I should only have to tap the volume button 10 times (since it counts down by 2s). However, after I tap it about six or so times, it automatically starts
 reducing in increments of 10s. This means, I always need to reverse to find the desired volume. This behavior is completely unwelcome, since if I really want to reduce the volume down to 0, I'll just hold the volume button down. This has been driving me crazy
 for a long time, but just posting now. Is there some way to turn this off???&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how it looks. I want to turn from 60 down to 40. It starts at 60:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbec075c-071d-4cfd-a68a-27f324016af4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbec075c-071d-4cfd-a68a-27f324016af4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I press volume down six times and now we're at level 48. Everything is going just perfectly!</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/892e6dd2-c341-46b6-aa4d-60e3c3e26963?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/892e6dd2-c341-46b6-aa4d-60e3c3e26963?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What just happened!!?? I press down two more times and suddenly it's at level 28!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d44f00b-1842-4074-b117-08488a900850?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d44f00b-1842-4074-b117-08488a900850?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the devs have lots to worry about, but this (for me) has to be one of the most annoying behaviors in all of Windows considering the frequency at which people adjust their volume levels. Can you please fix this??</p>
<p>

            Hi Craig.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you're using the Fkey for volume on a laptop then that is entirely under the control of the drivers for the sound controller and possible chipset or other driver governing Fkey.  
<br />
<br />For example on my Dell laptop the F2 and F3 keys tick down or up the volume in increments of one only.  There is no Windows setting for this, and I've never even seen a sound driver software setting that controls it on laptop models I've owned.  
<br />
<br />If you want to dig into this further I'd ask the Support or Forums for your PC maker and the Sound controller maker.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    I've had my computer a while now and like maybe in the first month I've had it everything was fine until my "Program Files (x86)" folder just vanished. I have no idea why it did that because i did nothing to get rid of it. It was just gone one day when
 i logged on and it annoys me. I tried looking for it somewhere else and i cant find it. I even changed my search options to show hidden folders and files and still couldn't find it. &nbsp;Where did it go and how can i get it back?

            It's there if it opened... so it's probably just marked as hidden. &nbsp;Try this:
<div><br />
<div>1 - Type <b>folder</b>&nbsp;into your Start menu's search box to find and open the Folder Options.</div>
<div>2 - From the View tab, choose to show hidden files and folders, then click Apply</div>

<div>4 - Back in the Folder Options, turn hidden files back off, then click OK.</div>

            There's a few possible reasons that a folder can exist somewhere but not show in the explorer view.
<div><br />
<div>#1 - Hidden. &nbsp;We know this is not the case because you checked it.</div>
<div>#2 - System. &nbsp;Back in Folder Options, enable the display of protected system files and see if it shows.</div>
<div>#3 - Rootkit. &nbsp;Sophisticated viruses known as rootkits can intercept system file display calls and hide them from your view to avoid detection. &nbsp;This seems unlikely to me because you can still open the folder via other methods, and it's rare that a rootkit
 will hide an entire folder, but it is a possibility nonetheless.</div>

<h2>            Cannot connect a Samsung SCX 4100 series printer to new computer using USB parallel printer adapter</h2>
                    I have just bought a Sony VIAO PC with Windows 8. I tried connecting my Samsung SCX 4100 Laser printer to the PC using the USB parallel printer adapter cable after installing the drivers from the original printer CD as well as the software from the CD
 that came with the adapter. The printer does not show up after repeated tries to install a new printer and also restarting. The PC does not recognize the printer; the only thing I see new under Devices is an IEEE-1284 Controller. Please tell me how do I get
 my printer to work on this new PC?

<h3> miek_m  say:</h3>
<h2>            SCCM 2012 R2 trial</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to follow the examples of several setup tutorials for System Center 2012 R2 and I'm having some frustration at try to find a fresh download to start with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I google download SCCM 2012 R2 on Google several Microsoft pages come up for the eval center, and when I enter my info and click next, I'm taken to a download page which contains like 9 links for different files, but regardless, when I click on any
 of them, a get a page not found error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 &nbsp; &nbsp; I would like to know if I can actually still get a download of SCCM 2012 R2, or if this is MS's lazy way of saying its no longer supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could someone please explain why I'm presented with 9 different files to download instead of just 1. I notice this also occurs with SCCM 2016, however the links will actually download files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm certainly willing to buy 2016, but I would like to just try it out without upgrading servers etc.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>This installation package could not be opened - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 888bruce  say:</h3>
<h2>            This installation package could not be opened</h2>
                    I have recently installed a new motherboard &amp; I am in the process of reinstalling all the progams again. I am receiving the following message when I try to install most programs (Itunes &amp; Winzip are 2 in particular) from downloads.<br />
<br />
"This installation package could not be opened. Verify that the package exists and that you can access it, or contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer Package"<br />
<br />
I have tried downloading from alternative sites or earlier versions of the programs with no success<br />
<br />
I have spent the last 4 hours searching for a solution including turning off virus protection, firewall, changing user account controls.<br />
<br />
In searching for a solution this seems to be a very common problem with no one solution to fix all.<br />
<br />
I had the same problen with adobe reader &amp; was able to locate the same download on another drive and it installed fine.<br />
<br />
It seems that this may be related to a reinstall of Windows as this problem did not occur in the original install of windows<br />
<br />
I hope someone may be able to help as I have several other programs to install<br />
<br />
Regards Bruce

<p>Hello 888bruce,</p>
<p><span>Step 1:<br />
Try to ensure that Windows Installer service is running.<br />
</span><span>Go to<strong><span>Start</span></strong> and click on<strong><span>Control</span></strong>
<strong><span>Panel.<br />
</span></strong>Go to <strong><span>Administrative</span></strong><strong><span>Tools</span></strong>.<br />
Click on <strong><span>Services</span></strong> and scroll to<strong><span>Windows Installer</span></strong>.<br />
Double click to bring up the service. <br />
Check to see if the startup type is set to <strong><span>Manual</span></strong>.<br />
Service status is usually stopped. Try and start the Windows Installer server. <br />
Note down the error message if any.<br />
Click <strong><span>Ok</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 2:<br />
Click Start, and in the start search box, type cmd. <br />
Then right click and select, ‘Run as Administrator’.<br />
At the command prompt, type:<br />
Type <strong>msiexec.exe /unregister</strong>, and then press ENTER.<br />
Type <strong>msiexec.exe /regserver</strong>, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3:<br />
<span>Verify the registry permissions<br />
</span>Click <span>Start</span> Button, in the Start Search box type: <span>
Regedit.</span> </span></p>
<p><span>Scroll to: HKEY_lOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/services/msiserver</span></p>
<p><span>Verify that the SYSTEM account has Full control. If it does not, add the SYSTEM account with Full control.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 4:<br />
If that doesn't help, then let's run System File checker to see if you have any corrupted system files.<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'.<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc /scannow<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
Restart your system.</span></p>
<p><span>Look at the following KB article:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB article 555175</a> - How to resolve Common "Windows Installer" Problems<br />
<br />
NOTE: Not all methods from the above link are applicable for Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>Hope this will help to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#37;Windir&#37;&#92;fonts does nothing, but fonts folder is in C&#47;Windows&#47;fonts</h2>
                    Just like the title suggests. I am trying to update my GPS with the newest maps but an error keeps occuring. The GPS people thought it was .NET framework error until further examination "proved" it was a font issue. When they had me type %Windir%\fonts
 nothing came up, however, the folder is in the appropriate place. Windows live also crashes on me (wonder if it is the same problem). Anyone know how to fix this? I really don't want to pay $50 or more to talk to microsoft. Thanks

<p>You may have an environment variables problem.</p>
<p>Start up a command window (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd") and in that window, type the following command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; echo %windir%</p>
<p>It should reply with the answer:&nbsp; "C:\Windows"</p>
<p>If it doesn't, you may need to add or edit your environment variables to correctly define the "windir" variable</p>

<h2>            Why does my Windows 7 crash&#47;freeze when playing ANY video</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p><span>lets
 see can anyone get their head around this one as it is driving me round the bend.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So... I have a media centre PC connected to my HDTV by VGA cable. I ran the PC on XP for a long time but last December, I upgraded it to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/microsoft-support/windows-vista-windows-7-support/480969-windows-7-crashes-when-playing-any-video-files.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows</a>&nbsp;7
 along with my laptop.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Cue 5 months of seamless media usage and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/microsoft-support/windows-vista-windows-7-support/480969-windows-7-crashes-when-playing-any-video-files.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">network</a>&nbsp;integration
 - it worked like a dream and I played both HD and SD content with ease.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
About two weeks ago, I was watching an HD '.mkv' file in Windows Media Centre and about 10 minutes into the video, the video file just Froze - both the video and the audio. I had to power down and restart the machine and started the video file again. About
 5 minutes after re-starting the video file, it hung again (not at the same place in the video). I then went and watched the video on my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/microsoft-support/windows-vista-windows-7-support/480969-windows-7-crashes-when-playing-any-video-files.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">laptop</a>&nbsp;where
 it worked fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A few days after this (first time I had used it again since it hung up) I began watching an SD '.avi' file. About 1 minute into the video the display lost it's signal (the little built in 'no signal' graphic came up) and after a further 15 seconds, the audio
 cut out as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This latter behaviour is now happening every single time I try to watch any kind of SD or HD video of any file extention. This problem is also independant of what video player I use (windows media centre and windows media player classic) After a minute or so
 the display cuts out and the audio quickly follows it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, I was a little annoyed but knowing a good bit about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/microsoft-support/windows-vista-windows-7-support/480969-windows-7-crashes-when-playing-any-video-files.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">computers</a>&nbsp;I
 decided to try and solve the problem taking the following steps.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1) I uninstalled all my codecs and reinstalled the latest version of the K-Lite Codec pack. The latest version has support for windows 7 so I doubt its a compatibility issue here. After doing this the problem still persisted, exactly the same as before.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2) I checked the date of the drivers for my video card (MSI nVidia 6200) and seen that they were dated sept 2009. I went onto the nVidia site and found the latest win7&nbsp;drivers dated april 2010 - I installed these but still the problem is there.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
3) I then thought, maybe its a problem with the actual video card hardware itself. When I built my machine the parts&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/microsoft-support/windows-vista-windows-7-support/480969-windows-7-crashes-when-playing-any-video-files.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">supplier</a>&nbsp;accidentally
 sent me two of the same video card so I swapped out the existing one for a brand spanking new version of the same card. The problem is still EXACTLY the same.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So yes -I am rather annoyed and frustrated at the moment as I have absolutely no idea what is wrong with the machine and how it went from working to not working almost overnight.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'd like to add also that the display is perfect when doing anything else on the computer - I can surf, play youtube videos, listen to music etc and it is absolutely no problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Put on a video and it cuts out the display like I have explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>WHY????</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Updates installed older Intel Graphics Drivers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Updates installed older Intel Graphics Drivers</h2>
                    <p>I just updated my Intel HD Graphics Drivers using the Intel Driver Update Utility. After successfully installing and rebooting my system, I noticed that Windows Update decided to reinstall the graphics drivers. I checked to find that the new drivers were
 an older version. I had installed the 15.33.38.64.4252 drivers, and they were overwritten by the 10.18.15.4279 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: why is this happening? How can I prevent Windows Update from overwriting drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp;Further investigating&nbsp;indicates that&nbsp;it wasn't Windows Update that was installing the older graphics drivers, it was the Intel Driver Update Utility that keeps getting old drivers.&nbsp;WU was trying to overwrite the old drivers that IDUU installed, and
 that resulted in conflicts and blue screens. I uninstalled the drivers, let WU do its thing, and all is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that the 10.18.15.4279 drivers&nbsp;are&nbsp;the latest stable version, according to Microsoft.&nbsp;The manual download for these drivers are here (<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25308/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10-15-40-4th-Gen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25308/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10-15-40-4th-Gen</a>-).&nbsp;However,
 the latest drivers are here&nbsp;(<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25489/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10-15-40-4th-Gen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25489/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10-15-40-4th-Gen</a>-), but I guess
 these have yet to be signed off by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please confirm this? Should I download the latest drivers, or just&nbsp;leave it&nbsp;to WU?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that with each Windows updates all the latest drivers are pushed into your system so that your system can perform better. In any case if you find that latest drivers which comes through Windows updates is causing problem,
 you can always check with the manufacturer website for the latest patch or updates if they have released any and install it. In many cases older versions of drivers also works.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you see that installing of Windows updates for drivers is conflicting then you can prevent the Windows update from reinstalling to avoid the conflicts.</span></p>

                    I have updated drivers to Via HD Audio(win 10). I have Stereo Mix set as Default Sound Device (under Recording tab) with 'listen to this device' checked and Headset Earphone (Microsoft lifechat lx-3000) selected. The Headset Microphone is enabled, not
 selected for anything with 'listen to this device' unchecked. Default playback device is Speakers, with headset earphone in ready (enabled). With my speakers powered on I hear sound through them but the headset earphones audio level is almost inaudible. The
 headset is USB, not analog plug. The speakers are analog plug and plugged into the green 'front' plug on integrated soundcard from motherboard. Motherboard is Asus crosshair iv formula. This exact setup worked in Windows 7. The volumes for everything is at
 100%, when on headset earphone properties under 'advanced' tab clicking the test button enables the tones at full volume. So I know full volume can be had through the headset. Conversely if the headset is set to default playback devic

<h2>            Start Menu is laggy and choppy when multiple windows are opened in the Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated to the Creators Update. There is a noticeable lag in the Start Menu when multiple app/program windows are opened. The Start opening animation becomes choppy, same for scrolling in the app list or through the pinned apps. Same goes for
 the Action Center animation, or when clicking on the time and date in the taskbar. When I minimize/close all windows, the Start menu is back to being smooth and responsive. Basically all animations are smooth again. But only when all windows are closed/minimized.</p>
<p>I noticed the lag in the menu becomes even worse if there's moving content in some of the opened windows, like a video playing.</p>
<p>This didn't happen in the previous Anniversary update.</p>
<p>What could it be?</p>
