aprilkunze</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. Are you still experiencing the same behavior with the app? Are you using a Windows 8/8.1/10 Phone? If yes, try checking if the phone systems apps are up to date. You may also check if the you have the
 latest software version installed on the phone. If not, kindly provide us the phone model for added assistance. We look forward to your reply. ^_^</p>

<h2>            Fonts do not display properly</h2>
                    <p>I was having problems with Office 2010 with fonts no displaying properly (especially in Outlook) or even being there. In Word I kept getting "There is insufficient memeory or disk space. Word cannot display the requested fonts." error message. Updated to
 2016, same thing. Renamed the Normal.dot file, same thing. Outlooked seems fixed but Word only has Calibri, Arial and Times New Roman.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

            <p>I have found that when using Word that a new blank document has only three fonts avaialable and the out of memory message appears but when selecting a template everything is there. in Office 2016 Excel, Publisher, Outlook (haven't tried Access yet as I don't
 usually use it) but Powerpoint crashes on opening. Anyone had similar issues? Is this a known problem with a fix or do I have some sort of virus/trojan/spyware/ alein invasion or what?? All the problems started about 4 weeks ago when I was still using Office/
 Word 2010. Before that date no problems. I haven't got a restore point that is recent (again another mystery).</p>
<p>If anyone could shed some light on this I would very grateful.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have Microsoft office 2016 pro but since last few months I not able to use it because there is a black screen when ever i open any of the office software like word or excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many time I did install and reinstall but in vain. even I have installed and reinstalled with using your tool which removes the office fully but in vain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>even your technicians have tried to take the access and tried it much time but not able to resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the solution which is given online on your website is for the people who are using the pro version in office. But it is not for a standalone machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>kindly guide us.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Meerathaparkhanna,
<br />The solutions generally apply to all versions. 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />the solution which is given online on your website is for the people who are using the pro version in office. But it is not for a standalone machine.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Can you post a link to the solution you found and I'll take a look at it?

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct the solution which is given is for the Microsoft office which is used in offices with some policies but since i am using standalone machine i am not able to solve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i donot understand Pro is not restricted version even an individuals can use it than why only provide solution for business only ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2768648/display-issues-in-office-client-applications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2768648/display-issues-in-office-client-applications</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>All the solution which are given are for the office when it is open or any one of the app gets open but here the problem is I cannot open any app and even when i install it is showing black screen. So non of the solution will work.</p>
<p>

<p>Yeah, that KB does not apply to your situation. The only thing in that article that I would do is disable hardware acceleration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A black screen can mean your computer resources are low or are not being allocated to the app, but it often only affects one program. Rebooting would fix it.&nbsp; (I see it in Chrome a lot, but often have a ton of tabs open.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it work as expected if you open the app in Safe mode?&nbsp; Hold Ctrl as you click on the shortcut to open the program then click Yes on the dialog that asks if you want to open in Safe mode.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hmm. Which suite do you have?&nbsp; It sounds like you might have a volume license version or have a hacked copy. Many of the cheap versions sold online are illegally sold copies from volume licenses.&nbsp; (Volume licenses are only available to corporations
 and the administrator needs to open the support case - that would be why they said they can't help you if you are not a company. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a hacked copy, they many have changed a file and that is causing the black screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not so much pro or not pro (I think most of the suites identify as pro) but which license you purchased that determines who the business group supports. I'm not sure what the policy is for the Home &amp; Business retail version, but the Office
 365 Business subscription does include support - its mostly intended for server side help though, not clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you uninstalled Office and reinstalled, did you get the installer from a microsoft website?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Yes i got installer from Microsoft website only. Even when i do reinstall i do it from microsoft website only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that most of volume version are either hacked or they are office use only. But I have received from the online website which has shared the microsoft website link which i think is autheticated link only if i am not wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but something amazing is that the black screen come even when i install this only laptop .&nbsp;</p>
<p>my other other laptop is also windows 7 i could install their but only problem is word didnt work their .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I faced issue in my sony laptop only.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have found that the Store (beta) as shipped (version 2015.4.24.1, the one you have) has a lot of trouble finding updates and the "check for updates" button is pretty much useless. You need to get the Store to the current version (2015.5.6.2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Find an existing, already included&nbsp;app in Store (beta), for example Calculator or Mail and Calendar. You'll notice the Store has no clue that the app already is installed because it has an Install link. Install it. Once it's started installing go to downloads
 and you'll hopefully have a large list of updates. Store (beta) should be one of these. You want to update Store (beta). If this succeeds it will close the Store and when you open it again it should be the newer version which works better.</p>

            <p>OK, so I managed to find a solution to this issue (honestly I didn't think this would work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install a random app (netlfix in my case) and when the installation started I went in the download section and there was a huge list of updates available (store beta being in the list).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yeah, problem solved, not in the most orthodox way but if others have this issue I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Dir&#40;&#41; loop changing filenames - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eaglyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dir&#40;&#41; loop changing filenames</h2>
                    I am trying to debug the following code:<br />
<br />
Fname2 = Dir(Folder2, MacID("XLSX"))<br />
Do While Fname2 &lt;&gt; ""<br />
Debug.Print "Do While: " &amp; Fname2<br />
<br />
Fname2 = Dir()<br />
Debug.Print "Do While: " &amp; Fname2<br />
<br />
Loop<br />
<br />
The display on the Immediate Window shows the below result.<br />
Do While: AJProjBillv149_donotuse_0712.xlsx<br />
Dir() :APProjBillv149_donot#F9BA0.xlsx<br />
<br />
As shown above, the first loop returns the correct file name (AJProjBillv149_donotuse_0712.xlsx). However, after setting Fname2 = Dir(), the filename of the 2nd file was renamed automatically.<br />
<br />
How do I resolve this to let it retrieve the right file and not to rename it? <br />

            Yes, I had the same problem. &nbsp;See&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macexcel/help-xl-2011s-dir-function-truncates-filename/e72fbf5d-749c-4a55-a77c-e2def6db24d9

<div>I ended-up using AppleScript to get around the issue for now. &nbsp;I created a function that returns an array of files found in the path. &nbsp;I have a separate one to return folders. &nbsp;This could use some error handling, but I just needed to get it working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You could add some language to the set list to every file to filter for XLSX files only. &nbsp;Google Applescript &amp; "every file" and there are example of how to use something like "whose name contains .xlsx". &nbsp;There may even be a filter for "has the extension"
 or something like that. &nbsp;Good luck.</div>

<p>Most likely due to Norton and Acronis are not setup to run RS4 code. Might even just be Norton causing the problem as in general, do not use 3rd party antivirus in Insider builds as they are not compatible yet.</p>

<p>Didn't realize that was still around. If you look through the posts in this forum, it is common knowledge for Insiders to stay clear of 3rd party av. It can cause issues with updating to new builds. Guess you have been lucky so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to realize that RS4 is new code, and there will be problems with some applications due to vendors not keeping up with these beta builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Acronis myself on my main system, but never used it on Insider builds. Never seen a need to backup test systems.</p>

            Yes, I am aware of that and there were a couple of times that it didn't work during the RS3 testing. Also, not sure why I called it Norton 360, it was Norton Security Suite, which is free if you are a Comcast customer.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;There have been HUNDREDS of reports of problems with 3rd party antivirus programs with insider builds in the last year or two.&nbsp; Sometimes they appear to be running, but have intermittent problems.&nbsp; We can't help you if you use these programs that're known
 to cause problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now as to compatible backup programs, try Macrium Reflect or Easeus Todo Backup.&nbsp; I've been using both without any problem for several years.&nbsp; Both have free versions for non-commercial use.</p>

            No, I tried. True Image causes green screen for me when I try and start a backup and Windows image fails with some cryptic error. Only way to take a backup now is manually using the Acronis recovery disk.&nbsp;

    <title>Stop Automatic Installation of Store Apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephendaugherty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop Automatic Installation of Store Apps</h2>
                    <p>Every time Windows updates to a new preview build it automatically installs all my previously installed store apps, even though I uninstalled them on the prior preview build. &nbsp;Does anyone know how to stop this from happening? It's annoying, because I have
 to go through and uninstall them every time there is a new preview build.</p>
<p>

    <title>14295 suddenly lost start except for Edge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaeljones1  say:</h3>
<h2>            14295 suddenly lost start except for Edge</h2>
                    I suddenly lost my start menu except Edge was still there. Now ALL apps show as NEW. I had a problem with weather, it suddenly started replicating itself. Edge and Internet Explorer both freezing and system running slow. I did full scan with Defender and
 it found no problems. I am getting a lot of disk usage that is bogging down the system. Lenovo Idea Center B520. All past updates have installed without a problem and 14295 also installed with no problems and ran good for several days before this condition.
 What the heck??

            Display drivers are newest one available. If I do hard reset will I still get insider fast updates and will I keep 14295? How do you suggest doing hard reset? Thanks for your time and reply. I am not what you would consider a computer geek.

A hard reset is when you hold the power button down when system is on&nbsp;until it shuts down and then reboot you won't lose anything, to be honest with you if you are not familiar with compute systems you shouldn't&nbsp; be using BETA software as it will have problems,
 bugs, glitches, delete files as this is the reason for Insiders (people with computer knowledge)&nbsp;is to test and troubleshoot the software before it is released to the general public, and it shouldn't be used as a everyday system.&nbsp;&nbsp; looking at your previous
 postings I see you are using a NVidia display card, I just had trouble yesterday with start button (build 14295)&nbsp;and went to NVidia site and downloaded the Game Ready drivers and it fixed the&nbsp;problem also was having troubles with 2nd monitor not being found
 it was fixed with the new driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I just did not know if you meant hard reset or recover. I have been an insider since&nbsp;January 2015 and have been a&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;user since it became available, I also used IBM OS2, DOS, etc. Just simply trying to get input from people that are perhaps more computer
 literate the me. My fist computer was a small box with 64K memory, tape recorder as storage drive and a 10 inch black and white TV from the pawn shop. I have built many systems from components and I am very literate in the hardware end of Pc. Just wanted some
 input without the snide remarks. Thanks for your time and the reply. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I can pin apps to the start menu. I have done a couple of games and settings and they work OK. Edge can no longer be pinned to the taskbar. It was strange, looked like Windows had a sudden hiccup and then this. Edge is SLOW and freezes. Internet Explorer
 seems to be OK. Looks like for some reason all apps and installed programs were updated just before this happened, at least that what Windows thinks. Ran trouble shooter on Windows Update and it found and fixed problems. I did not feed Windows beans to cause
 this fart, LOL. Looks like 10 is not yet stable. Also what happens on July 15 when the Insider Review expires?

<h2>            Closing a spreadsheet in Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>Just upgraded to Excel 2016, but for the life of me I can't find how to close the current&nbsp; spreadsheet without closing Excel down.</p>
<p>Every version I have owned has an 'x' to close the the current spreadsheet, but all I have is 'Share' in the top right hand corner in Excel 2016.
</p>
<p>I am obviously haveing a bad day and missing something very obvious!</p>
<p>Can anyone put me out of my misery and show me where it is? </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for that, but I don't have that&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2ffcd7c23f-4499-493c-a8ee-5e9f64f1769d.gif" />.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The 'X'&nbsp; closes the whole program down,&nbsp; I just want to close the active spreadsheet.<br />
There is obviously a setting I can't find to enable it. <br />
Not sure why Microsoft have hidden it by default, but have found I can achieve it with 'File' then 'Close', but just can't find how to activate the normal windows 'X' setting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as to sending Miscrosoft feedback, we all know they don't listen to users in the real world!<br />
</p>
<p>But thank you for taking the time to reply. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, Bing allows direct linking and you link directly to the sales page from the Bing ad.&nbsp;Here are the steps to start a direct linking campaign on Bing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1: Setup your first campaign</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>First, open a Bing or Microsoft account. Then you can create your first campaign. Click on the “Campaigns” tab and select “Create campaign”. Then, name your campaign and set up the budget.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftrillionaireminds.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f12%2fBing-Create-Campaign-268x300.png" height="369" width="330" /></p>
<p><strong>2: Create your ad</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, you need to actually write your ad. Make sure you research your product well and pick the most appropriate keywords for your target market. When you’re done, enter the ad title, ad text, the Display URL and the Destination URL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here’s the difference between Display URL and Destination URL?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">*</span><strong> The Display URL</strong> is the URL that users will see below the ad text.</li><li><strong>* The Destination URL</strong> is where the user will be taken after clicking on the ad.</li></ul>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftrillionaireminds.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f12%2fCreate-Ads-300x38.png" height="57" width="450" /></p>
<p>The Display URL is where you can add your main keyword to increase the click-through-rate and improve your results. Remember, although the Display and Destination URL are used for different purpose, the domain name of the Display URL and Destination URL
 should always be the same.</p>
<p>If you’re using more than one word in the Display URL, you can separate those either by an underscore or by hyphens.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3: Add your affiliate link</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it’s time to add your affiliate link in the Destination URL box. However, you should never run affiliate campaigns without using some sort of tracking that can be used to track your results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftrillionaireminds.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f12%2fCreate-Affiliate-Link-300x110.png" height="166" width="450" /></p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<h2>            How do I download just Access 2007 to do my homework&#63;</h2>
                    I am in a business class and have Access homework. I have already bought and installed Microsoft Office/Student 2007 but it did not come with Access. How can I get this application without buying a lot of stuff that will not be used later and clog up my
 computer (it's a laptop). Thank you-

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You might also try downloading the runtime version of Access 2007. Try this link:
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=d9ae78d9-9dc6-4b38-9fa6-2c745a175aed&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=d9ae78d9-9dc6-4b38-9fa6-2c745a175aed&amp;displaylang=en</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>See if using this works. Instead of the full version of Access that allows you to do development work, this copy of access will allow you to run and use a database that was created in Access 2007. However, if your homework requires you to do any programming
 then you may be out of luck.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck,</div>

            <p>Is it a parameter query (that is, it asks you for some information when you open it)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to initiate a merge from Access, you should have the table or query that contains the data open in Access when you access the Word Merge facility on the Export tab of the ribbon.&nbsp; The Microsoft Word Mail Merge Wizard will then open and in that
 you have the option of selecting to:</p>

 domain is registered under Larry Hawley, the manager. &nbsp;I am in the process of constructing a new website and new e-mail system for the small business, since I am not satisfied with the system setup by the previous consultant. &nbsp;I can provide any and all documentation
 to prove ownership and validation of the domain, or change records if you prefer. &nbsp;I'm not sure what in particular is restricted or blocked on the domain, but I appreciate the investigation.</div>

<h3> jrhester  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I query a table for two different criteria in the same query line&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Access 2007 running on WinXP</p>
<p>I have database with following tables:</p>
<p>Participants: EmpFname, EmpLname, EmpID, .......</p>
<p>ParticipantTrx: EmpID, EmpSupervisor, .........(EmpSupervisor is a foriegn (numeric) key tying back to EmpID in PArticipants)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All particiapnts are stored in the Participants table, regardless of their position or "rank"
</p>
<p>The following query works without issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>SELECT [tblSessions].[SessionID], [tblSessions].[ClassID], [tblSessions].[StrtDate], [tblSessions].[StartTime], [tblSessions].[EndTime],
 [tblParticipants].[EmpID], [tblParticipants].[EmpFname], [tblParticipants].[EmpLname], [tblParticipants].[EmpDept], [tblParticipants].[EmpLocation], [tblParticipants].[EmpJobTitle], [tblClasses].[ClassName] FROM (tblClasses INNER JOIN (tblParticipants INNER
 JOIN tblParticipantTrx ON-- Sorry My copy did failed to capture teh end of the sql here</span></p>
<p><span>For reporting purposes, I now need to include the EmpFname and EmpLname of the EmpSupervisor from the Particpants tables
 in this query.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I am trying to formulate a criteria in the query for EmpFname and EmpLname of the supervisor along the lines of "EmpFname
 and EmpLname from participants table where EmpSupervisor of query line&nbsp;equals EmpID in Participants table"&nbsp; Below is teh closest I have come tyhus far, however, this is added to the existing query results drop to ZERO.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Select [tblparticipants].[EmpFname], [tblParticipants].[EmpLname], where( [tblparticipants].[empID]=[tblparticpantTrx].[EmpSupervisor])</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Can anyone suggest where I am going wrong? or lead me out of the darklness here?</span></p>

<p>Hello Gene,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my knowledge, Office 365 is verified to meet the requirements specified in ISO 27001, European Union (EU) Model Clauses, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Business Associate Agreement (HIPAA BAA), and the
 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). You can see <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/CloudServices/office365/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> for reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you deal with HIPAA sensitive information you must have HIPAA training. Microsoft services doesn’t achieve it on its own. Your organization is responsible for ensuring that you have an adequate compliance program and internal processes
 in place, and that your particular use of Microsoft services aligns with HIPAA and the HITECH Act.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<h2>            Headphone jack severe issues&#33; Microsoft Lumia 950</h2>
                    <p>I don't what the deal is with this phone but my auxiliary cable that I have been using on my nokia lumia 920 for months now is not working on my 950. Whenever I would try to play music with it plugged, the sound would come from the phone speakers instead
 of the car but when I plug it into my 920 it works fine and the music plays from the car speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone also seems to have trouble connecting to ear/head phones with integrated mics, meaning 3.5mm jacks with three lines to separate the signals will not work. The same thing happens where the phone wont even pick up the cable. -.-&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that tells me that I have to find headphones and aux cables that are compatible with this phone in order to get the audio to work. Which is really stupid because every jack should work with the 950 just like they all did on the lumia 920</p>
<p>

            <p>I tried my Aux cable that's a standard cable without integrated buttons or mic and it wont work when trying to play music in my car, however I got home and plugged in my headphones which do have integrated buttons and a mic and it worked perfectly fine so
 I'm not sure if this is a hardware issue or a software issue, its quite a stupid issue to be overlooked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update- ok so I noticed on my Skullcandy headphones ( which have a detachable cord) one side has 3 rings while the other has 2, when the 3 ring side is plugged into the phone the headset will not receive sound but when the 2 ring side is plugged in to the
 phone and the 3 ring side connected to the head set the head set will work with the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>checked the cable in my car and it is a 3 ring 3.5 tip.......so if you have a 3 ring 3.5mm&nbsp;tip it will not work with your lumia 950 WHICH is absolutely a design flaw in what I would consider a very well built and fantastic phone, who the **** saw over the
 making of the headphone jack in this thing? that's a really bad flaw for a flagship phone.</p>

            <p>Hi Lydia,<br />
<br />
When Directory Synchronization is enabled, the room mailbox is expected to be synced to the cloud as a mail user.&nbsp;After the room mailbox is moved to the cloud in Exchange Hybrid, it should be converted to mail enabled user in the on-premises. For this issue,
 please help confirm some more details.</p>
<p>1.Did you move the room mailbox to the cloud after AAD sync is enabled?<br />
2.Do you assign a license to it?<br />
3.What is the mailbox type in your on-premises Exchange, a mail enabled user or room mailbox?<br />
4.Does the room mailbox show in your GAL?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, to identify the issue scope, please create new room mailboxes in your Exchange server and then test if the issue can be reproduced.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Alex</p>

<p>2. No license is assigned to resource mailbox</p>

            Hi Lydia,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the update. Since the room mailbox also exists in Exchange Online, please test if the cloud users can add the calendar of the room mailbox directly in Outlook Web App. Meanwhile, please also run the following PowerShell cmdlet in your on-premises
 Exchange and Exchange Online and provide the output in Private Message: <strong>
Get-Mailbox &lt;<em>roommailbox</em>&gt; | FL Name,RecipientTypeDetails,PrimarySmtpAddress</strong>.<br />
<br />
Moreover, I would like to know how many room mailboxes are affected by this issue, if it is the only affected mailbox, please try to remove it and recreate a new room mailbox to see if the issue persists. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">
 Private Message</a>. You can provide the PowerShell outputs in it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Alex

            Hi Lydia,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the private message.<br />
<br />
And according to that, the room mailbox is still in on-premises Exchange server.<br />
<br />
Given the situation, you need to add the on-premises room mailbox to an on-premises room list.<br />
<br />
To do this, open the Exchange Management Shell on the on-premises Exchange server, and then run the following cmdlets:<br />
<br />
New-DistributionGroup –Name &lt;NameOfRoomList&gt; –roomlist<br />
<br />
Add-DistributionGroupMember &lt;NameOfRoomList&gt; –member &lt;OnPremisesRoomMailbox&gt;<br />
<br />
Note: A room list has a limit of 100 room mailboxes per room.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Franky

            <p>Yes, I did create room list, but I don't know how to use it. When you choose room by clicking room button,, room list is not showing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't know what is the use of room list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Room mailbox did receive emails but not showing on room calendar.</p>

            <p>Hi Lydia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have created an on-premises room list, could you check if it’s synced to the cloud?</p>
<p>If yes, I’d like to confirm if Free/Busy works. Please check it in Scheduling assistant and provide the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4d31674-a904-489c-8a63-da5c4de6c202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4d31674-a904-489c-8a63-da5c4de6c202" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I’d like to collect the PowerShell output of <strong><em>Get-OrganizationRelationShip | FL</em></strong> from both Exchange Online and on-premises Exchange Server and the test result of free/busy at this site:
<a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/</a> -&gt; Office 365 tab -&gt; Free/Busy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent you a private message to collect them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Franky</p>

            <p>Hi Lydia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the private message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According the test result, Free/Busy works between Office 365 and on-premises mailboxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation, could you confirm if the room list is synced to the cloud.</p>
<p>If yes, please check if the room mailbox is the member of it.</p>
<p>If the room list is not synced, please run the PowerShell cmdlet Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta to force a delta sync and then check the room list in the cloud again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Franky</p>

            <p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The roomlist did sync to cloud. I can invite roomlist as attendee, but when I choose it by click room, it said "There aren't any rooms available in SORooms at this time. " But there is 1 room inside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found if I want to add items directly into room calendar, I was told "You don't have permission to create items in this folder". But it works fine for on-premise users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems like permission issue for room mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Lydia</p>
