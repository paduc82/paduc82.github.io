            <p>Well, I've been involved with Word 2011 since its beta testing but never have seen an icon such as you're describing, nor does Word have any influence on double-sided printing. That's a function of the printer &amp; its driver software. Word 2011 has 2 print
 icons: One calls the Print dialog, the other sends the current document directly to the printer. Neither has any sort of check... In fact the icons are identical except that the former includes an ellipsis following its label:&nbsp;

<h2>            When I open a workbook, Excel a 2nd blank window acting like &#40;linked&#41; to the first</h2>
                    <p><span>I am working in Excel 2013 with Windows&nbsp;10</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My workbook was saved when multiple windows were open for that workbook. Now whenever I open ANY workbook (including that one) Excel does the below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(1) Opens blank window (grayed out)</span></p>
<p><span>(2) Opens the workbook&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(3) Opens a second window with the workbook that immediately&nbsp;closes (open for about 2 secs)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am left with a named window containing the workbook, named as such and working properly &amp; a second blank gray window that is just called Excel.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If you close out of the blank Excel window the other named workbook window closes and the blank Excel window stays open</span>
<ul>
<li><span>This same thing occurs if closing via the
</span><span>x in the upper right-hand corner of the window or
</span><span>by choosing Close from the File menu</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>If you close out of the named workbook window then the named workbook window closes and the blank Excel window stays open</span>
<ul>
<li><span>This same thing occurs if closing via the&nbsp;</span><span>x in the upper right-hand corner of the window or&nbsp;</span><span>by choosing Close from the File
 menu</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>NOTE:</strong> Once the named workbook window is closed (in either of the ways above) you can no longer close the blank Excel window from the&nbsp;</span><span>File menu, your&nbsp;only
 options from the file menu are Open or New.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I know that this is not my personal macro book, it is hidden and is remaining hidden. I do have several add-ons Kutools, Kutools Plus, Acrobat and ASAP Utilities but I have had all of these for quite some time without
 any issues. I tried disabling&nbsp;all the add-ons from Excel safe mode and then rebooting. That did not correct the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue is very similar to another I found on Microsoft support except for the behavior of the second window. Because of the closing behavior I mentioned above I am not able to use the resolution from the article.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Thank you for replying. The issue started to occur on Wednesday (6/8/18) morning. It occurs for all workbooks opened by double clicking on the file name from File explorer or that are pinned to the start menu as well as through email. The issue does not
 occur if you first open Excel then use open a workbook from the File menu -&gt; open. I don't have the option to install Office updates (that is done automatically by my company). I am trying the Office repair now.&nbsp;

<h3> immortal25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Avatar so tiny&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Don't really know where I should put this, but I've chose an avatar for my contacts and it appears so tiny!!! When people call or when a message comes in, I'd really like to see a big pic of them! Unforuntately it's really just a mini thumbnail. Is this
 normal or some setting I need to alter?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And is it possible...or is there a 3rd party software that I can use to actually control the cropped picture for the avatars? Sometimes you just want the face or maybe including the body to a certain extent...and unfortunately it has that annoying fixed
 crop size which doesn't always suit what I want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks guys.</p>

            Hello Immortal25, if the images are very small then it seems that the image resolution is very small. If you use an image taken using your phone then it will be somewhat correct. If you want a third party app to modify the image then you may try the one
 called Resco viewer.

<p>Hello. I use the N9's phone to snap the pic...and then to use as avatar, it had to crop out the pic...but that crop size is standardized..I can't change it...and yet it comes out as a mini thumbnail...am just dumbfounded at the small pic. My friend who is
 using a HTC...that has a huge avatar displayed when someone calls.</p>

<h3> emerald521  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get Macro Button Images to Show in Toolbar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I created a Word template file, macros and a custom toolbar in Office 2011. This template will be used by several others in Word 2010. The problem is the buttons (images) for the macros on the Custom Toolbar do not show when the template is opened in Word
 2010. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to do this very simple task in 2010 is almost impossible.(Creating the macros is easy, but getting a button or toolbar to work is not.) That is why I did it in 2011.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on why the images aren't showing?</p>

            <p>As the link Joe provided to my answer states, the issue is 24-bit versus 32-bit BMP image requirements. On the PC, formats other than BMP are allowed but sadly that is not the case on the Mac version of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something you could try however is to create your command bar on the Mac but instead of inserting the 24-bit BMP files, open via Preview, any other image type that is sized properly for a command bar button and then use the good old Copy/Paste method to
 insert it into the button. It involves a bit of labor, but it might be worth a try. I know it's accepted on a Mac (i.e. opening a PNG image and copy/pasting via Preview) a screen clip of the image and pasting it into a button… I just don't know if the PC will
 accept that same button image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My final suggestion is to have two command bars inserted in the template, 1 for the PC and the other for the Mac. Then depending on the platform, automate which command bar is displayed. You can do this using the Application.Version property. Both Office
 2010 and Office 2011 are version 14, however, on the PC the property returns 14.0 and on the Mac the full version number is returned, which is currently 14.3.9, so that can be your trigger (one of a few) to determine what platform you are running on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Not sure about MAC products or functionality but you can use the wizard in Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Employer upgraded use to Windows 10 and Office 2016.&nbsp; The Wizard is still available.&nbsp; It can be added to a new group in the ribbon.&nbsp; It can still be accessed via shortcut by using &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;D&gt; then &lt;P&gt; as usual.&nbsp; However, on our
 network, step 3 of the wizard will fail if you choose to put the pivot table in a new sheet.&nbsp; It still works if I select existing sheet.&nbsp; I can then cut/paste the newly created pivot table to a different sheet afterwards.&nbsp; This issue started with a recent
 update of Microsoft server side products on our network.&nbsp; Our I.T. folks are fairly clueless as to how to fix this and I can not find documentation from Microsoft on the problem or solution.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; If, however, you do not use consolidation ranges in pivot
 table functionality then you do not need the old wizard.&nbsp; I do not, therefore I should just use the newer 2-step process off the existing menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            OK, if its only for viewing, on their home machines, then do not split the database. You need to lock down the database by making it an accde. But before you do that, make it so the user can't open the Nav Pane and can only open forms that YOU create to
 view the data. Make sure the Allowedit and AllowDeletions properties are set to NO on these forms.
<div><br />
<div>But finally, does it really matter if they do screw around? You maintain &nbsp;a Master database that they can download either at the lodge or from your website. If they do mess it up, just delete it and redownload a new master. The master should be kept in
 a spot where they can't open it, just download it. So they can't mess up your Master.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Slow Excel Online due to numerous comments</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing super slow Excel Online. My shared work sheet contain large number of comments (one comment for each of ~18,000 cell blocks) and whenever I try to view comment on one specific cell, Excel Online would rather pull and try to show the entire
 18,000+ comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I noticed that this issue occurs on Windows/Mac based version only, not on mobile version. I'm using&nbsp; Android phone and able to view/edit comment on one specific cell, it won't show every single comments like PC/Mac version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please advise how to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx,</p>
<p>Paritas</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Excel Online </strong>tends to become slower if there are that much comments in it because upon opening that spreadsheet, it will try to load those comments. The speed of opening your spreadsheet in Excel Online on a desktop will depend on the speed
 of your PC and internet. It does not happen on you Android phone because Excel Mobile tends to load minimal comments. What we can suggest to speed up the opening of your file is deleting the unnecessary comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have more concerns, feel free to post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

                    I bought it not too long ago, but I'm unable to call someone in Australia while trying to use the unlimited mins, and when I try to call it always says "This number isn't included in your current subscription" even though I have the "World Unlimited Mins".
 So when I buy actual Skype Credit, it works just fine, should I buy a different subscription? Or just stay with the $5.00 Credit?

 open the workbook for editing. I also cannot see the option to convert it to an Excel Binary worksheet. I am using Office 2010 and Windows 7. Please help.

<p><strong>After I click on the link to the Youtube Video, it opens up in my browser but my viewers are not able to see the Video. They only see a fixed screen (my Slide with the link to the Youtube Video).&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p>Try updating or removing and re-installing the video driver and check.<br />
<br />
BTW, what is the extension of the video file?<br />

You could also insert the video file as an object and check if it plays in presenterview<br />

            <p>It is a bug in Powerpoint. To activate video in presenter mode, insert the Youtube video in the slide, it will now play in the slide rather than the browser. But that is not enough you have to also go to the display settings at the top of presenter mode.
 Then choose duplicate slides, so that you and the audience now see the slides (rather than you seeing the presenter mode view). Now when you click the video the expected action happens of the video playing and the audience being able to see it. If you do not
 duplicate slides on both screens, presenter mode will not allow you to activate videos and advance to the next slide instead.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has taken me a few months to find the solution to this annoying bug. </p>

            Same problem here, finally solved....... by turning OFF the video acceleration FOR presentation mode (there are 2 options that are similar; one doesn't work). The monkeys at Redmond really ought to fix this stupid problem as it is a cause of great angst
 when things fail to work for stupid reasons.

<p>Which option exactly did you hit for turning off the video acceleration for presentation mode?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried checking "disable hardware graphics acceleration" &nbsp;and "disable slideshow hardware graphics accelaration" and neither has worked for me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can I sync my WM6 calendar with my PC without Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Microsoft Office 2007 (Word, Powerpoint, OneNote, Excel) on my HP laptop (with Windows Vista). My version of Office 2007 does not include Outlook. However, I want to sync my calendar from my HTC Mogul (Windows Mobile 6) to my PC (and vice versa).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will another program besides Outlook work for this? When I try to choose what features to sync in the Windows Mobile Device Center, it will not let me check calendar, tasks, or contacts, saying that I do not have Outlook installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is&nbsp;there is way to get it to sync using Windows Calendar or Good calendar? Or is there a way to download just the features of Outlook that I need?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            wifi not turning on</h2>

            Click on the Contacts or People tab
<br />Tap the All tab
<br />Type in your interest, ie. Music, and you should see a list of relevant groups appear.
<br />
<br />I'm a Michael Jackson fan, so, as you can see in the screenshot, I searched for Michael Jackson and some groups came up:<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8af9859-a878-4da2-8d6a-2df88c5db1da?upload=true" />

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Excel Fee Calculator.&nbsp; I'm working on a fee calculator that breaks down the dollar amount range and what fee applies to each
 amount (a3:a7).&nbsp; Is there a mathematical calc in excel that would break that down automatically by just entering the total amount in A1?&nbsp; A:3 is first 100k, A:4 is next 100K, A:5 is next 150k. A:6 is greater than 400k.&nbsp; The total balance is 380k and the fee
 should be .44% and annual amount should be 1680.00, but I am not getting that.<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>The difference is that -50.00.<span>&nbsp; </span>Somewhere I have a mis-step in the excel calc..<span>&nbsp;
</span>Thanks.</font></span></p>
