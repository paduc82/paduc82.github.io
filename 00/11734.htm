    <title>Why can&#39;t I access my outlook account anymore with the same email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> olivia ott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I access my outlook account anymore with the same email address I signed up with for Office 365 which I ended the subscription for 2 weeks ago&#63;</h2>
                    I have a massive problem with my University email account which I don't seem to be able to access anymore.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After having tried the Office 365 home version for a month through my University account, I ended the subscription before end of the trial period without any problems, my email address continued working perfectly fine through outlook. All of a sudden,
 however, two weeks later, outlook.com refused to log me into my email account, saying that my email address is logged into Office 365 and that I should change that first. Obviously this is strange as I haven't even been using Office 365. So I logged onto Office
 365 and tried to change the email address into a different on, thinking my Uni email would go back to working then. However, this made the disaster even worse, as what I actually did apparently was changing the alias of that Uni email address. Microsoft won't
 let me change it back to the original version and I am still unable to access my email account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help me out here!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

                    <p>When I try to add my Outlook 365 account as a new account in Outlook 2010 it appears to successfully "establish network connection", then begins to "search for [email address] server settings".</p>

</p><p>It fails, stating that "an encrypted connection to your mail server is not available. Click Next to attempt using an unencrypted connection."</p>
<p>
</p><p>On clicking next, it starts searching for the settings (unencrypted), but that fails too, with the popup box renaming itself, "Problem Connecting to Server", and I'm given a choice between retrying and configurationg manually.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Calendar Slowdown Issues When Enabling Offline Cache - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dylanrvw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Calendar Slowdown Issues When Enabling Offline Cache</h2>
                    <p>When I turn on Offline Cached Mode to make browsing and opening emails faster, it makes my Calendar slowdown immensely. &nbsp;For example, when trying to send an invite today, it took nearly 20 minutes and Calendar was generally slow as I have many shared calendars
 and need them updated in real time. &nbsp;However, when I turn Offline Cache Mode off, it makes opening an e-mail take about 7 seconds which is very annoying. &nbsp;Is there not a way to make both of these things fast? &nbsp;It is annoying that it feels like I have to choose
 between fast e-mail opening and Calendar synchronization</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried doing manual Calendar updates and it didn't make it any better until I turned Offline Cache Mode back off. &nbsp;What can I do to make Outlook run quickly with both Email and Calendar retrieval? &nbsp;Can I cache calendars locally as well and force an
 shorter update interval time? &nbsp;I did not see an option to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span><span>Outlook 2016 caches email messages from the last 12 months by default. If there are
 too many messages saved offline, you may experience slowness when opening emails and calendars. Likewise, if you have too many Shared Calendars, this may also cause issues with the performance of Outlook 2016. To further assist you, we'd like to know the following:</span></span><span>

<h2>            Word 2010 - Headers and Footers move</h2>
                    <p>I have a stationery template set up by an outside vendor.&nbsp; The header has our logo and company name, which is an object, and the footer has an object with our locations and addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the blank template, and the cursor is at the top, if I hit enter, the cursor moves to the next line, but the header also moves down.&nbsp; If I move the cursor down a few lines (by locating it with the mouse) the header doesn't move.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I copy text into the body of the page, and it is more than will fit in the space between the header and footer, the footer moves to the bottom of the text, meaning it is not on the first page, but is on the last page of the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change the settings to "Different first page", when I copy and paste text into the document, all the copied text goes before the header, and the last page of the document shows the header and footer, but no text, and there is no header or footer on
 the previous pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to keep the header and footer in place?&nbsp; </p>

<p>It sounds like the "outside vendor" has not actually set up the information, that should be in the Header and Footer, in the actual header and footer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that you had paid to get this set up, you should take it up with the vendor, or at least ask for you money back.</p>

<p>That behavior indicates that the two objects you're calling a header and footer are actually anchored in the body of the document, not in the header pane and footer pane respectively, and formatted to position at the top and bottom of the page. That's why
 putting text or empty paragraphs into the document makes the objects move. To fix it:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Display and check the box for "Object anchors". This will cause an anchor icon to display in the left margin when an image or object is selected. It's important to know where the object is anchored! Also check the box for "Paragraph
 marks".</li><li>Open the template itself, using the File &gt; Open &gt; Browse dialog instead of double-clicking its icon.</li><li>Open the header pane, either by double-clicking near the top of the page or by clicking Insert &gt; Header &gt; Edit Header.</li><li>If the "Different first page" setting on the Header &amp; Footer Tools ribbon is unchecked, check it. You should see a dashed line across the page, with a "First Page Header" tag.</li><li>Close the header pane.</li><li>Click on the logo/company name object to select it. You may or may not see the anchor icon, but it's to the left of the first paragraph mark in the document body.</li><li>Cut the object to the clipboard.</li><li>Reopen the header pane, and paste the object from the clipboard. </li><li>Depending on how the vendor set the positioning of the object, it may appear in the same place as before. If it's out of place, right-click the object, click Size and Position in the menu, go to the Position tab of the dialog box, and change the settings
 there.</li><li>Close the header pane.</li><li>Repeat with the footer object: Select and cut it, open the footer pane, paste, and (optionally) reposition.</li><li>Save and close the template, and start a new document based on it. Confirm that the header and footer objects now appear only on the first page, regardless of how little or how much text you add.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you want the footer object also to appear on all the other pages, you'll need to edit the template again, temporarily add a page break (Ctrl+Enter) to create a second page, copy the footer object from the first page footer, and paste the copy into the
 footer on the second page. Then delete the page break and save the template.</p>

    <title>Need software for special email alerts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drakin030  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need software for special email alerts</h2>
                    I am a Network Administrator. I just recently got a Windows Mobile 6 device (AT&amp;T TILT) This replaced my Blackberry.<br />
<br />
One thing I need to desperatly get setup is alerts for specific email. Anytime our UPS or Blade Center has a problem I will get an email. The Blackberry forwarded this as a Level 1 message, and I recieved a different sound for that email. The goal was to wake
 me up if I was asleep.<br />
<br />
I need to accomplish this same thing with my Windows phone. I do not mind if I need to purchase software, I just cannot find anything that works. I tried some Phonealam software but that was horrid.
<br />
<br />
How can I recieve alerts based on the email?<br />

            It appears that this program does what Exchange ActiveSync already does, and that's push emails to my phone.
<br />
<br />
I would think Microsoft would add this feature for Network Admins. I have tried looking for 3rd party programs with no luck.<br />

                    <p>I have a new Dell computer and was checking through the Windows Defender settings. I noticed the Controlled Folder Access was set to OFF.
</p>
<p>All other settings were set to ON.&nbsp; Should the Controlled Folder Access be set to ON as well?&nbsp; Honestly, I don't even understand what it is. I just want it set to the proper setting. Thanks!</p>

<p><span>Controlled Folder Access, Network Protection, and Attack Surface Reduction all require Windows Defender’s real-time protection – so these features are most assuredly not being turned on by third-party AV apps, they’re being turned off by third-party
 AV apps – right along with Defender’s real-time protection. In Defender’s <strong>
Limited Periodic Scanning</strong> mode, these are the only features that will be disabled:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/windows-defender-exploit-guard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/windows-defender-exploit-guard</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p><span>Now I can’t say for sure that there won’t be any genuine issues with Controlled Folder Access – but the primary issue that we’re seeing now is just that users don’t know how to allow an app through Controlled Folder Access when they see the
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Unauthorized changes blocked</span> </strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">notification.</span> The TechNet and Windows IT Pro Center documentation does show us how to do this in the Windows Defender Security Center app:

</p><p>
</p><p><span>But there’s a shortcut that lets us do this without even opening the WDSC; and that shortcut is included in this Windows Support document:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you see an <strong>App is blocked</strong> message when you try to use a familiar app, you can simply unblock the app.&nbsp;If this message displays:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Write down or take note of the path of the blocked app.</li><li>Select the message, and then select <strong>Add an allowed app</strong>.</li><li>Browse for the program you want to allow access.</li></ol>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>When you get an <strong>Unauthorized changes blocked </strong>notification, just jot down the file path that’s provided there, and then click on the notification – and that will immediately bring up the
<strong>Allow an app through Controlled folder access </strong>window (and remove the notification). If the file path is truncated to the point where you can’t locate the app’s executable file in the Open (file) dialog; then open Event Viewer; navigate to the
 Windows Defender Operational log; and locate the blocking event (Event ID 1123):</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right-click on the Start button<strong> </strong>and select <strong>Event Viewer</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Navigate to <strong>Applications and Services</strong> <strong>
&gt;</strong> <strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Windows</strong>
<strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Windows Defender</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Operational
</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Filter for (or just look for): <strong>Event ID</strong> <strong>
1123</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Controlled Folder Access prevents ransomware from encrypting your personal files, so it’s definitely worth a try. Of course if you have fail-safe backups of everything, then you won’t need to depend on this feature. You’ll find some other tips
 on how to maximize Defender’s level of protection in this recent discussion:</span></span></p>

<h2>            Using VBA to set the Font for a Word document that will be loaded to the body of an email</h2>
                    
<p>My Word document is loaded with a module in Access and is modified through code.&nbsp; I want to be able to change the Font to one that will allow the columns to line up correctly, such as Courier New, when it is copied to the body of an email in Outlook.&nbsp; This
 is the section that takes the document to the email. Can this be done here?</p>
<p>With wrdApp.Selection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .WholeStory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Copy<br />
End With</p>
<p>olMessage.Body = wrdApp.Selection</p>
<p>olMessage.BodyFormat = olFormatRichText</p>
<p>olMessage.Display</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            what do you need it to be?&nbsp; since its a word document you can edit with code or manually.&nbsp; this code uses an existing document as a template &nbsp;(which in itself you can also make it a merge doc), why not just have the font already inbedded&nbsp; or set in the
 doc itself?

            I tried that but when the document is copied into the body of the email, it takes on the default font for Outlook, apparently, which is set as Arial.&nbsp; With Arial, the columns don't line up (like in a table).&nbsp; If I can make it change automatically to Courier
 or Courier New, the problem would be solved.

            with the code above there is no reason to copy into outlook, the code makes an email out of word opposed to creating an email in outlook.&nbsp; i have never seen a manual way to create word into a email, the code is the only way i know that turns a word document
 into an email.

<p>Thanks for trying.&nbsp; I found that if I recorded a macro while changing the font, I could use the resulting code to accomplish the task.&nbsp; These three lines were what was needed.</p>
<p>Selection.WholeStory</p>
<p>Selection.Font.NAME = "Courier New"</p>

<h2>            Feedback Hub-&#62;Alerts section. Does anybody have that working&#63; What is it &#40;intended&#41; for&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the new Feedback Hub having the ability to add comments and shows MS-Engineer responses. I find myself returning to something that I had abandoned many a month ago. I'm just wondering about the Alerts section. It's never worked for me (I did see an
 inkling of 'workability' briefly) as it always show "...download...error". So, I searched in both the FH and here. Can't find any info about this. Only a 100 or so reported it not working, all the rest of the 7M are either ok, apathetic, or know something
 I don't....figures</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Having to choose PC OR Phone is quickly&nbsp;becoming insufficient. If it not already is. I 'need'&nbsp;a 'Both'. UWP thinking s.v.p.</p>
<p>PPS Topics and apps? More topics please, or an 'Other' item?. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry, a bit late as I was busy, thanks for your info. Anyway, I wouldn't bother checking too often. It was the same when it was called the Insider Hub so this has been going from the very start. No doubt something they planned, and maybe are still planning,
 but has turned out&nbsp;not to be that important. Hey, if the future was known, how boring life would be |--)</p>

<p>Not sure what the Pros are. But the cons can mean you might need to reinstall from an ISO if things go bad which it seems many Insiders have had to do that.</p>

 would add that there might be crashes that wipe out everything on your computer and you should know how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>You should know what an ISO is and how to use it</p>

<p>What hawkeye said, only doubled.&nbsp; Do NOT use beta software on a primary or production computer.&nbsp; If you only have one device, you aren't equipped for beta testing and you should wait for each new version of Windows 10 to release to the public before using
 it.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>What are the pros and cons that a user gets when using windows insider program?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have already received the best in replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do it mainly because I can.&nbsp; I have at least 3 or 4&nbsp; PCs on the go.&nbsp; These are connected by Dropbox so my data is protected.&nbsp; I keep Insiders on my #2 PC so 2nd choice (production) and this allows me to follow Insiders.&nbsp; After each build, I create my own
 ISO for the latest build and keep at least 1 edition back, just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 18298, I am in the group that lost the screen so I had a 100% dead PC.&nbsp; The SSD W10 was basically fried, the PC worked fine with another HDD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to recover the PC, I just used Acronis to clone the fried SDD to the SDD on my #1 PC and that gave me a 100% copy of 17763.194 including all programs and data.&nbsp; I am no longer in Insiders until I see this bug fixed.&nbsp; My 2nd choice of recovery would
 have been a clean install of 17763 from a bootable USB in BIOS but this would have lost my programs and data.&nbsp; I had a simple recovery but I also had the goodies to do it.&nbsp;

<p>Microsoft does not give support for the Insider Builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you want to make a Disk Image of what you have now one of the Disk Image tools many Insiders use is Macrium Reflect you can find the free version at the link below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do a search for Free backup software you will find several more options.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To make an ISO or create a Public Installer USB key you can go to the link below. You just need to read all the help topics on that site and they will guide you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose the USB key method it first downloads the tool to create it and you will need a USB key empty or not.
</p>
<p>But it seems it needs to be 8 GB or larger.</p>
<p>If it has info you want to keep on it you need to buy a new USB key so you do not loose what is on the one you have as it will be reformatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also doing a Clean Install means selecting Keep Nothing. This way you will need to reinstall any of the&nbsp; Apps that are lost with a Clean Install so you should be prepared to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you should make a copy of all your Images/Photos and other documents to an external or removable device for safe keeping.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing it this way the Public build will need to do several Updates so you should Check for Updates a couple times before you Reinstall any Apps or Documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Guess it is possible to download an ISO of the Build you are on as I have seen Threads here about that. But an ISO of an Insider Build does not mean it will work any better than what you have now as it is
<p>
</p><p>Hope some of this helps.</p>

<h3> pete_k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 TP Build 9879 as a VMWare Workstation host hangs and crashes when shutting down or suspending VMs</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to build 9879, my Windows 10 TP Build 9879 system which I was use as VMWare Workstation host hangs when shutting down or suspending VMs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After hanging for a few minutes I then get a BSOD with a dpc watchdog timeout error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything worked fine on the previous TP builds and the problem only occurred after updating to build 9879. I'm using VMWare Workstation Jul 2014 tech preview but I've seen on other forums that the same problem occurs with VMWare Workstation 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue has been posted on the VMWare community forums&nbsp;<a href="https://communities.vmware.com/thread/495313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://communities.vmware.com/thread/495313</a>&nbsp;but I've not seen this posted on the Windows Insider forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else here experienced this or found a workaround? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone successfully using build 9879 as a VMWare Workstation host?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping the recent patch to build 9879 may have helped but it's made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand this a tech preview and this is a 3rd party application but I'd really like to continue with the tech preview on a machine I use daily rather then having to use it from within a VM. With no new builds due until 2015 I'm wondering whether I'll
 have to go back to Windows 8.1 and run the TP in a VM. I would have used Hyper-V but there's a couple of features I need that forces me to use VMWare Workstation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any response appreciated.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to mange &#35;EXT&#35; external users in O365&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We have a large user base and number of external users (#EXT#) i.e. username_domain#EXT# is increasing in our portal. As I understand it, it happens because of external sharing done with OneDrive/SharePointonline, my question is about managing these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Do these external users automatically go away once the sharing is disabled for those particular files?<br />
2) If sharing is not disabled, these users will stay in our O365 as long as files are shared with them or will they go away after sometime?</p>
<p>3) Does deleting these external users break their access to shared files?</p>
<p>4) What is MSFT recommended approach to clean up portal of this increasing number of external users?</p>
<p>5) Is it possible to see what particular documents are shared with these external users?</p>
<p>6) Is it possible to run a power shell script to find out external user creation date/time stamp so that we can quarterly cleanup?</p>
<p>7) Once I delete this external user, I am unable to delete them from recycle bin using powershell which throws an "object not found" error in recycle bin, which I can see is still in recycle bin, any ideas how to accomplish that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>

            <p>Hi Zak_cal,<br />
<br />
1) The external users will still show in the <strong>Active Users</strong> list and the
<strong>User Profiles</strong> list ( SharePoint admin center &gt; <strong>user profiles</strong>) after we stop sharing the particular file.
</p>
<p>We can also check the external users in People and Groups </p>
<p>https://<strong><em>domain</em></strong>.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/people.aspx?MembershipGroupId=0<br />
<br />
2) If sharing is not disabled, these users will stay in our Office tenant unless we delete them manually.<br />
<br />
3) Yes.<br />
<br />
4) If you don't want these external users to access the data in your tenant, it's recommended to delete them from both active users list and the user profiles list.<br />
<br />
5) There is no out of box option to achieve this.<br />
<br />
6) <br />
Connect-SPOService -Url https://<em><strong>domain</strong></em>-admin.sharepoint.com -credential $credential<br />
Get-SPOExternalUser -PageSize 50 | ft</p>
<p><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a7633c4-db6d-4834-97ea-2e031a3786ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a7633c4-db6d-4834-97ea-2e031a3786ba" /></a></p>
<p>7) Please try deleting the external user using the following commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>$user=Get-SPOExternalUser -Filter user_externaldomainname.onmicrosoft.com<br />
Remove-SPOExternalUser -UniqueIDs @($user.UniqueId)</p>

            <p>Hi Zak_cal,<br />
<br />
1. We should use the command like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -Force -removefromrecyclebin<br />
<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is not a valid UPN and can't be recognized in PowerShell.<br />
<br />
2. We can't list more than 50 items with the <strong>-pagesize</strong> parameter, the maximum value we can set is 50.
<br />
As a workaround, we can use the command below:<br />
<br />
Get-msoluser -all | Where-Object {$_.UserPrincipalName -like "*#ext#*"} | ft -auto &gt; d:\test\externalusers.csv<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
James</p>

            Same issue for me as described. What fixed it for me was to make sure the region and keyboard setting on my phone were the same, ie both set to United States.

<h2>            OneNote &#40;Windows 8.1&#41; importing OneNote &#40;Office 2010&#41; files</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just installed Windows 8.1, and I would like to import my OneNote files from Office 2010.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a MacBook with Parallels, and do not have Office 2010 installed on this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my previous PC's OneNote files on an external drive, and have copied these files to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know how I can import these OneNote Notebooks into the newer version of OneNote, supplied with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone shed some light on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Free version of Onenote can open notebooks which are shared via Onedrive.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile&#58; Wrong&#47;Incorrect Font in Cortana</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Microsoft Lumia 532 running on the latest build of Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently Cortana has been giving replies to me in a font other than Segoe UI (official Microsoft font).<br />
It appears to be Arial or MS Sans Serif. I have inserted a screenshot for reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried restarting the phone. The issue is too small to consider factory reset as an option.<br />
Can you suggest me a fix? Thanks!</p>

            <p>Even though it makes no difference whatsoever I looked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The font you&nbsp;have on your phone is not Segoe UI, it is Segoe WP, windows phone.</p>
<p>What you see as a difference is the font weight and is determined your selected text size or&nbsp;screen size.&nbsp; Segoe WP has these weights: Light, SemiLight, Regular, SemiBold, Bold, Black</p>
<p>
</p><p>Segoe, along with many others are Microsoft originated fonts. There is no one "official Microsoft font".</p>

            <p>Hello garym123</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I understand that there are different variations of the font.</p>
<p>I was getting the Segoe WP font itself before. Something changed in between.</p>
<p>The one I am getting now is not the same, even if you change the font weight.</p>
<p>I have personally checked it in Photoshop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have not tested with the text size variation.</p>
<p>It is worth a try. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Do Microsoft plan to disable 3rd party Start Menu Programs&#63; and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david-business user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do Microsoft plan to disable 3rd party Start Menu Programs&#63; and stop them working in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>The question arises because if you add entries to the Standard Start Menu Folders in the User's Profile they are not included in the User's Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they were present when Windows 10 9926 is installed (upgrade or changing the registry key to display the 9926 menu instead on the 9875 menu) they appear to be copied somewhere else and so are listed in the 9926 start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This prompts at least 2 questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Do standard Installations MSI and other still continue to update the Standard Start Menu Folders in the&nbsp;User's Profile?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What happens to the Start Menu Entries when&nbsp; an application is installed using an installation method which does not register as an installation to windows (just copies the files)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have time to investigate further, BUT would be very interested to hear from Start Menu developers.</p>

<li>Yes they do. Installers add stuff in my install of the tech preview</li><li>Well, if you copy/paste, and don't manually create a start menu entry, you don't get a Start menu entry. Simple as that. If nothing makes the entry, how would it appear?</li></ol>
<p>And as to the title of the thread... No, Microsoft doesn't block 3rd party Start Menus and never did. Developers just have to update their code to support the changes in Windows 10.</p>

<p>All that "experience" and this is what you come up with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know that any third party Start Menu can just read those folders themselves and display their contents? Whatever Microsoft's start menu does has no effect on them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed programs that don't use MSI, and therefore don't use system calls to create start menu shortcuts, and they have added content to the Start menu/screen just fine in 9926. I would check you don't have a bad install, and also realize that this
 is a BETA, far from finished, and there are plenty of bugs around this new Start menu. For some people, it doesn't even open. For me, on one install, I couldn't pin anything.</p>

            <p>I have done some more detailed investigation into the Start Menu question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is that I now believe that</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>9926 maintains its own files for the Start Menu </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BUT when you click on an entry it uses the Shortcut in the original start menu folders.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If this is the case 3rd Party Start Menus should continue to work BUT there are still questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>about how the Start Menu can be manually/programmatically &nbsp;updated by directly editing the folders.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I came to these conclusions by</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes prior to 9926 3rd party Start Menus could just read the folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All installations wrote their start menu entries into these folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed 9926 and went to add Internet shortcuts(weather, and various Newspapers etc&nbsp; as I find the internet versions of these sites must better and more than the Metro versions - I don't have a touch screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly I found that Explorer had lost the "Pin to Start Menu" options in the right click menu. "Pin to Taskbar" still exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I copied the Shortcuts manually into the Start Menus. </p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT they did not display in the 9926 Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if I modified the registry switch to switch back to the old 9879 menu they appeared</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting the registry switch to 9962 again they still appeared in the start Menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting entries in the Start Menu Folder did not change the Start Menu but the when clicked the link failed looking for the Shortcut, only to return when it was reinstated,</p>

            <p>Your're messing with the registry has messed up your install's ability to do things. On a clean install of 9926, I put a shortcut in the Start Menu folder and a few seconds later it appeared in the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original Start Menu folders are maintained for the Start menu. The 8.1 XML format is used for the Live Tiles you pin.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your conclusions are invalid. Please do a clean install and don't mess with the registry.</p>

            &nbsp;I see there's a beta version of Classic Shell that works with Windows 10.&nbsp; I haven't tried it with 10 yet, but I've been using Classic Shell with Windows 8.x since 1/22/13 and it's simply great.&nbsp; Since these folks are developing a version for 10, I'd
 say that's very positive news because MS seems hell bent and determined to mess up the Start menu.&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; They apparently haven't given up on what they tried to do with Windows 8 yet.

<h2>            Groove Music stuck &#34;Couldn&#39;t Sync&#34; since Creators update</h2>
                    <p>Not expecting any direct help for this judging by the history of other such issues in these forums BUT I did want to document what I've been seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>
<p>Groove music (10.17022.1030.0) on <strong>Win10 1607</strong> (Anniversary update) is able to synchronize &amp; matches the web player. -
<strong>Works</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Groove music (10.17042.1441.0) on <strong>Win10 1703</strong> (Creators Update) and on Win10 Mobile 1703 fails with "<strong>Couldn't sync</strong>" default message. -
<strong>Fails.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried many many things to fix, concluding it has to be an introduced client version error as old client works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full details</strong><strong>:</strong> I recently upgraded to a new PC &amp; when setting up Groove music I only got 5 of my 30+ playlists appearing in the app. The app was fully up to date (17.17042.1441.0) running on Windows 10 1703 Creators update
 not enrolled in any insider preview rings. I checked on my Surface Pro 4 tablet (Also 1703 but on Release Preview) running Groove (10.17042.1441.0) and my 950XL Mobile (1703, Release Preview, 10.17042.1411.0) all of which were reporting different numbers of
 total songs (including Onedrive, Local, Music pass). It looks like my Surface hasn't been updating for a number of weeks, possibly longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Among the steps I've taken include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstalling &amp; reinstalling Groove via Powershell</li><li>Clearing out the local cache database (from appdata\local\packages)</li><li>Renaming or deleting various playlists that might be stopping sync such as empty playlists</li><li>Renaming songs that might have odd characters in the name</li><li>Removing all OneDrive music from OneDrive to only include "safe" Groove music</li><li>Checking where syncronisation stopped on the new PC to try and identify possible song or artist that is tripping over sync</li><li>Attempting to read client settings / data from packages folder</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>None of these things made a difference &amp; then this morning I found that an older tablet I use in the kitchen which has got stuck on the Anniversary Win10 update and so is on an older version of Groove (10.17022.1030.0) is still able to synchronize correctly
 &amp; perfectly matches the Groove web player. I can even update or rename playlists etc... and they all reflect back to online &amp; vice-versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to conclude that there is an issue either with the Groove client that was introduced post 10.17022.1030.0 or in combination with the Creators Update OS version. Either way I'm unable to synchronize and play my music correctly. I'm loathed to
 ring support as I know it will just lead to hours of pain where they attempt to get me to re-set all of my music data which I do not indent to do. I've got 5+ years worth of music in my collection &amp; playlist creation. Given there is zero way to preserve, backup
 or import this data again I will not be resetting it all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just posting this here in-case anyone else has noticed a similar issue with the latest clients to add weight to my theory &amp; also on the off chance that one of the very helpful MS employees (Not directly support) spot it and could shed some light on if this
 is an acknowledged issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wish list for these type of issues would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some detail about what the error is
<ul>
<li>Even if this is in a local log file!</li></ul>
</li><li>Ability to export / import playlists / collection data so that I could reset without loosing everything</li><li>Better ability to search this forum for similar issues
<ul>
<li>i.e. filter by date, keep getting lots of 2015 threads which obviously aren't valid now</li></ul>
</li><li>Better support options ;)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; congrats if you waded this far though :)</p>

<p>In further work on this / testing I've now successfully managed to break OneDrive integration with Groove :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved my 18GB of music files to another folder, deleted the original "Music" and let Groove online re-create it. After a pause to allow things to settle down I copied the original songs back into the folder but Groove online wont read any of them &amp; the
 "Working" client still sees all the old music details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah well</p>

<p>So I've not got the music back into OneDrive and showing in Groove web player...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Moved all the folders / mp3s from "Music" OD folder into a new folder, deleted "Music" folder, opened webplayer &amp; waited 24 hours to confirm OD music had been removed. Clicked the OD link and it created a new "Music" folder in OD. Copied original music
 back in folder by folder confirming that online was registering them as music files (Originally just moving the files back resulted in them not being recognised)</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT</p>
<p>
</p><p>Online shows that I have 2363 songs in my OneDrive collection. That folder is syncronised to my local PC, Groove on my PC is searching that folder &amp; it only shows 2291 songs!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed MusicBee portable &amp; got it to scan the same local folder, low and behold it too also found 2363 songs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something very messed up going on behind the scenes here.</p>

<p>I started the arduous process of going through the help system. After several online chats, I went to the MS Store just to speak to someone in person.&nbsp;They were&nbsp;attentive and very friendly&nbsp;but unable to help directly. They escalated my&nbsp;ticket up to Tier
 2 of 3. For the last two weeks now I've been in contact with an MS engineer but there has been no solution yet, just requests for further clarifications or screenshots. Also, I pointed him to this thread several times to alert them I'm not the only one experiencing
 this. My understanding is that my issue has been handed over to a server team to see how they can rectify my account issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I post if anything is resolved or changes. In the meantime, I've been looking for a way to kindly request a refund for&nbsp;this month's&nbsp;Groove subscription. Interestingly, I have yet to find anyone to contact about this and every engineer I talk to is unable
 to help. </p>

            Have you tried the fast ring build app? curious to see if that fixes it. i think MS had the 3-month groove give away just in time - probably will take them that long to fix this issue!&nbsp;

<p>I fixed my issue, but it really isn't a fix. Within the groove app under settings i clicked on Reset, which removes all music, playlists, etc (basically nuking my music). I then when into the settings app, and then reset the application. Now it syncs perfectly
 (and no longer get the "couldn't sync") error, however, I have to rebuild all of my playlists from scratch. good thing I have my spotify account to help re-build this. ugh. what a pain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>not sure if it's worth it, but wanted to let you know that it now syncs after nuking your groove music.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Disable working&#47;editing in certain cells</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a general idea of what I have in Excel:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>Work here only</td>
<td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>Don't work here, skip</td>
<td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>Work here only</td>
<td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>Don't work here, skip</td>
<td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>Work here only</td>
<td>
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>What I'd like is to "disable" the other cells from being selected and accidentally worked in. I realize that deleting the other cells or hiding them is an option, though I have it set up with pictures and so I need the other cells for sizing, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, when someone works in the cell and hits enter, they skip unwanted cells and head to ONLY the next cell that I want them to. Is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>This is a slightly convoluted process :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default all cells in an excel worksheet have a <strong>Locked</strong> property applied, but it has no effect unless sheet protection is used. What you first need to do is select the cells which you want to remain editable then go to
<strong>Format&gt; Cells - Protection</strong> to clear the <strong>Locked</strong> checkbox. Afterward, use the
<strong>Protect Sheet</strong> tool on the <strong>Review</strong> tab [or go to <strong>
Tools&gt; Protection&gt; Protect Sheet</strong>] to clear the check for <em><strong>Select locked cells</strong></em> as well as make any other preferred settings adjustments. (Note that if you do not use a password anyone can turn the protection off.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Navigation will be the standard left-to-right, top-to-bottom pattern but only selecting the cells which are not locked. Likewise, the user cannot directly select any locked cells.</p>

            This generally happens when you have got a previous Office version installed on your computer. Hence, you will need to uninstall the previous version using Fix IT tool. You may be required to repair your existing Office installation after this.
