<h2>            Exporting adrees book from an outlook Hotmail adress book to an IMAP&#47;SMTP account with Optus</h2>
                    <p>I have recently downloaded Office 365 2016 Home into Windows 10 on my PC. I have an Outlook Hotmail account which is exchange Active Syn with my address book and contacts. My other account which is linked is an optusnet.com.au account which is IMAP/SMTP.
 I have no contacts in my Optus account and I therefore want to duplicate my address book in my Optus account by importing contacts from my Outlook&nbsp; Hotmail address book. I am not sure on file format of the address lists so would appreciate steps I have to
 take to achieve this. Optus is my main account and Internet service provider.</p>
<p>I am also unable to create a "new contact group." Under "My Contacts," I select "Contacts" and all of my contacts are listed in my Hotmail address book.&nbsp; However, the "New Contact Group" option is greyed out.&nbsp; Pleases advise how I should setup my profile
 so that I can Create a contact Group. I understand that it is not possible to establish in a Hotmail account however why can’t I establish it in a IMAP type account. Is it because I have linked my Optus IMAP account to my Hotmail account.</p>

            <p>What do you mean by "I have linked my Optus IMAP account to my Hotmail account."..........?</p>
<p>In MS Outlook you would under normal circumstances have both the Hotmail and Optus accounts set up.</p>
<p>The Hotmail being EAS and the Opus being IMAP</p>

            Yes they are both set up in Outlook 2016. If I send an email from my optus email I can access the contact from the hotmail addressbook. Accounts &nbsp;are synchronised. When using my optus email I can press send/receive and have emails from all email sources
 . I just want to know the method of importing contacts from an EAS to an IMAP addresss book. I I also want to know if a group email can be set up in the IMAP contact list which is at present empty. I have found that a Team email can be set up in quick steps.
 I am not very computer literate so any advice would be appreciated.&nbsp;<br />

            I have a excel csv file with my contacts on . If I were to import these contacts ino my IMAP Optus account what would be the correct Custom Fields to enter since I had incorrect custom fields when I did not amend them. Also is it best to unlink my Optus
 account from my EAS hotmail account when I do this? My main email account is Optus and I really only need my optus accomt as a back up.

            <p>Thanks for info. Not being computer literate it seems a complicated process to me. Basically my contacts in my EAS outlook account were put there by a Microsoft techie who took control on my computer. I only ever use my IPAP Optus account with my friends
 and have no real desire to use a Hotmail account which is there as an emergency webmail back up. Would it be best therefore if I unlinked and unsynchronised my IPAP Optus account from my EAS Hotmail account. If I did this I assume I could not access my address
 book from Hotmail when using Optus I therefore need to get my address book into my IMAP account.&nbsp; I can follow instructions on how to import a CSV file into my Optus account however I am not sure on how to map Custom Fields in both columns. I am loath to do
 anything that will lose my address contacts. I am just a bit fed up with Outlook 2016 being so difficult. Live Mail was easy to handle. At the moment with linked accounts I cannot even load new individual contacts into my Optus account.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Search only searches my Sent Items</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue with Outlook 2016 on my Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>Every time I search for an email sent by another person by typing in their name, it seems to only show emails that I have sent where the name has been mentioned.</p>
<p>So far I have tried rebuilding the search index, changing the options so that searches look in all mailboxes (not just current mailbox or current folder), and letting it idle for a few hours so that it can index any new items.</p>
<p>But my problem still continues to plague me. It's difficult to find an email when you get dozens every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any nudge towards a solution for this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just purchased 2016 Microsoft Office 365. &nbsp;When saving documents, the extension is always hidden. I can manually change....but this is a hassle. &nbsp;I see that other people have said that this was corrected with update 15.14, but I have 15.31 and still have
 this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

    <title>Build 10162- stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmt50  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10162- stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Anyone else had this problem?</p>
<p>This build installed fine and worked ok to start with.</p>
<p>Now, no apps will open, when I try to start the Edge browser I get a white flash across the screen and then IE starts to open.</p>
<p>If I try to open any other apps such as insider hub, feedback, notifications, store, games all I get is a flash of white across the screen then nothing.</p>
<p>Clicking on the new start button results in the button changing colour/shade then nothing. The only way I could close down/switch back to win 8&nbsp;was to use ctrl/alt/delete as start button just didn't work. I get NO error messages.</p>
<p>Do I delete and reinstall from scratch or is there something in the pipeline to fix this?</p>

<h2>            Changing dates with Macros in Word</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have 2 questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Is it possible to add 3 months to the current date and display it with a macro?</p>
<p>- Is it possible to let the date notation language differ per document? (For example, on an english offer the month will be 'May' instead of</p>
<p>'Mei' in the Dutch offer.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            In the Dutch regional settings in control panel, your list separator character is probably set to ";", whereas the field codes assume "," (the separator is used inthe {=} fields). Change , to ; in the { = } field codes and you should be OK. For internationalisation,
 you will need a bit more.

            You can do this with fields rather than macros, and the format will be determined by the language applied to the field - see Paul Edstein's excellent document on data calculations at

<h3> marekhalfar  say:</h3>
<h2>            EOP content filtering of specific file types &#40;i.e. CAD data&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>we currently run o365 tenant with E3 lic plan and we have a requirement to filter email attachments based on file type (not only file extension). For example we have to block all outgoing email with CAD data attached.
</p>
<p>I get it that EOP can't do filtering based on content inspection here because not all CAD data files are supported...am I right?</p>
<p>As a workaround I've tried to setup a mail flow rule for emails with attachments that can not be inspected with action to route it to connector to our on prem mail gateway (Cisco Ironport) which is capable of such advanced&nbsp;filtering based on content inspection
 for "Magic Bits". But I can not make the rule to work for some reason.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest a solution how to either block such file types if possible or&nbsp;how to properly workaround this like I mention above?</p>

<p>Hi Marek,</p>
<p>Firstly, your understanding is right. By creating rules (Go to Office 365 portal &gt; Admin &gt; Admin Centers &gt; Exchange &gt; mail flow &gt; rules), you can block emails based on file extensions while EOP can't identify contents like all CAD data files. To make our
 products and services better for you and others, we suggest you provide feedback via the following link:<br />

<p>For the workaround, to get more dedicated support and benefit others with the same concern, please post a new thread in our forum with the detailed information about the rule. For example, how was&nbsp;the rule set on Office 365 and configured on the on-pre mail
 gateway (Cisco Ironport)?</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding.</p>

            This is a massive dealbreaker for me. I can trim down my list, but to what number? I migrated my e-mail from gmail to Hotmail with the idea of seamless integration with Windows 8, Outlook.com, and eventually a Windows 8 phone. But today I realized that
 the "People" list wasn't including everyone. How it chose who to include and who to leave behind, I have no idea. That Microsoft wouldn't state this up front is a huge faux paux.

<p><span>Please be informed you that have a maximum number of 1500 contacts&nbsp;that you can add in your People page. We don't have a way to determine which members do not get updated if you are trying to add contacts that are more than the said limit. We advise
 that you clean up your contacts and combine those users who have multiple contact details from your old account.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            Microsoft should prominently post this limitation while working to expand that number. I'm at 1,250 contacts, but the Outlook.com overpopulated my list with duplicates to over 10,000 that I can't delete.
<div><br />
<div>If Microsoft is serious about competing with Apple and Android with a "seamless user experience," they need to get this fixed before the new Windows 8 phones are released. Who knows how to fix this contacts problem? Anyone?</div>

            "Clean up contacts" only allows three names at a time to be "cleaned up" and I have about 8,500 extra contacts. Second, after "removing duplicates" they still remain. Third, these contacts are nt syncing at all with my local contacts. Microsoft has a serious,
 serious problem here and so far it seems has no idea on how to deal with it. Please, please, please read prior notes before commenting.

            I agree, this is a significant issue for those of us who would like to use outlook.com as our&nbsp;consolidated&nbsp;(primary) personal management center. There are so many positive steps for Microsoft...steps that make it a legitimate option as the preferred ecosystem;
 however, these types of surprises give pause.&nbsp;

            <p>
<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thanks for asking!
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>The purpose of Both Silverlight and Adobe (Flash / Shockwave player) is to support Browser based videos and games or simple website interactive (Flash) content.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>However both software, have their own different coding and functionality. Hence no same video / interactive content created respectively will be supported on or by both platforms.
 Hence, there is no conflict between Silverlight and Adobe.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Now to answer your questions,
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Yes! It is necessary to have both software’s installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>As a Windows 7 user, you might come across a need to navigate to the Microsoft website, probably to,
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>a. How to videos
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>b. Check latest software updates / releases</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>c. Explore options on our latest/newly releases product.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Since, Silverlight is a Microsoft product all of Microsoft's sites are supported by Silverlight. You may not be able to navigate or view necessary content without Silverlight/ Silverlight
 Plug-in being installed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Silverlight is also adopted by various other Organizations, namely Netflix to support online video streaming.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Silverlight is necessary for / Hotmail / Sky drive / webcam applications / MSN / Hardware acceleration on video clarity..Etc.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Adobe also, has its uses and benefits when it comes to supporting content in browsers and provides various support options, in terms of opening Online pages with Adobe reader / Adobe
 PDF handler, basically any content supported by Adobe which is installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Not to mention Adobe flash player for sites like Youtube.com</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Also to conclude, both the software’s are supported by multiple browsers as well as operating systems to provide optimal user support.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Please let me know if you have any further questions or queries.</span></p>
<p>

Hi,<br />
I was contemplating uninstalling Silverlight.<br />
Now I know I'd better not.<br />
This is exactly the answer to the simple questions, "What does it do?" and "What won't work with out it?" that I needed.<br />
I'm sure many people as well as me must be looking for this information.<br />

                    <p>Hello - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Excel spreadsheet that I have created a button/ActiveX control to send the current opened file in an email as an attachment. I have got the new email window (Outlook) to open&nbsp;and the file to attach ok with the below code. Now what I would like
 to do is insert an email address in the To: field, add a Subject line and a message in the body of the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize I may have taken an incorrect approach to this in calling the new email window and attaching the file (hence this post). It seems to work though. I just cant figure out how to add the To, Subject and message to the email, and then maybe have it
 automatically send? Any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>

    <title>Unable to publish InfoPath form to SharePoint online site. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rzkalva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to publish InfoPath form to SharePoint online site.</h2>
                    <p>I have created an InfoPath form for one of the clients which has subscription to O365. When I try to publish the form to the site it asks me for credentials repeatedly. The screenshot for the same is as per below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3fa60c13-e4d1-4a22-a683-42fb62813b12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3fa60c13-e4d1-4a22-a683-42fb62813b12" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I try to publish the same form to another SharePoint online site, it publishes successfully. Observing the popup of the credential it seems the SharePoint on premise popup. The site is not configured for the SSO as I am able to open the site from
 the browser in another location. What could be the issue ?</p>

</p><p>We recently had a really <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_infop-mso_other/infopath-2013/b4ad3e8e-27f8-4ca3-98eb-931964ec575a">
similar case</a> with the same behavior as yours, and after further investigation it is solved by enabling legacy authentication on his tenant, so we suggest running the PowerShell command to enable it on your tenant.</p>

<h2>            Can I have a messaging item marked as read from the Notification&#63;</h2>
                    I get a new text message or email, get the notification, can read it in it's entirity, especially if it's an SMS. Yet to clear the number of uinread items in the messaging app, I need to go in and open up the message. Very annoying.
<br />
I'd like to be able to dismiss the notification AND have the item marked as read, preferably at the same time.<br />
<br />
Do I have any options?

If you stll want to do this with a validation rule, I think this is what you want to place in the ValidationRule property:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like "ISBN # ## ###### #" Or Like "ISBN # ### ### ###" Or Like "ISBN # ### ### ### ###"</p>

I downloaded your database.&nbsp; Where did you try putting the revised validation rule?&nbsp; I see the original, incorrect validation rule in the table, BooksAndMedia.

            Yeah, that is a nice workaround, but is a valid ISBN showing up an error message at your end as well?

<p><br />
Nope, the example valid ISBN you posted works fine for me in the database I downloaded, with the simpe correction of the validation rule that I posted.&nbsp; And invalid ones -- at least, obviously invalid ones -- are rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where and how did you implement my suggestion?&nbsp; If you also have code in the text box's events -- not present in the database you posted on SkyDrive -- that may possibly have its own issues.&nbsp; However, no code is needed if you use the validation rule.</p>

            I upgraded my maps a few weeks ago, but it wasn't an upgrade like I imagined. Now I still have 2006 maps but I guess there are new versions of old maps with some bugs fixed...<br />
<br />
If I want the 2008 maps, I have to pay of course...

    <title>Daily Random Error -3170 with IMAP email accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markjdrummer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Daily Random Error -3170 with IMAP email accounts</h2>
                    I have been using Microsoft Outlook 2011 on my MacBook Pro for a few months now. &nbsp;I have a handful of email accounts set up on it. &nbsp;In the beginning, all were POP accounts. &nbsp;A month or two back, I converted a couple of them along with my Gmail account
 to IMAP. &nbsp;The Gmail account is working fine with no errors. &nbsp;The other two IMAP accounts hosted by GoDaddy work fine about 99% of the time, but I get a handful of -3170 errors at random times daily. &nbsp;I can't seem to find any sort of pattern or triggers for
 these errors. &nbsp;So again, these email addresses work in Outlook almost all the time fine, but a few times daily I'll get these errors, and then it goes back to normal. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>So far, the steps I've taken to resolve this are:</b>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've checked the DNS settings and they're working well. &nbsp;</div>
<div>All of the account information for both email addresses has been checked a number of times and are correct in Outlook. &nbsp;</div>
<div>I've contacted GoDaddy to check the email accounts and servers which checked out OK according to their tech support.</div>
<div>I've contacted Uverse (our ISP) to confirm that our broadband signals are clean which they are.</div>
<div>I've asked Uverse to confirm that the ports required were open and that they weren't closing during the day which they say they are not.</div>
<div>I've replaced the Uverse gateway with a new updated version.</div>
<div>I've deleted both email accounts from Outlook and re-entered the information.</div>
<div>I've uninstalled MS Office 2011 and Re-installed it</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After doing all of this, I continue to get this -3170 error a few times daily and it seems like those email accounts are not able to sync, send or receive emails for a few minutes until it comes back up. &nbsp;During this time, my internet and wifi connection
 is fine. &nbsp;In fact, I've set up the same email addresses in Mac Mail and when Outlook has this hiccup, Mac Mail is still connected to these email addresses like normal. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not really sure what my next steps should be to troubleshoot this error, but they're making me crazy. &nbsp;Below is the setup I'm running. &nbsp;Thanks in advance for any help. &nbsp;If I've forgotten any details, feel free to let me know and I'll be glad to provide
 any other info I can.</div>

    <title>lag between slides - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack-c  say:</h3>
<h2>            lag between slides</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a powerpoint 2010 presentation which I gave last year and am scheduled to give again in two days. I made a few changes, including re-doing the theme master. But now when I run the new pptx presentation, there is a notable lag between certain slides.
 (I do not have slide transitions enabled.)<br />
I thought of hardware issues, of course, but it&nbsp; lags equally on my laptop and my desktop. Both are pretty decent machines, and it didn't do it last year.<br />
<br />
The lag always happens after a slide with a lot of bulleted material on it, which is animated with "appear" only. That is, the bullets appear just fine with each click, but after clicking the last bullet, I can't advance the slide with another click.&nbsp; I don't
 know if it's a time thing, or if my clicking it a few more times gets the next slide loaded. I suspect it's something do with my animation.<br />
<br />
I animated the theme master in slide master with "appear". So when look at the theme master with animation tab open, I see this:<br />
0 outside of the shape or text box for the bullets<br />
1 next to the first bullet<br />
2 next to the sub-entry under the first bulleted&nbsp; line<br />
2 next to all of the other sub-entries<br />
<br />
I will try to post on a file sharing site the image of the animation of the theme master:<br />

            <p>Thank you, Geetesh. I see what you are saying. I did something more complicated.It seems in constructing my slide master theme (using shapes, fill, sending the shapes to back and front, etc, I ended up animating one of the shapes by&nbsp; mistake. Once I rebuilt
 my theme master, the problem was solved. </p>
<p>I was really baffled and was desperate for some advice.</p>
<p>I appreciate your input. I guess there is a reason most people use those pre-constructed themes!</p>

<h2>            word-Page layout-Margins does not work.  Talked to a Word instructor.  She said, &#34;delet it and reload it&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>It has become impossible to use the Microsoft Word program.</p>
<p>The cursor resides at the top of the page.&nbsp; When I try enter to move it down to the next line, it goes to the bottom of the page.&nbsp; I tried to go to page lauout and install a new margin template.&nbsp; That does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last time I looked at the program, the page came up looking a lot like Excel with cells simular to Excel all over the page.&nbsp; I tried opening a new page.&nbsp; It opened in the same format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I have a virus that just attacks Microsoft Word?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My secretary taught Microsoft Word.&nbsp; I took my laptop to the office and had her take a look at it.&nbsp; She told me that I should delete Word and reload it from the disk.&nbsp; I would be happy to do that, but I run the risk that Microsoft may not allow me to reload
 it from the disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really need the use of the program because I have a lot of articles that Ihave to write.&nbsp; I am stuck using Works.&nbsp; This seems to slow down my progress substancially.</p>

<p>Information on box implies 1 year technical support.&nbsp; I called support and they told me that I only had 3 months support.&nbsp; Also if you would like to do a go to meeting with me on my computer, I am open to that.</p>

1. The header &amp; footer areas (or white space) may be&nbsp; hidden.&nbsp; To get them to show once more, move the cursor toward the edge of the "paper" (white input area) until you see the message "Double click to show white space".&nbsp; For more information, see
<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The page vertical alignment may be set wrong.&nbsp; Click the page layout tab's dialog launcher arrow (lower right) &gt; Layout tab.&nbsp; Set the page vertical alignment to<span style="font-style: italic"> top.</span><br />
<br />
3. One possibility is that you are seeing the page grid.&nbsp; To get rid of it, go to the View tab and clear the box before Gridlines.&nbsp; Another possibility is that a full page table has been saved in your normal.dotm template.&nbsp; You can open&nbsp; normal.dotm and delete.
 To get to normal.dotm, click&nbsp; File &gt; Open &gt; (Microsoft Word) Templates.&nbsp; Double click Normal.dotm.&nbsp; Delete the table from the open file.<br />
<br />
4. While you are in the normal template, be sure that the settings mentioned above are as you want them for new documents.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; Formatting problems like these cannot be solved by uninstalling and reinstalling Word or Office. That's because uninstalling Word/Office does not delete user files where these settings and preferences reside.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the my suggestions don't solve the problems,
 renaming normal.dotm so that Word can create a new clean one should do it.&nbsp; Post back&nbsp; and let us know if you need more help.<br />

            Absolutely true. I would go absolutely crazy if my songs were out of order and if the phone ignored the track tag. This tells me your music's tagging is wrong in Zune. Double-check that and make any changes you need to.<br />
<br />
There is a bug I've seen, but it's in the Zune software on Windows, and not on the phone: In the collection&gt;Music&gt;Songs view (the view that shows all your music as one big list), Zune ignores the disc tag when sorting the list by album, causing multi-disc albums
 to display tracks as 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, etc. I just can't use that view because of that. Thankfully, this doesn't affect the phone.<br />
