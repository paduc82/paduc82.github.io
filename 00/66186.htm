<p>I sure haven't. I haven't even bought the game yet, and I won't until I hear news of Mega Man as downloadable content. I really want to know what went through Capcom's heads when they thought it was okay to leave Mega Man out and only include Zero.</p>

<p>Capcom is prolly busy polishing up Street Fighter X Tekken.</p>
<p>Cable as a DLC would make my day. It's too bad they removed fun characters like Servbot and Roll. I mean seriously Tatsunoko Roll was a great character. Not top tier, but she's got some nifty OTG combo's.</p>

<p>I read somewhere that they wanted to do Silver Surfer but they couldn't think of a good way to include his board. I think either of these ideas would be suitable:</p>
<p>1) Surfer is constantly on his board (hovering slightly off the ground like MODOK).</p>
<p>2) Surfer is on his feet but when he super jumps, and in some of his special moves/hyper combos, the board flies in to be used.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get brother printer driver to install to 64 bit windows 8 &#40;kernal-mode error&#41;</h2>
                    I am having the same problem listed in this string: 

<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/brother-mfc-j835dw-all-in-one-printer-kernel-mode/dfe365d5-8cc6-4b08-9fbb-ba9cc51e6396">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/brother-mfc-j835dw-all-in-one-printer-kernel-mode/dfe365d5-8cc6-4b08-9fbb-ba9cc51e6396</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a windows 8 computer that is about 3 months old (not a computer that was upgraded, it came with windows 8 &amp; has gotten all windows updates since.&nbsp; I have added some software but not changed the operating system.&nbsp; I had been using an HP printer that
 worked fine until the printer itself broke last week.&nbsp; So, I got a new printer (a Brother MFC-J4410DW) and cannot get the driver to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1) I tried installing the driver/software with the Windows 8 driver&nbsp;from the Brother website (downloading the file&nbsp;&amp; then clicking the file to unzip + run... also tried simply clicking the .exe file located&nbsp;in the unzipped files on another attempt)&nbsp;using
 a USB connection.&nbsp; The install froze at the point it asked for me to connect the printer and wouldn't move to the next screen... forever waiting to "connect."&nbsp; I tried different ports, different cords, etc.&nbsp; Although the install would not complete I did verify
 through the devices screens that the computer was seeing a scanner attached via that port, but not a printer.&nbsp; The scanner, tho listed, would not work.&nbsp; After using their uninstall tool and retrying a few times I figured I'd try to get around that by setting
 up a wireless connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I successfully&nbsp;connected the&nbsp;printer to my wireless network from the panel on the printer.&nbsp; I used the windows 8 driver from the brother site and ran the install as a wireless one (instead of USB).&nbsp; The device was recognized on the network so the install
 proceeded, but before it completes (have done this multiple times, uninstalling it each time and with all my firewalls, antivirus, etc off)&nbsp; it produces a windows "kernel-mode" error that the printer driver cannot install because it's not compatible with my
 op system&nbsp;and to contact the manufacturer.&nbsp; Each time, the drivers for the fax, scanner, etc all install but not the *printer* driver.&nbsp; Brother has an install check in its utilities and it always shows the successful install of all but the printer driver and
 suggests I uninstall and try again.&nbsp; I have, many times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Then, I tried installing the printer through the windows 8 "add a printer" function and it does not see the device when connected via USB as a printer able to be set up so I get nowhere fast (it does still see&nbsp;it as a&nbsp;scanner).&nbsp; However, when it's connected
 to my wireless system it shows as an available printer device but the status is "driver is unavailable" so it's not a printer I can print to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) I called brother and spent time with their support team, got escalated, and was told that they have heard of this error but that it's not something they can help with as it in an operating system error.&nbsp; They said that many windows 8 computers work just
 fine with their windows 8 driver so it must be something in my specific system that is messed up.&nbsp; I pushed the issue since I bought a fresh computer with windows 8, have not modified it and have gotten all windows updates so I see no reason my install would
 be an "unlucky" one (plus my old printer worked fine), but they insist their drivers work on most windows 8 computers and said I need Microsoft to fix my operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not try running a windows 7 driver in compatibility mode, but since they guy on the thread mentioned he had done that plus everything I have done and did not have success with that I'm not confident it will work and don't really understand the process
 so don't really want to waste more time trying that one.&nbsp; His last post said he suspects his problem stems from the fact that he was using a computer that had been upgraded to windows 8 so he was going to try a fresh install in hopes that would work.&nbsp; That
 doesn't seem to&nbsp;apply to me nor would I know how to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

<p><span>Hi Christie,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description, I understand that Brother MFC-J4410DW is not working with your Windows
 8 computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. What is the exact \ complete error message?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to install the driver in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Download the latest drivers from the Manufacturer’s website

You can follow the link given below to install the driver in compatibility mode.</p>

            <p>As an FYI to other who stumble upon this thread, I tried every option I could find&nbsp;(including those above) before trying the clean install other threads recommend&nbsp;since that was something I didn't want to take on, myself.&nbsp; I had an uber techie windows expert
 come and spend three hours trying everything, then doing the clean install and when that still didn't work he upgraded to a more powerful version of Win 8 to see if he could get more control over things since nothing was working (the back end settings were
 more restrictive then other versions).&nbsp; That didn't work either.&nbsp; And, I kid you not, this guy doesn't get stumped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I eventually gave up and moved the printer to my office where I still have win 7... and it works flawlessly. Seeing as how Brother told me it's an issue they had heard from numerous Win 8 users (but don't think is across the board... not sure how they know...)
 I'm of the opinion that it'll be up to Brother to create something that works right and hope that they do so.&nbsp; I did get an e-mail from them&nbsp;this week&nbsp;saying they have an updated&nbsp;option available&nbsp;(connected to my support&nbsp;call) but didn't follow up since it's
 no longer pertinent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, until Brother updates their drivers (which hopefully they are now doing)&nbsp;I'd not waste too much time trying to make your printer be compatible with win 8.</p>

            Right. If your Brother printer doesn't work for what you purchased it for, or they make life too difficult for you, return it. I'm a big fan of that option.<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have multiple Clientele that have asked me to look into this since Brother insists that they cannot return them once the box is open and Brother will not grant RMA's since they blame Microsoft.&nbsp; TechNet Forum informs me that Microsoft does not concur
 with this assessment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, I have been looking into this for a couple of weeks with a printer one of my Clients abandoned here in disgust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have the exact same problem. I have 3 Brother MFC 9560 cdw printers in my business. (Commercial Real Estate)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We tried 2 Asus and one Toshiba computer on ALL THREE. All three laptops are running Windows 8. We had Brother tech. look at this remotely and they were unable to get the drivers installed and the printers to work. During the driver download there is&nbsp;message
 asking you to connect the printer to the computer. We either received error messages or the installation process simply stalled.&nbsp;They tried for two hours and spoke with&nbsp;a Microsoft consultant.&nbsp;With all three laptops the laptops crashed and gave an error message&nbsp;when
 the printers&nbsp;were connected to the laptops. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brother tech support&nbsp;also gave us the run-around stating&nbsp;that it was the individual laptop/windows 8 configuration causing this. Clearly this is not true. There is a major connectivity and compatibility &nbsp;issue between Windows 8 and Brother printers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are highly irritated with this waste of time and energy. Clearly there is&nbsp;a major&nbsp;issue. AVOID THESE PRINTERS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily for us we bought all three printers at Costco. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are about a year old but Costco have said they&nbsp;will take them back. (I am not sure what they do with them but&nbsp;hopefully they&nbsp;send them back to the supplier)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our thanks to Costco.</p>

            <p>I bought a Dell XPS. tried to hook up a brother 7860dw. no luck the drivers updated in my computer and the printer doesn't print.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>tried the same thing with an HP P1006. no luck there either. all my windows 7 computers have no problem with the printers.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not real familiar with Brother Printers, but they might suffer from the same type of problem as HP Printer Software....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you just run the installer,&nbsp;compatibility mode or not, it will fail....</p>
<p>This is because the installer is a self extracting file, and setting the compatibility of the extractor part of the installer has no effect on the installers that are inside....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a HP, you can use the OEM disk, open it, and set the compatibility of Setup, Install, or whatever.</p>
<p>The problem is that HP uses several installer applications and some times a Windows Installer...</p>
<p>You need to set them ALL ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It using a downloaded driver\software, you may need to manually&nbsp; extract the installer to a folder so that you can get to the more important installers inside....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary point being... look for ALL applications and\or Windows Installers on the CD or the Downloaded files...And set their compatibility to Win 7 or maybe even XP SP3...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IMPORTANT.... REMOVE your printer and or scanner from your computer in DEVICES and PRINTERS before uninstalling and reinstalling the software... Driver installation might fail even with the correct drivers\software if this step is missed...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disconnect it from the computer, and start like it is the very first attempt to install.... Don't hook anything up until instructed to by the wizard</p>
        </p>

 to install the printer on several devices left me with the ability to scan in Win 8 but no printer recognition whatsoever.&nbsp; I am now using a Sony Netbook that I bought for $300 at Sam's Club a couple of years ago, running Win 7 Starter to access the printer.&nbsp;
 I have not been able to install the Brother printer driver on any variation of Win 8, on any computer.&nbsp; Microsoft informs me that it is a Brother issue.&nbsp; Brother used to inform me that it was a Microsoft issue, until I doggedly pursued it from that angle.&nbsp;
 Now they tell me that 9 computers of various makes at two locations are all afflicted with the same mysterious malady they attribute to your computer.&nbsp; A bad case of '<span>Je ne sais quoi' is the
 final analysis from Brother.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

            I had the same issue with&nbsp;an&nbsp;older Brother printer and a new HP computer with windows 8. I could not get the printer to talk to the computer so I went and bought a new Brother MFC printer thinking that surely it would be compatible with windows 8. No such
 luck. I had the same problems. I spent 45 min on the phone with Brother tech support. Nothing we did worked. Waste of time and effort. They blamed it on HP. I am going to take it back and get another printer.

            I found a simple solution to this that only takes a few minutes.&nbsp; Go to a Windows 7 PC. &nbsp;You do not have to own it, or even control it for long, provided you temporarily have Administrator privileges.&nbsp; Install the&nbsp;Brother Driver, hooking up the printer
 only at the point the software indicates.&nbsp; With a free Goggle Gmail or Microsoft Hotmail Account comes a free 'Cloud Printers' Account.&nbsp; Register the Printer in either or both.&nbsp; Everything works everywhere from there on out.&nbsp; No SuperTechies necessary.

<p>
</p><p>2. 512 MB - limited RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would need a minimum 2 GBs of RAM to sufficiently run Windows 8 on your system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether you have a logo PC or you’ve built your own PC, the recommendations for Windows 8 include:</p>
<p>1 GHz or faster processor <br />
1 GB RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit) <br />
16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit) <br />
DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver </p>
<p>One new element to Windows 8 is the requirement that Metro style applications have a minimum of 1024x768 screen resolution, and 1366x768 for the snap feature. If you attempt to launch a Metro style app with less than this resolution (e.g. 800x600, 1024x600)
 you will receive an error message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, it would you would have a better chance upgrading the amount of installed RAM and migrate to Windows 7 32 bit instead (which will be supported until 2020).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to run Windows 8, its best you purchase it preinstalled on a new computer and migrate your information from the older computer.</p>

<h3> ahia111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble in deleting Skype Account</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi!</span></p>
<p><span>I have been trying to delete my Skype Account for quite some time without deleting my Microsoft Account.</span></p>
<p><span>Every time I try, it takes me to different links and asks to sign in again and again and doesnt delete
 it. The Skype Community Page and the links to Closing Skype Account are just useless. They dont work at all. I cant even ask a question in the community page. Live Chat Support is just fake. Sorry to say but its really disappointing and mere wastage of time.
 I never had such problem while deleting any other app account ever. Never gonna recommend Skype to anyone ever.</span></p>
<p><span>Seriously disappointed!</span></p>

<h2>            How do I stop Windows 10 from checking for and running updates when it wants to</h2>
                    <p>How do I stop Windows 10 from checking for and running updates when ever it sees fit? &nbsp;This drives me crazy. &nbsp;I need to be able to schedule it to do these tasks when my computer is idle and not when I have 10 windows open doing research. &nbsp;I can hear it and
 I notice a lag especially if I am using IE or Edge. &nbsp;As an example - my pc ran a check yesterday afternoon at 3:56 p.m. &nbsp;WTH! &nbsp;I was deep in research and was not idle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a clue on how I can change this? &nbsp;I don't seem to be able to find it in settings.</p>

            <p>Hi Monica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern about scheduling/ hiding the Windows Updates on your operating system, we will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>In Windows 10 you don't have a direct option to hide/disable the Windows Updates.</p>
<p>Instead, <span>I would like to inform that Microsoft has also released a troubleshooter that allows you to hide updates and thus prevent Windows from reinstalling them until a revised version becomes
 available.</span></p>
<p><span>Download the troubleshooter
<strong><span>wushowhide.diagcab</span></strong> from Microsoft; it’s a standalone application,&nbsp;no installation required.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer: </span>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>How to temporarily prevent a Windows or driver update from reinstalling in Windows 10
</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>When you run the application, you will receive:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><span>Show or hide updates </span>
</strong><span>screen, click on <strong><span>Next</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>You may click on <strong><span>Hide updates
</span></strong>to hide and on <strong><span>Show hidden updates
</span></strong>to see which updates are hidden.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2:
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can also&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">enable the Defer upgrades option.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>By checking
<strong>Defer upgrades</strong>, feature upgrades like the Windows 10 Fall Update are delayed for 4 – 12 months, depending on other settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Advanced options</strong> to see whether you have it; by default the option is disabled. Check if this option is disabled/ unchecked.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Microsoft will not recommend the users to postpone the Windows Updates from being
 installed as there may be a fixes for the existing bugs and also security updates will be provided for the customers via Windows Updates.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 3:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Also, you can c</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">heck with turning on&nbsp;Metered
 connected. </span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>On Windows 10, Windows Update won’t run if you’re on a metered connection.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow:
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open
<strong>Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Wi-Fi</strong>, connect to the metered connection, maybe a Wi-Fi hotspot you’re tethering from your mobile, then click
<strong>Advanced options</strong>, and toggle <strong>Set as metered connection</strong> to
<strong>On</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps. Reply to the post with an updated status of this issue, we will be happy to assist you further.</span></span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Abdurachmanov,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. We will help you in resolving your issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions regarding the query:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>What was the error message displayed before?</li><li>Did you get any error code?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot your PC and check if you are facing similar issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persist, I suggest you to re-perform <strong>startup repair</strong> from the Windows 10 installation disk by following the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Startup Repair</strong> is a Windows Recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer for the problem, and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup Repair is one of the recovery tools in the System Recovery Options menu. This set of tools is located on your computer’s hard disk, and on the Windows Installation disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are on Windows 10, I suggest you to repair your computer by creating a Windows 10 Bootable media (i.e. USB or DVD) using
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Media Creation Tool</span></a></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">. &nbsp;</span>Once you're ready with Bootable Media, follow the below mentioned
 steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Insert&nbsp;the Windows&nbsp;installation disc in the disc drive or connect USB media and then start the computer.</span></li><li><span>Press a key when the&nbsp;message <strong>Press any key to boot</strong>&nbsp;from CD or DVD appears.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your PC does not detect the media automatically </span>
<ol>
<li><span>During the restart process, read the screen for any instructions that explain how to&nbsp;interrupt normal startup and enter the basic input/output system (BIOS)&nbsp;setup utility. Most PCs use the F2, F10, ESC, or DEL key to begin the&nbsp;BIOS Setup.</span></li><li><span>Look for a tab in the&nbsp;BIOS Setup Utility that is labeled <strong><span>Boot&nbsp;Order</span></strong>,
<strong><span>Boot&nbsp;Options</span></strong>, or <strong><span>Boot</span></strong>. Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to go to the
<strong><span>Boot Order</span></strong>, then press <strong>Enter.</strong> </span>
</li><li><span>Locate the CD, DVD, or&nbsp;USB flash drive (this might be called Removable Device) in the Boot list.&nbsp;Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to move the&nbsp;drive up so that it appears first in the Boot list. Press
<strong>Enter</strong>. The boot order sequence is&nbsp;now changed to boot from the CD, DVD, or USB flash drive.</span></li><li><span>Press F10 to save your&nbsp;changes and to exit the BIOS Setup Utility. Select
<strong>Yes</strong> in the confirmation window. The PC will <strong>restart</strong>. Allow the PC to restart&nbsp;normally. The scan will take a few minutes and remove any malware that&nbsp;may be infecting your computer.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Select a language, a&nbsp;time, a currency, a keyboard or another input method, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the operating&nbsp;system that you want to repair and then click <strong>
<span>Next</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select <strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong>.&nbsp;Select
<strong>Advanced options</strong> from the window&nbsp;and click on <strong><span>Startup&nbsp;repair
</span></strong><strong><span>option</span></strong></span>.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue persist, I suggest you to perform <strong><span>System Restore </span>
</strong>under <strong><span>Advanced Options</span></strong>&nbsp;and follow with onscreen instruction to repair your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would ask you to reset your computer and see if the issue resolved. Please note that here in this reset we would keep your files and only the programs and applications will be uninstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open start menu and select the <strong>settings button.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. In the settings windows, select “<strong>Update &amp; security</strong>”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. In the “Update &amp; security” windows, select “<strong>Recovery</strong>”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. In “<strong>Recovery</strong>”, please select “<strong>Reset this PC</strong>” and click “<strong>Get started</strong>”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. A blue screen will follow giving you two options<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">, Click either "<strong>Keep my files</strong>" or "<strong>Remove everything</strong>," depending on whether you want to keep your data files intact. Either way, all of your settings
 will return to their defaults and apps will be uninstalled. <strong>We would suggest you to select “keep my files” options.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">6. </span>Here, Select "Just remove my files" or "Remove files and clean the drive" if you chose to "remove everything" in the prior step. Cleaning the drive takes a lot longer but will make sure that, if you are giving the computer
 away, the next person will have a hard time recovering your erased files. If you are keeping the computer, choose "Just remove my files."<span style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">7. Click next if windows warns you that you won’t be able to roll back to a prior version of the windows operating system.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">8. Click <strong>reset when prompted</strong>. Windows will restart and take several minutes to reset itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">9. Click <strong>Continue when prompted</strong>.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Factory Reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> veronica22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Factory Reset</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a used HP laptop, Star Wars Special Edition Notebook that has Windows 10 installed. I noticed the previous user did not do a reset and so I went to do so (mainly to get him logged out of the main microsoft account on the laptop) the install
 did not complete. A blue screen came up, which stated "Your PC/Device needs to be repaired" and "The operating system could not be loaded because a kernel is missing or contains errors". Below that it reads "File: \WINDOWS\system32\ntoskrnl.exe" and "Error
 code: 0xc0000221". It tells me I need recovery tools, which I don't know if I even have (probably not) and that I can press enter to try again. I've tried pressing enter and it takes it to an automatic repair screem which eventually leads back the the blue
 screen that I described above. Just a constant loop. I cannot get to my homepage and it will not boot properly. Can I fix this? What caused this issue?</p>

            So, I tried to start it in Safe Mode and it is taking me back to the same blue screen that says there was an error. The screen came up after I tried to do the restart. It comes up before I'm able to even log onto the computer. I turn it on, it takes me
 to the automatic repair screen then the blue screen that says my PC/Device needs to be fixed. That's as far as I can get. I have not done any other troubleshooting yet. What should I do next?

<h3> jttc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Local Master Browser unable to see NAS devices on network</h2>
                    <p>This issue relates to the user to access NAS devices on the network via File Explorer\Network. &nbsp;Correct see all Windows PCs reliability but not so NAS devices after a &nbsp;rebooting, the PC does not see the devices where previous sees. &nbsp;This happens more often
 then displaying the NAS devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My research leads to believe that the issue relates to way LMB of WS-Discovery and is not used NetBIOS. &nbsp;I was advised Corporate network work because of Windows Active directory which removes this problem but it means requiring the use of Windows Server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discussion: I am thinking this issue relates to posting a question and for discussion been researching on this subject and sharing this in hope Forum discussion if they have similar experience and perhaps sharing can help MS can check my information and
 perhaps support the use of their valuable resources to sorting this out enabling user to use Explore's Network to access their share drives. &nbsp;As a MS windows fan I believe that is Windows OS issue I like to see less technical Windows user have a easier life
 using Windows with confidence or pushed to using other OS e.g. IOS, Linux Android</p>
<p>reagrds. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: is whether Microsoft can make the protocol that used by LMB selectable and force the broadcasting going through NetBIOS instead of ws-discovery, all NAS devices will be displayed?</p>

</p><p>The issue i raised is related to a consumer based product Windows 10 Pro sold to Enterprise as well as consumer. &nbsp; This issue exist on three Windows 10 OS as well as the insider version which are used by consumers. &nbsp;Unless you feel it is just Home version
 is for consumer and the Pro is not right? I like to understand your rationale in your declaration. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Destination Path Too Long Problem - Item Not Found When Renaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaybird2323  say:</h3>
<h2>            Destination Path Too Long Problem - Item Not Found When Renaming Folders</h2>
                    I've been looking for an answer everywhere to this question, and it seems none of the 'fixes' that people have had success with have worked for me so I'm posting my own question in hopes someone can help me, and in turn anyone else who stumbles upon this
 problem will find this thread and be helped as well.<br />
<br />
My OS is Windows 7 Home Premium SP1<br />
<br />
Here is the problem:<br />
For a few months now I haven't been able to make a new folder and rename it with windows explorer (I have to go into the command prompt and do it that way)<br />
It was giving me 'Destination Path Too Long' errors, despite the path NOT exceeding the 260 character limit. Even if I rename the folder '1' or 'a' it gives the error. I have folders that were created before the problem that are fine, but they too cannot be
 renamed with windows explorer. <br />
<br />
It also gives me the 'destination path too long' error when moving folders into other folders, thereby making organization of folders difficult.
<br />
<br />
I tried uninstalling the "kb980408" update as other threads have said.. and it did nothing for me. I tried deleting the reg files as indicated on several threads to try to fix the issue that some people had success with.. I have not.
<br />
<br />
I ran chkdsk, several malware and virus scans which has done nothing. <br />
<br />
I had originally not installed SP1, so I tried that to see if it changed anything. It did. Instead of the 'destination path too long' error, I then go 'item not found' when trying to rename a new folder or moving a folder into another folder. If I hit 'try
 again' on that box, then it would actually rename the folder or move the folder successfully. Well, not being able to live with the stupid error that pops up when I simply want to create and rename a folder I searched for a way to get rid of THAT problem,
 which brought me back to deleting those registry keys once again. After rebooting, its back to the 'destination path too long' error and will not rename/move folders once again.
<br />
<br />
Has anyone had any experience with this problem and can you guide me into a solution that does not involve a clean install?
<br />

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker Sound Problems</h2>
                    Has anyone else had this problem?<br />
<br />
The sound on my Asus 202 Vivobook is fine. No problems. When I add sound to a movie project, it turns off. Sometimes this happens, sometimes not. The sound can be recorded by my voice, or it can be a song added to the movie.
<br />
<br />
What I'm saying is, the sound aspect of Windows Movie Maker is wonky. I cannot comeup with a better phrase than that.<br />
<br />
When I restart my laptop the sound comes back just fine.<br />

            I did the repair. I'll see how that works. <br />
<br />
Just to be clear, sometimes adding audio does work.&nbsp; My problem is that when it doesn't, it disables the audio on the computer - meaning everything. I can't play music, the various sounds the computer makes (warning sounds, etc.) are shut off. It's very weird.<br />
<br />
Also, I tried sending you the log files but I kept getting a time out. <br />

            Do you having any ancillary audio output devices, like a headset or USB speakers?
<div><br />
<div>When this issue happens, have you looked at you PLAYBACK devices in the system; is it still set for your default speakers?</div>

<div>This could be a sound driver issue.</div>

<div>As a suggestion, if not already, you should visit WINDOWS UPDATE and see if there are any updates to your SOUND system. This might help you. It's not an absolute, but it has helped others; based on other experiences and responses from the Windows Movie

1. Headset - yes. Problem occurs when I am not using them. USB speakers - no.<br />
2. No. How do I determine if it is set for default speakers. (which I do not use.)<br />
3. My system is set for automatic Windows updates. I have updated my Asus bios. However I'll visit that link &amp; see what happens.<br />
<br />

<li>The reason I ask is that Windows operating system can switch playback options, so if you have a headset or USB speakers, the operating system may, for some reason, switch to those output options. Knowing if you have other output options helps determine

When you experience a problem with your system not playing any audio, I would check your properties to find out if there's anything is reporting. This should be indicated with the strength indicator next to each playback option.<br />
<br />

</p><p>Thanks for your good wishes, Larry. I hope that they are more effective than the gibberish you posted here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for the record, I uninstalled Movie Maker, re-installed it, used it on a fresh session in which I checked my sound - working perfectly - and whammo. The sound stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My updates are up to date. Nothing wrong with the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I tried uploading my log files and got a timeout error, and have not received a response from the Microsoft tech who solicited them in a private message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what else would you suggest?</p>

<h2>            Xbox live recognises my network but wil not connect&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>When running my xbox live connection test, the xonsole recognises my network name.</p>
<p>However, when i run the test, it fails repeatedly at the first stage (between the xbox and my internet network name)</p>
<p>It has never had this problem before but i have recently changed routers. however, i have followed all the internet guidance on DCHP and DNZ etc but my EDIMAX AR7284wna router will still not connect to my xbox which is extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had a similar problme with such a router or can anyone provide me with some help please.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Things that keep a wireless adapter from connecting</p>
<p>1. Most common thing is not getting the KEY or Passphrase correct.<br />
&nbsp;A. Keys and passphrases are case sensitive, make sure you are typing it correctly; including upper case and lower case letters.<br />
&nbsp;B. Passphrases and SSIDs can change, without notice, in some routers with features that keep them from having duplicate setups of nearby networks. Make sure you "really" know what your passphrase or key is set at.<br />
&nbsp;C. Other members of your household may have changed the passphrase/key.&nbsp; Again, make sure you really know what the passphrase/key is set at in your router.<br />
&nbsp;D. Using passphrase when you need a key. Some routers allow you to enter a passphrase for a WEP security feature. From that passphrase the router generates a key (or four keys). Make sure you use the WEP "key", not the passphrase, and make sure it is the "first"
 key.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Incompatible methods of encryption&nbsp; (WEP, WPA, WPA2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some routers may use non-standard methods to encrypt the wireless signal.&nbsp; If your router uses WEP , try changing it to WPA2.&nbsp; WPA2 is the most recent method and may be the most reliable and secure.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp; MAC filtering can block your Xbox from connecting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAC filtering is a feature in many routers that adds another level of security.&nbsp; It is a way of only allowing "certain" machines to connect to the router.&nbsp; If your Xbox's MAC address is not on the router's "Allowed" list, your Xbox will not connect;
 even if you have the right passphrase/key<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
4.&nbsp; Distance from router.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;Wireless can only cover fairly short distances.&nbsp; If you get more than 20 feet from the router, you could have various kinds of issues, including not being able to connect. Move your Xbox and router closer together. The distance that can be covered reliably
 will be different for each setup; it may be shorter than 20 feet for some, and maybe longer than 20 feet for others. It depends on what kind of obstacles are in the way and the electromagnetic environment in your area.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Interferance.<br />
&nbsp;Wireless connections naturally depend on radio "waves".&nbsp; Waves are always subject to possible interferance; where one wave cancels out another.&nbsp; Interferance can come from other electronic devices (like TV sets, phones, bluetooth stuff, neighbor's networks,etc).
 Sometimes trying a different wireless channel setting in your router will help. Also changing radio bands can help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
6.&nbsp; Incompatible Radio bands.<br />
&nbsp;Wireless routers typically can work on two bands of frequencies; 2.4 ghz&nbsp; and 5 ghz.&nbsp; If your wireless router is set for one type of band and your wireless adapter is set for the other type of band, they will not see each other and cannot connect. Make sure
 your router and your adapter are compatible with each other. Keep in mind that the wireless adapter built-in to the new Xbox slim is only a 2.4ghz adapter will not work on the 5ghz band.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Incompatible standards (802.11a,b,g,n)<br />
&nbsp;A "standard" is a method of communicating and connecting that is defined by an accepted organization and followed by many companies that build wireless stuff. If your adapter uses one method and your router uses another method, they won't be able to connect.&nbsp;
 So make sure your router and adapter are both using the same methods.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;Duplicate Network Names (SSID)<br />
&nbsp;If there are other networks nearby with the same name (SSID) this can cause your Xbox to have trouble connecting.&nbsp; Make sure your SSID is unique.</p>
<p>9. Mixed mode settings in the router.<br />
&nbsp;Some routers handle sifting between a,b,g and N pretty well;&nbsp; but some don't.&nbsp; If your Xbox connects using "n" and someone turns a laptop on, that needs to use "g" the router may drop all connections when trying to shift to the "g" mode.&nbsp; Try setting the router
 up to use only one mode.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />
A good general way to troubleshoot wireless problems is to start by setting your wireless router up in a very basic configuration.&nbsp; Disable any security (WEP, WPA, WPA2) and disable any MAC filtering. Set the wireless mode to a simple "g-only" mode.&nbsp; Move your
 Xbox as close to the router as you possibly can, perferably in the same room. Then see if your Xbox will connect.&nbsp; If it does, you can start turning the features of your router back on, one at a time, until you find the one that is giving you problems.</p>

<p>De Menace is correct in his suggestions. To simplify, first check your password. Make sure that you both using the correct password and that you are using caps where caps are needed (Network Passwords are case sensitive). If you are sure that is correct,
 then you may need to adjust your settings a bit.</p>

<p>Look....the forum is filled with people having connection issues to Xbox Live. &nbsp;There is something wrong with the Xbox Live servers/connection. &nbsp;I have two xboxes at my home right now and one will connect just fine and the other will not. &nbsp;I host lan parties
 every Saturday with 4 - 6 xboxes and we have never had this problem before. &nbsp;The router is configured properly, however, one xbox will not connect (it has its own xbox live gold profile). &nbsp;Fix the issues instead of passing it on to people's hardware. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a way to fix that, but it all depends on how close your router is... I would suggest using an ethernet cord... Also some times it could be when you are far away from the Router and your xbox can't pick up the connection. This has happened to me before
 and all I could recommend is that you move the xbox 360 closer to a router, and also use an ethernet cord</p>

<h2>            Mechwarrior 4 Vengenance, and Mechwarrior 4 Mercenaries Problems</h2>
                    Hello. I recently decided to dig up my old MW4 series game CDs and I come across a problem. I have successefully played MW4:Mercenaries for a few days and in the last stretch of the game when I tried to load up the game it will start, you hear the starting
 sounds of the opening video but the screen is dark it then minimizes the game to the Windows Taskbar after about two-three seconds. When you try to bring the game back up it does the same thing, and then minimizes again. When you right click for the menu it
 only displays a close window option. I have tried to uninstall the game and then reinstall it but it does the same thing, and have tried to change my screen resolution and it does it as well.
<br />
<br />
Afraid that something is messing with my ability to play games on my computer I tried other games, all successfully loaded and then I tried Mechwarrior 4 Vengeance which went through the same thing. I have tried every trick I know to get these games to play
 but no luck therefore have broken down to seek help from others. <br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.<br />

EDIT: There appears to be no Error Message or anything showing up before it minimizes.

            <p>Try Compatibility Mode (for XP) to see if that helps. For method please see:</p>

<p>There is also&nbsp;a patch on the Mechwarrior website that may be worth investigating.</p>

            Hi,<br />
A few more things to try, keeping in mind it may never work with that software:<br />
<p><b><span>Windows 7 Compatibility Center</span></b><span><br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>

</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></a></p>
<p><span>Have you tried right-clicking on the shortcut to the program, or the .exe, and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option? Do so even if your user is an Admin. Try right-clicking
 on the actual Setup.exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option? Do so even if your user is an Admin.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Windows Virtual PC</span></b><span><br />
Download Windows XP Mode<br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><span>Windows XP Mode (Windows 7 only, but not any of the Home versions) "You are not eligible to download Windows XP Mode. You must have Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise,
 or Ultimate to run Windows XP Mode". If you have an old XP CD (or other older Windows CD) available you can just download the Virtual Machine and skip the XP Mode download. This covers the whole gambit of virtual machines in "Home" versions if you want to
 have a look at it. Of course you will need a licensed copy of XP to install and run in any of them (except XP Mode).</span></p>

    <title>Xbox 360 randomly disconnecting from live, giving error messages that - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shaqtimus rhyme  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 randomly disconnecting from live, giving error messages that seem irrelevant.</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox will often disconnect at random, sometimes multiple times within an hour, other times not for a couple days. Roughly 1/3 of the time, I will be able in instantly reconnect, but other times it will repeatedly give me error messages. When I get an
 error message, the ONLY way to reconnect is to restart the xbox. I've looked up the error message numbers it gives me, and they are always either something about problems downloading a profile, or problems regarding buying/downloading bought games. I bought
 a new xbox four months ago, and downloaded my profile back then, and haven't bought any games at all. The only downloads I've done at all are the free monthly games. And the disconnecting problem started about 1-1 &amp; 1/2 months ago.</p>

<p>With Arris gateways similar to the one you own, there known issues regarding random disconnects similar to what you have described. I recommend checking out our Arris TG862G Known Issues post and update the Arris' firmware to version<strong> 7.6.59c or later</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have updated your device to it's latest firmware, post back and let us know if the issue persists or not! :)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade errors 0x80070003 and 0x80070005</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to upgrade a PC from Windows 7 64 bit to Windows 10. I've been trying all week... it says the PC is compatible with Win 10, but every time I try and install Win 10 I get a 'something went wrong' message with one of&nbsp;the above codes. At first I
 thought it was antivirus, but I've uninstalled everything except Microsoft Security Essentials, still the same, so I then uninstalled everything on my PC which was to do with Windows 10 and started again - still the same.</p>
<p>I must have tried at least 10 times now.</p>
<p>I only have a day left to do this so would appreciate any answers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe it's trying to tell me something and I shouldn't bother&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers guys, hope someone can help!</p>

<p>If you initiate setup using Windows Update, errors such as the above can occur for many reasons. Sometimes restarting your computer a few times can fix it. Removing security software can also help. If those basic solutions don’t work, then there is a possibility
 something is wrong with your software distribution folder.</p>
<p>Press Windows key + R, <strong>type:</strong> <em>appwiz.cpl</em> then hit Enter. Search for
<em>troubleshooting</em> then launches it. Under <em>System and Security</em>, launch
<em>Fix problems with Windows Update</em> then follow the on-screen wizard.</p>
<p>If this does not fix the problem, run it a few more times, then try again. If the problem persists, then modifying the software distribution folder manually might be worth a try. If these instructions prove too cryptic or difficult to attempt, then switch

    <title>Screen brightness after Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> felix kopf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen brightness after Creators Update</h2>
                    Since the creators update, my display brightness has been adjusted to 50% after each reboot.<br />
I have to manually select the appropriate brightness every time and Windows will forget this setting every time I restart.<br />
I am using a laptop, Windows 10 Version 1703.<br />
I think, it is not related to the new feature "Night Mode".<br />
All the settings are as I want them to be. Advanced power plan with 100% brightness, disabled adaptive brightness.<br />
But after each reboot, Windows just forgets this settings.<br />
What I have noticed is that Windows 10 since the creators update is forgetting most of my power settings at restart.<br />
Brightness gets reset, adaptive brightness is turned back on each time.<br />
My Nvidia graphics card is up to date and I updated the driver for the Intel HD Graphics.<br />
<br />
<p>Update to Build 15063.250 does not solve the problem.<br />
</p>
<p>Still:</p>
<p>On a laptop, Windows <span>forgets many settings with every reboot:</span></p>
<p><span>- display brightness</span></p>
<p><span>- adaptive brightness</span></p>
<p><span>- everything from the different power plans (advanced, balanced, ...)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All of this gets reset to some default values everytime the system restarts.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>I got rid of the problem by freshly installing Windows and activating a Pro-Licence, not my Education-Licence.<br />
