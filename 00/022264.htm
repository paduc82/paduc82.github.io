            <p>Hello raineGF, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your Forum Contribution.</p>
<p>I would suggest two things, the first is a series of steps that actually is to reconnect to Facebook chat but maybe it is worth trying for this issue too:</p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Turn off Facebook Chat.<br />
2) Set Chat status to Offline. Turn off your Phone.<br />
3) Switch your Phone back on. Go to Battery Saver option in settings.<br />
4) Turn on Battery saver. <br />
5) Go to Advanced Settings inside Battery Saver. <br />
6) Tap on each of the three options there, from bottom to top, one after another.
<br />
7) Come back and turn off the Battery Saver. <br />
8) Go back to messaging and turn on Facebook Chat. <br />
9) Now set chat status to available. It should get connected. </p>
<p><br />
If this does not help, you may as well try to soft reset your Phone.<br />
Therefore simply press and hold the "Volume Down" and "Power" Button together until the Phone restarts. You wont lose any data this way...<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Silas W.</p>

            It means that the phone isn't made to the specifications of US networks (which are different from the rest of the world). To put it simply, it won't work in the US, which is why it isn't sold on the US market.

            The Arte is a triband phone which works on 900, 1800 and 1900 GSM frequencies.<br />
<br />
US networks use either 850 or 1900, so such a phone would work only if there was reception on a network that uses 1900, but you could not be certain of coverage everywhere.<br />
<br />
Also, north American networks use a different frequency for 3G services than other regions, so that would also reduce the functionality of this model in the US.<br />
<br />
There is more on mobile frequencies here:<br />

    <title>Plain Text Content Control Inside Box Can&#39;t Be Edited Once - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Plain Text Content Control Inside Box Can&#39;t Be Edited Once Protected</h2>
                    I am creating a document that contains some forms that can be filled out/edited once protected. I want to protect the document to keep the integrity of the formatting.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The problem is, the majority of my forms are within text boxes with borders. When I protect the document, these no longer can be edited. I can't click on the "Plain Text Content Control" where it says "Click here to enter text." to add text. This is a bummer
 because the boxes really add some visual interest to the document. I have a few other Plain Text Content Control Boxes at the top that are not in boxes and those can be edited when protected.<br />
<br />
I don't really understand why I can't edit these boxes once protected. It's pretty frustrating because I don't want to have to redesign the entire document. Does anyone have a solution or alternative for this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            You need to verify that either these possibilities will actually do what you need and not have unwanted side-effects (i.e. I can't vouch for them).
<div><br />
1. You could try using the other approach to protection - i.e. protect the document against all changes, then select each content control and allow "Everyone" to edit it. That should allow you to leave all your text boxes "as is".</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>2. You could try using Word Frames instead of text boxes (Frames were the predecessor for Text boxes and work rather differently). But I think that will need quite a lot of work to get your layout right. To find the command you need, go to (e.g.) File-&gt;Options-&gt;Customize
 Ribbon or File-&gt;Options-&gt;Quick Access Toolbar, select "All Commands" under "Choose Commands From", then look for Insert Horizontal Frame ("Insert Frame" does something else). &nbsp;

    <title>&#37; of Row Total returns &#35;N&#47;A in Power Pivot pivot table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pjhorst  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#37; of Row Total returns &#35;N&#47;A in Power Pivot pivot table after June update</h2>
                    <p>I believe a bug was introduced with the June update re: performance enhancements with Power Pivot sub and grand totals no longer returning results unless required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, with a Data Model based Pivot Table, you could have value return results as a % of Row Total, have Grand and Sub totals turned off and the % calculations would still display with values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, in the same scenario, you end up with #N/A.&nbsp; Turning subtotals or grand totals on, enables the calculation to complete.&nbsp; The updated indicates the subtotal/grand total will only return if required for the pivot table to render.&nbsp; I believe this is not
 actually happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a work around, you can write the measure by hand but the&nbsp;impact is you have to know how your pivot table will be formatted so that you can indicate the correct column in your DAX to roll up to ...Calculate (,[countme],allexcept(table1,table1[known_row))
 .&nbsp; This takes away from the flexibility of the original/desired functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other minor impacts, like handling the resulting blanks vs previously calculated 0%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very easy to test with a simple dataset.&nbsp; The original functionality is still present in a standard pivot table or Excel install without the June update applied.</p>

            <p>In your picture, Grand Total is visible (so, is turned on).&nbsp; To match mine, you would also want to verify subtotals are turned off.&nbsp; Since you only have a single row they won't display but can still be turned on, which impacts the pivot table.</p>

            <p>PJ, I have a quick update for you. The engineering team just told me that they've checked in a fix for this issue. It may take a while to reach you since you're one of the slower release channels (FRDC), but it will come eventually.
</p>
<p>

    <title>Horrible new version of Skype replacing the one which is working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Horrible new version of Skype replacing the one which is working great&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using skype for many years to IM message and video chat with family.&nbsp; I downloaded and installed the newest version for Windows 10 for desktop.&nbsp; There is no way to set it up.&nbsp; No 'options' to change or enlarge font, no way to delete old conversations,
 no way&nbsp; to adjust any settings.</p>
<p>IT IS PLAIN AWFUL!!!!!! Tried using it today and the print was so small I had to stop using it. I looked everywhere to find settings or options to change font or do anything and, lo and behold, cannot find setting or options.&nbsp; We are stuck with the default
 setting decided upon by Skype and only that.&nbsp; Had to do much research to be able to reinstall version 7.41.0.101 in order to get back to a working version. I understand that in September the working version will be retired.&nbsp; Too bad for those of us who have
 used this program with no problem.&nbsp; Please consider letting us decide which version we prefer and keep the old version available!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess we will have to search for another more people friendly IM and video chat program which will allow us to set it up as we like it. &nbsp;</p>
<p />

            Could you let me know, please, how to reinstall the old version.&nbsp; I just updated to the 'new' Skype and completely lost all previous chat history, no access to anything.&nbsp; I'd greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; I'm in agreement that Skype/MS should allow the user
 to stay with the old version or try the new.&nbsp; I am not impressed and a bit pissed at having lost all the information obtained.&nbsp; Thank you &amp; good luck on finding a new IM.&nbsp; Not so sure I'm sticking with Skype if this is any sampling of it.&nbsp; Thank you again.

            I just did a Google search for the download for Skype version 7.41.0.101 for desktop and found several sites.&nbsp; I guess on Sept. 1st it will not be available but it gives time to find a good replacement.&nbsp; The new version for Windows 10 that we downloaded
 is useless.

                    <div>

</p>
<p>

<p>I <strong>can</strong> call the game bar (Win+G) normally from any app I have enabled.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I <strong>can't</strong> record the screen with Win+Alt+R or the onscreen button.</p>
<p>Hitting the onscreen button gives me the message "We can't record right now. Try again later".</p>
<p>Using the keyboard shortcut, I get the "processing" mouse cursor for a brief moment, but then nothing happens.</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Funnily, I <strong>can</strong>&nbsp;record clips with Win+Alt+G.</p>
<p>So I'm pretty confident the recording function itself isn't broken.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried resetting the Xbox Store App &amp; signing out and back in. No effect.<br />
</p>
<p>I had no issues with standard (non-Insider) build.</p>

<br />I make some recent update in Outllok that version number of compilation has installed.?
<br />Does it happen to all users who have permissions on the distribution groups?
<br />I perform tests on different computers where Outlook is installed?

<h2>            Onedrive for Business Sync Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, changing this to a discussion rather than a question, if anything i learned from support, like skype, they have programmed answers that are out of this world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to continuously getting Sync errors with onedrive for business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We couldn't find the file on the server."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the file in the portal, and to my surprise it was there. So why is this awful program unable to sync changes to files?</p>
<p>Why are the notifications so limited in feedback to the point I am wondering why my company is wasting money with this terrible application and its nonsense services?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish to add insult to injury here, searching online for solutions, and what do you people suggest?
<strong>Repair</strong>.</p>
<p>I mean, like how stupid do you think people are that you create a duplicate folder in the user profile but increment a number at the end.</p>
<p>even, worse, your software attempts to sync the whole drive back to the PC!!!! WHY??? Is our internet connection for your pleasure?</p>
<p>Every time someone repairs his or her drive because of the sync problems, the connection drops. Our company has a whole Terra Byte sitting in your cloud service, it is becoming a nuisance replicating an increment in our profiles and wasting our disk space
 for your leisure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only to have more sync errors in the future. I had my fill with this excruciating pain of managing your sync problems.</p>
<p>I have Google drive and dropbox both installed along with your second rate onedrive personal, and i suppose you would be surprised that none of them cause problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So dear dollar-grubbing whatchamacallit, please fix your rubbish piece of service/code and allow us techies to get some feedback about why it won't find our files on the server. If it is file corruption, file duplicates with different timestamps, password
 expiry, read-only open file, whatever you think you can conjure, please let the error explain to us more.</p>
<p>I mean, we can physically go check and find the files, so why can't your broken drive find them as well? If the files are not on the cloud and they are in my onedrive for business folder, then why not upload them to the cloud? Does it know why? or just love
 to tick the heck out of my online experience?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an IT representative in my company, I make no effort in advising users to hook up with this abomination. I let them know they do this at their own risk because i can't seem to understand why those sync errors occur. NO FEEDBACK, and NO REASONS FOR FAILURE.</p>

<p>It is not my PC, not my files, it is this bad software.</p>
<p>It has a mind of its own.</p>
<p>I am on Onedrive for business folder, saved files into it which has the folder name suffixed by the company name, and my files are not on sharepoint because i don't want them there.</p>
<p>and then 30 files couldn't sync. i deleted those files now, but i am very reluctant to do this ever again because it wasn't my first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to understand why all those overwhelming office help forums, too much text and yapyap&nbsp; and for what?
</p>
<p>all that there is to say, is not said. I can't read this nonesense. but i did and i think it is ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go tell your boss and block this thread if you wish, i don't care, it is not you, not your crew or colleagues, just that microsoft needs to go find another hobby now.</p>

<p>
</p><p>what is this pile of crap? and why they stick to contoso for a dummy company name? why can't they make the enterprise crap different from average user deployment packages? maybe that is why onedrive client works better than onedrive for business?</p>

</p><p>Frankly, microsoft's business model for enterprise sucks bad. heck, you should see what they are building into their 2016 server. Everything is rigged for failure, the error messages are just fun to have before i stick my screwdriver into the PC and devastate
 any windows product installed on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, i didn't come here for help, i wanted to vent steam. and I will come here as often as i feel like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Rena but please stop attempting to solve this with preprogrammed questions.</p>

<h2>            Windows Feedback App won&#39;t work. &#40;Solved&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Nate, and the <strong>title basically says it all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30bc724c-0cf8-4741-aa92-7a072b546e74" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am connected to a working network, I am registered with the Insider Program, and I was and have been connected to the Internet when running the Feedback app. Clicking reload does nothing. So basically I can't provide feedback on the app because the app
 isn't working. Oh the irony.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still occasionally get notifications to provide feedback on things, and that does work, but after submitting my answers, this shows up again.
</p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hey there., </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you signed in to Windows 10 for the first time. It normally asks you for your Microsoft Account details. Like log in etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check, you can simply: </p>
<ol>
<li>Press Start, and you should see PC Settings pinned up at the top somewhere.</li><li>Click onto PC Settings </li><li>Once the page has loaded, please go to Users and Accounts</li></ol>
<p>This should then load your account up first. The one you have signed in on. It will allow you to change your picture etc..., and at the top, it will tell you which email address it is linked up to. Please check to see if it is the mail address you have used
 to register up to the Feedback service for Windows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not got a Microsoft Account linked with your PC account, then you should be able to link one from that page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the above information helps you with your question. Please post back any results</p>
<p>

<h2>            Project 2010 Import wizard for Excel does not launch</h2>
                    <p>Just went to Project 2010 recently. The import wizard for excel will not launch. Have tried File ... Open ... (selected "Excel Workbook" as the type) and then double clicking the Excel file. Project just sits there with nothing happening. Have also tried
 File ... New ... New from Excel Workbook and double clicking on the Excel file. Again, nothing happens. The Excel file is an .xlsx file with only a few rows of text.</p>
<p>Is there some setting I neglected to use when I installed it? The Trust Center settings for Legacy Formats is set to "Prompt when loading files with legacy or non-default file format".
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to any and all who respond. I greatly appreciate Everyone on these forums. You have been a life saver many times in the past.</p>

<br />Unfortunately Skype only supports a 64-bit now. You can use the Skype for web <a href="https://web.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/en/</a> with the Chromium browser

<br />
<br />Have a look at Rambox, that may work for you . . .

<p>Hi John. My company works extensively with Skype For Linux, and we had to upgrade all of our systems to 64-bit mid 2017. After some initial hiccups (SFL 5.xxx), eventually, SFL 8.xx appeared. It has a different GUI, a different engine, different everything.
 But Skype video calls work fantastically well, same as they always have, once you get connected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFL 8.xx is missing many of the features that were in the last 32-bit version, 4.3. But features are returning slowly, as they get developed. SFL 8.xx is an Electron application, ie. a browser based thing with web objects inside a container. The concept
 is that Microsoft wants to make all Skype apps look similar, with the same sort of look and feel. So Skype now looks similar on Android, iThings, Linux, and new Windows 10 UA version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say, my Skype For Web experience on Linux has not been good. I only managed to every get a successful video call maybe once or twice, and the rest simply do not connect. I tried Chromium and Firefox. So I'm not too keen on Skype For Web. Having
 said that, some of our customers tell me they use Skype For Web on their Mac PC very succesfully. Go figure!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a bit of a shame that 32-bit is no longer supported at all. The whole point of Linux is to make use of your older hardware, which might have too few resources to run Windows, but happily runs Linux. There are alternative apps of course, but with Chrome
 and other major players also no longer supporting 32-bit, unfortunately you may find you can't last much longer on 32-bit. I've caved in, and gone to 64-bit everything now.&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft belongs to the folks who believe that Computers should be thrown away after two years and RAM of recent machines needs to be filled completely ... so, they don't offer anything for 32bit, neither for not-so-bleeding-edge distros.</p>
<p>You could try putting it into a container w/ a small 64bit base system (remember to install 64bit kernel on the host - it can still run the 32bit userland)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, S4L is crashing directly at startup (and therefore completely unusable) for several month now (looks like they still don't know about the concept of error handling), so we can conclude that Microsoft doesn't support Skype on GNU/Linux at all.</p>

<p><br />
As things are standing now (since several month) they most vital feature is missing: being able to start the application at all, w/o crashing immediately.<br />
<br />
See numerous reports here in the forum. We gave them enough information (including stack traces and analysises) to quickly fix the problem, but obviously they're either completely unwilling or incapable to do that.<br />
</p>
<div>
<p>I really wonder why they even made another release few days ago, if the code is still so bad that it's crashing immediately on startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey, Microsoft, did it ever occour to you that it could be a good idea to hire some experienced GNU/Linux developers / sw architects if you wanna develop software for GNU/Linux ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Which is a ridiculous idea to begin with. Different device types and platforms have different UI concepts. For example, PCs have keyboards and mice (or touchpads) while pocket computers tend to have touch screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, Microsoft already tried to kill the PC in favour of a tablet computer. And they already failed miserably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, Electron is long known for being completely unstable, complicated and fat. (actually, the idea of using a browser engine for local GUI applications is ridiculous to begin with - many, including Microsoft themselves, already tried and failed miserably).</p>

<p>
</p><p>That never has been the major idea behind GNU/Linux (except maybe for some john-doe-users) ... it's more a nice buy product that we can easily support older hardware (more precisely: we don't have any reason to artificially kill that support), as our development
 model just scales magnitudes better than those of the big corporations.</p>

    <title>How do I turn off automatic scrolling in Word 2013&#63;&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sharongeorge13  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off automatic scrolling in Word 2013&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I type many documents each day and this problem is driving me to distraction!! &nbsp;As I type the cursor and text moves down the page and ends up at the bottom of the page, something that did not happen in previous versions of Word. &nbsp;I need the text to stay
 at eye height, something that used to be controlled with the scroll lock but this does not work!!! &nbsp;I have checked for add-ons but do not have any and have found no other clues as to how to stop this. &nbsp;
<div><br />

<div>I really hope someone can help soon!!</div>

            I am not mistaken, I have been using Microsoft Word for over 25 years and the scroll lock has always stopped this behaviour but since upgrading to Office 2013 the scroll lock will not work!

            Sharon is Correct. &nbsp;I have been using Microsoft Word for about 20 years also. &nbsp;This is really staring to annoy me!! &nbsp;Please let me know if there is a setting to turn this off.

            <p>I have never used scroll lock the way you described, I cannot get it to work the way you describe in Word 2010 or 2013 on WIn 8, BUT I'll assume you are right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only guessing, but I suspect the problem is the new "Layout engine" that controls display of text and other objects on the screen. Here are some links about the subject, but I don't recall any mention of your specific issue in them</p>

            <p>Hi Rohn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to my question. This could have something to do with Windows 8.1 because I don't have this problem on my other computer running Windows 7. &nbsp;I am having this issue on my laptop that has a touch screen. &nbsp;When &nbsp;I need to edit something in
 the middle of a document, as soon as I stop typing, paste something, or hit return, the view on the screen immediately scrolls to the top of the document page. &nbsp;The cursor stays in place and is scrolled out of sight. &nbsp;I have to constantly scroll back down
 to the location where I am typing. At first I thought it was my mouse or the touch screen, but this problem does not happen in Notepad or any other Office programs. I am only having this issue on Word 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vic</p>

            I agree with Sharon. Today, I noticed when I create a new MS Word document, it begins to automatically scrolled to the end of the document. Additionally, when changes are made (i.e. changes to page 1) the document automatically scrolls to last page (i.e.
 page 10). This is crazy and annoying. Really need a fix for this problem!

<p>My computer operating system is Windows 7 and MS Word 2013 (Office 365) is suddenly auto scrolling. I am not convinced it is the operating system (also I've not have any recent updates to OS).</p>

 click to a different spot. Please help!

<h2>            Embedded Help&#58; Excel Windows vs. Excel Mac</h2>
                    <p>I've just updated from the 11 year old Office for Mac to Office 365 for Mac ($99/yr subscription version).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm impressed by the number of new features. I decided to review some basics, so I'm watching some Lynda.com tutorials (available with a LinkedIn account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the first things I've notice is the incredibly limited state of tooltip info when one mouses over icons in the ribbon, and the virtual absence of "Tell me More" popups in Mac Office Excel 365 compared to the Windows version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the second things I've noticed is that in some instances the Tooltip popups are not helpful at all. For example, in the brief tour template, some of the tooltips that list keystroke equivalents haven't even been modified from their Windows version
 equivalents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I expect these disparities to lessen over time, given that I'm purchasing a subscription-based product?</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the code base is the same, the operating system environment is completely different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The extra text for mouse-over of Ribbon buttons is in the code base. I am sure that the folks who make such decisions at Microsoft made a conscious decision not to display that text. The development team is very open to user suggestions, which is why I urged
 you to post your suggestion to UserVoice. The number of votes for a suggestion gives the Microsoft Office teams a guide as to how many people agree with the suggestion. Then they make their decisions about what the interface will have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help is not the same on both platforms partly due to the fact that the operating systems don't have 100% feature parity. If they did, what would be the point of having Mac, Windows and LINUX as OS options? Office for Mac takes advantage of Mac OS to provide
 a slick feature when searching Help. When using Help, the Help system highlights menu features and pressing Return activates the feature. This is Mac-only.&nbsp; Here's a screen shot of the feature in action.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d703bc8-c4a5-439e-be36-1dbf4e3ffa6e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d703bc8-c4a5-439e-be36-1dbf4e3ffa6e?upload=true" height="427" width="633" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are features that are Mac-only or Windows-only based on operating system capabilities. A major difference between platforms is Office Automation. In Windows, you can automate Office apps using Visual Basic for Applications or JavaScript. On the Mac,
 you can automate Office apps using Visual Basic for Applications, JavaScript, AppleScript, Automator, and Objective-C. Don't go around feeling that the Mac side is always short-changed. It's not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't have to work too hard to find the PivotTable features in Excel for Mac. They're on the Insert tab of the Ribbon, just like the Windows version: If you have enabled Intelligent Services (and maybe even not), you can use the relatively new Recommended
 PivotTables feature, which relies on artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9385728c-8975-49b3-a4d2-abdfcd6b625e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9385728c-8975-49b3-a4d2-abdfcd6b625e?upload=true" height="216" width="242" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be thinking of the Power features in Excel for Windows: PowerView, PowerPivot, PowerMap, Data Model, Get and Transform, etc. Those features are currently under development for the Mac. Hopefully, it won't be long before Excel for Mac catches up on
 these features. You can add your vote to encourage the development team here:</p>

<h2>            Not receicing password reset emails from Elder Scrolls Online</h2>
                    Has anyone else had this problem? I cannot recieve emails from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; I need to reset my password, as I have forgotten it. And, I'm able to answer my secret question and provide whatever information they ask of me. However,
 hotmail blocks their messages, not even sending them to my junk folder, much less my inbox. I've added them as a safe sender, and even as a contact.&nbsp; Contacting both Outlook's customer support, and ESO's customer support has yielded nothing but frustration.
 No one seems to be able to help. What could be causing this?

<h2>            Capitalization of Greek letters</h2>
                    I create science-based presentations that frequently use lower-case Greek letters as symbols. If they are the first thing in a text-box they are auto-corrected to capitals. Is it possible to prevent this without stopping auto-correct of lower-case standard
 letters?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Auto capitalization is a default feature of Office that can be disable or enable depending on the user preference. Once the feature is activated, it will be applied in all languages. However, it is possible to set an exemption by following the steps in this

            As far as I can make out the only exceptions I can add for first letter capitalization are for the word before the autocorrect rather than the word that is autocorrected i.e.: to stop abbreviated words seeming like the end of a sentence. Am I missing something?
 I tried adding greek letters in each of the 3 exception options just in case but it didn't work.

<h2>            Can not filter subform data &#40;that is based upon a query&#41; to main form combo box</h2>
                    <p>I have a main form (Form A) with an unbound combo box whose data source is a drop down list.</p>
<p>I have a subform (Form B) whose data source is a&nbsp;query (linking multiple tables).</p>

<p>I want to filter the subform data to the main form combo&nbsp;box value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to do this without problems if my subform's data source is from a basic table (i.e. not a query of multiple tables) using</p>
<p>this criteria expression in the Access query builder view :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forms![Mainformname]![Comboboxname]
</p>
<p>with an AFTER_UPDATE event&nbsp; for the combo box to requery the subform data.</p>

<p>My criteria expression works FINE if the subform's data source is a table listing NAME, AGE, COUNTRY..</p>
<p>but DOES NOT WORK if the subform data source points to a query that links</p>
<p>NAME (from one table) to AGE (table2) to Country (table3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've ALSO tried to create a second query (of the 1st query results) and putting the criteria expression</p>
<p>in the 2nd query and it STILL DOES NOT WORK.</p>

            <p>Hi AccessNewbie777,</p>
<p>The subform in this case isn't actually linked. You are just specifying criteria in your underlying query to restrict the results. The sample I provided has a true link between the mainform and the subform and this would be the recommend solution. In addition
 to not having a true link, using 'like' and 'iif' may have a performance impact.</p>
<p>If you really want to go in the direction you've started, you would want to modify the criteria to also allow nulls.</p>
<p>Like IIf(IsNull([Forms]![Mainformname]![StudentName]),"*",[Forms]![Mainformname]![StudentName]) or [Forms]![Mainformname]![StudentName] is null</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Dennis</p>

<h3> gimrall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint - Doughnut Chart - Leader Lines Issue</h2>
                    <p>I would like to use Series Data Labels to identify the key aspects of my chart. &nbsp;When I move the label, a leader line is automatically created from my label to the section of my doughnut it corresponds to. &nbsp;I have tried to modify the properties of the leader
 line (the goal is to make it invisible or nonexistent) but every time I save, close the program, and open it again, the leader lines have reset to the default grey. &nbsp;It does not matter what I adjust (color, opacity, existence, etc.) they always come back to
 the default setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have dozens of these charts and labels already created and if I delete all the data labels and switch to a text box, the chart changes size and my formatting is ruined. &nbsp;So this is not an acceptable solution. &nbsp;Please help!</p>

            My apologies for the delay. &nbsp;This is a corporate computer, so I do not have Admin access. &nbsp;I had a long service call with the IT department and they have never seen this issue before. &nbsp;We did a full repair of Office 2013, which did not resolve the issue.
 &nbsp;We went through and deleted numerous temp files, which did not help. &nbsp;Interestingly enough, we opened the file using Office 2010 and the lines have been successfully deleted. &nbsp;Unless we find a way to resolve this issue, this will be my temporary solution.

<p>I had the same issue and resolved it as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the leader lines on your chart by left clicking on one.</li><li>Right click on a leader line and select "Format Leader Lines..."</li><li>Under the paint bucket (Fill and Line), navigate to Line and select "No line"</li></ol>
<p>Lines should disappear and should remain gone after you save and reopen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original problem was happening when you deselect leader lines as an option on "Format Data Label". This would reset every time the file was opened. A bug in the 2016 version.</p>

            <p>I had this the problem for me is that the old PIN was forgotten. I used the function I have forgotten my pin. I added a new pin assuming I forgot my PIN and then rebooted now the pin works on build 10162</p>
