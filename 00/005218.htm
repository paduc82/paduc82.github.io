<h2>            How to Export HD Powerpoint Slides</h2>
                    Hello, I'm trying to figure out how to change the export settings on Powerpoint so that I can export large powerpoints in HD images. I saw the article detailing a step by step process on&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/powerpoint/change-export-slide-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how
 to do it</a> and I went to my registry keys and got all the way to "Microsoft" but then there was no "Office" underneath it, so I couldn't proceed. Can someone help me, I really need to be able to export HD images for a project I'm working on.

<p>It seems to be a rare, but real, circumstance that the Office key is missing from the normal location in the Registry. We've never gotten enough information from any single user to identify where the Office registry entries are stored on their machines:</p>

<h2>            Emails sent to yahoo.com and comcast.net addresses are instantly being reported as &#34;undeliverable&#34; by the system administrator.</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Outlook on my computer with no problem for 7 months now. Within the last 2 days, however, I've just started getting notices from the system administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Messages I send to yahoo.com and comcast.net email addresses are instantly being reported as "undeliverable" by the system administrator. I can log in to my email provider's web site and send emails successfully via that portal, so it's not a question of
 the server or the destination emails. It is definitely an Outlook problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10 of the undeliverable messages from the system administrator just say that the email was undeliverable, with no additional information. 2 have said this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Server error: '550 5.7.1</font></span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Relaying denied: You must check for new mail before sending mail.'</font></span></p>

<p><font>I've looked all over the web for a solution, but nothing seems to match this problem.</font></p>

            Apparently, my email had been blacklisted. My tech support went to <a href="http://nszones.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://nszones.com/</a>&nbsp;and requested that my ISP be removed from the list. All emails are now going through. Thank you 24/7 Techies!&nbsp;<a href="http://help.247techies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://help.247techies.com/</a>&nbsp;So nice to know that even though you can't find human
 contact in a technical time of need at Microsoft, you can find it elsewhere.

    <title>Home A&#47;V Pack and Video Playback from Zune MP3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> improveandsupportit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Home A&#47;V Pack and Video Playback from Zune MP3</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have downloaded Video to my Zune 8GB device.&nbsp; I have a Zune A/V cable with 3 connectors, Yellow for Video, and Red and White for Audio, I also have the Home A/V Pack.&nbsp; The cable, that came with the A/V pack&nbsp;can plug directly into my Zune or into my home
 A/V pack base.</p>
<p>My issue: Video from the Zune doesn't process on any of my TVs.&nbsp; I have two older TVs (CRTs) with Yellow/Red/White video ports and two newer TVs (Sony Bravia LCD TVs).&nbsp; The sound plays through for the video, but the images do not -- no Video on my TVs!</p>
<p>I can't find any issues on the website related to this.&nbsp; The Video that I am trying to play was purchased through Zune and loaded to my device using standard synching.</p>
<p>I also have a Zune HD player, 32GB, it also does not play through the cable.&nbsp; I am aware that the Zune HD player is incompatible with the non HD base.&nbsp; I am willing to purchase an HD A/V pack for this device, however, I won't do this until the issue with
 my Zune 8GB player is resolved.&nbsp; I actually have two Zune 8GB players, and one Zune HD 16 and on Zune HD 32.&nbsp; Until now I have never tried to play Video with these devices on a TV.&nbsp; I bought the Zune A/V Pack when I bought my first Zune 8GB MP3 player.&nbsp; I
 used the base immediately for music and haven't had any issues with it.</p>
<p>Regarding Video playback, am I overlooking something?&nbsp; Should it be possible to play the Video that I buy on Zune.net on any TV?&nbsp; Is there an incompatibility issue with the Video purchased on Zune, is it only possible to play back on a PC via the installed
 Zune software?&nbsp; If so, is there a way to convert Videos purchased on Zune.net to a format that would allow the Video to be played on TVs?&nbsp; From my experience with Video in other scenarios, there are typically issues with codecs.&nbsp; Could this be the issue with
 the Zune Video, it is not formatted/licensed for playback on TVs?&nbsp; But if this is the case then what is the purpose of the Zune cable and A/V pack, that has a yellow cable for video playback?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can imagine, I am quite frustrated by this.&nbsp; I have tried every combination of cable, device, A/V pack and TV and haven't had any Video playback.&nbsp; I have a hard time believing it is the cable and or A/V pack, it appears to be an issue with the Video
 content.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for helping me to resolve.</p>

<p>The Zune 4GB, Zune 8GB, and Zune 16GB do not provide video output</p>
<p>The Zune 80GB and Zune 120GB support high-quality component video and standard composite video. To view component video, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Remove the cover from the back of the dock, and then set the video selector to Component Video .&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Connect a component video cable to the dock. Match the cable’s green, blue, and red RCA plugs to the corresponding jacks on the dock.<br />
Note The component video cable is sold separately.&nbsp; <br />
3.&nbsp; Connect the other end of the cable to a compatible TV or to a monitor.&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp; On your Zune device, select Settings , select Display , select TV Out , and then select On .</p>
<p>The Zune screen will become blank, and the output will be sent to your TV or to your monitor. To revert from using the TV screen to using the Zune screen, select TV Out again, and then select Off or merely remove the Zune device from the dock.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
To determine whether your TV is compatible with the dock, make sure that the TV's input jacks match either the A/V output cable’s yellow RCA plug or the dock’s green, blue, and red output jacks.<br />
Note Video quality depends on the quality of the original video file and the sync settings in the Zune software.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Excel 2004 &#38; 2008 - Crashes When Double Clicking In Header Region</h2>
                    Okay this is an extremely odd issue. I have a Mac OD/HomeSync environment that consists of 250 Mac OS X 10.5.8 clients on OSX 10.6.7 Server with MS Office 2004 Suite. I am guessing this was an issue in my deployed image because all machines in the building
 have the same issue.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div><u>So here is what happens</u></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Launch MS Excel 2004</div>
<div>Double click in header region and then it crashes</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have done a complete removal using MS Office Remove app and have reinstalled from CD.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried the recommended troubleshooting here &gt;&nbsp;http://www.office.mvps.org/troubleshoot/crashes.html</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have dug around looking at plist, permissions etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Still do not have a solution. This happens on both 2004 and 2008 version.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone has some ideas for me to try that would be amazing!</div>

            <p>Hey Todd,</p>
<p>Sounds like you've got a fire on your hands! I'd start with weeding your fonts:<br />
<a href="http://word.mvps.org/Mac/fontweeding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/Mac/fontweeding.html</a></p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try performing the manual uninstall of Office for Mac 2004 and 2008. These KBs explain how to do that:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/312172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/312172</a><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2500821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2500821</a></p>
<p>Once you've <em>completely </em>removed Office for Mac, try reinstalling and see if it works correctly.</p>
<p>Let me know how it goes!</p>

            Thank you for your reply Cody.
<div><br />
<div>I was actually able to find the issue. We have SmartBoards in our environment and apparently the new version of Smart Notebook has a application that is aware.app. After I terminated this process MS Excel was perfect!</div>
<div><br />
<div>So what I did to fix this was delete the aware.app file off all my clients via Apple Remote Desktop.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>After this was performed MS Excel works flawless. As far as I can see the aware.app does not affect the functionality of Smart Notebook in anyway.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello, </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Well, I currently have Outlook Email right now and I would like to add another Email with my own domain. I have followed the instructions to Set up a new Mail Server (MyFreeola) however every time I add my account information and the POP3 email information
 it says -&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There's a problem connecting to the POP3 mail server.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div><font color="#000000"><span>I don't know what's wrong. I have the POP3 and SMTP information of my Mail Server on Freeola but it's not working.</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#000000"><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#000000"><span>This is the information I have used provided from Freeola:</span></font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>'Incoming Mail Server (POP3)':&nbsp;<strong>mail.freeola.net</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>'Outgoing Mail Server':&nbsp;<strong>smtp.freeola.net</strong>.</div>

            I have exactly the same problem as PerfectNutter.
<div><br />
<div>I have checked all the email settings with my domain host and confirmed they are correct, the email address I am trying to collect is working fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can collect email through Gmail, microsoft outlook 2003 and several smartphones running android.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I try to use Outlook.com I get the message&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There's a problem connecting to the POP3 mail server.&nbsp;</span>this message sometimes shows SMTP instead of
 POP3</div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div>I have tried every permutation of the settings possible with no change, the fact that I can get this to work in other applications and devices indicates to me that the problem lies with Outlook.com.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any help would be much appreciated this issue has wasted a lot of my time already.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

ian mcalpine23.</a> I understand that music files saved on the SD card are not showing in your Groove music app. For this, please try to check if the music files are still on the SD card. If you have "Files" application you can check the file and folders on
 your SD card. If you still see them, tap one music file to play it just to make sure that they are not corrupted. Now open the Music app. Go to songs. Under songs you will see the word "showing" followed by the color green text. Tap on the green text and select
 All music. This will view all music saved on the phone and SD card.

            well....its telling me I am not who I am for chat..and there is no phone number meanwhile its been days trying to get outlook to show my message content when I click on them...so I guess I have no choice but to contact all my cleints through my phone and
 tell them to start emailing me instead at a non Microsoft account.&nbsp; I will also tell them the why of it. They haven't been very pleased lately either. The community I have gotten one response on. Appreciated the time the person took but it didn't solve it.
 Realllllllly sick of Microsoft...programs constant updates, switch to this or that wont work, this quick books program now wont work with that operating system..there goes another 300 plus bucks and no one from Microsoft to talk to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like I might have
 to give apple a try.

            Unfortunately there's no fix to this problem. It has been the same issue since Mountain Lion and now Mavericks. I<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">t
 also affects Mac's own applications such as "Page". I'm looking into installing Windows and Office via Virtual Box (virtual machine) so that I can do my translation work.</span>

<li>Sign in to <a href="http://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://people.live.com/</a></li><li>Select the contact which you want to remove from the list then click the <strong>
Delete </strong>button.</li><li>Sign out from the People page.</li><li>Sign in Skype client using your Microsoft account, then check if the contact is deleted, if not, delete it from the list.</li><li>Go back to People page to verify if the contact has been deleted already.</li></ol>

            HI,<br />
I do not have SKYPE installed on my laptop, but my home computer does.&nbsp; When I access my hotmail account on my laptop, the SKYPE contacts show up.&nbsp; I know how to hide them, but the problem is that someone that I don't know is making a SKYPE call to me on my
 laptop!&nbsp; I don't answer it, but it has occurred 5 times today and it is annoying.&nbsp; When I try to delete them in PEOPLE, it won't let me .&nbsp; I have removed SKYPE from my home computer.&nbsp; I need to remove these so they don't have the ability to reach out to me.&nbsp;

THanks!<br />

            Hi&nbsp;marjhan,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community. Let us help you on the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I understand that you're getting a Skype call from an anonymous contact. It's possible that you have linked your Skype account to your Outlook.com account which is the reason why you're getting Skype calls even if you don't have Skype installed on your
 laptop. I suggest that you unlink your Skype account from your Microsoft account. You can refer to the link below on how to do so:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p><span><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12211/how-do-i-unlink-my-skype-and-microsoft-or-facebook-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I unlink my Skype and Microsoft or Facebook accounts?</a></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, please check "Programs and Features" on your laptop to confirm that you don't have Skype installed in it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p><br />

"Some of these contacts come from another service and can't be deleted. Would you like to delete just the Outlook and Messenger contacts?"<br />

<p><strong>Today&nbsp;the server finally updated the db entries and the Skype contacts were removed. So it seems there is just a big delay until the contacts are updated when removing them from Skype or when unlinking the Skype account from the MS account.</strong></p>

I got a new computer. It had Skype on it (piece of garbage Skype is). I want to delete an Outlook&nbsp;contact but it won't let me because that contact is somehow linked to my unregistered/unsigned up for/unused Skype account.&nbsp;I finally buckled and opened Skype
 to see if I could delete the contact from Skype...it isn't in the Skype contact list.&nbsp;I've googled this for the past 2 hours and followed ALL the details on how to delete the Outlook contact, but NOTHING works.</p>

I understand the importance to delete the Skype contacts at Outlook.com. Please be informed that you have to delete the contacts in the Skype program in order to stop it from showing up at Outlook.com.</p>

Feel free to post back if you have other concerns about Outlook.com.</p>

                    I have installed many themes on my N80. I have enough free memory on both the phone and my miniSD card. Can anyone answer the following questions for me?<br />
<br />
1. I cannot install any more themes. Both from the phone, and using PCSuite, I get the message UNABLE TO INSTALL.<br />
2. I cannot remove some of the installed themes. I have checked in the APPLICATION MANAGER, but the installed themes are not listed there. Can anyon advise me on how to uninstall themes, or even delete them from the N80?

            How many themes do you have, and where are they loaded (phone or mem).<br />
<br />
Also the main issue, are they 100% compatable with S60v3? Many themes out there aren't

            I have 21 themes currently installed on a SanDisk Ultra 2GB memory card. The card has about 50MB free and the phone has 8MB free.<br />
<br />
After installing some new themes (mde for the N80), I seem to have "lost" some of the themes that were previously installed. Most of the themes on the phone are not listed in the Application Manager.<br />
<br />
Also, even after I have uninstalled some themes, I cannot install any more new themes - I get the error UNABLE TO INSTALL at the end of the installation process. This is when I try installing on both the SD card and the phone.<br />
<br />
I don't want to reset my phone at this point. Still on v3 firmware. Waiting for the download for V4 before I upgrade the firmware.

            Your notebooks are saved on Onedrive.
<br />
<br />If you open Onenote &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Save &amp; Backup &gt; Here you will find the path for Default Notebook location
<br />
<br />Copy one notebook from Onedrive to this location and see whether it appears or not. If yes, copy all others. (I haven't attempted this that is why I am asking you to experiment with one notebook first)

 accesses, possibly indicating access to the link to people other than the intended recipient.</p>

            Hi Snowas,<br />
<br />
I'd like to answer your questions as below:<br />
1. Therefore I think I should just send them an "anyone can view" link to the PDF document.?<br />
If you mean you want to share a file in your OneDrive for Business library with external users who doesn't have work/school accounts (the account which is related to OneDrive for Business and other Office 365 for Business services). You can choose Share&gt;Get
 a link&gt;choose Edit link-no sign-in required or View link-no sign-in required. It depends on if you want them to edit the PDF file. Users who are outside of your tenant can view/edit the PDF file without signing with work/school accounts. To learn more, see
<strong>Share a document by using Get a link</strong> section in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-documents-or-folders-in-Office-365-1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>.<br />
<br />
2.It's not feasible to check who accessed the file with the no sign-in required link. We cannot get the data about how many external users accessed the file with the link or their IP addresses. You may submit your requirement via
<a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Uservoice</a>. This is the best way to let the related team hear your voice. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Tim

    <title>Phone only makes emergency calls, icons are gone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adamvk---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phone only makes emergency calls, icons are gone</h2>
                    
<p>My Nokia 5800 Navigation edition has some serious issues. I'm wondering if it was in a bad batch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I can text, email, surf, but I CANT call people. When I try to call people, it says "emergency calls only."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) All of the icons/email preview does not show up on the home page. Even after a hard reset they were still not there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried putting my SIM card into another phone, and it worked perfectly fine, but when I put that person's SIM card into my Nokia phone, it had the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there ANYTHING I can do to fix it? I only bought it in December, so I'm hoping Nokia will just send me a new one...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for you help.</p>

<p>did you perform some backup before performing the hard reset? if yes what did you back up? files? settings? those are ones you shouldn't back up when your phone is not stable, because if you back them up while your phone is not stable and after a hard reset
 you restore them you will have the same issue again and it will be just like circle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>format your card memory, backup your contacts on the card memory, format your mass memory, perform a hard reset and tell me something.</p>

<p>Not being able to reset the phone only leaves you with the option of rebooting your phone by removing the battery and leaving it out for at least 5 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work then I would suggest sending it to your local care point. They will try fixing it before replacing it.</p>

            You can do a hard reset which won't need any keypad.<br />
<br />
Turn of the phone. Press camera-call-end buttons and power on. Keep holding them buttons down untill youre past the "nokia handshake logo screen". This is known as the hard reset. - This will delete everything on your phone memory.<br />
<br />
As I have understood you, youve been trying to diall *#7370#? - Try the hard reset i showed you!

<p>If your phone was second hand, it may have been stolen then sold off as legitimate, then the real owner reported the phone's IMEI code. Take the mobile device to your local police department or nokia care point, and verify that it has been stolen.</p>

                    My system is not completely stable. Cannot run sfc. When creating a USB repair the program quits with an error 0x80070013-0xA0019. I have upgraded from Windows 8 to 8.1 to windows 10 insider preview. To go back to Windows 8 and repeat that takes a very
 long time. I did it several times over the past few years. How can I get an ISO to reload windows 10 or how can I correct the errors?

<p>Any theme with anna icons can give this effect, simply install a dark wallpaper, as there is a slight shading on the background of the photo it is probably not Dark solid as that theme has a plain black background, personally I prefer just to have the anna
 icons and a few wallpapers thta look good on the phone ?</p>
<p>There are many available on the Ovi store and I use some from Tehkseven&nbsp;</p>

<p>My current theme is a standard anna theme Midnight Blue, but with a custom wallpaper, but the whole point is you have many ways to adopt your N8 and personalize it ?</p>

    <title>Calls Not Connecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kellycrum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calls Not Connecting</h2>
                    I'm trying to Skype with the end goal of screen sharing for work, and when my coworker and I try to call each other, it will try to connect and then the "call" will end. We'll both get missed call notifications even if nothing went through. Is there any
 way we can fix this?
