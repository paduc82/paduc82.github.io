<h2>            Old Windows XP</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Has anyone in the Microsoft Community experienced this yet. I made a new discovery today. In 2008 I created a Facebook page using Microsoft Windows XP. Over the course of 5 1/2 years, the News feed has been producing Spam, Malware and effecting everything
 up and including my phone. The News feed on Facebook was completely dismantled. Just to let you all know that if you have created any type of account using a Windows XP Computer, it is compatible with Windows 10 and will literally turn into Malware.&nbsp; I am
 in the processes of deleting the&nbsp; Facebook account.</p>
<p>I love the New Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t get OL2010 to show me Google Calendar reminders</h2>
                    I've got my Google calendar synchronized with Outlook 2010. I followed the instructions here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/18353/view-your-google-calendar-in-outlook-2010/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/18353/view-your-google-calendar-in-outlook-2010/</a>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In my Outlook 2010 calendar tab, I see two, my main outlook one and this extra Google calendar. When I look in that Google calendar in OL2010, I see all my calendar entries. If I go to a browser and add a new item, it syncs into Outlook just fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My problem is that these calendar items have no reminders. When I open each item in OL2010 it shows Reminder:None. Despite them all having 10 minute reminders over in Google itself. If I try and add a reminder directly in OL2010 for the items, I get the
 error message "<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">will not appear because the item is in a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">folder</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">doesn't

<p>ICS files are read only and does not support reminders. You may have to import the ICS appointments over to your default mailbox calendar as it cannot be opened directly from its location.</p>

    <title>Nokia predictive text sucks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thetao---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia predictive text sucks</h2>
                    
<p>I don't come here often to complain, as in spite of a few limitations, I've experienced few problems with my E73.&nbsp; But one feature that still puzzled me is Nokia's implementation of predictive text.&nbsp; I have been playing with it tonight and now can't believe
 it exists in its current form on a refined device like the E73.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, is there a really good on-line tutorial somewhere that explains the predictive text logic in-depth?&nbsp; Maybe that would help.&nbsp; (Keep in mind the E73 is a full-keyboard phone, and most tutorials I've seen assume a numeric keypad only.)&nbsp; But here are
 my main complaints:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Predictive text was not designed for use in the web browser.&nbsp; When typing in a text field, moving up or down is supposed to supply a list of possible words...but up and down are also how you navigate out of a text field on a S60 3rd ed. phone.&nbsp; There
 are so many times when I've wanted to move the cursor/pointer but see a list of words instead.&nbsp; There should be a way to either disable the word list, or to make it appear through some other means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Predictive text considers all punctuation the same as alphanumeric characters.&nbsp; When typing, it will insert the proper word, which I often want to immediately follow with a comma or a period, but this instead causes the word to truncate.&nbsp; I would prefer
 it treat all punctuation the same as a space, i.e, the end of the word.&nbsp; This might cause problems for words that contain punctuation, but there are relatively few of these.&nbsp; This would also keep snips of words out of the custom dictionary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I found Nokia's Custom Dictionary app on the Nokia Labs site just this evening.&nbsp; I appreciate them making it available, but it seems I shall be using it far too regularly to remove junk. :smileysad:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Sometimes I will see a single word suggestion floating in the window, but the suggestion is either for a capitalized word or for a word fragment.&nbsp; Perhaps I don't understand how this feature is meant to work, but right now it seems totally useless, and
 I would prefer to turn it off as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any comments or suggestions are welcome.</p>

            A possible solution to 1 is press the right softkey after typing the word. Then pressing the up or down key won't present a list of words.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of the issues, yes I'm just surprised how someone could pass that functionality in the present form. Typical Nokia.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>True.&nbsp; There may be other solutions, too, like pressing Right on the D-Pad?&nbsp; But these seen un-natural to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two other complaints:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I have "Number matches" disabled in Settings, but this doesn't prevent words beginning with numbers (or primarily containing numbers) from entering the user dictionary.&nbsp; I don't suppose it was actually designed to work this way, but think this would have
 been a good idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Has anyone else tried using their phone to Reply to a post ON THIS VERY BOARD with predictive text on??&nbsp; (And I mean Reply, not Quick Reply.)&nbsp; It's bizarre!&nbsp; Perhaps it's partly a browser bug with Javascript or CSS, but I do know the problem does not
 occur in textarea fields on other sites.&nbsp; If "Word auto-completion" is enabled, any words suggested by predictive text are taken as the correct word, and continuing to type will append the additional characters to that word.&nbsp; Separarely (I think), caps or
 numbers may be forced automatically.&nbsp; So when trying to type the word "something", this happens</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>s</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>sometimes</p>
<p>sometimese</p>
<p>sometimese2</p>
<p>sometimese26</p>
<p>sometimese26i</p>
<p>sometimese26i9</p>
<p>sometimese26i95</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully there is a Deactivate Prediction option on the menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that my phone is an E73, so your results may vary.</p>

            Yes actually I meant the D-pad right; never mind the slip. My model (E71) has, in addition to the option of turning the predictive text on or off, two additional options: Typing correction and Automatic word completion. If yours does have those options,
 try turning typing correction off (so you can type whatever you wish, even if it's A wrong word), and keep the automatic word completion turned on (so you still get the predicted word as faint text which you can commit by pressing the spacebar or the right
 D-pad or you can continue typing ignoring the completion). That way, you can always get the list of words by pressing the up and down keys. This fixes the problem you described using the "something" example.<br />
<br />
As for the right D-pad key feeling unnatural to tell the text field that you have completed your word and therefore no longer need the list of words, well, that's a bit subjective as I think there has to be some way to tell that the word is complete. So, what
 would be your choice for this? You can also press the spacebar for the purpose, but unless the receiving end trims the text, you'll then need to press backspace to delete the space character.

            Oh, just noticed you mentioned the problem occures only with the particular site. Well, I use the mobile version of the site while on the phone (it's easier and faster), so didn't experience that problem. But if you get the same text area (the phone's
 buit-in one to enter text) and not something specifically provided by the site, it's probably not the site's fault. And I'm surprised this doesn't happen on other sites. Weird.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>On the E73, the Predictive Text settings look like this (* = my settings)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Word auto-completion</p>
<p>Off</p>
<p>On *</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Text correction level</p>
<p>High</p>
<p>Medium *</p>
<p>Off</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Number matches</p>
<p>Not shown *</p>
<p>Shown</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Text correction mode</p>
<p>Show suggested word</p>
<p>Show test as entered *</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect the E71 is the same, even if the names are slightly different.&nbsp; All of my settings seem reasonable, so don't think changing them would alter the E73's behavior when replying to posts on this site with the Reply editor.&nbsp; BTW, while I can easily
 switch between the Full and Mobile interfaces, I've tended to use whatever the site serves me.&nbsp; Probably 90% of the time, the default is the Full version.&nbsp; Not sure if that's unusual, or why the version varies randomly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Predictive Text off, there is still a problem with textarea fields (but ONLY on this site!) where the caps lock can get stuck on.&nbsp; What appears to happen is the "capitalize first letter" feature, i.e. "Abc" in the title bar never reverts to "abc" after
 typing a character, the result being all caps.&nbsp; I can switch to lower case letters, but only one character at a time.&nbsp; The only "fix" is to move the cursor to a 1-line (i.e. a text input) field and type something there to trigger the change.&nbsp; So I don't know
 what the problem is, but the coding on this site appears to be triggering bug(s) in the browser. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My typical solution, though, is to use "Quick reply" instead of "Reply", which works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for telling the phone that a word is complete, the problem for me is the <em>
blocking</em> nature of the T9 dictionary list that appears when pressing Up or Down.&nbsp; I am still getting used to Nokia's Predictive Text, but have just realized this list crops up everywhere there is a full screen editor.&nbsp; It pops up in Notes, in QuickOffice,
 etc.&nbsp; But there is another popup GUI which floats in the window and appears to suggest user dictionary words and maybe mis-spelled words, just one word at a time.&nbsp; I would like an option to use this interface 100%, instead of the current blocking GUI:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Press an alphanumeric key, and it may suggest a combined list of T9 words, user dictionary words, and correctable words.&nbsp; Perhaps the number of suggestions can be configurable, too, from 2-5 words.&nbsp; Keep typing to ignore the choices, or press Fn+Up or
 Fn+Dn to access the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Press a non-alphanumeric key (space, period, comma, dash, etc.) to signify a word boundary.&nbsp; New words longer than 3 (?) characters go in the user dictionary, optionally ignoring words that start with, or primarily containing numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) When cursoring around a docunment, the GUI from 1) still appears, perhaps after a short delay.&nbsp; But it would never block your input, and would float around the window and hopefully never get in your way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above likely isn't perfect, but I think it would be much better than the current system.&nbsp; The trick would be to implement it in-house and then subject it to real-world testing...which IMHO wasn't done enough for the current implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with the move to touch screens, perhaps this thread is coming too late? :(</p>

            The way you posted the settings makes it so easy to see what exactly might be going on with the text prediction feature. Yes, the E71 is almost the same. The settings are all fine except I would suggest trying to set "Text correction level" to off and
 see if that makes it a bit more to your liking. Since the specific problem seems to appear only on this site, it would seem the phone's feature is not something that's at the wrong. Instead of changing the predictive text settings awkwardly to make them compatible
 with one site and breaking them for everything else, I think it's more suitable to mold the particular site's behavior while you still can, that is, either use Quick Reply or use the mobile version. The version presented by default depends upon the site itself
 - it sniffs the client (the browser) and for some browsers determines that the desktop version is the best and for some others thinks that the mobile version would be a good thing as the client might not handle all the features efficiently. Therefore, the
 default version (desktop or mobile) served by the website of itself changes from browser to browser. Then too, on one and the same browser, if the site has stored a cookie with your preferences, it might display the last chosen version the next time. Cookies
 keep getting deleted or expiring; so the version served by the site might change again. So yes, it's almost random.<br />
<br />
Quick Reply uses the plain text mode, so it works normally.<br />
<br />
I didn't quite get your description of the T9's list of words. What is meant by the 'blocking' nature? Does it mean that it makes you to necessarily choose one of the suggested words? Well, if that is the case, Nokia really makes it a big deal to type something
 different from the suggested word; it seems to think whatever it's chosen for you is simply the best and exactly what you want. That is the aspect I don't like of Nokia, and it's apparent everywhere, not just in the text prediction feature. Little customization.
 And the defaults are not suited for normal humans, I don't know where, if at all, they get the user experience reports from.<br />
<br />
The 3-point wishlist you presented above is amazing; my idea of a perfect text prediction system too. And the sad thing is, it could have been done with the existing technology as it requires no changes in the underlying structure. (Given what the predictive
 system already does, the above suggestions could easily have been made into the options.) But Nokia just doesn't understand how normal people use their device. That's why it always takes an awkward number of clicks to get to a feature no matter how common
 it might be.<br />
<br />
A little off-topic: When you open a pictures folder (not the Gallery which I never understood what it is other than a mess) and click on a picture to view it, what is your immediate expectation? That you'd press the D-pad keys to view the previous/next pictures.
 Isn't it? Well, not possible. You need to close the viewer, scroll to the next picture, and click it again. Same with the music or video files. Talk about usability studies.

<p>Thanks for the "Text Correction Level" suggestion.&nbsp; I made the change, and so far don't see a major difference, but will toggle it back and forth for a couple days to experiment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By "blocking", I meant to say that that when pressing Up or Down on a word, the T9 lists steals focus away from the cursor.&nbsp; You can't keep cursoring and must respond to the list.&nbsp; I am slowly training myself to the Nokia way of doing things, but it's still
 annoying. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's possible the version of this site that appears is cookie controlled, but at the same time, my E73 seems to be logged-in permanently, through a cookie, of course.&nbsp; It would be odd for one cookie to keep expiring while the login cookie remains, so I am
 still leaning towards a bug in the web site.&nbsp; It's only a small inconvenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By "pictures folder", do you mean a directory of pictures (like camera snapshots) as seen through the File Manager?&nbsp; I expect the D-Pad to do
<em>something</em>, and just remembered that it's used here to scroll around the picture, it it's either too large for the screen or if you've zoomed in.&nbsp; But using left and right to move through a directory of pictures does make a lot of sense.&nbsp; There are
 very few times when you have just one picture, and closing one picture only to load a new one wastes unnecessary time.&nbsp; I don't use the Gallery much either, as it takes a long time to load.&nbsp; It seems like a feature Nokia might use to advertise the phone in
 a video presentation, but which isn't terribly useful in practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all the feedback! :)</p>

<p>Sorry to hijack your thread but I can't find a button to start a new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I type "Hello" for my first word my e7 changes it to hello. If I type "hello" it changes it to Hello. I find this really annoying. I can go back through my message and edit it, but it makes it much less convenient. My PC, laptop, pencil and Biro all write
 what I input. At&nbsp; "the cemetry side of the semi-century", I find it hard to write wrong to get it to come out write.</p>

<p>All topics on this forum seem to suggest turning off the predictive text on other phones, but nothing particular to mine. In Settings, Phone, Language, Predictive text, I only have 2 tick boxes namely Number keypad and Letter keyboard. Both are un-checked.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to disable this annoying quirk?</p>

            Well, after less than one day with this new build I had to revert back to build 14295. My system would periodically reboot on its on with no warning. So, I will wait for the next build.

If you have a good OCR application with your scanner you would be best to scan into Word first.</p>
<p>Clean it up then import into Excel.</p>

            As Gord says, what you want to do is use an OCR, Optical Character Recognition, tool to convert the printout back into digital.<br />
<br />
Office 2013 comes with 2 ways of doing this, Word and OneNote.<br />
<br />
For example, if you have access to scanner:<br />
<ol>
<li>scan the paper into PDF</li><li>Open the PDF in Word 2013</li><li>copy the table from Word to Excel</li><li>Save</li></ol>
<p>If your Scanner does not do PDFs:</p>
<ol>
<li>scan the paper to an image file</li><li>open the image file in OneNote</li><li>Right click on image, select "extract text"</li><li>Paste the text into Word</li><li>clean up unneeded "stuff", like row and column headings, typos, other unneeded text</li><li>add tabs or spaces between columns</li><li>convert text to a table, or save as TXT for import into Excel<br />
</li></ol>
<pre><br />Here is an example of text captured from an image in OneNote<br /><br />The Image<br /><br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c7526bb-b30a-40c4-9e30-61e79f364605" /><br /><br /><br />The text captured in OneNote<br /><br />

    <title>Any solutions to keep calendars separate between the two outlook email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tas911  say:</h3>
<h2>            Any solutions to keep calendars separate between the two outlook email accounts&#63;</h2>
                    I know how to set up two separate email accounts using outlook 2003 where you can toggle between the two accounts for sending and reading emails. However, when you send calendar invites on outlook, it says "sent on behalf of xxx from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** for
 *** Email address is removed for privacy ***" or something similar. It references both emails on the send invitation. Does outlook 2003 calendar have the capability to totally separate the two calendars? I feel that outlook calendar is assuming that one email account is a "designate"
 of the other thus this mixed up situation.<br />
<br />
Any solutions to keep calendars separate between the two outlook email accounts?

<p>The only way to keep them separate is by using 2 profiles, one for each account.

<h2>            Orange dots</h2>
                    In my word there are orange dots showing instead of the icons. This happens for all of the icons but specific examples are icons like 'align text", "bold, inserting bullet points. And then along with these orange dots, my word is not working properly,
 it always shuts down and says it is not responding, I have a hard time opening downloads. How do I fix what is happening?&nbsp;

            <p>Nothing in this regard has changed in Office 2016... It's still single page displayed as a picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMHO, nothing about this is likely to change any time soon. My understanding is that OLE as you are referencing it is a Windows OS technology not supported by Apple in OS X.</p>

<p>Hi Rodolfo,</p>

<li><span>Go to the&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft account family page</a></span><span>&nbsp;and add
 your family members. Then visit your&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">family leaderboard</a></span><span>&nbsp;in Microsoft Rewards to give
 points.</span></li><li>At the moment a level 1 Microsoft Rewards member may only give or receive 1,000 points per calendar month. Level 2 members may give or receive 5,000 points per calendar month. These limits may change over time.</li></ol>
<p>If you have any other concerns, Please reply here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble finding the URL at the moment, but I am positive I remember reading in the fine print/terms that there was a lifetime maximum amount of points that can be transferred besides the monthly limits, I don't remember what that total amount
 of points was, nor can I recall if the lifetime maximum was placed on the amount of points sent or the amount of points received (as I recall it was only for one of them, sending or receiving).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have been changed since then of course, so if someone could please confirm and link any Microsoft documentation to clarify this [if it exists]; Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Profile picture doesn&#39;t show up on receiving end of my emails</h2>
                    Do I have to have a social network account so that recipients of my emails can see my profile picture? Although I set up my outlook account with a profile picture, it doesn't show up in emails I send to others.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to clarify the issue, are your recipients currently navigating their mailbox with&nbsp;the new Outlook.com interface?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the recipient of your emails is also using Outlook.com, it is by default that your profile picture should appear after you send an email to your recipient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Sugestion for new firmwire in N73</h2>
                    I bought N73 week ago. Eariel I had E50. It have greate function: when you have new SMS, e-mail, mised call samll LED informs you about that. In some new model it is also. In n73 it is LED too but in turn on when screen off and informs you that phone is
 ON. Programers from Nokia, please put in N73 new option like in e50.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for my Eanglish.

            The N73 has been available for 2 years. If they were going to add that feature (if it was even possible) they would have done it by now.<br />
<br />
The feature has been added to the N73's replacement model, the N78.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's time you moved on to a newer model?<br />

            Actually, that does make sense.<br />
<br />
The blue LED flashes for a brief instant periodically to let you know the phone is in sleep mode. If it's received a message that you've not yet read, it would make sense to take advantage of the LED already there and make it flash differently to show that
 there are unread messages. Good idea.

            It does make sense but don't you think they would have done it by now if they could?<br />
<br />
The LED was part of the N73's design because it was one of the first models to totally blank it's screen in sleep mode.

            You're probably right. It's a shame they didn't think of that right from the word "go". It would be a far more discrete way of letting you know you have unread messages than Motorola's "I'm gonna bleep every 5 minutes until you read them".

            It would and that's why the feature has been appearing on more models. Most of the new FP2 models do it and some of the recent FP1 models do too (E66 and possibly E71).<br />
<br />
A few series 40's have the feature too (7500 springs to mind).<br />
<br />
The LED on the N73 is most likely not controllable by software and is triggered by the hardware going into the sleep state.

            In 6300 screen totaly off too, but it has LEDs informs you like in e50. This LED in n73 is irritating. If they colundn't change it to be like in e50, they sholud give possibility to off it like in Samsung. When I put phone front of me and I'm watching
 TV it is irritating when it bliping

I had exactly the same problem with my N73, but not while watching TV, but by trying to fall asleep. And I did exactly what is mentioned above - put it face downwards...even though I always felt I was scratching the display...<br />
<br />
But beczkas maybe you should really follow psychomanias advice and move on to a newer model... how about the N78! :)

There is a ridge around the screen and the joystick sticks out from the keypad a few millimetres too. So, unless there's something under the phone, its screen won't even be in contact with anything.<br />
<br />
As for upgrading to the N78, that's a nice idea, but are <i>you</i> going to buy it for him? :)<br />

 365 and I would like to hide them for those list.&nbsp; I have tried in the Exchange Admin section of Office 365 but when I select the option to hide them from the list I get a message that I can't since they are synced with our on prem AD.&nbsp; Is there a way to hide
 these accounts from Office 365 list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I have a few Distribution groups created in our on premises AD that are synced and I would like to also hide those from the list in Office 365.&nbsp; Is there a way to hide those also?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brent</p>

            <p>Since you are synchronizing your local AD, any changes to attributes need to be made there first. In this case, you will need to modify the msexchhidefromaddresslists attribute on any objects that you do not want to be visible in the GAL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this is an Exchange attribute, you need to have the local AD schema extended in order to use it.</p>

<h2>            Onedrive for Business Does Not Sync OneNote &#42;.ONE Files&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am setting up Office 365 for my office and am syncing common excel and word files using Onedrive for Business. &nbsp;We also have a shared Onenote notebook on our server that we all use that I would like to sync with Office 365 as well. &nbsp;Onedrive for Business
 appears to specifically exclude all *.ONE files and I am suspecting that is because it wants you to use the share functionality directly in Onenote to get it into Office 365 and share it out from there. &nbsp;The problem is that when doing that, it removes it from
 its existing location. &nbsp;I would very much rather go the route where the files are left on our server here and any changes are synced up to Office 365 like we can do for all other files, rather than be forced to move the entire notebook up to Office 365. &nbsp;Any
 solutions out there?</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>It is not feasible to sync the OneNote files with OneDrive for Business sync client. If you add a OneNote notebook to a local folder that syncs with SharePoint Online, the notebook won't sync with the SharePoint site and may cause other sync errors within
 the local folder.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Ran</p>

<h2>            Renew Office 365 Home using a new product key</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Office 365 Home for nearly a year - it expires next Tues 1 December.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a new Office 365 Home product key (from a reputable supplier) as the new code cost slightly less than renewing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I enter my account, click "Renew with an Office product key", and enter the new product key, the error message below constantly appears</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my current Office 365 Home expires - will I be able to use the code then?</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<div>An error has occurred</div>
