                    <p>Ok,&nbsp;was sitting here watching some kind of show on Mixer. Was about to get out from on a Channel and into watching another one, when all of a sudden one screen pops up and says Congratulations and hey ho.</p><p>What the....? I thought. And saw that I was suddenly signed up (Account) to the Mixer thing. I never signed up to anything, at least it was never my intention to sign up to any Mixer though.</p><p><br /></p><p>Now I want to know: How the F am I going to cancel out of Mixer for good again? When never actually even signed up to Mixer even.</p><p>I watch on some of the Channels a little while couple times a month. I have no interest in being signed up an account there.<br /></p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Black Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tamara908  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Black Screen</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 4 that has ALWAYS (literally since the first time I used it) had issues shutting down on me. I was always able to get it back with the buttons (power and + volume, and everything else). After the last update, it crashed. The keyboard
 lights up but nothing on the screen. Of course it's out of warranty. I took it to the Microsoft store and they said that there was nothing they could do. Can this be fixed? If not, is Microsoft going to help those of us with these issues? So far, nobody in
 Customer Service can help me and seems to be clueless as to who&nbsp; can. This is a major problem, what is Microsoft doing to help us who were so adversely affected by your updates and inferior product? NOBODY in Microsoft will help me or even give me any kind
 of answer, they just keep shuffling me to other people. I'm at a loss!

            As stated, I've tried all of those things in the article you suggested. I took it to the Microsoft store and they told me nothing can be done. My keyboard lights up when I try to get it going, but it never comes on. And yes, I agree there is a software
 issue which is why I'm wondering what Microsoft is going to do to fix this? I know I'm not the only one this has happened to.&nbsp;

If there´s no life at all then it has to be exchanged (and if you are out of warranty you would have to pay a fee to get it exchanged)</p>

            This is my problem with how Microsoft is handling this. First of all, nobody has the ability to actually help me. My only option is to buy another one, because mine is, of course, out of warranty (well played Microsoft). This is a software problem with
 your product!! And there is no recourse when your product fails! As a consumer, it's ridiculous. I should not have to purchase anything since this is an issue on your end!! And apparently, Microsoft has nobody employed within this entire conglomerate who can
 actually help a paying customer with anything. The only option to get this fixed is for me to give you more money; that is ridiculous! Why would I buy another one? This one has given me nothing but grief and nobody within Microsoft gives a crap. You all must
 make a lot more money than I do if you think this is acceptable. This is a KNOWN problem, and has been since it was released. What are you doing to fix it?&nbsp;

            There are a lot of people who are having this problem. Microsoft is not taking any responsibility for it. It's like your company is ok just taking people's money, sending out something to kill their computers then sending out an "update" that kills them.
 Sounds like a scam to me.&nbsp;

 At first I thought it was in colluded with&nbsp;the new set up. Because I'm computer&nbsp;alliterate I let them connect remotely, I started to worry that maybe it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a scam, so I investigated and read revues, not good, so I turned my computer off.&nbsp;When I&nbsp;restart
 my computer&nbsp;I call the support # that came with the information&nbsp;for the HP window 8. he suggested to do a&nbsp;factory reset. he&nbsp;took control and help me.&nbsp;A couple weeks later things started to miss up IE 11 started to crash, lost, connection lost. cant get to
 some web sits&nbsp;,&nbsp;I could be here for hours, when I ran the update it&nbsp;automatically upgraded to&nbsp;&nbsp;window 8.1. things haven't worked right from the beginning . I says &nbsp;my&nbsp;windows is activated. so can anyone help. should I start over again and if so where do I
 find help with doing that. -</p>

            Thanks much but a similar fix works on my computer by clicking on the <strong>
gear </strong>at top right, then <strong>options</strong>, then on <strong>focused inbox</strong> in the column which appears on the left side. Similar idea, just different locations. Use Windows 10 and Firefox.

    <title>How to force Windows Explorer to always show medium icons&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> susanpowell1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to force Windows Explorer to always show medium icons&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Early versions of Windows (Win95-Win2000) let me set my preference for how I wanted to display files and folders and forget about it until having to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; Ever since Windows XP added bag MRU support and messed around with media folders, I have
 not been able to get Explorer to behave properly.&nbsp; I want Medium icons at all times regardless of folder.&nbsp; Sometimes Explorer will inexplicably decide to switch a single folder to List or Large Icons view.&nbsp; I should be able to set the option I permanently
 want somewhere and never have to worry about it again.&nbsp; My OCD views this as a serious bug in Windows Explorer and it needs to be fixed.&nbsp; Using the "Apply to Folders" button in the Folder Options dialog does NOT fix the problem.&nbsp; I can enter a folder and it
 will show correctly one minute and then I'll leave to go do something else in another folder and then come back and the view will change.&nbsp; This issue happens multiple times per day, especially when working with images and video Explorer will switch the view
 to Large icons mode.&nbsp; I'll switch it back to Medium icons and all will be well for five minutes before I hit save in Photoshop and Explorer decides that the latest file requires Large icons mode again.&nbsp; Ack!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Constantly wrestling with Explorer is unacceptable.&nbsp; If there's an application that I can run to force Explorer to operate correctly, I'd very much appreciate that.&nbsp; However, Microsoft should just nuke Explorer from orbit and build something that just plain
 works.</p>

<p>That indicates that the only custom template you've created is for the Generic/Unspecified folder types. You can determine which template a folder is using by viewing the
<strong>Customize</strong> tab in its <strong>Properties</strong> dialog. You should repeat the process of setting the view to your liking and then using
<strong>Apply to folders</strong> for folders of type Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, Contacts, Desktop (folder in This PC), the main Libraries folder, and the &lt;<em>UserName</em>&gt;folder on the Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There will still be some folders that have their own views initially, but they should save any modifications you make to the view.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that a folder only seeks out a template when it hasn't yet been opened and saved its individual view. So it&nbsp;may seem as if some folders are ignoring your templates.</p>
<p>We can fix that if need be. But please try using Apply to folders as described above and see if that improves things.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Think I heard that the Adept would have a psionic blade sort of like Psylocke from the X-men, but I'd prefer something more like the biotic powered punch Jack hits the YMIR whith when she's escaping purgatory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">As for the concept in general? It's a nice touch, but doesn't really fit with the combat of the ME universe imo. The only class that should be getting that close in combat is the Vanguard really. Maybe if as an Adept you could
 chain the move it would make sense - Pull followed by melee just as they reach you.</span></p>

<p>It reminds me of Knight Commander Merediths lyrium sword in DA2, just a smaller version. &nbsp;It cant be a bad thing though. Apart from the achievement for killing husks after knocking them back with a punch, I cant remember using the shoulder move. It was dreadful.
 So, a definate improvement in my book.</p>

<p>Considering that Kasumi had a melee attack very similar to the newly added Omni-blade I'm a bit surprised as to why people are so against this.</p>
<p>Even in today's military world of combat drones, heat seeking missles, good ol' automatic rifles our military still uses knives and bayonettes and trains with them. Being able to whip a blade to someone's throat in close combat makes as much sense today
 as it did 500 years ago, I'm glad to see that sensibility brought to a fictional future.</p>

<p>original title: Windows 7 wont start, sometimes as if it's not there anymore</p>
<p>My CPU is an Intel i7 860 with GPU nvidia gtx275 and 4GB of RAM. It's pretty new and not even a year old yet. Overall it's not a bad computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, like a week ago it started lagging some, then it got worse after a few days. The<em>HDD light</em> is always showing and i can hear the computer working hard as if I'm running many programs at once. But my from my<em>task manager</em> , i
 can see that the CPU speed is like lower than 5% and the RAM like 30% which is normal. Sometimes the lag is gone and sometimes it's back. When it happens, even when when i watch videos, the videos lag. Then later, my computer start restarts on its own. On
 one of the restart, after <em>POST</em> , the desktop computer runs<em>chkdsk</em> or something like that, that scans the C: drive for errors , i think, and i let it do that. And i can still go into the computer after. But it just goes downhill. The restarts
 became more often and the '<em>Starting Windows</em> ' screen at start became longer and longer. After another restart, there was 2 options '<em>Launch System Recovery Tools</em> ' and '<em>Start Windows Normally</em> ' i cant remember if thats exactly what
 they are called. I run<em>System Recovery Tools</em> and restart after that and i can still come back into the computer. I run my<em>Avast! Anti-virus</em> program to check for virus but there isn't any. I have also tried to use<em>System Restore</em> but
 there isn't any restore points created, which is unusual because there was always some restore points. After yet another restart later, i couldn't get back into the computer anymore. After<em>POST</em> , at the screen of '<em>Loading Operating System</em>
 ....', instead of going to '<em>Starting Windows</em> ', it say something like '<em>Failed to load Operating System, insert the CD into CD/DVD drive</em> '. Sorry, i am not very good at recalling stuff. But i do not have the CD, Windows 7 was installed in
 the pc before i bought it. So i reset the computer and it came up with '<em>Windows Error Recovery</em> ' and i have the 2 options '<em>Launch System Recovery Tools</em> ' and '<em>Start Windows normally</em> ' like before, but this time after i use the first
 option, it just stops at a blank screen and nothing else.... i reset the computer again and i chose the second opting and it does nothing again (just stops at the blank screen). I keep trying to turn off and restart my computer several times now. After that,
 it will came up with <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">one of these every time now</span> : 1) Insert CD 2)
<em>Windows Error Recovery</em> 3) it will go on to '<em>Starting Windows</em> ' but blank screen after that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, i didn't realize i have written so many. Hopefully the extra details will be of help instead of being confusing :) Please help me!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.</p>
<p>To boot with a Windows 7 disk (full or repair) go into Settings/Setup (BIOS/CMOS) often<br />
F2 as you boot so watch screen - set to CD/DVD 1st in boot order. Remember to set it<br />
back when done.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't get to Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder to see the location, enable Hidden Files &amp; Folders and the path to the message store will be very similar to this:</p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\Your User Name\Local Settings\Application Data\Identities\{Long string of letters &amp; numbers}\Microsoft\Outlook Express</p>

<p>All of those have the same cause.&nbsp; Something is screwed up with your address book.</p>
<p>It could be any of several specific problems, which include:<br />
&nbsp;- corrupted WAB file<br />
&nbsp;- corrupted or mismatched DLL files for the address book<br />
&nbsp;- having OE set to use the Outlook98/2000+ contacts instead of the WAB<br />
file and there is something wrong at the Outlook end</p>

<p>You probably need to follow the link from PA Bear if that is the case.</p>
<p>You can try deleting Folders.dbx first and rebooting. Here is what to expect as a side effect.</p>
<p>Consequences of deleting Folders.dbx:<br />
<a href="http://www.insideoe.com/files/store.htm#deldbx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.insideoe.com/files/store.htm#deldbx</a></p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The path to the message store will be very similar to this:</p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\Your User Name\Local Settings\Application Data\Identities\{Long string of letters &amp; numbers}\Microsoft\Outlook Express</p>
<p>Locate Folders.dbx and delete it. a new one will be created when you open OE.</p>
<p>Again, if this doesn't help, follow the instructions in the link from PA Bear.</p>

<h2>            My computer has been attacked by an application called Disk Doctor</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>this application, Disk Doctor, wants to run a defragmentation and possibly scan and clear my HDD. I have F-Secure installed, and when it warned me, i blocked the software, but apparently the Disk cleaner and the Defrag Scanner bit of it are installed.</p>
<p>the path i think it's in is c:/docs and settings/user/Local settings/ temp/15467765.exe; or it could be in c:/ docs and settings/user/start menu/programs/disk doctor</p>
<p>I've tried to delete them from there, but next time i restart the computer, they're still there</p>
<p>then there also is a c/WINDOWS/ 15467754 PF file. i think this is&nbsp;a genuine system file, but I don't really know...?</p>
<p>i don't seem to be able to uninstall it from Control Panel, as it doesn't appear on the list of programs.&nbsp;And if i click its Uninstall icon,&nbsp;it doesn't let me do it either, also because&nbsp;the window&nbsp;remains open from after login, and can't be closed.</p>
<p>It says that there are problems with my HD, etc...</p>
<p>When i click on the Help tab of the window that stays open, it takes me to <a href="https://secure.defragmentersupport.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://secure.defragmentersupport.com</a> and the website apparently is called Secure Payments INC, which indicates to me that it's clearly after my money</p>
<p>Please can somebody tell me how to eliminate it from my computer, as i can't access my files</p>
<p>Windows XP home</p>
<p>thank you</p>

One day they worked and the next day did not work anymore. I don't even know whats happens. Spend for each around 250 euro and now they are piece of crap. XBOX&nbsp;is still on warrant. Can i ask Microsoft for refund? They should, because they were connected to console via USB and look like and console broke them. Any advise from Microsoft site ??</p>

<h2>            Need to reinstall hard drive, possible corrupt file, will Windows 10 reinstall or upgrade again&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was hoping that the Windows 10 upgrade would fix whatever was corrupted on my hard drive but it hasn't. I am still having problems with increasing slowness with my wifi connectivity. Is replacing the hard drive different than upgrading the operating system?
 I think it is but want confirmation of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, if I reinstall my hard drive, do I install Windows 10 or 7 back in? My product key or whatever I have got is for Windows 7, 64 Bit, Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Sybil,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would require more information to help you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since when you’re facing slowness in Wi-Fi connectivity?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When connecting to a wireless network (Wi</span><span>‑</span><span>Fi), your Internet connection speed can be affected by both where your computer is located and whether other wireless devices are in the same area. Wireless networks operate on frequencies
 that are similar to those used by other devices, such as microwave ovens or cordless phones. Operating a 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) cordless phone next to your 2.4 GHz wireless laptop can cause interference, or completely block the wireless network connection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Proximity to the wireless access point or router, as well as physical obstructions, can affect the quality of your Internet connection. To improve your connection speed, move closer to the access point and make sure that there are no physical obstructions
 between the access point and your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to refer to Andre Da Costa post from the below link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/if-i-need-to-reinstall-windows-what-to-do-to/00881c62-88a6-4b43-8aa1-9a4e6b43c953">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/if-i-need-to-reinstall-windows-what-to-do-to/00881c62-88a6-4b43-8aa1-9a4e6b43c953</a></span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Five weeks ago, my computer slowed down terribly. I consulted my organization's tech support and learned I needed extra RAM but that in order to install it, I had to switch from a 32 bit o/s to 64 bit o/s (both Windows 7). My husband helped with the installation
 and it wiped my drive clean. I had, unfortunately, saved all of my files, but not my programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put MS Office Suite, downloaded other software I needed, reinstalled my backed up files, and we got everything back up to speed. I did several rounds of Dell analytics (I have a Dell Latitude E6320), and installed a utility cleaner as well as antivirus
 program. But, unfortunately, I still have a problem where the Internet starts very speedy but gets bogged down during the day the more I use it. It used to knock itself off of wifi if I didn't manually disconnect and reconnect every couple of hours when it
 was getting too slow. Manually disconnecting and reconnecting still seems to help regain speed although I am not sure that is still sporadically disconnecting on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has nothing to do with location to router or strength of wifi connection, though I wish it were that simple of a fix. Dell support had told me I need to reinstall my hard drive as it seems a file is corrupt, but I was waiting to see if upgrading to
 Windows 10 would do the trick. I don't think it has. I think I need to reinstall the hard drive again. So if I do that, will Windows 10 come back? I had purchased a Windows 7, 64 bit hard drive and I had then purchased the Office 7 Suite for this whole rigamarole
 (plus that extra RAM of course.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any words of wisdom.</p>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>My Xbox Slim's power adaptor is dead ( no light at all) and I have already tried unplugging and plugging in back the cable out from power outlet and Xbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Is there any official reseller or online store in Singapore selling the power adaptor brick of Xbox since I do not see one while googling for it ? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hey Master Mac X, </p>
<p>There's a nifty Xbox 360 No Power Solution guide that may be your best bet at this time:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/console/xbox-360-no-power-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../xbox-360-no-power-solution</a> </p>
<p>You'll notice you've probably already tried some of the steps there. If also trying another room entirely didn't work, it may be time to setup a repair. Another good test is borrowing a friend's power supply to see if it works properly for the console.

<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you have a few doubts regarding Windows 10 updates. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>wuauclt.exe /detectnow</span></strong><span> command is actually forcing an update detection.

<ol>
<li><span>Open Windows Update by swiping in from the right edge of the screen (or, if you're using a mouse, pointing to the lower-right corner of the screen and moving the mouse pointer up), tapping
 or clicking <strong>Settings</strong>, tapping or clicking <strong>Change PC settings</strong>, and then tapping or clicking

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once automatic updates are enabled, launch Command Prompt in Administrator mode and enter the following command:

</p><p>Thank you for replying me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;I still cannot confirm that <strong><span>wuauclt.exe /detectnow</span></strong><span> command does work in Windows 10, because it&nbsp;was unable to check the running result from windows update log files. There is no log output&nbsp;after&nbsp;executing
 the </span><strong><span>wuauclt.exe /detectnow</span></strong><span> command.(I checked the windows update log from "Windows\SoftwareDistribution\ReportingEvents.log")</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, I dump the parameter information from the </span><strong><span>wuauclt.exe
</span></strong>command. It seems like there is no functionality&nbsp;of&nbsp;"/detectnow" for wuauclt.exe command in Windows 10 Pro.
</p>
<p>Parameters I found for wuauclt.exe command are listed below:</p>
<p><span>/RunHandlerComServer</span></p>
<p><span>/IdleShutdownNow</span></p>
<p><span>/ReportNow</span></p>
<p><span>/ResetEulas</span></p>
<p><span>/ResetAuthorization</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, my purpose is to check the windows updates by command line in Windows 10. So is there alternative command can be used to finish the task in Windows 10?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            May the problem with no updates have to do with the network connection type? I believe lot of users now a days are using laptops with inbuilt or USB connected mobile devices. I believe Update system discovers mobile connection as a possible "connection
 causing costs" and do not automatically perform checking and downloading. I have seen a warning of it somewhere. Checking and downloading of updates do start, when performing &nbsp;<strong><span>wuauclt.exe /detectnow</span></strong><span>&nbsp;command.
 &nbsp;<br />
.... following is currently just suspecting ...<br />
When automatic updates have not been performed because of previous assumptions, normal users have not even noticed missing updates. When they request your help and you start /detectnow, checking and downloading of updates proceed as long as you use the connection
 for something else. Latest experience seemed to stop downloading after a while when I just left the laptop on. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I believe Microsoft should add a configurable feature to update system, where user can convince the mobile connection to be "non extra cost affecting" and by that mean allow it's use for continuous operations, whenever it is connected and functional.<br />
<br />
At least here in Finland 4G/3G mobile data connection agreements are</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;often</span><span> with unlimited data usage.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;

            <p>I found this one which does appear to do what you are after.</p>
<p>this will indeed show the feature update for windows 10 1607 (AKA Anniversary update)</p>
<p>I used it to go right from 10240 to 1607</p>
<p>
</p><p>it takes a LONG time to run. &nbsp;it will download the update files and stage them in c:\<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">$</span>Windows<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">.~</span>BT<br />
The script will exit saying that the update completed with result code 2. &nbsp;Then you manually restart the machine. &nbsp;The first reboot doesnt seem to do anything. &nbsp;it reboots fast. and still says its version 10240. I was confused by this, and I ran wuauclt /detectnow
 from the admin command line. (or maybe wuauclt /reportnow, I dont remember.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I checked the update control panel thing and saw the machine wanted to schedule a restart. &nbsp;I hit Restart Now, and I am watching it finish the anniversary update. its been about 2 hours now. since I started the script, and its at 71% of the install.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Arnulfo Avi</p>
<p>I just pluged the picopix to the minidisplay-HDMI adapter, and the display of surface book suddenly become off for about 2 minutes, and on again without any response to the Picopix. If I did that thing to other projectors, it will be good displayed. And,
 If I connected the picopix to other windows laptops, It is also good.</p>
<p>I have updated the picopix firmware from their newest one, but it was not working also.</p>
<p>I am looking foward your reply.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Indeed, with this new version Skype 8.15.0.4, Windows 10 (1511) is no more supported and might require to be installed in "Compatibility mode with Windows 8". Should fix the problem, thanks for the tip.</p>
