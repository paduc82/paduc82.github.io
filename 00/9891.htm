    <title>Macro Function is not working correctly in Word 2016 for Windows 7. It - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aintie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macro Function is not working correctly in Word 2016 for Windows 7.  It says &#39;support for macros or controls not installed&#39;.  WHY&#63;  How to fix this FAST&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Office 365 with Excel 2016 for about a month and there has been no problems with Macros there, however, I just learned today that this new Office 365 with Word 2016 has this problem - Macro tool is there and seemingly available and usable
 but will not begin recording because of some missing support files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know how to make a Macro and it works fine in Excel, BUT it's missing software support for macros and controls working in Word.</p>
<p>DETAILS:&nbsp; When I start to use the Macro Tool in Word, you can name it, choose where to store it, and type in a description, but when you try to proceed to recording the macro, by clicking 'OK', it says 'function requires macro language support, you or your
 administrator chose not to install support for macros or controls when this software was installed'.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; NOT TRUE. &nbsp;&nbsp; I AM my own administrator and I DID NOT CHOOSE to NOT install anything in this office software package. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need HELP to fix this FAST!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE NOTE:&nbsp; Macros work fine in Excel 2016, I've been using them without any issues, BUT NOT in Word 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just discovered this today. I did not even use them (in this recently purchased and installed version of Office 365 for Windows with Word 2016)
 until today when one class of 8 that began today was being taught on this!!!&nbsp; I need to fix this FAST because I had 8 office software classes START today and this has now cost me over 4 hours of time trying to search for a solution on Office.com and on answers.microsoft.com
 only to find that several others have had this problem since last July, when the Preview of Office 2016 was released for Office 365 version, and more have had it recurring again on December 20, 2015 where people were apparently missing a file in the program
 after some Office Update was done on December 20, 2015 and left them with crippled or missing Macro usage.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Thanks so much<br />
</p>

 amongst other remedies.</p>

            <p>Thank you.&nbsp; Yes, I finally found a Microsoft website article for 'Repair an Office Application' and it also referred to the 'Fix It' solution you mentioned.</p>
<p>The frustrating thing is that I could not find this info by searching on Office.com but when I googled the same question out on the web it brought up a link to the info at Office.com!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And even more frustrating was that I was also on the phone with Office 365 Tech Support for an hour and they actually told me that "this was beyond our limitations", they couldn't solve it, they would have to transfer me to what they called "Commercial Tech
 Router" dept. only to hold again and then learned that they were closed for the day!&nbsp;&nbsp; They did not even suggest uninstalling and reinstalling but at that point I was beginning to realize that something must have gone haywire when it installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link I've shown below gave these instructions for doing a Quick Repair or an Online Repair:</p>
<p><em>In Windows 7 or Vista </em></p>
<p><span><span><em>1.</em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><em>Click Start &gt; Control Panel.</em></p>
<p><span><span><em>2.</em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><em>Click Programs &gt; Programs and Features.</em></p>
<p><span><span><em>3.</em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><em>Click the Office product you want to repair, and then click Change.</em></p>
<p><span><span><em>4.</em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><em>In Office 2013 and Office 2016, click either Quick Repair &gt; Repair or Online Repair &gt; Repair. In Office 2010, click Repair &gt; Continue.</em></p>
<p><em>Note: &nbsp; If you bought a suite like Microsoft Office 365 Home or Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013, search for the suite name. If you bought an individual Office application like Microsoft Word, search for the application name.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link in case others are having this problem:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-in/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?CorrelationId=86902389-a962-4287-b7f0-3ec48c863db7&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IN&amp;ad=IN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.office.com/en-in/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?CorrelationId=86902389-a962-4287-b7f0-3ec48c863db7&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IN&amp;ad=IN</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy to report that I ran only the Quick Repair so far and that actually fixed my problem with the Macros in Word&nbsp; and they are working now.&nbsp; I still see a little slow-to-respond or slow-to-open though so I may need to try the Online Repair and if that
 doesn't fix it all, I'll have to do the uninstall and reinstall as you advised.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help.</p>

    <title>Size of Ribbon Icons in Powerpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dugwill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Size of Ribbon Icons in Powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 Home installed on my Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Menu Tab, Ribbon and icons/text within the ribbon, in PowerPoint are larger then the ribbon in other Office apps (Word, Outlook, etc.) &nbsp;This is really apparent on an external monitor with 1920x1200 resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the Tablet vs. Touch mode and it only makes the PowerPoint Ribbon bigger. I have also tried re-sizing the text, apps and other items via the Display settings menu. &nbsp;This re-sizes all content in all Windows apps. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue appears to affect only PowerPoint. Here is a screen snippet showing the difference in ribbon size between OneNote (left) and PowerPoint.</p>
<p>

            <p>FWIW, you can toggle collapse/pin the ribbon by clicking on the up arrow on the far right. The full ribbon will drop down when you click on a tab and hide again when you click on the slide.</p>
<p>I feel your pain as I too have a Surface Pro, but I guess I've just adjusted to it.</p>

            <p>You must have all the requirements for installation or it will not install. If you don't have a test computer or a separate hard drive or partition to try out this beta operating system, don't install it. It should not be an upgrade to your existing windows.
 You could lose everything if you install it on your main computer. Wait until the final version is released next year.</p>

<h3> prashcom  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91; IDEA&#58; Go Green &#93; - How bing &#47; google can save 20-30&#37; of the server load in Search Result page &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Friends, Very simple idea but I am sure this can help bing &amp; google kind of company to save 10-20% of the server load from day one of the implementation !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to www.bing.com or www.google.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Type yahoo or hdfc or hdfc netbanking or citi bank or microsoft or any top brand name with 1 or 2 words..<br />
<br />
For all the above keywords, I don't think Bing or Google needs to display or run thousands results or algorithm.. also the pagination etc..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Instead just give a drop down of 4-5 frequent URLs which people can click in these cases in search box itself..
</p>
<p>So just replace the auto fill keyword with Auto fill URLs :) </p>
<p>Is this not a WOW ?? Simple but Exactly what people want !!<br />
<br />
I am sure in these example people want to go either yahoo.com or based in location geo specific yahoo.co.in or uk websites.. so why Bing / Google need loose their own server bandwidth..??&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Why not first AUTO fill URLs and see if people click those options itself.. Isn't not easily predictable??
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please don't run your algorithm all the time because this take lots of effort and also need energy, power etc..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So simple IDEA can actually help in our GO GREEN Campaign !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will help the environment !! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Pl like &amp; share my message to save the environment !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Prashant Kumar</p>

</p><p>Hello ,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>I think you're missing a very important point which is their compulsion to "<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Know us better, 24/7, so they can
</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">help us with our best interests."</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know how how they can present millions of results considering they are l learning our likes, lives and even the way I am Undressed right now. (sorry Ladies and,as I typed this, should I still be using a Google phone, aka Android, it.would be stealthily
 taking pictures of me and recording sounds, etc. Make a random search on Google and out of the 32 million results proudly achieved in 0.02 seconds are not there. But if you jump to the the very last one it will show miraculously... as the second page and not
 the 32 millionth.</p>
<p>Make aaI personally am not acquainted with Bing. </p>
<p>But what Google searches continuously are each and every one of our smallest details of our private and intimate lives. That's an enormous power shared by few over many. They'd never forfeit THAT. Why , eludes me. Google doesn't hide the fact they record
 audio and video and pictures of you and all around you.</p>
<p>I don't know the truth about Google,let alone Bing, I.e. Microsoft. Alll I know is that I had to obey the Google servers orders or else many features would stop working leaving me with a useless piece of plastic, metal and other stuff I don't care about.</p>
<p>I recycle the physical, touchable stuff. (software can't be recycled. Drop the Recycling Bins, for our deleted stuff (software).</p>
<p>I'm sorry to have written too much for your 'booooring' limits. But I think that they don't have nearly as close as they claim, number of results you can use, not if you count the letters that show up separately and mean nothing.</p>
<p><strong>It's all about adnonsense and billions in publicity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Going back to the amount of useless results, I for one believe they are not all in your PC no storage space nor are they queuing.
</strong></p>
<p>But it impresses people and Bing cannot fall behind.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

                    <span>I installed office 365 home&nbsp;premium&nbsp;on the 8th of February and it has been running just fine, I loaded it mostly for outlook and it was time to upgrade anyway I have been running office 2003 pro. so after install office 365 I uninstalled 2003. everything
 has been running fine I&nbsp;check&nbsp;my outlook many time doing the day and have a number of mail accounts attached to it. yesterday it just stopped working, I could go to my online versions of hot mail ,&nbsp;gmail&nbsp;etc but outlook would not open, i did some searches
 on the web to find something about a service outage and assumed it was that. however now I find that not only will outlook not open but none of the office 365 software will run. I can not open word document on my system or any other aspects of the software.
 so I figured that I would just uninstall and&nbsp;re install but when I try to install the software again it says that&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;integratedoffice.exe - bad image and will not let me use the install file it says that either not designed to run on windows or
 it contains an error try install the program from the original install media. so I figured that I needed to uninstall then re install so I went to the control panel and tried uninstalling and it click it an nothing happens, so I tried right clicking and uninstalling
 and still nothing happens.</span>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>so at this point I am lost I need to get my&nbsp;software&nbsp;up and running. anyone have any ideas where I go from here..</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>added information: &nbsp;someone told me to run sfc /scannow and see if it found any errors, after&nbsp;completing&nbsp;it says windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations.</div>

<p>MG, Cheers for the help. I viewed my events&nbsp;and aside from an occasional, arcane 5061&nbsp;system&nbsp;integrity audit failure (someone with too much time on his hands can explain what that is if he wants) and after running the MS security scan, found nothing remarkable.
 all remote connection allowances are now unticked so lets see how it goes from here.</p>

            <p>Hello. Thank you for fast reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error appears on any Visio drawing, even an empty one. We created randomly a dozen of various drawings of different types. All had the same defect. For instance, we have used standard BPMN sample template supplied with Visio 2016. All drawings were created
 in Visio 2016, not migrated or upgraded from any other version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from appended screen, '<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">FindShapeXML</span>' is not an object in Visio file but the name of JavaScript function included into standard JS files generated by&nbsp;Visio during HTML publishing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would really appreciate fast resolution of this error because due to it we failed with our presentation of Visio 2016 to major prospect in UK who was keen in quality HTML publishing of their Visio diagrams.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, but I have not been able to install it as of yet.&nbsp; I'm missing something.</p>
<p>I hope someone can jump in with the final steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the ipad, go to store.office.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found solver on the main page, but you can filter by "'Excel", and find Solver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions, and it says I have the add-inn.</p>
<p>However, on the ipad, when I go to Insert / Add-ins/ See All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see it there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not&nbsp; sure what the next step is.</p>

            Thanks, Dana! I've completed these steps and have the same problem - no Solver add-in in the Excel menu. Microsoft site says to press 'update' button in Excel app to activate the new add-in but this didn't &nbsp;work for me either.

<h2>            Call Restrictions feature don&#39;t have Restrictions Password - Nokia 2330 - Silver and Black</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Nokia 2330 classic, the silver and black phone. Honestly, I love my little phone, and I wanted to start with some standard before I dish out $100 + bucks for my first phone back with T-mobile without a contract (no commitments, which I love). Please
 help me with the <strong>Cancel all call restrictions </strong>(requests the system to cancel al call restrictions) option located within
<strong>Call restrictions</strong> which is located within <strong>Security </strong>
which is located within <strong>Settings</strong>. <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>
Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Call restrictions</strong> &gt; <strong>Cancel all call restrictions</strong> It keeps asking me for a Restriction password which I contacted T-mobile several times and they don't have a clue why my phone is requesting this. T-mobile
 doesn't even know the password for this feature on my phone, and they tried providing me several codes which they thought my work such as 1234 (the default code) with no success. I'm glad with all the random codes after the default they (T-Mobile) had me enter
 as the restriction password for canceling all the call restrictions I didn't cause any further problems to my phone such as being locked out but luckily it isn't like a PIN Code or Security Code then I would have. Their last result for me was I had to submit
 a exchange request for another phone. But at my level of frustration/lack of faith with T-mobile, I refuse to purchase a completely different phone with them at full retail price because I said to them how will I know the next phone I receive won't encounter
 the same problem. I chose to exchange my phone for the same make and model, and I'm waiting for them to process the request. It would save me a great deal of time and money (they will be charging me the same amount for my current phone for the exchange, but
 they said they would credit me back the amount of my current phone within 30 days of receipt of the "defective" one). Also, I grown attached and quite fond of my Nokia 2330 within the 1 day I had, so I don't want purchase another phone at full retail price
 just yet. I hope for their sake and mine that the exchange phone which is the same make and model will let me access this feature without entering a password. Last but not least, T-mobile contacted Nokia and was told that my phone shouldn't be requesting a
 password to cancel al call restrictions and offered the solution to restore all settings. It didn't help a bit, so if anyone out there encountered a similar issue with their phone then I will love to hear about it and the resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time, your help, and your consideration!</p>
<p><br />
Very Sincerely,</p>
<p>K.Jones</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a wonderful day &amp; Thanksgiving Week!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. They want me to once I receive the exchange take the SIM card out of my current phone and put it into the exchange phone. I informed them (T-mobile) if I can't access this feature on the exchange phone then my next call will be requesting a refund.
 Additionally, I will be not purchase another phone from T-Mobile, but through a third party that is unlocked. I do want to keep my service since I haven't experienced any problems with it yet. Any suggestions just in case? :-D</p>

            Hi,<br />
I am supporting as Tech Support for a network provider (Mobily, KSA)<br />
either it may be Call barring, in this call barring you will get options as International call barring(Incoming/Outgoing)<br />
All call barring(incoming/outgoing). So to cancel all the barring services you need to enter PIN2 as service provider provides PIN1 and PIN2. So ask PIN2 and enter in to Barring Calls all the Barring action will be Canceled

<p>Thanks for replying to my post. Unfortunately, still no resolution from T-mobile customer service, so I just deal with my restrictions since life is full of them anyways. Why not another one, right? I was really frustrated at first, believe me, so I can
 definitely understand. I apologize if I couldn't be of any assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again, and have a wonderful day!</p>

<p>I still didn't overcome the phone restrictions, and I just accepted the fact that T-mobile doesn't have these PIN codes available for my phone. I guess I'm just one of those unlucky customers, go figures. Also, I apologize if I couldn't be of further assistance.</p>

<p>Hi Nana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several possible reasons that may cause this error.&nbsp; One of which is due to insufficient space on your phone.&nbsp; In order for us to resolve this, may we know how many free space is in your mobile device right now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible reason why you're getting this error is due to an update needed in the language pack.&nbsp; In order to be able to resolve this, you can try performing the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Go to Settings &gt; Language+Region.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Tap the Phone language.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select &nbsp;a new language (Make sure that you're familiar with the language).</span></p>
<p><span>4. Download the language pack and then restart the phone.</span></p>
<p><span>5. After that, retry to update your phone by going to Settings &gt; Phone updates.</span></p>

<p>Why you didn't try as i do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me guide you, reset you phone, setting - about - reset your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When phone asking date and time, please set to date 01 December 2017 and time 00:00. It's okay if the process still Lumia cyan, click store, delete all apps in progress except extra &amp; info, wait for a few minute until the download of extra &amp; info is finish.
 And you get notification "welcome to Lumia denim". And download all of yours apps and after you finish all apps back a time and date to current date and time, and enjoy your Lumia denim.

    <title>Envelope icon doesn&#39;t disappear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sailavid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Envelope icon doesn&#39;t disappear</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I've enabled the Envelope Icon in the system tray for new mails (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/292034/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/292034/en-us</a>).<br />
<br />
If a new mail arrives and I open Outlook 2013, read the mail, the envelope doesn't disappear, even if there aren't any unread messages.<br />
The only temporary solution is to right-click any Outlook folder with all read mail and then select
<em>Mark All as Read</em> in the context menu (mentioned here: <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/335122/why-does-the-outlook-taskbar-envelope-icon-sometimes-remain-active-even-if-i-ha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://superuser.com/questions/335122/why-does-the-outlook-taskbar-envelope-icon-sometimes-remain-active-even-if-i-ha)</a><br />
<br />
We are using Outlook 2013 with Exchange 2010 SP3.<br />
<br />
Why isn't the envelope hiding automatically, after I read all mails?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

    <title>How to make the contacts in the outlook data file the default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nutmix  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make the contacts in the outlook data file the default ones&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I setup outlook with an imap (gmail) account, and all was good. I use go contact sync mod to get my contacts into outlook into the default "outlook data file contacts" list, and when I want to write a mail, it looks there to expand the addresses I type in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I added a work exchange account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I write an email (e.g. for my gmail account), and type a name into the "to" field and hit CTRL-K, it doesn't find anything. &nbsp;When I hit the "to" button, it brings up the exchange contact list, not my local one. &nbsp;To change contact lists is very difficult,
 as you never know which contact list the address is in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I can think of to get my outlook data file contact list to be the default, but no luck yet. &nbsp;i know it is possible, as on my old (now dead) laptop, it was the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the contacts view in outlook, it shows 4 items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Contacts - Outlook Data file (1300 items - this is my address book i want email to use)</li><li>Suggested Contacts - my exchange email address (159 items - not sure where they came from, presumably emails which I sent to via exchange. Its not the company address book. When i open outlook contact view, this one comes up by default, and is used in email
 address expansion)</li><li>Contacts - my exchange email address (0 items)</li><li>Suggested Contacts - Outlook data file (6 items)</li></ol>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear: I am looking for a way to make outlook use the "outlook data file contacts" as the default address book, which will mean that when I write an email, enter a name in the "to" field, hit control-K, it will look up the name in the "outlook data
 file contacts", and not the exchange suggested contacts or any other exchange related address book.&nbsp;</p>

            I am in the same boat. Such a stupid and flawed way to activate the product. Why didn't they, meaning Microsoft, just simply put the product code with the product it's intended for. It is downright stupid and doesn't make sense. And I've had no way of
 typing at home for 3 months now and still can't figure it out. Just... frustrating.

            <p><span>Hi Aurelie,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I need more details to assist you with the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>How is the account configured in Outlook? (POP/IMAP/Exchange/EAS)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the steps below and check the result:</span></p>
<p>Open Outlook in safe mode and check if you are able to receive the emails.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Copy and paste, or type the following command in the <strong>Open</strong> box, and then press Enter:</span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Outlook /safe</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>There is space between Outlook and /</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to receive emails in safe mode, then the issue might be due to add-ins. In order to disable the add-ins follow the steps given below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click on File menu, Options and then Add-ins.</span></li><li><span>Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.</span></li><li><span>Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.
</span></li><li><span>Click OK.</span></li><li><span>Open Outlook and perform a test.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps fail, I would suggest you to start the computer in clean boot mode and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the link below to know how to start the computer in clean boot mode.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Ensure to restart the computer to normal mode (Step 3 in the above link) once the troubleshooting is complete.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Clean boot is performed to disable all startup programs and 3rd party services on the computer and check if they are conflicting with the Office program. If so, you may disable the
 unwanted software which conflict with the suite or update the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>Insert a row at the top and put the heading Fruit at the top of your column. Select the whole column and then hold the ALT key down and press D then P then F to create a pivot table. Drag fruit into the row box &amp; drag fruit again into the Values box.</p>
<p>Right click on the first value in the count of Fruit column, then select Sort - Largest to Smallest. Your top 5 will then appear at the top of the pivot list.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If it helps you can use this method:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use <strong>Remove Duplicates</strong> from ribbon to sort out unique products and put them in a row (as picture shows) than use this formula in D2 and drag it as far as you need it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMPRODUCT(($B$2:$B$15=D$1)*(SIGN($A$2:$A$15)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case I have used a "help" column (column A) where I have placed the ordinal numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b801c1f-67a7-4ef5-9551-20318c554796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b801c1f-67a7-4ef5-9551-20318c554796" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In that way you can sort out all amount of the product you have.</p>
<p>From this point is easy to find 5 most occurred product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>p.s.</strong> for sure you can put the unique product not in row (as I did), but in a column (maybe this is more easy).</em></p>

<p><span>Hi Joanie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As far as I know, when students finished the quizzes and submitted it, after that they can view how many scores they got. And there is no option for students to print the graded quizzes, however<strong>, on teacher’s ( the
 quizzes organizer) side</strong>, he can click the extended menu and choose to print the quizzes response in Teams like this:</span></p>

            first you need to download "project my screen app" from microsoft (for your pc).Install it.Secondly you have to connect your device to your pc(via usb).Then go to control panel &gt;devices and printers,then right click on your windows phone icon &gt;eject or
 remove device.Then remove the usb cable from port and re-insert the cable,then go to settings&gt;and click on project my screen on your phone and open installed project my screen app on your pc.Finally your phone will ask you for project your screen to computer.tap
 on yes or allow

<p>I dont think you are getting the issue here.</p>
<p>We get the option of allowing the app through Phone, But still, there is no response on the app in PC. It still stays in black screen.</p>
<p>The app is detecting the phone, but doesnt not work.</p>

            <p>The error message indicates you probably have an older version of the Avery Dennison Label Wizard add-in for Word that is not compatible with Word 2010. The solution is to uninstall the add-in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the error message continues to appear after you uninstall the Avery wizard, you have to manually delete the template that contains the faulty macro. Shut down Word and start up the File Explorer. In the address bar of the Explorer, type or paste</p>
<p>
</p><p>%appdata%\Microsoft\Word\Startup</p>
<p>
</p><p>and press Enter. Select the file AVWiz12s.dotm (the number may be different, depending on the version of the wizard) and delete it.</p>

            Press on the center button on the D-pad.&nbsp; You will see either a magnifying glass or a red cross indicating movement (un,down, left,right).&nbsp; Press to get the Magnify glas then magnify to your desired level by pressing up or down.&nbsp; Moving left right will
 change pages.&nbsp; Now press the button again to get the red cross up then you can scroll around to read it.
