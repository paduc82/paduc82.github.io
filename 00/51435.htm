<h2>            Cannot rename folders</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having some difficulty renaming files within a foldder. I can right click to highlight, but it doesn't allow me to retype a new name. Strangely, though I can do this on a folder on my desktop.</p>
<p>I have tried a restoration to an earlier time, but that didn't work.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if anyone had some ideas on how to resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ralph</p>

<p>Here's an article on how to fix the problem of being unable to rename and/or move folders within Vista:

http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/unable-to-rename-or-move-folders-in-windows-vista/</a>.</p>
<p>The last post in this thread contains a link to registry editing program that supposedly fixes the problem (though I haven't tried it):

http://forums.techguy.org/windows-vista/626307-windows-vista-unable-rename-folders.html</a></p>
<p>Before doing either of the above procedures, backup your registry just to be on the safe side.&nbsp; Here's how:
<a href="http://www.adamsdvds.co.uk/tutorials/vista/regedit/backup.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adamsdvds.co.uk/tutorials/vista/regedit/backup.php</a>.</p>
<p>If those don't work, this is probably a permissions or ownership issue.&nbsp; Give yourself Full Rights to the folder (and perhaps any parent folders if permissions are inherited as shown in the Advanced section) and also take ownership of it.&nbsp; Then you should
 be able to rename it.&nbsp; Here are some procedures to help you:</p>
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></a><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders, take
 Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for
 replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/</span></a><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>.</span></span></span><span><br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope one of these solutions helps!</span></span></p>

 the place, so I'm going cap the age at 13. A mic is not needed as long as your honest about your age. But all the rules/ info are in the game so msg me directly, not over the forum to get an invite. Fyi I'm 15, I'm on at arround 5pm-11pm MST on weekdays and
 2pm-1am weekends depending on the day.

            <p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using a Microsoft account or a local account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if Maximum password age and Minimum password age is set on the PC.</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows logo key + R </strong>and type <strong>gpedit.msc </strong>
and press OK.</p>
<p>b. Navigate to <strong>Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Password Policy, check if 'Maximum password age' and 'Minimum password age' are set certain days. If yes, double click on it and change the days to 0.</p>
<p>Also, check 'Password must meet complexity requirements', double click on it and choose Diabled if it is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if it helps. If the issue persists, we will be happy to help you further.</p>

    <title>Multiple accounts linked to same email&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple accounts linked to same email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several years ago, when I was a kid, I created a skype account with my email. Years later, I linked that email to a Microsoft account. I'm now using Skype to conduct job interviews, and some potential employers have told me that I had two accounts, and there
 was confusion on which account was me. Apparently, when I logged in with my Microsoft account, it created a second account, where my current email address actually has&nbsp;<strong>two, separate</strong> skype accounts associated with it. I cannot access or log
 into my old one, and I want to delete it, or somehow merge it with my current account. How can I do this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify: my email has two accounts associated with it. I can only access one, and I need the other one to be deleted or somehow merged with my current, actual account to erase confusion when people are trying to find me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Przemyslaw,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some system components may be missing or corrupted, causing the problem you are facing to occur. Before we can fully address this, please answer some things so we can understand this better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did this start after updates were installed on the computer?</li><li>Does the same situation happen when you add a pin as your sign-in option in Windows Settings?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have tried adding the option in Control Panel, let's see if there will be a difference when we do it in Windows Settings. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Accounts</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Sign-in options</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>PIN</strong>, click on <strong>Add</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try the suggestions posted by <strong>John Rubdy </strong>on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-security/set-pin-as-default-sign-in-option/d0aac9c1-88cf-44c4-a1b2-2ddc519d1881">
page</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the steps above help you set up a PIN on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>I don't think you read my whole problem. I already HAD a PIN so couldn't add one anymore. It didn't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I deleted it, and added it again. And it still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I'll have to refresh - but I've just spent 2 days configuring it after the fresh install. I really don't want to have to do this.</p>

            In the end, I had no choice. I just refreshed the installation and it worked. PITA though, because I had to reinstall all the programs.

<h2>            Where is &#34;Select All&#34; for picture uploading&#63; </h2>
                    Is there a "Select All" feature in my photos folder when trying to upload to Shutterfly. As it stands now, when I try to upload to shutterfly using their uploaded - I go to my picture folders and I have to select each one individually to be uploaded. I
 can hold down the control button and highlight the pictures I want uploaded but this takes forever when I have hundreds of pictures! What am I missing? I have used other photo storage programs when uploading to Shutterfly and they always have "Select all pictures"
 button to choose.

A couple of things you can try...</p>
<p>Highlight one file / press and hold your Shift key / highlight the last file.</p>
<p>Highlight one file and type Ctrl+A.</p>

    <title>external drive letters lock in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> csvideo  say:</h3>
<h2>            external drive letters  lock in</h2>
                    I bought a new computer. &nbsp;Going from XP tp 7 pro 64. &nbsp;I have several external hard drives that I use frequently for backups etc. &nbsp;With XP, I was able to assign certain letters to certain drives. &nbsp;After that, any time I plugged that drive in ( all USB )
 it would get the same letter. &nbsp;In &nbsp;other words If I had "J" assigned to a drive, any time that I connected that drive, it would come up as "J" &nbsp;even though a lower letter like "E" or "F" might have been available. &nbsp;I can't even remember now how I did that.
 &nbsp;Somewhere in Control Panes drive Management. &nbsp;I would assume that I can do the same thing in Win 7, but I can't find it.

<p>Sheesh just the 2 controllers by themselves would cost over $120.00 &nbsp; &nbsp; My fiancee and I really like the series a lot and her 360 has been acting up so I have a feeling we
<em>might</em> consider getting this. Especially for that price. We were already discussing the&nbsp;black slim 360. But I NEVER expected the GOW3 360&nbsp;to be $399.99.</p>

<p>I expected that GOW3 console to be at least $600 because it comes with a LOT of content including a 320GB HD, GOW3 figurine, 2 controllers, and more. &nbsp;If its cheaper than that I will be shocked. &nbsp;</p>

<p>That is because they never said it was coming with the statue. That is for the Epic Edition. The console version only comes with the basic game. Sorry no figure for the package.</p>

            <p>Microsoft should warn people about making changes to someones e-mail programs. I just went to the Outlook.com website and it tried to update me. Then they send me an e-mail welcoming me to Outlook.com and telling me about getting a new e-mail address. I
 don't want a new e-mail address? Do you know how many accounts I have tied to my MSN address? Luckily I did as Gordon said and clicked return to Hotmail.</p>

That's like saying Microsoft is trying to keep up with the "Jones"!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People use Windows because they want to run applications and games that are out there, not to have a&nbsp;company in your face all the time. If it works, leave it alone!</p>

<p>I always get a little "scroogie" this time of the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked out Outlook.com a little more and it looks okay and appears I can just keep my same e-mail address. I would absolutely hate to change my e-mail address. I changed isp providers a while back and switched all my accounts back to my hotmail address
 which takes a lot of time to do. My hotamil address goes way back to the MSN days and I've had that address forever.&nbsp;I would really hate to lose it.</p>

 my "Update History".&nbsp; I don't know who is doing this, but if I want "Windows 10" I will do it of my own accord, and I don't want it forced on me.&nbsp; I went to "Report</p>

            <p>Microsoft is pushing the update. The reason for the mounting number of failures is because it is waiting for a user interaction from you to say yes install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure Win10 isn't reserved in the Get Windows 10 App. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall update KB3035583 (Get Windows 10 App)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Update make the Windows 10 Upgrade a hidden option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And even then there is no guarantee it won't try and install. I did the above, cleared out all the files, made adjustments to the registry to remove all trace of the upgrade, and it still downloaded it.</p>

    <title>Computer won&#39;t type...how to remove password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weedler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer won&#39;t type...how to remove password</h2>
                    <p>The letters on my keyboard are not working at all so I can't type my password to open my computer. There are two things that happen when I try to get on...it will either fill the password with c's and when I manage to remove them they come right back like
 the c key is stuck. The other thing that occurs when I try to put in my windows password is nothing. &nbsp;I don't hear the click or feel that I've typed anything and nothing shows up on the screen. &nbsp;Usually when you do a hard shut off you get a click or some indication
 that something has occured. &nbsp;On mine I get nothing. &nbsp;I can barely get it to shut off when I use the mouse and an external keyboard doesn't help me get around this issue either. &nbsp;It does turn on and connects to the Internet. I managed to get into the F2 commands...but
 not the F8. &nbsp;I'll have to fiddle more with those later. &nbsp; Someone checked it remotely for a virus (COMCAST) and suggested I go to ASUS with my problem. &nbsp;I don't think I'll be doing that as my computer is out of warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a ASUS X551M, it was having some problems with sticking and sluggish keys prior to this. I figure that I have to switch out the key board and probably the key pad, but I'd like to save my data before I do that. &nbsp;So I figure to remove my password should
 at least let me get in to save my data, right? &nbsp;I'd like to do what I can to fix it myself. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insights are welcomed if they help me get my data or help me fix my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>What do you mean when you say, "computer won't type?</li><li>Are you saying that an external keyboard also does not type anything?</li><li>Have you tried using the keys in safe mode?</li><li>Do you have the installation media for Windows 8?</li></ol>
<p>I would suggest you to try starting the computer in safe mode and then check if you are able to type.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Start computer in safe mode</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>a.</span></strong><span> When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong><em>Shift</em></strong> key when clicking the <strong><em>Restart</em></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>b.</span></strong><span> The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>c.</span></strong><span> Next, hit <strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options followed by
<strong><em>Windows</em></strong> <strong><em>Startup</em></strong><em> <strong>Settings</strong></em> from the next screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>d.</span></strong><span> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></li><li><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></li><li><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>If you are able to type in safe mode, p</span><span>erform Clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>I somehow missed this message when it was originally published. &nbsp;But I followed the instructions and my keyboard opened up and I was able to type in my password. &nbsp;So I guess I'll put off getting a new one for now. One thing I learned that I could not download
 my personal files while in safe-mode. &nbsp;I sent them to OneDrive instead and then when I had full access again I was able to download them to a disc drive. &nbsp;From now on I will be more diligent about transferring my important files to disc for safe keeping rather
 than leave them on my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            wmi failure in xp</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to fix a WMI corruption in Windows XP running sp 3.&nbsp; So far, here's what I've done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Ran wbemtest.&nbsp; Tried to log in as root\cimv2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Got error 0x80080005.&nbsp; Facility: Windows.&nbsp; Description: Server execution failed.</p>
<p>-Went Manage Computer.&nbsp; Clicked the + net to services.&nbsp; Right click to properties on WMI Control.&nbsp; "Failed to connect to &lt;local computer&gt; because "Windows: Server execution failed"</p>
<p>-Tried rundll32 wbemupgd, UpgradeRepository at the command prompt.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to happen.&nbsp; Rebooted. Still nothing.</p>
<p>- Tried these commands.&nbsp; The</p>
<li><strong>cd /d %windir%\system32\wbem</strong> </li><li><strong>for %i in (*.dll) do RegSvr32 -s %i</strong> </li><li><strong>for %i in (*.exe) do %i /RegServer</strong>
<p>Got some activity with both commands.&nbsp; The second command opened up the wbemtest.&nbsp; At the command line, It told me "Please wait while WMIC compiles updated MOF files."&nbsp; After a few minutes, I got...</p>
<p>Parsing Mof file: %windir%\wbem\cli.mof(phase error -3) Compire returned error 0x8008005</p>
<p>Killed that process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'm running out of options.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>Casually thinking about the problem, has anyone tried replacing the WMI repository and files with files from a similarly built computer?&nbsp; Or are they so specific that it is hopeless?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just based on my reading WMI is intended to be a collection of generic info that acts as a go-between various objects.&nbsp; By my guessing, the generic nature would lead the files themselves being easily replacable.&nbsp; That doesn't always work in practice, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just wondering if anyone had tried this.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7&#58; How to install using Bootcamp&#63;</h2>
                    I've gone and downloaded Windows 7 on my Mac OS X thinking that once I downloaded it, I could use bootcamp to use it. I was sorely mistaken. So now I have bought 150 dollars of nothing, though I did get a backup disk, and well it just failed. I don't know
 if I should ask for a refund or what I should do... Or can I do anything?

<p>You do realize you need to burn the .ISO file to a blank DVD. I think you need to use either Disk Utility which includes the ability to burn disk images. If that does not work try use a third party program available for OS X that can burn Disk Images. If
 none is available, back the .ISO file to a external disk or thumb drive with enough disk space and burn it using a Windows system with burning utilities. Burning a Windows 7 ISO File on a DVD<br />

<p>Next, what you will need to do is use boot camp for Apple OS X to prepare a partition for Windows 7 on your Apple Mac.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer might think that there is an Ethernet cable connected to it. If there is no cable connected, we suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the driver from the device manager.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's the same issue, kindly run the Network Troubleshooter. To do so, follow the steps below:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong>. </li><li>Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Network and Internet</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Internet Connections</strong>. </li><li>A window will pop up, click <strong>Next </strong>to proceed with the troubleshooting.
</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
