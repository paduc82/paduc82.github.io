<h2>            How long does it take for a system restore to run&#63; </h2>
                    my computer crashed (black screen and white curser on start up)and did a systems restore - it crashed again and now the system restore has been running for more than 5 hours I was told this is because its trying to restore to a point before a Norton update
 (which happened when I did the earlier restart) but if it wasn't working my the morning there's a problem. Is this correct?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm running Vista Home Premium on a new Toshiba.

<p>I appreciate the update.&nbsp; I've never seen a System Restore take more than an hour but I suppose it is possible if the circumstances are right and especially if it's an older point where more changes were made that need to be restored.</p>
<p>Remember, although a System Restore can often fix such probllems, it doesn't always work.&nbsp; If it doesn't work, continue with the next step in my prior post and eventually we will find the problen and/or a solutions of some kind.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>System Restore can take up to 30=45 minutes but certainly not 3 hours.&nbsp; The system is frozen.&nbsp; Power it down with the power button.&nbsp; Also you need to dsiable Norton when doing a system rsstore because Norton interferes with the process.</p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp; Be sure to check the box
 to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should be able to restore with
 no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup or shutdown &nbsp;(Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event
 Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if
</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and
</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; You may also want to try a free trial
 of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:
</span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span> and Avast at:
</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free
 OneCare at </span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the options
 (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp; If the problem goes away then
 it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If
 the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:
<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></a> (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt
 to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at <a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></a>.&nbsp; If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should
 still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version,
 then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            HP laptop &#39;Something went wrong&#39; issue</h2>
                    My HP laptop won't connect me to my Microsoft account. It keeps saying, 'Something went wrong and we couldn't set up your Microsoft acoount'. Nothing is wrong with my internet so that leaves me to believe that the problem is on your end since I recently
 took my laptop in to be fixed and gave them permission to basically wipe everything clean. Please, tell me what to do step by step. I've already seen that other people have had this same issue but I don't know what else to do. Before I took my laptop in, it
 had no problems connecting me to my Microsoft account. Now I can barely do anything if I use a local acoount. I want to use my Microsoft account. Please help and fix.

            I think I'm using windows 10 but I don't have a problem with the printer or the driver. Like I said, the problem is that I can't sign into my laptop using my Microsoft account. I can only sign in by using a local account. Laptop works with local account
 but of course some features will most likey be restricted unless I use a Microsoft account but it keeps giving me an error message saying something went wrong. I have a Microsoft account, it just wont let me use it for some reason.

<h2>            I can not shutdown Windows via the Start Menu</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title:&nbsp;Shutdown, problem</p>
<p>My Dell Inspiron laptop (64-bit) with Windows 7 is having issues shutting down. As of yesterday, whenever I click shutdown from the start menu, nothing happens. It's as if I never clicked shutdown at all. The same happens when I click restart or any other
 shutdown/log off options. The only way I can get it to shutdown is if I press the power button, but when I turn it on again, instead of saying "Starting Windows" it says "Resuming Windows." I've run a few virus scans and there doesn't seem to be an issue there.
 I'm not sure what else to do.</p>

<p><span>Hi Craig 627,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the computer after which the issue started?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you using Microsoft Office Outlook on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>Try the following steps and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check the status of the issue in safe mode. Let us know if the issue persists in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP</span></strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in safe mode then, place the computer in a clean boot state and troubleshoot the issue. You can start Windows XP by using
 a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p><span>Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal
 startup state”, after performing the clean boot troubleshooting.</span></p>

    <title>Bluetooth audio terrible. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth audio terrible.</h2>
                    <br />
<div>No equalizer.&nbsp;</div>
<div>No "advanced" options.&nbsp;</div>
<div>No "Configure Speakers" option.<br />
Mobile Device Center does NOT fix this issue as suggested. <br />
In fact, NOTHING has fixed this that has been "solved" on this entire site! I have a Sony DR-BT50 bluetooth headset, and a Cirago radio.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can get sound, but the sound is terrible quality. I get 10,000x better quality through these headphones on a $20 mp3 player. Why can my $300 OS, and my $2000 computer NOT get the same (if not better) crisp quality sound?<br />
<br />
I want a FULL capability to equalize, not "just" with Media player! <br />
I mean for all sound. Soundblaster software wont recognize bluetooth. Nothing built into my system does. Please help.
</div>
<div><br />

<div>It's almost as if Microsoft said "Bluetooth Hurka Durka Derp" and started working on Windows 8.</div>

            <p>Hi Leuthesius,<br />
<br />
<b><u>Method 1</u></b><br />
I would suggest you to run hardware and devices troubleshooter and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter<br />

<br />
<b><u>Method 2</u></b><br />
I would suggest you to update Bluetooth drivers from the manufacturers website.<br />
<br />
<b>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />
</b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a><br />

 uninstall which worked but now I cant&nbsp;reinstall the game, because when it starts to load the files I get a white screen that when I do anything it changes to&nbsp;black with a hourglass cursor waited&nbsp;30+ mins then realized that it was messed up and now I'm here.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Can you confirm the Skype version you have and the OS your device is running?
</span>Sharing system sound works best if you and your contact have the latest Skype version available for your devices installed and a stable Internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Skype detects a weak connection (applies both ways) users might experience issues with call connection, delays, freezes etc. so try to using a different connection and check if the issue persists.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If&nbsp;</span>after updating to the latest version and changing your connection you still continue to experience this issue, feel free to post back so we can check further.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Realise that when connected via USB Win 10 recognises the connection and installs automatically and that via Bluetooth it should work the same way.</p>

<p>Hey Blinkyman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have another device that has Bluetooth and is compatible to your laptops that works but the controller doesn't and you have already tried everything on the guide, then it's likely the Bluetooth feature in the controller is no longer working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the controller is up to date&nbsp;as well and it's still not working,&nbsp;then the controller would need to be replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go to the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Devices </a>section on Microsoft support website or you may go to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Blinky, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are sorry to hear about the current situation where the controller will not work via Bluetooth. When you connect an Xbox Wireless Controller with a micro-USB cable, Windows will automatically download and install the drivers for the controller. If Windows
 is not set to automatically download device software, you can check for updates through Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here’s how to check for <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/accessories/connect-xbox-one-controller-to-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
updates manually</a> in the Device Manager:</p>
<ol>
<li>Point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then select
<strong>Search</strong>. </li><li>Enter <strong>Device Manager</strong> in the search box, and then select <strong>
Device Manager</strong>. <br />
<strong>Note</strong> Windows may ask you for an administrator password or to confirm your choice.
</li><li>Locate and expand <strong>Microsoft Xbox One Controller</strong>. </li><li>Right-click the expanded <strong>Microsoft Xbox One Controller</strong> and select
<strong>Update Driver Software</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Search Automatically for Updated Software</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>Is there an external source or If I uninstall the driver will it re-install automatically on a reboot or should I Roll Back ?</p>
<p>Should I Run SFC ?</p>
<p>Could it be a Win 10 1803 update issue?</p>

            Looks like you have tried quite a bit, I was able to solve a similar issue by downloading the Xbox Accessories app to my PC.&nbsp; The app is free and from Microsoft in the Windows Store.

<p>Updated the firmware from there with the controller plugged in via USB.</p>

            Hmm...I tried to take your advice but it seems that the Downloads file was set up originally by the Windows 7 operating system (i.e. it's not a file that I created)...and it doesn't allow me to delete it. When I right click on the Downloads file there
 is no listing at all for Delete.

    <title>DirectDraw Emulation Is Broken In Windows 8&#47;8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DirectDraw Emulation Is Broken In Windows 8&#47;8.1</h2>
                    <p>So this is the 3rd place I've been asked to post this after Technet &amp; MSDN. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be an issue in Windows 8/8.1 with DirectX and its DirectDraw emulation. Certain games which use DirectX9 &amp; older run at very low framerates compared to Windows 7 &amp; Vista which to my understanding also emulate DirectDraw. There are numerous
 threads about this on the Internet, below are some examples of this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/1177947-windows-8-warning-for-old-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Neowin - "windows 8 warning for old games"</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/gaming/26958-how-play-old-directdraw-games-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Eight Forums - "How to play old DirectDraw games on Windows 8?"</a></p>
<p><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/203510/discussions/0/846963165559152822/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Steam Forums - "Poor performance in Windows 8"</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people have experienced significant FPS increases by using the WineHQ provided D3D files. This is because it emulates the DirectDraw calls through OpenGL, a bit shameful of Microsoft when DirectX was always supposed to be considered the superior, fully
 backwards compatible alternative to OpenGL.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Compatibility Mode does not solve this issue! - </strong>This is not a compatibility issue. The games run exactly as intended, there's nothing preventing them from running, it's simply the fact that something is broken in DirectX in 8/8.1 which causes
 them to run with unusable FPS. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The games run perfectly in Windows Vista/7 which to my understanding use the same system as Windows 8/8.1 for DirectDraw emulation so it definitely seems as if Microsoft broke something probably unintentionally in Windows 8/8.1 to cause this issue.

            <p>I wouldn't say that it isn't made for games. The games themselves are actually running as expected there's just this DirectX issue which is preventing them from running to their full potential.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found games which simply refuse to run Windows 8/8.1 also do not run on Vista or 7. This is where VMware Player comes into use, but this DirectDraw issue in Windows 8 should be fixable.<br />

            <p><span>DirectDraw was deprecated in DirectX 7 which itself is 14 years old. The API (code contracts between software and hardware) hadn't updated since, Software developers were advised to not use this interface for more than a decade. What you see is gradual
 abandonment from hardware developers and no effort put in compatibility testing by software developers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>DWM never played well with DirectDraw. Search StarCraft here and you will find many issues since Vista. Now in Windows 8 DWM is always on. &nbsp;Also in Windows 8 color depth is limit to true color and above so lower color depths are software emulated (try Layer_ForceDirectDrawEmulation
 and DWM8And16BitMitigation if you know how to edit the registry).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good thing about interface deprecation is that it is now a fixed interface. It is now safe to hook DirectDraw APIs or write a replacement based on a supported graphics interface as no breaking changes will be introduced in a future update.. Search "directdraw
 wrapper" and you can find many such libraries, most of them have a limited set of supported games, however.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The fact remains that in Windows Vista &amp; 7 the games were more playable than they are in Windows 8. Sure there may have been some isolated issues which you have pointed out above but to go from working for the most part to universal slow speeds is a joke
 and if the answer is that it won't be fixed then it would be great if we could have some official response with literally "The speed issue in old DX games is not going to be resolved".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It proves that Windows Vista &amp; 7 are actually more viable platforms for gaming at the moment as they can run new games flawlessly and old games with playable FPS. Presumably nobody is expecting these games to run absolutely perfect in Windows 8, but at least
 to be playable as they were in Vista &amp; 7 at decent speeds. </p>

            <p>I don't think this is going to be resolved by Microsoft. Deprecated means no engineering effort will be put into it. And we did see no effort in the last decade. No compatibility testing, no security updates. Efforts to solve this from the open source community
 is another matter. If there's enough demand, maybe some video card company will release a card that support DirectDraw to put the software emulation back in its place, who knows.&nbsp;DirectX is a contract between hardware and software developers. Microsoft's fallback
 is a spare tire not a full replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes Windows 7 is a more viable platforms for DirectDraw games.&nbsp;<span>Those games have a average shell life of a few weeks. Nobody then write DirectDraw games and expect it to be running on software emulation full time or there are still people playing them
 after a decade or two. I would say it is amazing that they lasted this long without the developer's effort.</span></p>

            Yes and the "fallback" has worked fine in Vista &amp; 7. There hasn't been direct hardware support for years which is why the emulation is there and all modern machines which can run current games should be able to emulate this fine (as they do in Vista &amp;
 7). I'm not a Dev, I'm a Network Engineer so this sort of thing is out of my league but some sort of explanation as to why the emulation is superior in previous versions of Windows would be useful.

            <p>It may well be the case that even more old junk has been removed from the newer versions of Windows. A game is no different than any other piece of software, it is the developers' job to make it compatible with newer releases of OSes, not the OSes' developers'
 job to worry about keeping backwards compatibility with&nbsp;decade+ old stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not nice, as said game developers may have gone out of business by now, but that's reality. The only people capable of fixing this are themselves, what Microsoft could do at best is to try and add some error mitigation features... which for something
 that has been deprecated for more than a decade is simply not worth the effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until customers demand more support from game developers, this will be a process that will keep repeating as time goes and technology improves.</p>

            I don't think it's anything to do with "old junk" being removed. The emulation is still there or else these games would surely not even run. Interesting point, a lot of the games which run slow, run at full speed in windowed mode, surely this is a good
 indicator that the emulation is simply broken and not just a case of an intentional change in Windows 8.<br />

<h2>            Xbox Support team</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
The last week or so, i've been having problems with connecting to xbox live. at first I thought it was an xbox live issue so I ignored it and assumed it would be a temporary thing - continuing to play a few games offline.</p>

<p>Today I thought it might be worth getting in touch with xbox support to see if this could be fixed. I was advised to uninstall &amp; re-install my profile on my console. I mentioned to the member of xbox staff that i thought this would delete any saved games
 or progress made since I last connected to XBL (due to the cloud backup/saving nature), which was quite a bit in this instance. She assured me that it definitely would not affect any saved game progress and I went ahead. luckily, this did fix my XBL problem
 but, as I had already assumed, I lost progress on anything i had been playing this week which included buying a new game and getting about 25 hours in/nearly at the end.
</p>

<p>Obviously this is hugely frustrating and I understand that nothing can be done about it now. I just wanted it to be known that xbox are advising this as a solution to one of the many problems with their service and their staff seem to be misinformed about
 how this will affect things. if anyone has the same issue in the future and they are worried about losing progress I would advise exploring all over possible fixes first and ignore whatever the xbox support staff advise.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jack</p>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>the troubleshooting steps provided by the customer support are in respect of the rules and the regulations of the service. When playing offline you still can:</p>
<p>Watch TV, although you need to be online to get OneGuide listings.</p>
<p>Sign in to your profile, but only if you've signed in online before. This includes the Kinect automatic sign-in mode, if you set that up while you were online.</p>
<p>Change console settings, but not profile or family settings. Content controls will remain in place while offline.</p>
<p>Play games, if you have a disc or you're on your home Xbox.</p>
<p>Save game clips (as long as there's space).</p>
<p>Earn achievements. </p>
<p>Note There's limited space to store achievements offline, so you should go online every once in a while to sync them.</p>
<p>Use most voice commands if you have a Kinect.</p>
<p>There are some activities that you need to be online to use, such as:</p>
<p>Playing games and apps that require an Internet connection.</p>
<p>Playing games that require online sign-in, even for a single player.</p>
<p>Syncing and playing saved games on more than one console.</p>
<p>Using social features like friends, messages, and parties.</p>
<p>Browsing and buying content from the Xbox Store, Music &amp; TV, and Groove.</p>
<p>Using Xbox SmartGlass.</p>
<p>Updating the console or apps</p>
<p>For further info I suggest you to check this support page:</p>

    <title>Mysterious Drive&#58; Q, No Microsoft Office 2010 Starter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mysterious Drive&#58; Q, No Microsoft Office 2010 Starter</h2>
                    <p>Two years ago in earlier 2013 I installed Microsoft Office 2010 Starter onto my HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC since my Microsoft Office 2010 Professional Trial had expired and I was only using it for my online college classes where Office 2010 was required
 instead of my normally installed Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007 which I prefer because I couldn't ever afford the expensive version of my more favorite&nbsp;<span>Microsoft Office 2010 Professional (I hate and will never use Microsoft Office 2013 even though
 I did try that before installing Microsoft Office 2010 Starter but it wasn't as I expected and wanted it to be).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I installed Microsoft Office 2010 Starter (which was only a trial version since I only needed it for about 4 weeks) I noticed it also installed the mysterious Q Drive that I can't do anything with or even take control of. I've read through multiple
 support pages and YouTube videos that uninstalling Microsoft Office 2010 Starter is supposed to get rid of this mysterious Q Drive but that didn't work whatsoever and that was back in late May 2013 that this occurred; since then I have been dealing with this
 nuisance of a Q Drive and something called VAM in my Windows 7 Control Panel. Following a YouTube video I was able to get rid of this VAM that wasn't even clickable by following the steps in a YouTube video to edit the Registry that worked perfectly back in
 February 2015, the Q Drive had also vanished that day but then it came back on the Tuesday (2 days later) when Microsoft released their updates for that month's "Update Tuesday". There was no updates for Microsoft Office other than my Microsoft Office Enterprise
 2007, MS PowerPoint Viewer, MS Word Viewer, and MS Excel Viewer. (I don't have Microsoft Office 2010 Starter, or any other parts from it installed) but after restarting my HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC and going to my External Hard Drive (a Drive H) and
 this mysterious Q Drive was back after two days being gone (the VAM file that wasn't even doing anything in Control Panel is still gone and has never come back).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the Registry and the changes I've made to get rid of the Q Drive and VAM in the Control Panel before are still there and thus since they got rid of this Q Drive before, it should still be gone but as I've stated, it has come back. There are
 times that it isn't showing up and I want to hope that its gone forever but that is never the case. At times on the same days that I've noticed it gone, later on in the day it will be back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use, update and also work on a computer (desktop) at the church I go to and it to is the same operating system as my HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC; that operating system is Windows 7 Home Premium. This desktop at church has almost all the programs
 that are on my HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC other than Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007. Instead, it does have MS PowerPoint 2003 installed along with&nbsp;<span>MS PowerPoint Viewer, MS Word Viewer, and MS Excel Viewer. The day the Q Drive returned on my
 HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC I used an app on my iPad to remotely control and update that church desktop computer and also checked to see if the updates were the reason why the mysterious Q Drive was back on my HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC but it
 didn't have it. So for some reason after the updates were installed on my laptop this mysterious Q Drive had come back and yet again I want this very annoying and useless drive gone once again and this time for good.</span></p>
<p><span>If anyone knows how to get rid of this mysterious Q Drive once and for all, please let me know; thank you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(PS: If anyone asks for any unimportant information to fix this problem like someone who will remain nameless (but was a MS MVP) asked for on another one of my posts will be ignored because in reality all the information that anyone needs to know I
 have included in this posting!)<br />

            <p>SpiritX MS MVP, read the damn post, I'm not using ANY Microsoft Office 2010 Product and that includes MS Office 2010 Click-To-Run. Obviously you're not smart enough or intelligent enough to comprehend that or you've seen that that isn't the case. Thus I
 want this DAMN Q Drive gone because I'm not using any of the products that use it and I want and DEMAND that its removed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get that and my post through your thick head, SpiritX MS MVP after all, I'm starting to realize that so called MS MVP's don't know a damn thing!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Actually it is fully uninstalled and the evidence shows that it is. There is no part of it any where's on my entire system or in the computer's registry either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you're being further unhelpful and very disrespectful in how you've said "its not fully uninstalled either" without showing such proof. I don't even have time to go searching the forums for information that says it isn't &nbsp;uninstalled when I've already
 followed every tutorial that gets rid of it thats worked for every other person thats tried to get rid of it and have succeeded in getting rid of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the way you wrote your post, you don't deserve the title of MS MVP, you aren't even helpful, you've offered useless and unhelpful information twice SpiritX MS MVP. You really need to learn to be more helpful!</p>

</p><p>Q-drive can still be there after uninstalling Starter Office 2010.</p>
<p>A simple Google Search finds this information.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2011/11/25/how-to-remove-the-office-2010-starter-virtual-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ghacks.net/2011/11/25/how-to-remove-the-office-2010-starter-virtual-drive/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>While that is all fine and good, users who uninstall Office Starter will notice that the virtual drive created during installation remains on the system. And that's a issue. It took some fiddling around to find the reason for this. Microsoft Office Click-to-Run
 2010 gets installed alongside Microsoft Office Starter 2010. This is the program responsible for the creation of the virtual drive on the operating system.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>It is not really clear why it is not uninstalled when Office Starter is uninstalled. Could be that Microsoft is utilizing the technology for other products as well, so that an uninstallation could prevent those programs from starting up properly.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like you have 2 choices if the above does not assist you: As Rob advised,&nbsp;check in the Office Forums; or pay for Microsoft Support.</p>

            <p>The facts are you aren't being helpful, you are not even listening and even comprehend what I'm telling you thus you are the reason why I'm treating you and anyone else the way that I am because you and &nbsp;SpiritX don't listen and are not understand what I'm
 telling you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I'll have to say it again and hopefully this time you get it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already followed all tips and tricks to get rid of the Q Drive and it was gone but it came back and all the tips and tricks that got rid of it are still in effect, no if you were to have listened I wouldn't have had to say that again. Thus having to
 state it again obviously means you didn't read any of my posts Bill Smithers so your link isn't relevant to the situation because that was one of the links I used along with multiple help videos on YouTube for getting rid of the Q Drive along with multiple
 Google Searches using every link possible from the search and none of them have gotten rid of this damn Q Drive. Now as I've now said multiple times, it was gone for a full day then came back on a Microsoft Update Tuesday two days after getting rid of it.
 There was no updates for any Office 2010 products because there are not any Office 2010 products on my HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC. There hasn't been any since May 2013, back then all Microsoft 2010 and Click-to-Run 2010 programs were removed from the
 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now how many times do I need to say this before anyone comprehends it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The evidence that supports what I'm saying is directly in Microsoft Update on my HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC, Microsoft Office Starter 2010 and Click-to-Run are no where's in my Add Remove Programs for uninstalling as they are shown in the link you've
 posted and that's because back in May 2013 I uninstalled them from there, the Q Drive wasn't gone nor was the VAM in Control Panel after the uninstall, they stayed but all traces of Microsoft Office 2010 Starter and Click-to-Run were removed from the system,
 they weren't even leftover in the PC's registry, they were totally gone but left behind the Q Drive and the VAM in Control Panel. Multiple Google Searches and YouTube videos from 2013 didn't get rid of them until I decided to edit the registry Manuel in February
 2015 and the the Q Drive and VAM were gone after that, except two days later after Windows Update ran that Update Tuesday and after that the Q Drive came back but VAM in Control Panel didn't and going back to edit the registry again to get rid of the Q Drive
 again showed that it was supposed to already be gone yet it was there again and being its big nuisance as it had always been since the first day Microsoft Starter 2010 installed it in April 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now as I've been saying, I want Thais stupidly illogical Q Drive gone once and for all! If you can't tell me how to get rid of it when all tutorials and videos to get rid of it aren't working (since they've already been followed to the "T"), then don't reply
 or offer help for something you clearly aren't understanding. Net time I use my laptop I'll take screenshots just to show you that what I'm saying is 100% accurate just so you all can fully comprehend what I'm trying to tell you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I have already checked the Office help forums for this problem back in 2013 and again in February 2013, they weren't any help whatsoever. I wouldn't be posting this post/thread if they were even helpful because the Q Drive would be gone once
 and for all like I want it to be. On top of that Microsoft charges way to damn much for support and when I've gotten support from them before on almost every issue they never gave one bit of helpful information whatsoever, that includes with this issue, they
 said to make sure Microsoft Office Starter 2010 and Click-to-Run were uninstalled and the Q Drive would be gone but obviously they were wrong since I'm posting about the Q Drive still being there! I had contacted them in February 2015 when the Q Drive came
 back after that Update Tuesday, they gave me a runaround then weren't even helpful!</p>
<p>
</p><p>thus this post is even in the right area because it isn't even related to Microsoft Office or Click-to-Play since May 2013!</p>

</p><p>As I've promised here is proof that I don't have any Microsoft Office 2010 programs installed (but for some strange illogical reason Microsoft Update for today's Update Tuesday says I have two updates for Mucrosoft Office 2010) but as you'll see through
 the screenshots for installed programs, nothing is related to Microsoft Office 2010 or even the Q Drive thus it shouldn't be there! The final screenshot shows the Microsoft and Windows Updates for today showing two updates for a product that you can clearly
 see isn't installed: Microsoft Office 2010!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any of these screenshots, do you see Microsoft Office 2010 Starter or Microsoft Office Click-to-Run installed, unless I'm blind I don't see it there or anything else associated with Microsoft Office 2010!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You have now had two or more MVP's try to tell you that Office 2010 is not fully uninstalled.<br />
However that does not mean you will necessarily have any of the programs available in the<br />
Programs Menu or Add/Remove. There may only be references to it in the Registry and<br />
maybe in the WinSXS folders hence the updates being offered and possibly the Q drive.
<br />
Regardless it is not fully uninstalled. <br />
<br />
Check in the Office forums.<br />

<p>
</p><p>SpiritX MS MVP, Microsoft Office 2010 is FULLY uninstalled from my system and that's 100% the case because its also removed from my computer's registry. Nothing any of you have said has even proven that Microsoft Office 2010 is not fully uninstalled. All
 you've done is say and not even prove it, you post nothing but links that don't even support your claim and waste my valuable time to search for something when I don't have the time to do so!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if you're going to sit there and keep saying that Microsoft Office 2010 isn't fully uninstalled offer proof that's 100% concrete that shows it isn't fully uninstalled because my registry and the computer itself says you're wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if some how it being uninstalled fully from the Programs and Features menu, there also isn't any traces of it in any system folder. I've already checked!<br />
</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is the first time updates for Microsoft Office 2010 have appeared in a Windows Update for an Update Tuesday and this is counting from the time it was uninstalled in May 2013 up until now. So if it really wasn't fully uninstalled how come
 updates haven't appeared for it in that span of 2 years? (So what is your answer to that? - Especially since you all want to assume it wasn't fully uninstalled back in 2013, but pure and simple logic dictates that I should have seen updates for it in that
 2 years time but I haven't until you've all decided to say it wasn't fully uninstalled!)<br />

    <title>Kernel Power Critical Error, event id 41 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael kinney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kernel Power Critical Error, event id 41</h2>
                    Good afternoon,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been having this problem for a little while now and it's incredibly frustrating.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At random intervals my system will restart without warning. &nbsp;I have disabled the automatic restarting in the system protection settings and I have read through the Knowledge Base articale found here: ( http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2028504 ).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am not overclocking my system and I have run MemTest to check the system memory. &nbsp;My Power Supply is a 500w&nbsp;unit&nbsp;and my usage is far below that as best I can tell (Asus P8Z68-V PRO/GEN3, Intel&nbsp;i5 3450, Corsair 2x8GB RAM, WD 340 GB HD, HP DVD Writer,
 USB Mouse, Keyboard, Headphone, WebCam, and &nbsp;5 cooling fans). &nbsp;All my fans are running, operating correctly and free of dust (I blow them out regularly).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows is up to date and I have updated all of the drivers (I think) that I can. &nbsp;I have also enabled the kernel dump feature in the system protection settings and, as of yet, no dump file has been created by any of these events (13 in the last 7 days
 - 5 today).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This error occurs at random intervals, even when the system is sitting idle in the middle of the night. &nbsp;I have allowed my system to sit with a Linux Live CD loaded up and have not noticed it rebooting then, so I am guessing it's not a loss of power kind
 of thing; it very much appears to be some kind of problem with Windows and the software drivers or hardware that I have. &nbsp;This is extremely frustrating and I just want my system to work and not feel like I have to fight with it to do so; dare I say it kind
 of makes want a Mac (*ducks*).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone has any ideas, please help me out. &nbsp;I'm debating whether to pull my own hair out or throw the computer out the window.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Michael</div>
                </div>

            <p>Your last sentence caused me to realise none of your recent unexpected restarts have resulted in the production of a dump file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">Most system failures result in a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) and a dumpfile report is created providing that the computer has been configured to create reports.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In a limited number of system failures no dumpfile is created. A report is generated when the computer is next booted and placed in the System Log in Event Viewer. The report is given an Event ID number 6008 and gives very little helpful information,
 save that the cause is unknown and that it occurred at the date and time specified. . A further report is placed in the Reliability Monitor with a red orb on the Miscellaneous Failures line and it is recorded as a Critical Failure. Unfortunately the Technical
 Details for this type of failure reveal no additional information.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">The more common causes of this type of failure all relate to power failure.
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">These can be because:<br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">1. The user has pressed the Power On / Off button. <br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">2. A power failure or a loss of supply to home or office where the computer is located. If this has happened it will often be obvious because electric lights are other electrical appliances switch off.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">3. A faulty electrical appliance on the same electrical circuit as the computer or the computer trips the contact breaker or blows a fuse and switches off the supply for safety reasons.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">4. The power cable between the mains power socket and the computer becomes disconnected at either end.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">5. A power surge or lightning strike occurs. Your computer should connect to an uninterruptible power supply unit, which then connects to the mains supply. If an incident occurs you will have to reset the uninterruptible power supply
 unit. Without one of these units in place a lightning strike or power surge can damage the computer beyond repair.<br />
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">6. A faulty power supply unit. The best test here is to remove the existing power supply unit and replace with a known good power supply unit having the same capacity. Most home users do not keep a spare power supply unit to hand.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">7. A damaged or disconnected power cable or motherboard connector within the computer. You can check the cable is properly connected but a damaged motherboard is not easily checked.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">8. If the computer is a laptop check whether the battery can be fully charged, holds the charge and was or was not connected to a mains supply when the failure occurred.<br />

    <title>windows security center &#38; defender shut down - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows security center &#38; defender shut down</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>Running Norton Imternet Security (NIS)&nbsp;2011 (v18.1.0.37) and Windows 7 Pro 32.&nbsp; All has been running well until today when windows security center suddenly reports that it is turned off. Re-starting windows security center via the services window causes
 windows defender &amp; NIS to be turned off, both NIS &amp; windows firewalls to be turned off &amp; NIS virus protection to be turned off.</div>
<div><br />
I've run a full system scan with NIS and anti-malwarebytes, both came up clean.</div>
<div><br />
I decided to remove norton so that I could get back to basics and see whether norton was the culprit.&nbsp;Uninstall completed and followed up with nortons own removal tool. I feel confident that norton is now removed from my system.<br />
<br />
Try now to start windows security center and it stays live for about 2 mins before switching itself off? During that 2 mins it complains about lack of an anti-virus program and defender being switched off. I cannot turn defender on at all now&nbsp;as it immediatly
 shuts down upon activation with the following warning:<br />
<br />
"The windows defender service on local computer started and then stopped. Some services stop if they are not in use by other services or programs."<br />
<br />
I've attempted to load &amp; run MSE but this, on opening, flashes a window at me for about 0.1 secs before shutting down. I'm unable to see what the window says before closure.&nbsp; I've now removed MSE.</div>
<div><br />
So, I seem to be back at a basic win 7 security level but am unable to switch anything on. Where do I go from here?</div>
</div>

<p>You should <strong>never</strong> use 2 different firewalls or 2 different real-time protection systems at the same time. They will often conflict and will also cause significant performance reduction.</p>
<p>Many 3rd party security suites will automatically shutdown Windows Firewall in favour of their own. This is normal.</p>
<p>I would try reinstalling Norton then check that both Windows Firewall and Windows Defender real-time protection are turned off.</p>

I asked rockstar, they said it was a problem with xbox &amp; I should ask here. Tried chatting &amp; requesting a call on 3 different browsers now. None of them work, so the feature must be "broken" so microsoft doesn't have to do anything except steal the money I
 paid for all this ****. Just make my account work for gta5 online.

<p>If you haven't done so already, I would suggest uninstalling / reinstalling your game from the console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>are you saying that you have never had Xbox Live Gold on your account?</p>
<p>if that is the case then you were able to play online by mistake. it would seem that whatever the mistake was, it has now been corrected and Xbox Live Gold (or Game Pass Ultimate) is now required for you to play online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or it could be that you had your Xbox as the Home Xbox for an account that does have Xbox Live Gold and they have set a different Xbox as their Home, which would result in you losing the benefits of Gold.</p>
