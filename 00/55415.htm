<h2>            Desktop locked in reboot loop - error 0xC000021A, automated tools nonfunctional, cannot install from USB</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently upgraded my desktop PC to 1709 after adding some new parts (videocard, a fan and cd drive) and having it switched off for ~4 months.&nbsp; Worked for ~ 1 week, then BSOD, and now cannot switch on, coming up with a 0xC000021A error and loading into system
 recovery.&nbsp; I haven't got a backup image.&nbsp; The PC has a SSD boot disk and a HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the following, without success:</p>
<p>Reset This PC (gets to 2% then reverts "There was a problem resetting your PC, no changes were made")</p>
<p>Startup Repair (logfile (accessed in CMD) says ¬£startup repair has tried several times but still cannot determine the cause of the problem", with all checks above successful)</p>
<p>Startup Settings (can't boot into Safe, Networked Safe or Disable Drive ID modes, just reenters the BSOD loop)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Physical - I've swapped out the SATA cables and changed the motherboard port the SSD &amp; HDD are using without effect</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Commandline:</p>
<p>It now reads the SSD as E: and HDD as C: (formally C: and D: respectively), but the file system of both appears as I recall it (not sure if that matters)</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkdsk /f /r - finds no errors</p>
<p>sfc /scannow - fails "Windows Resource Protection could not perform requested operation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth and any other dism /online command - fails with a error50 "doesn't support servicing windows PE"</p>
<p>dism /image:C:\ /cleanup-image /revertpendingactions - error 2, unable to access path</p>
<p>dism /image:E:\ /cleanup-image /revertpendingactions - error 1392, error accessing temp folder X:\windows\TEMP etc, ensure path and R/W permissions exist</p>
<p>Pointing dism at the install.eds on a boot USB returns either a 50 (for /online with sourcing) or 2 (for /image:H:...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Bootrec /fixmbr - claims to be successful</span></span></p>
<p><span>Bootrec /fixboot - Access Denied</span></p>
<p><span><span>Bootrec /rebuildbcd - says no windows install exists</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at Diskpart, people suggest formatting the EFI partition to FAT32.&nbsp; However, how do I know which partition is the EFI?<br />
I see disks 0-1 and volumes 0-4, labeled as follows:</p>
<p>0: <em>nothing</em> - <em>nothing</em></p>
<p>1: Internal Ha - NTFS</p>
<p>2: System Rese - NTFS</p>
<p>3: <em>nothing</em> - NTFS</p>
<p>4: <em>nothing</em> - NTFS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really stuck, and need this PC for work.&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions on where to go from here?</p>

            Instead of using the format button, when you get home try deleting the partition. That is different from formatting it. The Windows installer will create new partitions and set the properties that it wants if you tell the installer to use the unallocated space as your installation volume.

<h2>            Aero Flip 3d - not all the open windows are in the stack</h2>
                    I have a PDF viewer, a specialist indexing program, Gvim and Boxer Editor open, using two monitors. The Aero 3d Flip stack shows the desktop and three of these open programs - all but Boxer. Why is it excluded? Is there a way of including it? (This is
 Windows 7 Home Premium). I am also using Actual Window Manager.

<p>Hooray - I have actually made the reply facility work on this forum. It seems one has to click on the message first</p>
<p>then in the reply box in order to make the caret appear. Guesswork pays off sometimes.</p>
<p>Anyway, I minimised Boxer (a text editor) and found that it was then in the Aero 3d stack. It came up maximised but I could restore</p>
<p>its original size without it disappearing from the stack. I had disabled Actual Window Manager so I will try it with</p>
<p>AWM running again.</p>

<p>nvstor.sys is a Nvidia driver. Nvidia are well known as providers of graphics cards but they also provide other computer related hardware e.g motherboards, You need to confirm by using a kernel debugger whether the problem is caused by nvstor.sys&nbsp; or another
 driver. Using a debugger is a challenging task for those with limited computer skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>What does this comment by you mean "w/Vista OS". Please clarify?</p>

    <title>SP 2017 won&#39;t wake up properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adriankomiÂÑski  say:</h3>
<h2>            SP 2017 won&#39;t wake up properly</h2>
                    <p>There are two instances when my SP 2017 will occasionally (which the occasion has been quite frequent recently) not wake up properly from sleep:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When I leave it on Surface Dock for some time, and I try to wake it up by, for instance, hitting something on the Type Cover, the Type Cover will light up, but the screen won't show. Music is still streamed through Bluetooth, so the system actually functions
 properly in the background - I just can't access it because the display driver - or whatever - seems to refuse to co-operate. Everything gets back to normal after disconnecting the Dock connector.</p>
<p>2. When I put it to sleep in "wireless" mode (without the Dock connected), and then try to switch it back on, it won't give any response. The only solution in this case is hard resetting the device, which is obviously a pain in the you-know-what, especially
 while in the middle of an important job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

<p>Hi Adrian, </p>
<p>
</p><p>

</li><li>Select <strong>Power </strong>and click on <strong>Run the Power troubleshooter</strong> button.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Installing the latest Surface and Windows updates may also help resolve the issue. Click

<p>Thanks, but I don't think the issue is related with Surface Dock itself. First of all, it often occurs when not connected to the Dock. For instance, today it would occur again with SP lying on the shelf, and then I could actually SOLVE IT by
 messed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the drivers are up to date. I specifically attempted updating Surface Dock, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, I'll try the troubleshooter in spare time, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other users with this problem?</p>

<p>Just checked the troubleshooter. Obviously didn't do anything, except for messing with my power configs in an entirely undesirable way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Surface firmware / OS version as well as Surface Dock firmware is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I try next? This is actually a serious bug, so I wish you treated it seriously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My monitor is Dell U3415W, though I am sure it doesn't matter at all given that - today, for instance - Surface again wouldn't wake up properly when
plug it to Dock</span> just to solve the problem. And this was its first Dock plugging today. So it's clearly got to do with the display driver or something getting utterly confused as to the proper monitor output, and seems like a major alpha-class software
 flaw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might add that I have disabled the lock screen (the one that you have to swipe off to get into the device after waking it up) with the use of Group Policy Editor. Just please, don't tell me it's a "not recommended setting" if it's actually a native functionality
 (though ridiculously hidden from users' eyes, to make life with Windows even more difficult). I might try restoring the lock screen if it's of any relevance to the issue.</p>

<p>Let's try a different approach on this issue you're experiencing.&nbsp; Normally, if the device is not waking from sleep, you can try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>On the keyboard: Press Ctrl + Shift + Windows + B.&nbsp; This would initialize your display adapter / display driver.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Once you're able to press the keys properly, you would hear a short beep which would mean that the display driver has been initialized.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>You may also run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit (SDT) to check for any errors on this.&nbsp; For more information on this, you can click on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/fil-ph/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span><span><span><span>If the said step would not resolve the issue, we would need to do a force shutdown.&nbsp;

                    When I run disk cleanup, it shows 79 mb taken up by "retaildemo offline content." Running the cleanup does not remove it. How can I get rid of this?

            <p>When I run system cleanup, there is no error message -- it seems to proceed normally. But when it's done, the Retaildemo Offline Content is still there. I would like to delete it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, on another forum (link here:&nbsp;http://www.thewindowsclub.com/retail-demo-mode-windows-10) commenters are saying it requires some kind of password to get rid of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I followed Ryan's lead and it worked: no more Retail Demo Offline Content taking up 137MB of hard drive space. Thanks, Ryan.</p>

                    Just payed ¬£14.99 for this game through the games on demand screen with Xbox. Yeah, it won't download. Gets to 8% hops around from 0% to 10% then a message appears saying c&amp;c 3 cannot be downloaded. I am not happy. There is a lot on the Internet regarding
 this problem with this game for so many Xbox customers. Dating back to last december on here! How can these guys sell a product they know has a download issue, knowing full well the consumer cannot fully download it or use it or play it but still continue
 to take people's money? I have tried all suggestions on numerous threads on this site and others. I still can't get it to download. I would like to elaborate on the hard drive space glitch, im sorry but in order to download content of upto 6GB you have to
 spend money... more... Not a chance! I still cannot receive a product I have paid for. This is bad business. Instead of beating around the bush with ports, cables and checking storage capacity (some people know to check these th

<p>Hi UK Producer,<br />
<br />
The official forum support staff as well as Xbox Support is aware of the issue and are working towards a resolution. Until it's resolved, it seems that you and everyone else attempting to download this game at this particular time cannot complete the download
 successfully.<br />
<br />
Please be patient as they work towards a resolution for all parties :).<br />
<br />
Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello fellow angry gamer (said in a respectful manner),. The xbox support team are fully aware of this issue. Not really sure if they have the power and or rights to anything about this matter, but they are "as they informed me" working on this &nbsp;corrupted
 download. By all means, don't let my message stop you guys from expressing yourself and speaking out on this site. The more the merrier.

<p>Hey guys thanks for your input on this issue. I understand that time is needed to fix a problem. I have read the very same problematic and frustrated threads with regards to downloading this Command and Conquer Red Alert 3 game through the GoD menus. These
 other threads I speak of date back to 2009/2010! It is now 2013! So my question is, does it take 3-4 years to fix a dodgy download on the vendors part? Obviously the hierarchy know about it, haven't resolved the problems for general paying users of the service,
 and are indeed letting it sit there at the forefront of category C in the browse GoD section, cashing in on it. Before purchasing this GoD the on screen text clearly states no refunds. Ok I can live with that, even though I think anybody whose put there case
 forward with being unable to access this particular game after purchasing should be entitled to a refund or the points or even a free download of similar value, im sure enough profit is made to look after a few of your/their customers. With the amount of feedback
 at this point regarding this GoD, it shouldn't even be for sale in my opinion. Wouldn't this corrupt download file (as it was stated above by Outlaw 240sx) be a breach of some kind of online/digital rights or acts? I see the same comments on this problem even
 on this site, nobody really seems to be getting through to these people, 2008 this game was released by now surely any underlying problems would have been fully resolved?! Even if it wasnt available on the Xbox as a GoD till say 2011/2012. Points or money,
 for any person who has paid and uses the Xbox infrequently this is an off putting situation, would feel like you have been stolen from and I guess would be off-putting for any future transactions regarding digital game downloads with any company, not just
 these or you. Lastly if you paid with PayPal might you have a valid withstanding case for dispute? Thanks for reading guys, I'm not ranting or having a pop (unlike my first post) i like gaming on the Xbox. Kind regards to the readers and the support people,
 have a nice day, peace.</p>

<p>Hey there everyone,<br />
<br />
Command and Conquer should be downloading properly now.<br />
<br />
I would recommend the following steps:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete any partial downloads </li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your system cache</a>
</li><li>Redownload C&amp;C </li></ul>
<p><br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're still having issues with this game, please create a new thread with details on your issue so we can tailor support to your individual situation.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Since the Anniversary upgrade, on my Dell Vostro 230, the programs keep freezing.&nbsp; I upgraded with the latest Windows 10 update yesterday and although the system is a little more stable, it is still not fixed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot the system and the Microsoft Edge icon on my toolbar is blank, then I know the system is still corrupted.&nbsp; I then have to go to the Command Prompt and type "Netsh Winsock Reset" and reboot the system.&nbsp; If the Microsoft Edge icon is visible then
 the system will most likely run with less program freezing.&nbsp; Also, the boot process takes about 4 times longer than usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Microsoft, you broke it about 5 weeks ago, so when is this going to be fixed?</p>
<p>

            This could be due to a compatibility issue with your make and model. Dell does not list the Vostro 230 as compatible system:

<br />You could consider perform a clean install to see if it works better.

<p>I have the same problem with Word and also Jasc Paint Shop Pro 8.&nbsp; Double clicking a link to a document in Windows Explorer opens the program then I get that error message.&nbsp; Once the program is open the document will open if I double click the link (or icon
 on desktop) for the document but it won't do both.</p>
<p>I tried the registry edit above and then the error message stopped but the document still wouldn't open, and I got messages about some changes to normal.dot, sorry I'm lost already.</p>
<p>So I imported my backup to revert the registry back to the way it had been and somehow it got fixed.&nbsp; The program and the document now open right up when I double click the link.&nbsp; Back to normal, I don't know why.</p>
<p>The problem is that I don't know what to do to the registry in JASC.&nbsp; I guess I'll just have to open files the hard way since it's several years old and I think Corel bought them out.&nbsp; When I try to go to jasc.com I get sent to Corel instead.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>If you are doing ANY over-clocking STOP.<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.<br />
</strong><br />
The Bug_Check was 0A CAUSE ntkrnlmp.exe which is a Windows component which means<br />
something else drove it into Fault.<br />
<br />

<strong>1.</strong> Check for malware, especially RootKits (see the 3rd reply in this series).<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when<br />
possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check with ASUStek, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums<br />
about any known issues. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board<br />
and separate device drivers. Run Driver View - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update<br />
those without Dump in their names (see driver update methods in the next message).<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Check the memory very thoroughly. Keep in mind that memory tests do not detect all<br />
issues such as the tiny speed differences between memory modules that appear to be
<br />
identical. So it may be necessary to swap the modules in and out in different combinations<br />
and patterns (see the memory test methods in the next message).<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Daemon Tools or&nbsp;Alcohol with SPTD.sys has been known to be involved in this issue.
<br />
So it may be necessary to uninstall DT or Alcohol and Disable/Remove SPTD.sys.&nbsp;You can<br />
always add them back in when the issues&nbsp;have been removed.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Another factor is that Norton/Symantec is involved and there is an indication that it is.
<br />
Uninstall it then run the Norton Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use<br />
MSE while testing.<br />

<strong>7.</strong> After 1, 2, 3, and 4 and IF the issue still occurs then run Driver Verifier to see if it can<br />
indicate a CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods in the next message).<br />

<br />
Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security products are<br />
just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds.<br />
The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by manually checking<br />
at the System maker and device makers's sites.<br />
<br />
Below&nbsp;I will post a generic bluescreen troubleshooter and in the next message how to update<br />
drivers and BIOS as well as do memory checks.<br />
<br />

<strong>BCCode: 0A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000000A<br />
<br />
Bug Check 0xA: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</strong><br />
<br />
The IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x0000000A. This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.
<br />
<br />
Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Parameters </p>
<p>The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high.</p>
<p>The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.</p>
<p>If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution </strong></p>
<p>If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace.</p>
<p>To resolve an error caused by a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Restart your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option from the Windows
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>To resolve an error caused by an incompatible device driver, system service, virus scanner, or backup tool
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for error messages that might identify the device or driver that caused the error.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Try disabling memory caching of the BIOS.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Run the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Make sure the latest Service Pack is installed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If your system has small computer system interface (SCSI) adapters, contact the adapter manufacturer to obtain updated Windows drivers. Try disabling sync negotiation in the SCSI BIOS, checking the cabling and the SCSI IDs of each device, and confirming
 proper termination.</p>
</li><li>
<p>For integrated device electronics (IDE) devices, define the onboard IDE port as Primary only. Also, check each IDE device for the proper master/subordinate/stand-alone setting. Try removing all IDE devices except for hard disks.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If the message appears during an installation of Windows, make sure that the computer and all installed peripherals are compatible with the version of Windows being installed. For example, you can get information about compatibility with Windows&nbsp;7 at the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=246806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Compatibility Center</a>.

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<strong>This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information</strong><br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />

<h2>            Power supply buzzing noise</h2>
                    
<p>Normally, the sound is a lot less noticeable. But, I started watching Netflix after an episode of a show, the sound got disturbingly loud and annoying. The buzzing sound is louder than my TV at a normal level, it's painful. The only thing that drowns it
 out is loud enough music. Help! Any suggestions? ):</p>

<p>Unplug the power cord and let it fully power down. &nbsp;Ensure it's unplugged from the power brick as well as from the console and the wall. &nbsp;Wait 3 minutes and then plug it all back together, ensuring you've plugged it directly into the wall and not into a
 power strip or extension cord or surge protector. &nbsp;Also, you should have the power brick in a ventilated area as it contains it's own surge protector and built in fan.</p>

<h2>            High CPU usage</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I purchased Windows 10 Pro two days ago to install it on my MacBook Boot Camp to play games and stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an i7 Processor and my CPU has been used 25-50% at all times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Process that is using it (on windows task manager) is System and when I click "show file location" the file is:&nbsp;ntoskrnl.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been using my CPU and draining my battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am super annoyed with this and I have tried everything to fix it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) check drivers</p>
<p>2) Turn off Windows Search Index</p>
<p>3) On Command: Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has seemed to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me?</p>

            Hi ,

Thanks for the update. 

There is a new feature in Windows 10 called Delivery Optimization that can sometimes overwhelm your CPU and Network resources because its optimizing for the best way to download Windows Update efficiently and install them. Disabling it can greatly reduce its impact on system performance. 

Also following the article to review the Task Manager processes can also help with finding what processes might have high cpu usage.

    <title>elevated admin access name format &#40;to install programs&#41; &#38; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clancularius  say:</h3>
<h2>            elevated admin access name format &#40;to install programs&#41;  &#38; fresh install of windows 10 with OEM key.</h2>
                    <p>I have several issues and wondered if the Microsoft community could help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) &nbsp;Confused about the windows 10 elevated access password request.<br />
As an example:<br />
I use a standard account. &nbsp;But I have a user Admin account as well. &nbsp;<br />
In windows 7, if I am installing a program from a standard account, a window will appear asking for local admin password. &nbsp;it looks like this.<br />
</p>
<p>User admin account name</p>
<p>[type in password here]</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, the dialogue box looks like this</p>
<p>User admin account name<br />
Computer name/user admin account name&nbsp;<br />
[type password here]<br />
</p>
<p>Is this normal?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I ask, I screwed up moving user folders to my 2nd harddrive. &nbsp;End result was what I wanted, but I had to delete a bunch of duplicate folders that kept popping up in different areas, along the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I screwed up trying to reset to default, my startmenu tiles.</p>
<p>Copied sysadmin appdata/traydata files to my two accounts, but the tiles are still screwed up and I am having problems with losing access to programs I installed under my standard account, but only have access to in my user admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;I seem to be having problems installing some programs from my standard account, which I lose access to, when I log back in.</p>
<p>MSI Afterburner was one. &nbsp;I installed it from my standard account, but have to sign in under my user admin account to access it.</p>
<p>The original HALO game is another that continually asks me for passwords, even if use the desktop icon and "run as administrator" access.</p>
<p>AMD Catalyst control center is another program that I installed as a standard user and typed in admin passwords to install. &nbsp;But now, it disappeared from my standard account and I have to access it from my user admin account. &nbsp;Somehow I got it working in
 my standard account, but won't allow me to make any changes. &nbsp;Doesn't even ask for password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I uninstall these programs (and from which account?) and then re-install them again from my standard account?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3) I see conflicting information on the web &amp; even microsoft's site.</p>
<p>NO, you CANNOT use OEM key to do a complete fresh install of windows 10 (after you upgraded from win7 to win10)</p>
<p>you must install win7 first and then upgrade to win10 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>YES, you can do a fresh complete install of only Windows 10 with an OEM key.</p>
<p>I downloaded the media creation tool. &nbsp;Downloaded a zip file (upgrade? &nbsp;full install of win10pro?). &nbsp;I have win 7 pro.</p>
<p>Will try and create a install using USB memory stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if I ask the same questions as other people. &nbsp;Been at this for 9-10 days now?. &nbsp;And I'm exhausted. &nbsp;7 of those days were spent trying to get my original fresh install of windows 7 to update.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Yes, it is normal in Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It is strongly recommended to install or uninstall&nbsp;the programs from admin account. When you install a program in admin account, it is common for all the accounts associated with the computer, however the settings that you set for any programs&nbsp;in particular
 account will not be applicable for all the accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The OEM key comes with Windows 7 will be registered with the motherboard when the installation of Windows 7. If you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;10 from Windows 7, it will get activated automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you perform a clean installation instead of an upgrade, you'll be asked to enter a Windows&nbsp;10 product key or buy a new license in order to activate Windows&nbsp;10. This is because we weren't able to register your free upgrade entitlement with the activation
 servers because you didn't upgrade to Windows&nbsp;10. To fix this, you'll need to go back to your previous version of Windows, make sure the previous version is activated, and then upgrade to Windows&nbsp;10.</p>
<p>

    <title>I&#39;m scared of Windows 10 S - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redpandaman  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;m scared of Windows 10 S</h2>
                    <p>I have a bunch of Windows exclusive games for the PC. When I heard that it would be mandatory to get apps from the windows store, which Steam, GoG, and Battle.net are not present on. Is the update optional? Can I get a version without this "security" the
 only reason I got Windows was to game. So without these services there would be no reason to actually purchase Windows. Yes, Microsoft, a possibly paying customer that you will lose if you continue like this. I would like for these worries to be put to rest.
 If not. How do I decline updates on Windows 10.</p>

            Windows 10 S is not an update to Windows 10. It's a different version of Windows 10, designed for low cost computers and the education market. If you don't want Windows 10 S, don't buy a computer with Windows 10 S.

<p>We appreciate the information provided above. This confirms that your device is not mandated for the Windows 10 S update. Like what was confirmed on BulldogXX 's thread, there are specific devices that has a built-in Windows 10 S Operating System. In addition,
 only the Windows 10 Pro was mentioned to have the ability to switch over to the Windows 10 S edition. You can click this

<h2>            How do you repair a corrupted user file&#63;</h2>
                    I have a new user profile I could use but I'm trying to avoid having to move all of my files from the corrupted user file. Any ideas?

            Hi JeniferFarrell,
<br />
<br />I'm an INDEPENDENT ADVISOR
<br />
<br />Execute the following commands to find and repair corrupt or missing files from the system through CMD:
<br />
<br />1. Simultaneously select the Windows + X keys.
<br />
<br />2. Click on the Command Console option (Admin).
<br />
<br />3. Enter and execute (select the enter or enter key) the following commands one by one:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe / Online / Cleanup-image / Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe / Online / Cleanup-image / Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Sfc / scannow
<br />
<br />4. Once all the commands are finished (this may take a while), restart the computer and check if the problem was solved.
<br />
<br />If for some reason the previous solution did not resolve the incident, try creating a new user, this in order to verify that the damage is not directly from the user:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Simultaneously select the Windows + X keys.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Select the control panel option.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Click on the User Accounts section.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Create a new account with administrator permissions and verify if in this the start menu and searches work correctly.
<br />
<br />Let me know your progress       
        </p>

            Hi Jenifer
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Click File &gt; New Task (Run)
<br />Type: CMD
<br />Hold down Shift, click OK
<br />
<br />Check your hard disk for any errors:
<br />Click Start
<br />Type: CMD, from the results, right click Command prompt
<br />Click 'Run as Administrator'
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f
<br />Hit Enter
<br />When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
<br />
<br />If that does not work....
<br />
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.

            Hi Jennifer.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If the new User account works fine then the problem is not that System FIles need repair or the image file by which they are checked with DISM doesn't need checking.  Instead see these specific fixes for Corrupted User Accounts:
<br /><a href="https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profile-windows-10-9139/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profi...</a>

<br />
<br />If it won't repair then it's easy to move your files over.  Just snap your old C:\Users folder on the left and the new one on the right,  On the old account open each User folder (Desktop, Documents, etc), on the new account open the same folder, from Home tab choose Select all, drag the group from the old to the new folder.  
<br />More here on copying groups of files:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><b>The common two causes of this issue can be:</b></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>a. Microsoft Account has not been verified yet on your computer.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>b. Date and time in your computer is set wrongly.
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><b>Method 1: The store app uses https instead of http which is used by other apps, so in order for the SSL handshake to proceed, the clock on the client
 and server needs to be correct.</b></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Follow the steps below to check if the date and time are set correctly.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>a) In the Start screen type ‚ÄúDate and Time‚Äù, and click on date and time settings.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>b) Check if the date and time is set correctly.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>a. Close the Store app completely (swipe down from the top)</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>b. Press ‚ÄúWindows + C‚Äù to open the charms bar, click on settings and then on ‚Äúchange PC settings‚Äù.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>c. Click on Accounts, It will show your Microsoft account there.
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>d. See if there is a ‚Äúverify‚Äù link below your account. If so, click on it and go through the 2 step verification process</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>e. Once done try starting the store and check if you are able to visit Windows Store.</font></font></font></p>

<h2>            Xbox Live username</h2>
                    <p><span>So I made an Xbox Live account, right from my new Xbox. But I forgot I had a Windows 10 Xbox account, and would like to use my Windows 10 username. I can still change my Xbox Live account username but it is taken by
 the Windows 10 account. I know that I could of used the Windows 10 account but its too late now because I have purchased Xbox Live on the console. Any idea how I can change my Xbox username to the one I have on Windows 10. *Not by paying to change the username,
 and its okay to delete the Windows 10 account if that meant the username would become available.*&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Network priority - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antony lai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network priority</h2>
                    Dear All,<br />
<br />
I have a problem on network connection priorityl. <br />
<br />
I am using Chinese Vista Home Primium. I connect to the network through wireless connection. My network works fine on 192.168.1.xxx. I need to connect to my PS3 with Yellow Dog Linux 6.1, but the wireless connection&nbsp;at Linux side is not stable. I planned to
 connect the Linux through wired connect. After I connect my Vista to the wired network using another Network IP, 192.168.2.xxx, Vista cannot go online. I think the wired connect got higher priority than the wireless. I cannot got the Network Advance settings
 screen that I found it on the Internet. <br />
?<br />
Is there a way to change the wireless network got higher priority? Thank you very much!!<br />
Regards,<br />
Antony

            You're doing this wrong. Your Local Area Network (LAN) subnet is 192.168.1.xxx. If you assign an IP address in the range of 192.168.2.xxx this isn't your LAN so of course you won't have connectivity. I'm not sure why you thought this could possibly work.<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with wireless/wired priority. It has to do with that you are trying to connect to a completely foreign network. What router do you have and what is its IP address? 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1? If your router is 192.168.2.xxx then you are
 connecting to someone else's wireless network. This is not uncommon when people set up wireless routers without changing any of the defaults and setting proper security.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could clarify exactly what equipment you have, the results of ipconfig /all, and what this all has to do with your PS3 and Linux.

<p><span>Hello, Antony</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing the Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>If you need an internet connection for your wired network you will likely need to change the settings on the router for it to be in the same subnet (192.168.1.x
 for instance) depending on your routers capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span>To answer your question, you can change the priority by going to Start, right click on Network, click Properties, and click Manage Network Connections on the
 left menu. Next, right click your WIRELESS connection, click Properties, you may be prompted to continue, select
<strong>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</strong>, click the Properties button, Click Advanced on the General tab, uncheck
<strong>Automatic Metric</strong> and enter ‚Äú<strong>10</strong>‚Äù in the Interface Metric box. OK out of the dialogs until you go back to the Network Connections screen. Next, do the same for your WIRED connection, but this time, put ‚Äú<strong>20</strong>‚Äù in
 the Interface Metric box.</span></p>
<p><span>The connection with the lowest ‚ÄúInterface Metric‚Äù will have priority.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: using multiple network devices can cause anomalies depending on the setup, it may be more reliable to simply disable your wired/wireless device in the
 Network Connections screen as needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if this helps.</span></p>
