    <title>&#8220;Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering&#8221; option - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#8220;Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering&#8221; option under Accelerated graphics.</h2>
                    There is NO Accelerated Graphics box in the Internet Options&gt;advanced tab. Twice I've been given this advice and twice IT DOESN'T EXIST! How can I check a box that doesn't exist? I get the message that DEP closed Internet Explorer 9. What is the file name
 I need to look for to let IE9 through DEP? OR...Where is this phantom accelerated graphics option? I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit.

If Internet Explorer detects that your video card or video driver does not support GPU hardware acceleration, The advanced option to Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering option will be checked and greyed out.<br />

Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Did Win7 64-bit come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7, or did you upgrade from Vista to Win7?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed <em>and is your subscription current?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Are ALL of the following updates listed in <strong>View installed updates</strong> (not Update History)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp; <strong>Windows Internet Explorer 9 </strong><em>or KB2544521</em>; KB2530548 [or KB2497640], KB2544893, KB2476490, KB2393802; KB2535512

<p>3 - No Norton or AVG at all...ever.</p>

<p>So, I'm no longer using IE9, but the message I was getting is that "Internet Explorer has stopped working and needs to close." When I clicked on the diagnostic&nbsp;option in the same window it said that the Data Execution Prevention had shut it down. I tried

            This computer is about a week old. The very first thing I did was install MSE, then the updates. Everything dates from the 16th of June. There is nothing listed for (KB976932), but this version of Windows 7 comes with the service pack included, so&nbsp;I installed
 IE9 after that. The closest I come to that code is (KB976902).&nbsp;First I&nbsp;installed IE9&nbsp;manually, but because it didn't work, I restored and then accidentally installed it through an update, then used the restore point again&nbsp;to reset. I never found the software
 rendering option anywhere and eventually gave up trying until I came here. The error message only occurs in IE9 and I never received it before or since. KB2544521 is listed under installed updates.

<p><br />
That may have "screwed the pooch."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, you would never, EVER use System Restore to "undo" an update, Service Pack, or IE upgrade (which often leaves the system in a "confused" or "torn" state)! Instead, uninstall the update, Service Pack, and/or IE upgrade (i.e.,
<strong>Windows Internet Explorer 9</strong>)&nbsp;&amp; reboot. If that doesn't correct the problem,
<em>then</em> try System Restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, I think it'd be best for me to pass you on to MS Support for further assistance:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft offers home users no-charge telephone support for IE9 install and uninstall issues. You may also be eligible for telephone support if your issue causes your computer to crash or if IE9 does not let you browse all sites. In the US and CA, call (800)
 642-7676.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-US/CA residents can see this page: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/oas/default.aspx?&amp;gprid=15672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIP: Select the <strong>I use it for my own personal use</strong> option then click on
<strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please keep me posted on any progress you make &amp; don't be surprised if the tech recommends doing a Repair Install (AKA In-Place Upgrade; AKA startup repair) of Win7.<br />

            Final resolution: Firefox. Even with a clean install no one can make IE9 work. I gave up and won't touch IE again. Firefox is problem-free. Thanks for trying, though.

<p><br />
I have that option listed in my Internet Options&gt;Advanced Tab area.&nbsp; It is the first listing.&nbsp; If you don't have it then something is definitely wrong with IE installation files and it should be removed completely then reinstalled.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Have you done any system backups since obtaining your computer?&nbsp; You can use them to restore files from months ago when things worked.</p>

<p>Start&gt;Control Panel&gt; Double Click on System Icon</p>

<p>As for where you will find the Accelerated Graphics Options on Windows 7, it comes with Internet Explorer.http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398082</p>
<p>Check your graphics driver. Try uninstalling from device manager. It will reinstall on reboot. You might also try updating the driver.</p>

<h2>            Setting your fall back font when 3rd party fonts are not installed &#40;Word for Mac&#41;</h2>
                    I create and share several company templates (powerpoint, word)&nbsp; to individuals outside of our organisation. Our company has a custom font. Not surprisingly, most members outside of my company don't have it. When they open our documents, it reverts to
 a comic sans style script. How can I program templates so they default to Calibri?&nbsp;

<p>This is not something which <em>you</em> can control... at least not by any means considerably more invasive than having the other users install the font. If they don't want to simply install a font the most certainly would strenuously object to an outsider
 programmatically controlling their computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On their end - depending on their version of the program - they can use <strong>
Format&gt; Font Substitution</strong> to specify which font is used in place of the missing font(s). For whatever my opinion may be worth, however, this still will be far less than optimal: All fonts have their own defined parameters which directly affect text
 flow. IMHO it would be better to use a more readily available font then reformat after the editing has been done.</p>

            As Bob has mentioned, font substitution in Office is installation-dependent, not document-dependent. HTML/CSS is far more useful in this regard. Here is a
<strong><a href="http://www.brandwares.com/downloads/Useful_Office_Fonts_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PDF of useful fonts</a></strong> that come with Microsoft Office. These are always the best bet for widely-distributed documents or collaboration.
 Choose fonts checked in every column for maximum compatibility.

<h2>            hotmail sign in &#91;issue&#93;</h2>
                    <p>My wife travels frequently internationally for business. &nbsp;When she does, she uses a gov't issued sat phone. &nbsp; Her personal email (hotmail) now requires her to sign in with an extra step, she must receive a text with a numeric code. &nbsp;She cannot with this
 phone, it is a secured line and strictly for business. &nbsp;Tried skipping the text step yet it then needs a smart phone in order to do so. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts? &nbsp;&nbsp;At this point is the hotmail account finished?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks So Much,</p>

<p>If a contact has multiple Telephone Nos, then how to set a default number for that&nbsp;contact, e,g. Nokia's or Symbian Phone, You can Select a Particular No to Dial First or Send SMS. It is very helpful to avoid Overseas Call specially when that Person has

<p>In what application? In messages, Open new message, it will show you a message field, then tap the screen. Depending on phone orientation you should see either qwerty or alphanumeric.</p>

</p><p>I don't get an error message. I click on google search to search for viooz.com and type next to it the name of the movie I want to watch. Google responds with the movie but, you can not open it. Underneath the icon of the movie are cartoon advertisements?</p>

<h2>            Using Automator to print highlighted text in Word 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    I am just trying to highlight text and send to a Brother QL-500 label printer. &nbsp;Brother doesn't have a solution. &nbsp;I need a way to do some sort of print function in Automator in MS Word, which I understand was possible in MS word 2011 for Mac, but not for
 2016. &nbsp;Does anyone have a work-around. &nbsp;Seems like a simple function.

                    <p>So I just got the Lumia 950XL two days ago and signed up for insider preview versions (slow)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´m running build 10.0.10586.36 on my phone and when I connect the phone through Continuum&nbsp;to my Xbox One with the Wireless Display (preview) app on the resolution on the connected display (xbox/TV) is only 640x480</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if that is a limitation as of now or are there any settings I´m not seeing that can fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Xbox was connect to the TV through my AV receiver but same happens when the Xbox is connect directly to the TV</p>

            <p>Hi, Kristjan--</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a workaround posted in this forum thread:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_apps-insider_xbox/continuum-screen-resolution-xbox-one-4k-tv-lumia/f254b61e-188d-4c25-9b36-6fcffda420c5,</p>
<p>
</p><p>but I'll copy and paste it here for you. If this doesn't work, please reply here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround is:</p>
<p>go to Xbox One's Settings&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Display &amp; Sound</p>
<p>Select Video output</p>
<p>Set TV connection to : "Auto-detect"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the resolution using Continuum will be the right one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Live Lock Screen &#40;Beta or Final&#41; for Windows 10 Mobile.</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Question is that, Why Microsoft dropped support of<strong> Live Lock Screen for Windows 10 Mobile</strong>? It is most required feature ever i wanted on mobile device. Current lock screen looks Dumb &amp; Boring! Microsoft garage is continuously developing
 &amp; updating their app for Android &amp; iOS but not developing any app for Windows 10 Mobile. By looking your strategy towards Windows 10 Mobile, it clearly shows that, Microsoft has just given birth to child (i.e. Windows OS for mobile) but he is not interest
 to take care of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update on Live Lock Screen for Windows 10 Mobile!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Issues with receiving emails&#63;&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jxpchan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with receiving emails&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This has happened more than once and it is really starting to bother me. I will be waiting to receive an email and expecting that email in my inbox when I receive it. However, I will receive a notification (from my phone) that I have received the email and
 when I try to find the email after, it is not in my inbox! In fact, syncing the inbox doesn't work either because it keeps saying it's "up to date" when it isn't and it continues to only display emails I received yesterday! I know that I have not deleted or
 moved the email and this individual has sent me emails before without issue, so I don't understand why I am having this issue now! Has anyone else had this problem and fixed it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: My issue has been fixed (somewhat)</p>
<p>Just offering some background information to give a clearer picture of what happened. So, the email I was expecting was a notification email regarding an e-transfer. I had received the notification but ( as seen from my post) couldn't locate the email. Since
 I had gotten my family/friends to send me emails to check if it was a syncing issue, I determined later that there were no issues with my inbox. According to an email I received from interac, I didn't have any pending transactions so now, I am more confused
 about how I got a notification on my phone if nothing ever came through to begin with.</p>

            Did you look for the message in the junk email folder?
<br />
<br />Are you using Outlook on the web to read you mail or Outlook desktop software?  
<br />
<br />If you are using Outlook desktop software, is it set to work offline? It will say 'working offline' in the status bar.  If you are not in offline mode, restart Outlook.

<p>Yes, I did. It, unfortunately, wasn't there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went on both the web and the software (as well as my mobile device) to look for the email but could not find it. I asked people to send test emails and also received a confirmation email for something I set up earlier so I'm not sure why it's specifically
 this email that I cannot find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if the software is set to work offline but I have logged out/logged in and restarted my phone and laptop multiple times.&nbsp;</p>

            If you went to outlook on the web and didn't see it, the problem is not outlook working offline. 
<br />
<br />Is it in deleted items or deleted items recovery folder? 
<br />What phone do you use? Samsungs will filter mail it identifies as junk mail... and its easy to mark address as spammers on the phone.

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I've been de-Googling my life--bit by bit--and the last 4 things tying me to them (apart from stray tracking cookies) are:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Google Docs</li><li>Google Sheets</li><li>Google Calendar</li><li>Google Analytics</li></ul>
<p>My next step is probably going to be migrating the first 2 over to Office Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there an easy way to do this?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Since you are using Google file formats, we do not have an application that can convert them to Office formats. However, the developer of the Google file formats can provide you with the best advice on how to go about this concern. That being said, we recommend
 that you contact their support and ask them if they have a way or an application that can convert all your documents to Microsoft Office format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other questions or concerns in the future, we're just a click away.</p>

<h2>            oneNote in office 2019</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I upgraded from office 2016 to 2019.</p>
<p>Got to work this morning eager to use the new apps (I'm a math teacher and use OneNote in all my lessons).</p>
<p>I log in, go to open my notebooks, and get an error message saying I cannot open them in OneNote as they are older versions and I need to get a converter.</p>
<p>Is there any way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>

            Hi Sarah,
<br />
<br />Microsoft has dropped support for the Desktop version of OneNote 2016 in favor of the App version for Windows 10 and that has been removed form the Office 365 download . . . 
<br />
<br />Check this link for downloading OneNote 2016, it will work with your version of Office 
<br />

<p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>Once I have downloaded and opened the notebooks, can I convert them so that they will open in the oneNote app?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Does not display webpage. History does not work</h2>
                    The home page for ie is normal http://www.page.htm. The page does not display at all (just a white window). I open a new tab. Click on the new tab, then click back on the home page tab, and the home page DOES display. I can click a link and the link works,
 but the history button does not work, so I cannot return to the previous page and home page.<br />
<br />
Using internet options I reset IE options, and disabled addons etc.<br />
<br />
I have uninstalled updates IE9, and 8. I think IE7 is as far back as I can go. Then I reinstalled to IE9 testing along the way. Used system restore for what it was worth, but didn't have restore points going back far enough.<br />
<br />
I tried a swiss army knife solution from tweaking.com, which ran subinacl, fix hijack, psexec, regini, repaired or modified all permissions, ran a checkdisk, as per -<br />
Reset Registry Permissions=True<br />
Reset File Permissions=True<br />
Register System Files=True<br />
Repair WMI=True<br />

<br />
and reset Vista services to default.<br />
<br />
Still same response from IE. Nothing worked.<br />
Reinstall Windows Vista Ultimate after using it 3 years? WAY too much stuff installed including web devl apps, win devl apps, IIS, SQL. Say it ain't so. Any other possible solution?<br />

            Tried both methods. Same symptoms, including in the new user.<br />
<br />
Recent changes?<br />
Me: messing in the registry.&nbsp; I found a (commercial) service had been collecting browsing data over a period of years without my knowledge. I proceeded to delete their toolbar, and wipe their files and registry data out of my system. In haste and out of anger,
 I did not backup the registry. Stupid me.<br />
<br />
I have several browsers installed due to my work. None of them are affected; just IE. It is important to my work that IE works properly.<br />
<br />
Other browsers display full functionality, so that eliminates network connectivity issues among other things.<br />
<br />
I've got to say, the click behavior I described is really interesting. Its not that the browser cannot display the homepage when starting up, it is just that it does not do it for some reason.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I do not know IE well enough to know why.<br />

            typo: s/b www.somedomain.com/page.htm. I typo'd the placeholder<br />
I have tried other pages like microsoft and google. None work properly.<br />
<br />
shell:history is populated<br />
Open a shell:history page displays properly in a new tab if IE has a page already opened.<br />
Open from shell:history with IE closed responds the same as the homepage.<br />
<br />
Open (a link) in a new window does not respond.<br />
Open (a link) in a new tab opens the tab, but does not display the page.<br />
Most popular sites page (links) do not respond.<br />
<br />
I am comparing a reg backup from Jan 2011, but the builds are different, and it's a shot in the dark considering what I do not know about IE.<br />

<p><br />
Are you implying that the problems only start again when you install IE9?&nbsp;&nbsp; That would sound like you have something else installed which is doing something with IE but which doesn't understand some differences in IE9 and hence is interfering.&nbsp;&nbsp; How controlled
 is your reinstall of IE9?&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you should be removing some things before retrying?</p>

IE (7-8-9) were working fine, until I went messing in the registry.<br />
<br />
IE8 and IE7 browsers display the same symptoms on uninstall to those build levels.<br />
So far it seems the core engines and network system files are ok. Everything works. I am looking for a few keys responsible for the homepage display, and tab display behaviors.<br />

<p>Sounds like your system is all "tweaked" out&nbsp; :)-&nbsp; Since you pretty much did all the major troubleshooting steps I only have one suggestion and that would to run this script in the link below. Make sure to run as Admin and it will work for IE 7 8 and 9.
 After the script is finished running restart your machine.</p>

            Thanks Joe-C:<br />
<br />
Did it. No go. Then uninstalled 9; did it again. No go again. Reinstalled 9. Same.<br />
Did required shutdowns along the way. Got script output: "Not necessary to correct bugs in the registry. All tasks have been finished."<br />
<br />
Memory: Didn't Supreme Court mandate IE to be a stand-alone app separate from the system?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I can't let this IE problem become a separate job unto itself. I found a reg script to fix the pinned site problem. I'm doing work arounds. Hopefully that will work until I need to upgrade to Win 7. I don't see a solution for this.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I thought you were running Win 7 (?) Have you installed SP1 for Win 7?</p>
<p>Have you tried SFC.EXE?<br />
How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7:
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>I'm not sure that throughout all of this, this has been done. Uncheck "Preserve favorite website data"&nbsp; then clear the Temporary Internet Files and History.</p>

SFC - don't recall the switches that were used, but yes it was one of the first things.&nbsp; I'll check out the article, and also try the uncheck. Certainly worth the effort. I've spent the night re-setting (vs resetting) folder and file permissions. Wouldn't surprise
 me at all if I did a restart and it worked all of a sudden. ;-) Probably not though.<br />

<h2>            I cannot load Navy Knowledge Online from home computer</h2>
                    <p>Today I have been trying to access Navy Knowledge Online with my issued CAC reader and my CAC card. When I attempt to access the page I get "this page cannot be displayed." I have followed the guide provided on Militarycac.com on 3 computers with no success.
 I called NKO support and they stated that the problem has to lie with my computer and that they do not support home computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know any other solutions to this issue?</p>

<p>It won't continue while the computer is asleep (nothing can actually process during sleep, all activity gets paused).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a portable computer (the Surface Pro 4) and I like to set my power to 'never sleep' when it's plugged in. That way overnight while it charges it can do all these scans (and other things like backups and updates) and thus those things are always done
 before I wake up and I don't have to worry about being interrupted or finishing them later.</p>

<p>That should be fine.&nbsp; Most devices built in the last roughly 5-7 years have more modern capabilities with power management and will prevent a battery from overcharging or decaying performance from being plugged in too much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also no longer necessary to fully drain batteries to re-train them these days.&nbsp; The old "memory" problem of older generation batteries is not really prominent anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
I would still recommend following the manufacturer's instructions, if they gave any. But in general, I wouldn't worry about it being plugged in when you aren't using it on the go.</p>

    <title>Does Microsoft really want to compete in the market &#38; get a share, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ammarsalman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Microsoft really want to compete in the market &#38; get a share, or just live in an isolated world&#63;</h2>
                    Well, many people started wondering, why is Android so popular? almost every family has at least one person who uses an Android, but how many families have persons who use WP?
<br />
Unfortunately they're rare, I used to wonder why, that was before using the actual Windows Phone, and before discovering how many features it&nbsp; misses, of course I used a Nokia older smartphone, with the Symbian OS, and I can easily tell that the Symbian offers
 some better features in many aspects...<br />
Now before heating up on me, and before typing replies, read my opinion till the end.<br />
I'll make a quick list about the major missing features in Windows Phone 8:<br />
1. No file-explorer, many would wonder, why do I care about it? well, I am an expert smartphone user, and I am expected to get the best out of my phone by getting everywhere I need in the phone, specially that MS prevented 3rd party apps from the ability of
 saving anything to the Videos folder in the storage, how bad can that be? well, it's very bad since those apps store private data, which is not accessible by anyone/anything, so if I downloaded an app, and from the app I downloaded a video from YouTube, I
 wouldn't be able to reach that file except from it's own app, whether I had a PC or not, so I am actually with ZERO control on MY, MY, MY PHONE, UNLIKE MY OLD N95.<br />
2. The ability of downloading and controlling FILES (MP3, TEXTS, PDF...etc) from Internet Explorer, or any other web browser, the fact that I have to download the file from my Laptop and then copy the file to my phone is just unbelievable, and why all that,
 because I am not allowed to do stuff I easily used to do with my N95...<br />
3. A decent music player, seriously, I had a much better MUSIC experience with my OLD N95 than any Windows Phone device.<br />
4. A decent camera app, again, I had a much better camera software experience with my old N95 than any other WP device, how? well, maybe by having the ability to choose the resolution of the image?? maybe by have the ability of choosing the resolution of the
 video?? not by only having 2 HD options, what if I wanted a non-HD video? I just can't....Also, THE ZOOM WHILE RECORDING, how could MS forbid us from such ability???<br />
5. A decent video player, with the ability of playing 3GP files, with the ability of choosing whether I wanted in landscape mode or portrait mode,&nbsp; with the ability of reaching my wanted part of the video by one touch?<br />
6. WPA2 Enterprise networks support, unfortunately MS decided also to forbid its "trusted" custmores from connecting to most of the world's universities networks, what a shame, having a WP means being the ONLY one with a "smartphone" without the ability of
 using INTERNET, LOL WHATS THE USE OF A SMARTPHONE WITHOUT THE INTERNET?<br />
7. A decent Bluetooth application, with the latest ports which allow multi-filesharing over Bluetooth capabilities, and with the ability of changing your NAME to another name else than Windows Phone!! Again here, I had a better experience with my old N95 in
 the Bluetooth section!!!<br />
8. This is a killing one, the ability of controlling SIM data, seriously, I can't delete my SIM messages? my SIM contacts? and once again, the N95 has the lead...<br />
<br />
Well, I guess I've pointed out the most important missing features in the Windows Phone 8.<br />
And in my opinion and as an expert user, I have to warn everyone who thinks of buying a Windows Phone of those missing features, cause really, if I knew they were missing, I wouldn't have bought mine...I NEED THOSE FEATURES EVERYDAY OF MY LIFE.<br />
<br />
I used to be the biggest WP supporter, at least before I bought one and discovered why people are heading away from it.<br />
Microsoft, this failure is all from YOUR side, it has NOTHING to do with Nokia, If Nokia made an Android device I assure you they wouldn't have lost any place in the market, so YES Nokia lost cause of MS, and instead of respecting who's beside them, they just
 keep ignoring and ignoring, just like what will happen to this post, will be ignored by MS (what a surprise).
<br />
<br />
But of course, I am not here only to criticize what MS did, the main reason of this "question" was to post my opinion which could be the solution for MS and Nokia to rule the market in 2 months.<br />
Now you would wonder, what solution could do so? I mean, adding the features above isn't enough, since Android and iOS already have them, so it would be more like catching up...<br />
So MS needs another plan, turning Windows Phone 8 into a Windows 8, really people, I can't express my happiness with the Windows 8 experience, such an amazing platform, which allows us to feel the innovation, everything is clear and easy to use, how can they
 turn WP into Win8? that's easy, by multitasking, by giving us the ability of opening 2 Windows at the same time, it's called Windows, WINDOWS for god's sake...<br />
After all, NO1 ever can deny MS success in Windows platforms, so why not to give a part of the success to the Windows Mobile/Phone devices?
<br />
<br />
Microsoft, add those features, do what I pointed to before, let me buy your next smartphone, let me have the privilege over Android/iOS users, let them get jealous from what I own, make me proud of owning a Windows Phone product.<br />
<br />
So that's for it, thanks for reading, and see ya...<br />

<h2>            Unlock a workbook</h2>
                    
<p>I need help to unlock a workbook in the middle of the code so that a manager doesn't have to type in the password. &nbsp;Here is a portion of the code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheet1.Cells(22, 2) = "= 'C:\Users\ben biggs\Desktop\BOMServerFolder\[wwtconsumptionentry.xlsm]cellsend'!R1C1"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when it accesses that file, I just need it automatically have the password. &nbsp;The problem is the code is going to access like 10 different workbooks and I can't have him remembering 10 different passwords.</p>

<p>I am not sure how you are opening the workbook.&nbsp; If you are using the Open method, check Excel VBA help for Workbooks.Open and you will find you can provide the password as one of the parameters.</p>
<p>Where you get the passwords from is up to you.&nbsp; Store then in some worksheet. Or hard code them in the VBA routine.</p>
<p>Or, maybe, you can simply not password protect the workbooks?</p>

            The code I listed above is how i open the work book. &nbsp;It just get the information from the cells listed. &nbsp;There is a password on the document. &nbsp;My trouble comes from the fact that this code is very compact and I don't know where to put the password info.

Welcome to Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you have accidentally flagged an email and you want to unflag it. Flagging your emails enable you to look for the messages easily. Once you have flagged an email, a red flag will be displayed beside the subject of the message. To unflag
 the email, just simply click the flag icon <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fofficeimg.vo.msecnd.net%2fen-us%2ffiles%2f768%2f178%2fZA006045537.gif" /><font color="#444444">.</font></p>

<h2>            3D models in PowerPoint advanced texturing and lighting</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am testing the 3D model insertion / animation function inside office, especially &nbsp;inside Power Point.</p>
<p>I am inserting 3D baked models that have their lighting and materials embedded in their texture.</p>
<p>I am looking for some more proffesional articles on the 3D capabilities of Office / Power Point, especially on how to turn on or off the global lighting and shadows, how to control reflections, etc.</p>
<p>Does anyone know where to find such discussion groups? Other links or sources?</p>
<p>everything I found up to now are very basic guides.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>No version of Office contains Outlook EXPRESS.</p>
<p>Presumably you mean that you were using Otlook from Office 2003. Home and Student 2007 doesn't come with Outlook, which you would have found out if you'd researched before purchasing.</p>
<p>If you still have Office 2003 you will need to re-install it to be able to read the pst file (presumably you copied that as your backup) and then you can either continue to use Outlook 2003 as your mail client.</p>
<p>The other option is to go back to the old computer (presumably using Vista or XP) and export to either Outlook Express or Windows Mail, which you can then transfer to Windows Live Mail on your new Windows 7 computer.</p>

            It was outlook not outlook express, as to the comment about researching before purchasing you would assume that a newer version would have more instead of less,reguardless I missed that. The next question is my son needs 2007 for one of his classes because
 it was not compatible with something from a teacher in 2003 version, is there a way to retrieve the saved emails or do I have to spend more money to purchase outlook seperate or is it even available? Do I have to run 2 versions of Office 2003 and 2007 which
 seems kind of crazy?

<p><br />
This is where researchy really pays off - Office Student and Teacher 2003 (which includes Outlook) is NOT the same as Office Home and Student 2007 (which does NOT include Outlook but DOES include Onenote).</p>
<p>The second issue about compatibility I don't understand. Office 2007 (any version) will automatically open any document created in any prior version of Office. The same is not true the other way. The default document type in Office 2007 is NOT able to be
 opened natively by prior versions of Office unless the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Compatibility pack</a> is installed.</p>
<p>So no - you can run Office 2003 even if the class tutor has 2007, but not the other way around unless you install the compatibility pack.</p>
<p>Hope that's clear!</p>
