<h2>            Nokia Phone Demands I Sync Contacts - Unsure Why</h2>
                    Today, my Nokia phone began to badger me with alerts, demanding that I sync my contacts. I am unsure why, as I have not installed any new programs or applications that might have brought on this change. The only thing that I could think that may have caused
 this was a new contact that I added to my phone today. However, I have nothing I want to 'sync' to that number in the first place. All I want on there is the phone number and name, and I have those already. How can I fix this problem?

    <title>Lumia 900 Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scot---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 900 Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Got my Lumia on Friday from AT&amp;T and have noticed a couple things so far. &nbsp;May be issues with the device itself, or may be with Windows Phone 7.5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Phone cannot be powered off when it's plugged into its charger. &nbsp;If I power the phone off while it's connected to the charger it appears to shut down and then immediately powers back on. &nbsp;I don't know if it's supposed to do this, or if this is some sort
 of bug/defect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I'm unable to connect to the 802.1x WiFi network at my work. &nbsp;Connecting requires that we enter both a user name AND a password. &nbsp;The Lumia 900 is able to see the network, but when I attempt to connect it only gives me the option to enter a password.
 &nbsp;There is nowhere to enter my user name. &nbsp;There is no way to connect to WiFi at my work without entering a user name. &nbsp;I have never had this issue with any other device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still playing with it, so will add on if I notice anything else.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 switching between desktops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haydentaylor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 switching between desktops</h2>
                    I think it'd be awesome if the Microsoft team added an easier way to switch between desktops in Windows 10. I'm currently using the technical preview and I don't like having to either go down to the task view or hit the key binds which consist of 3 different
 keys. I think it would be really nice if they implemented another 'charms bar' like menu to swich between desktops just like how you can move to the top left hand corner of the screen to change apps. So if you moved your hand to the bottom/top right hand of
 the screen it displayed a preview of all the active desktops as well as a red X on them to close it.

</p><p>Hi Hayden</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that the Task View icon on the Taskbar is the easiest way to work with the Virtual Desktops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can click that icon and this displays all of the virtual desktops. You can switch to any of those desktops or click the X close button on each desktop.</p>

<p>I don't like how small the desktop icons are and the windows view are much larger, I want a menu showing only the desktops so I don't have to focus my mouse on a tiny area to switch desktops. Or maybe an easier keybind would suffice like control + right/left</p>

<h2>            Publishing Free&#47;Busy Information to MS Exchange from Multiple Calendars</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I've tried, with no success to try and get MS Outlok to publish my free/busy information from multiple calendars to our business Exchange server, and hoping someone might be able to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My setup for calendars is as follows:</p>
<p>- Main Outlook calendar (Default, Free/Busy information shared with no issues)</p>
<p>- Internet synced ICS file calendars from Google account (visible in Outlook calendar in side-by-side views, but not able to be merged with my main Outlook Calendar with regards to free/busy times)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I store my annual vacation times on a Google calendar administered through my Google account (and android phone), and ideally want this information (already imported through Outlook over the internet through an ICS link) to be merged with my main Outlook
 calendar free/busy time so that when other people in the company use the "scheduling assistant" in "Appointments", all my free/busy time is shown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question is, can these two calendars' free/busy time be merged in Outlook and published? Or am I out of luck? Or there any plug-ins that can do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance! </p>

<br />
As I'm sure you are aware, design view exists in MS Office / Word. I have built websites with Office / Word in design view. Perhaps he is using Office / Word, not Publisher.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, there's a small icon consisting of a green set-square atop a scale-rule which, if clicked, exits the design mode.<br />

    <title>Contact suggestion when addressing an email. Contact picker not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 3dwulf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contact suggestion when addressing an email. Contact picker not showing up</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently switched over from another email client to better integrate with my coworkers. After the headache of importing my contacts I have only one more issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The basic problem is that when addressing and email my contact list is not being referenced for suggested contacts. The contact picker does not show up at all if the auto-complete is not populated and turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Cleared out the Auto-complete</p>
<p>2. Cleared out suggested contacts</p>
<p>3. Turned <strong>off</strong> auto-complete in the options. At this point when testing the address suggestions in a new email, nothing was suggested.</p>
<p>4. Turned <strong>on</strong> auto-complete in the options.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>5. Switched to off line, created a new email, added all my contacts to the TO, sent the email, deleted the email from my outbox and went back on line. Only the email address were copied over using this method so if you have another method please let me know.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What happens now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When I type a first name of a contact, the contact picker list comes up but only for contacts that have their first name in the email address. When I select this contact only the email shows up (<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></em>)
 and not the persons name as this example:&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Microsoft account team &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</span></em></p>
<p>2. When I type a first name of a contact that does not have that name in the email address nothing is suggested. If I typed Microsoft in the above point nothing would have showed up in the contact picker. If I type this name anyway and then tab out of the
 address bar, then after about 5 seconds the address will appear. As you can imagine this is not optimum if I am trying to quickly address multiple people as well as trying to keep track later who I sent the email too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the contact list not the primary list that the contact picker refers to first?</p>
<p>How do I get the full name to show in the address bar instead of just the email address</p>
<p>How do I get the name of the person to be the look up item instead of just a detail in the email address</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hello Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the cache concept between the two list even if I don't understand the logic of why it is needed to have an extra list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I exported from EM Client in VCF format (the only format offered). As I did not want to spend days importing all 700+ contacts one by one into outlook I finally found a way of generating a CSV format by importing the VCF into gmail and then exporting out
 in CSV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was then able to import into outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at my contacts in the contact list they look correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>As previously stated the "To" btn brings up the address book, which is a filtered view of Contacts that have an electronic address.</p>
<p>The auto complete is populated by usage, from either addresses you manually enter, or by using the address book to enter an address.</p>

</p><p>In other words the auto complete cache is empty until you add records in either of the two methods shown above.</p>

            <p>Hello Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We seem to be miss communicating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Status:</p>
<p>The auto-complete list is populated with ALL my contact emails.</p>
<p>The contact list is populated with names, email addresses, phone numbers and all contact&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Action results:</p>
<p>When I type in the address TO I only get suggestions that have the name I am typing in the actual email address.</p>
<p>When I select this name then only the email address is shown in the TO address bar and does not inlude the name of the person.</p>
<p>If the name I am typing does not exist in the email address then no suggestion comes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this normal? Based on every other email client that I've used this does not seem normal.</p>
<p>Is there a way of reviewing the list of auto-complete?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something that I noticed is when I am addressing and use the TO.... button the list that comes up shows Name (full name of the person), Display name (the email address of the person) and the Email Address (the address of the person). Should the Display Name
 show the persons name instead?</p>

<p>
</p><p>What shows up in/under the AddressBook Display Name is the value that currently exists in the Email DisplayName field for a given contact. Generally, when a new contact is created via the Outlook UI - the EDN will be (Name &lt;email address&gt;) but if the data
 was imported via the Outlook import wizard - only the email address gets populated in the EDN.</p>

            <p>The B25 doesn't belong in there. I don't know what exactly you are trying to accomplish, but {=ROUND(MIN(IF(B4:B10&gt;0,B4:B10)),-2)} will round the minimum of the positive values in B4:B10 to the nearest multiple of 100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warning: if ALL values in B4:B10 are either &lt;=0 or blank, the formula will return 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note for others: the { } are used to indicate an array formula; they should not be typed.&nbsp;The formula&nbsp;should be entered as =ROUND(MIN(IF(B4:B10&gt;0,B4:B10)),-2) and confirmed with Ctrl+Shift+Enter. Excel will then display {=ROUND(MIN(IF(B4:B10&gt;0,B4:B10)),-2)}

            <p>The Round() function needs a positive integer as the last parameter. Your formula has a negative number. Why? What are you trying to round to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, your formula is missing a closing bracket for the Min() function, which should be after the B25 cell reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This formula works for me (confirmed with CTRL-Shift-Enter):</p>

            So, to B25 or not to B25 ... All depends on the placement of a closing bracket. Eagerly awaiting Jenni's response.

            <p>Hi HansV</p>
<p>Thanks for your info, greatly appreciated.&nbsp; B25 is where the formula will go and it is a workbook with branch info that has 1 line missing or no data.&nbsp; Therefore the total sum returns a 0 and complicates the issue.</p>
<p>I did get it to work, yes the {} are the ctrl,shift,enter.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

    <title>Attempted to migrate region, got stuck in a redirect loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessicaaugustsson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Attempted to migrate region, got stuck in a redirect loop</h2>
                    <p>I have a GB (Great Britain) microsoft business account and I am moving to Sweden, so would like to change the region to Sweden so I can update the payment method. &nbsp;On the Billing Help page, the topic "Changing your billing country or region" says that I
 should use the following link on the Xbox account migration page (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=393915) and that I can change my address at that site (even though I don't have an xbox). When I click the link, the page doesn't load, and instead, after
 attempting to contact microsoft, I get an error that says "This web page has a redirect loop".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me? I'd really appreciate some advice.</p>

            <p>I think that it might be the case for accounts in the US being unable to change billing country. I'm uncertain about that. But I know I found the following when I searched for billing help in the menus of my Microsoft account:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/db1f1473-fe16-451a-a115-b197fe40eb8e" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the "Xbox account migration page" link at the top of the right-hand pane. And perhaps there was a delay, or I clicked too many times, and then promptly got stuck in the redirect loop I mentioned before. Whatever happened, I now seem to have
 my GB business account (as mentioned previously) plus a "US personal account" with no information on it at all, and which I'm pretty certain is the result of whatever went wrong with the migration page redirect loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to do is NOT have this strange US personal account at all, and migrate my GB business account to Sweden, which the directions above seem to indicate I can in fact do. (However, the Xbox Live help pages state that one can only migrate countries/regions
 every three months, so perhaps whatever went wrong with the redirect loop has also put some kind of block on making any new changes for three months anyway.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if you have any information for European Microsoft accounts, and how I might migrate the billing address from Great Britain to Sweden, I'd be grateful, since the above screen shot mentions being able to do so, and I'd like to continue being able to
 pay for my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            How do I remove read only status from email downloaded documents&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Some forum posts say you cant do this.</p>
<p>I know that you can duplicate the document and save it by another name - but this doesn't support my needs or the file naming conventions of my business.</p>
<p>What would I like advice on how to achieve? &nbsp; I want it to be my decision and not Microsoft's whether a document is read only or not. &nbsp; For preference I would like the automatic read only default switched off.</p>
<p>Is this achievable?</p>

<p>Hi Leaf-farms,</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting our forum.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve learnt that you would like the downloaded document from an email to be read only or not is on your decision. I totally understand it would be rather convenient if you can manually set it. While, itâ€™s not feasible to achieve that. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Given the situation, Could you please submit your feedback via:</p>

<p>Hi Leaf-farms,</p>
<p>If you are not using an Office 365 Business account and you want the Outlook 2016 to view&nbsp;attachments as not read-only status. Based on my test and research, we cannot change it in the Outlook 2016 client.</p>
<p>Besides, as our forum mainly focuses on Office 365 Business Online Services, we have limited resources dealing with Outlook client related issues. Given the situation, you can also post this issue with detailed information at
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook client Forum</a>. Engineers there might be able to provide you more assistance. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Franky</p>

<p>I posted in what I thought was a support forum. &nbsp; The badge on the right hand side of your email reply says Microsoft Support. &nbsp; I have had previous answers to my question where the english was so poor as to be not understandable; I have had a response that
 told me to adjust Trust Centre settings (when that function doesnt exist in Word for Mac). &nbsp; No you tell me that Outlook as an email client doesn't do what I need it to do.</p>
<p>Not exactly something to put in the book of all time great customer care.</p>
<p>Time I think to a) say hello again to the Mac Mail app &nbsp;b) check out Open Office &nbsp;c) make sure that my subscription to Office 365 is not set to autorenew</p>

            Hello Paul,
<br />
<br />I'm sorry to hear you are having this issue! My name is Jeff, I am an independent advisor with years of experience with Microsoft collaboration solutions looking to help fellow community members like yourself. I look forward to helping diagnose the issue and point you in the right direction to a fix. Let's get started....
<br />
<br />The best course of action is to submit a new support request filling in all of the information that is requested (IP range, sent to/from, etc). This will cause a manual review to see if they can be whitelisted. You can access the link here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportrequestform/8ad563e3-288e-2a61-8122-3ba03d6b8d75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportrequ...</a>
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, none of the advisors in this community can fix this issue, it must be resolved by Microsoft directly.
<br />
<br />Good luck!
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />-Jeff

</p><p>I go there and look, but it is always a log of me logging in.&nbsp; There is a "This wasn't me" link, but no apparent way to verify that it was me, or better yet to turn it off so it will stop snooping on the account.&nbsp; It's almost harassment and there has to
 be some way to address it.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Selecting &#47; Copying multiple attachments in Office 2016 &#40; from one mail to another &#41;</h2>
                    For years, I have been copying multiple ( selective or even all ) attachments from emails to other emails, folders, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;We just cannot seem to make this work in Office 2016.&nbsp; I can right click individual and copy but cannot select more than one at a
 time.&nbsp; Is there something that i am doing wrong or did MSFT take away this basic functionality??...awaiting Expert inputs.

<div>Hi JitendraAhuja,</div>
<div><br />
<div>The feature to select/copy multiple attachments from one mail to another is created by design. As a workaround, you may save the attachments to local and select the ones you need to a new email.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also highly suggest to submit <strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">feedback</a></strong> about this, any improvements in the product are based on the users' requirements. Our developers strive to capture Microsoft
 users' ideas and are working hard to create a more powerful and easy-to-use product.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards.</div>

<h2>            Cell Styles changes Date to Number format - how do I stop this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The date column is already set in a date format.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I apply to a row a cell styling from the Format area (where all the different cell styles are displayed), the date is changed to General.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I attempt to modify the cell style, the only option I have for property Number is General format.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How do I adjust the cell styles to keep the date in a Date format, and not covert it to a General format?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Amy</p>

            Hi Bob,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply. As it turned out, if you don't want the original date format to change, then un-check the Number option in the cell styling. So, when you apply that style to either a cell, row, or column, it will leave the original numerical data
 (including dates) alone. This was what I was after.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best,&nbsp;</div>
<div>Amy</div>

    <title>Nokia Lumia Update FAIL&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew.r.s.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia Update FAIL&#33;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>The scaling is ALL wrong for the Lumia 635 devices!&nbsp; When trying to text or even type things, the taskbar overtakes the options; start a new text, selecting texts, as well as the search option.&nbsp; Also when to type the keyboard overtakes the dialogue portion
 you are entering.&nbsp; So you can't&nbsp; even see what you're typing.&nbsp; I BELIEVE this is due to the screen resolution now being "480x854", instead of "480x850" as it was previously and before the most recent and newest update was sent to my device. This "scaling"
 issue is BY FAR THE WORST AND MOST INCONVENIENT issue I have EVER had with this phone.&nbsp; And in saying so, I am definitely going to change devices, because I am quite positive that you, the developers, have known about this issue for some time now and have
 just been reluctant to fix it.&nbsp; Is it because this is a cheap, lower-end device and you don't care about the people who cannot afford your more expensive phones?&nbsp; I certainly hope not...but the fact remains, you know this, among MANY other issues, but aren't
 taking action. FIX IT, PLEASE!</p>

    <title>publisher 2007 footnotes and endnotes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lindalouk  say:</h3>
<h2>            publisher 2007 footnotes and endnotes</h2>
                    When I copy a document from Word to Publisher 2007, I lose all the footnotes/endnotes. By this I mean, none of the footnote/endote numbers show up in the main text. I can copy the actual endnotes by simply pasting that section of the document in (i.e.,
 I get the references at the end; what I don't get are the numbers in the text).

<p>
</p><p>ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(i).AlternativeText = ""</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unsuccessful on random images in my document, I believe it's because it can't comprehend the newlines and it is starting a line or two below the existing text instead of sensing it. Let me know if you can reproduce this. Otherwise I'm not sure why
 this wouldn't be working.</p>

<p>Just to be sure, you can run the following macro that sets both AlternativeText and Title to the empty string, for both Shapes and InlineShapes:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Sub RemoveAltText()<br />
'Stefan Blom, Microsoft Word MVP, May 2019<br />
Dim x As Shape<br />
Dim y As InlineShape</p>
<p>For Each x In ActiveDocument.Shapes<br />
x.AlternativeText = ""<br />
y.Title = ""<br />
Next x</p>
<p>For Each y In ActiveDocument.InlineShapes<br />
y.AlternativeText = ""<br />
y.Title = ""<br />
Next y<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Title isn't used in recent versions of Word, perhaps the document was initially created in an older version?</p>
