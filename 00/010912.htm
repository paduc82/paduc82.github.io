            Hi Steve,<br />
<br />
According to the error message, the issue might be related to a duplicate entry in the Permission list for the user’s calendar. To check it in the Outlook client:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right-click the user's calendar and select Properties.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click the Permissions tab.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Go through the users list and check for a duplicate entry.<br />
If you find one, remove the duplicate entry and then restart Outlook again and try to share your calendar to see if the error occurs.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are using an Office 365 account in your Outlook 2016, you can try sharing the calendar in Outlook Web App (OWA). For detailed information, please refer to

<p>Are you trying to simply share the calendar for viewing, or to allow another person to make changes?&nbsp; Viewing should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to allow another user to have editing privileges, this is a know issue in most (all?) versions of Office Outlook since the 'new' Outlook.com overhaul.&nbsp; Don't remember where I saw it, but&nbsp;a MS tech response was something to the effect of 'we know
 about it and are working on&nbsp;a fix'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an Office 365 (2017) user, the sharing/editing feature is the main reason I subscribed to the package.&nbsp;&nbsp;Being unable to share editing has&nbsp;been an issue much too long - many, many months.&nbsp; My subscription expires in Jan.&nbsp; If no fix by then, I'll opt out
 of renewing and figure out&nbsp;something else for mail &amp; calendaring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is reminiscent of trying to use Norton Identity Safe in IE 11 or Edge browsers (it works in Chrome).&nbsp; Norton is catching heat for it not being available, but it appears MS is refusing to allow it to be installed.&nbsp; MS is now supporting&nbsp;the free
 LastPass program instead.&nbsp; Additionally, the new Creator build of Win 10 is promoting a new 'for pay' password service named Keeper ($30/year, 1 user/$60/year, 5 users).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the rhetoric, but it seems like there's always time to do things over, but no time to do them right the first time.&nbsp; Discouraging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>
<p>

<p>We also encountered this problem. The&nbsp;cause appears to be that when Office tries to send the "sharing" emails to share the calendar with recipients it doesn't check to see whether that username is already in the calendar's permission list. So (for example)
 if you make a secondary calendar and then try to share it with Jane Doe as "editor", if Jane Doe is already in the calendar permission list with permission level "None" Office will not replace the permissions. Instead it gives the error "Error While Preparing
 Send Sharing Message."</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the issue, bring up the Calendar and click "Calendar Permissions" on the Home menu of the ribbon. If there are any usernames in the permissions that are the same as the username you want to add, then remove them. Once they've been removed you can
 re-add them manually with the correct permission level, and re-send the sharing email.</p>

<p>I have the same sharing issue as numerous others seem to have.&nbsp; The calendar I wish to share has just "Default" and "Anonymous" listed under permissions and nothing else, certainly not the username with whom I wish to share.&nbsp; Consequently I have no usernames
 to remove.&nbsp; Sharing still fails with the&nbsp;<span><strong>"Error while preparing to send sharing message."</strong>&nbsp;error message.</span>&nbsp; If I try to add a username manually, the only option I am given is my own email address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I said before on 10/11/17, MS knows about the problem.&nbsp; At the end of a very long Chat session with MS Support that went to their level 3 folks, I was told "we're working on it".&nbsp; It's not reassuring to see the problem still exists after more than six
 months.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It's also disturbing to see MS reps (see comments above on this thread by Alan Wu &amp; Edward Qu, Microsoft Support Engineers) trying to solve a problem that the advance Tech Support group knows about and
 has been unable to fix FOR MORE THAN 6 MONTHS.&nbsp; Isn't there some form of linear communication within Microsoft?&nbsp; Don't the support people talk to each other?&nbsp; Isn't there some kind of central information function (think commonly available database) where MS
 folks can go to see what's happening with various issues?&nbsp; It begs the question "how many different people at MS are expending resources working on the same issue, and don't know what the others are doing?"&nbsp;
<span>What idiocy is at work here?&nbsp; </span>From my days in the military, that would be referred to as FUBAR.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p>Unfortunately, my plan to opt out of renewing Office 365 'if the problem wasn't fixed by the 1st of this year', fell through.&nbsp; My daughter gifted a new subscription to me for Christmas, so here I continue to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After picking up a couple of Amazon Dots for Christmas, I discovered the Outlook.com calendar can be used via Alexa to create events.&nbsp; So both my wife &amp; I can make calendar entries on one calendar, but not edits without using the PC.&nbsp; That's probably not
 a viable option within an organization.</p>

    <title>6260 Slide - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stalwart---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            6260 Slide</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Nokia People,<br />
<br />
I bought the 6260 phone at last after long waiting since I am a fan of the S40 based mobiles. However, I was disappointed!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Features and performance wise, the phone is OK and the S40 6th edition is sooo coooool. I would rate it at least 8 out of 10. Camera for still shots is perfect with Average quality mediocre 15 frame/second QVGA video. Awesome 240*320 Display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, The worst thing about it is the build!!! Plastic!!! It has a strange fingerprint-prone cheap looking front. It's all in plastic except for the back cover that is aluminum. Moreover, The assembly is noticeably poor. You can notice a mellimeter gap
 here and there. Specifically in the Keypad and the back cover. If the Keypad it is lit, you can see the light coming from the lower gap between the keypad and the plastic frame it is embedded in!!! Not to mention the annoying plastic ticks sound you get when
 you use the D-pad or any other key. A strange thing as well is that you can not rotate the screen in important applications like office products and internet browser!
<i>😠</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion:: I don't want to be offensive. However, i am starting to feel that Nokia Chinese products do not go through the thorough QA Process Finnish products go through. A simple comparison between the 6260 and the famous 6300 would give you that feeling.

            FWIW there is no difference between a Nokia product manufactured in Nokia's China plant and the same product manufactured in Hungary, Finland or wherever else Nokia has plants. A lemon is just as likely to come out of any other plant as it is out of the
 China plant.

<p>Hi Grschinon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lemon is not a product. It's a plant. I am insisting that the 6260 slide build quality is very poor. Is it because of China or the design? i don't know. In all cases, Nokia has to re-look at it. It's simply suffering with each button press and produces
 a "sqeeek" sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, it might be my specific mobile problem. I'll go to Nokia dealer and see what's up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi grschinon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't get what you meant in your first post. Now I understood it. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to the same shop I bought the 6260 from, and it is the same problem with all sets. The plastic usage is high which produces unpleasant sounds while using the phone. Besides, there is still the same poor build quality problem which is apparent in the
 phone finishing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Not getting security code on phone number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarthak11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not getting security code on phone number</h2>
                    <p>I changed my email in my security info of my xbox account. This is because I can not access my old email address. Now when I try and buy something from the xbox store I can not because I am locked out of it for 30 days. I have my phone number listed as other
 security info. When I go to recover my account it asks me to choose one of 3 options: 1. My email 2. text on my phone 3. phone call. I can not use email as I can not access that email anymore. I choose the other 2 options and press send code, the option greys
 out for a few seconds then nothing happens. The send code button becomes blue again as if I have not pressed it.</p>
<p>What is happening?!!!</p>
<p>I just renewed my xbox live membership for 3 months and I am going to be locked out of my account for the next month?!!!!</p>
<p>Can someone please help me..</p>

    <title>N79 display messed up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ngnok  say:</h3>
<h2>            N79 display messed up</h2>
                    
<p>So much for my little N79...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the display quit working properly. It's difficult to explain what's wrong but here it goes: the display goes blank and stays blanked out for a period of time; navigating the menu may cause the image to scroll right (what should be shown on the right
 appears on the left); colours change with no apparent reason; phone feels unresponsive but it's the display that isn't drawing anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restarted. Removed battery and restarted. Removed memory card and battery, then restarted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried doing a soft reset. Then a hard reset. Then reinstall the latest firmware (v. 11.049).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Made no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm taking it back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry for the confusion. I meant that remark as a swipe at the keypad construction. In my view, Nokia sacrificed far too much functionality (read: ease-of-use) of the keypad to design (read: "looks" ).</p>

<p>I was experiencing the exact same problem with my N79. Only that my display sometimes went upside-down in addition to the (d)effects you described :-)</p>
<p>Yesterday I took it to the service centre.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Got the phone returned last Wednesday (May 13th). It took them more than a <strong>
month</strong> to fix it...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The work sheet refers to a "mechnical repair". I reckon that confirms the issue was in the hardware.</div>

<p>Not so lucky, after all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I tried to take a couple of pictures for the first time since the phone was returned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera button does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press on button and nothing happens. No picture is taken. No focus movement. Nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sent the phone back to be repaired. I just hope this time it will take them less than the 34 days it took the first time around.</p>

            Mine was repaired in about two weeks. The whole LCD panel (with its PCB and control logic) had been replaced. Now the phone works like new. Hope the new LCD panel will last longer than the original...

            The blue dotted lines are probably table gridlines. To verify this, with the cursor on some of the surrounded text, look in the&nbsp; ribbon.&nbsp; If you see the Table Tools tab, the the cursor is in a table.
<br />
<br />
In your destination document,&nbsp; the table gridlines are probably turned off.&nbsp; To turn them on, go to Table Tools &gt; Layout tab &gt; Table group and click the View Gridlines icon.<br />

            You will find countless posts here that document that you cannot use Windows Easy Tansfer or any other automated transfer process with Outlook.&nbsp;That has never worked with Outlook and apparently never will. You must now create a new Outlook profile from
 scratch and connect it to your existing Outlook data file so you will have all your Contact data.

            Is the Trim-command still needed in Win 10; or does Win 10 optimise SSD/s automatically now? Thanks for your reply in advance.&nbsp;

<h3> paulcree  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do i NEED wifi to download&#47;update apps&#63;</h2>
                    I don't have WiFi at home. I instead opted for unlimited data on my phone (which I can also use as a personal hotspot). Moving to windows phone from Android has 1 MAJOR problem for me; I seem to NEED WiFi to download any app bigger than about 30mb data
 (pretty much any decent game). Now I love my Lumia 1020 and don't want to go back to Android, but why why why can't I download apps like I could from Google play. On one&nbsp; occasion I downloaded a 3GB game (the bards tale in HD) from Google play on my htc one
 via my unlimited 4G. Tonight (again), I've tried to download a game which I then realised was 1008MB size to be told I need WiFi, so now I have to wait until next week when I'm back at work to get it or use my personal hotspot and download the game on my nexus
 7 tablet (which would you do with 4 days off work?). So yet again I will end up getting the game from google instead of windows phone store. When will this pointless restriction be removed and enable me to have good games on

 two weeks in a row (much more useful for seeing details than the month view, or for copying tentative appointment blocks from one week to the next) or I can use the Ctrl + mouse pointer to select non-consecutive dates (i.e. this Monday and Wednesday AND next
 Monday and Wednesday) which is super-useful for scheduling instead of scrolling back and forth (and forgetting in between).
<br />
<br />
Does this function work on Mac? <br />

<h2>            Dates in Sheet not working for everyone</h2>
                    <p>I have a template with multiple date and time calculations that work for most people yet for some they don't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Invesitaging it's appears to be down to the US mm/dd/yyyy messing the calculations where they should remain in the dd/mm/yyyy formate</p>
<p>The calculations start with a data validation list which highlights the issue perfectly..</p>
<p>My list starts in </p>
<p>A2 =text(today(),"dd/mm/yyyy"... </p>
<p>theni add a day in the next cell so</p>
<p>A3 =text(sum(a2+1),""dd/mm/yyyy")</p>
<p>then a4........a150 adds a different day</p>
<p>For&nbsp;me these cells then show&nbsp;...&nbsp; 06/03/2013, 07/03/2013, 08/03/2013, 09/03/2013 ...................ect ect...
</p>
<p>yet for some it shows as................06/03/2013, 04/06/2013, 07/04/2013, 05/10/2013
</p>
<p>and no matter what i do to change the format of the cells in the recipients&nbsp;excel&nbsp;to dd/mm/yyyy they remain the same</p>

<h2>            Need Excel Formula for Date and Time Conflict Validation</h2>
                    <p>Is there a formula that will allow me to compare&nbsp;two sets of date fields/lines and flag&nbsp;if there is a conflict&nbsp;(i.e. within the same time window)?

</p>
<p>In other words if I have something running during first implementation window (first date line) and another implementation starts at same time or&nbsp;during&nbsp;that first implementation&nbsp;(second date line) I need it to&nbsp;flag as a conflict.

</p>
<p>You can do that with conditional formatting. Say the 2 columns are A &amp; B. Select B2 then drag to select as many rows as you want in Col B then:-</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Home tab | Conditional formatting | new rule | use a formula to decide which cell to format and enter this formula</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>=AND(A3&lt;&gt;"",A3&lt;B2)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Click the format button | Fill tab choose a colour and OK out. Conflicts will be highlighted in Col B.</p>

            It seems you found the&nbsp;<em>asterisk</em> that was in place of the <em>comma</em>. The * was multiplying the numbers returned by the two MATCH() functions, thereby extending the requested row outside of the&nbsp;YearsPO name range resulting in the #REF! error.
 By using a comma, one MATCH() supplies the row and the other supplies the column.

<p>You can use a User-Defined-Function to create a number that will allow sorting based on your heirarchy strings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the code below into a standard codemodule in your workbook, save the file as a macro-enabled .xlsm, and use the code like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SortVal(A2,".",5)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then copy down, and sort your entire table based on the column of formulas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Function SortVal(r As Range, strd As String, i As Integer) As Double<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim v As Variant<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim j As Integer<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; v = Split(r.Value, strd)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For j = 0 To UBound(v)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SortVal = SortVal + v(j) * (10 ^ ((i - j - 1) * 2))<br />

<p>Assuming your data to be in cells <strong>A1 to A10.</strong></p>
<p>Copy the data in cells <strong>B1 to B10</strong>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The text VS in the formula is introduced only to retain the leading zeros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above methods are only suitable for <strong>Excel</strong>, not Access. There will be many other ways of writing this formula with the type of approach I have used, as well as several other shorter solutions like User-Defined_Functions as suggested by
 Bernie Deitrick or a Macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let me know if this is what you wanted to do, and if any changes are required.</p>

            <p>Hi Marshall,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are experiencing issues using the built-in laptop keyboard. Let me try and assist you with that issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you started facing this issue recently or from the time you started using Windows 10 Technical Preview?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these methods by using the external wireless keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p><span>Run the hardware troubleshooter. Once this is done, restart the computer and check the status.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps:<br />
a)&nbsp;Press the ‘<strong>Windows + W</strong>’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and then press <strong>
enter</strong>.<br />
c) Click <strong>hardware and sound </strong>and run the <strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter</strong>.<br />
d)&nbsp;Follow the On screen instructions. Once this is done, restart the computer and check the status.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that does not help, let us uninstall the built-in keyboard driver (only built-in driver).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First, install the driver from&nbsp;<a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/product/HP-Pavilion-dv7-Entertainment-Notebook-PC-series/5082216/model/5141406/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HP website</a>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + X and </strong>choose <strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.&nbsp;Expand Keyboards, find the built-in driver and right-click on it. Choose 'Uninstall driver'.</span></span></p>
<p>c. Follow the onscreen instruction.</p>
<p>d. Restart the laptop and install the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if it helps. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>

            i tried both steps to the best of my understanding and ability. Neither of them worked. I have temporarily solved the issue by turning on sticky keys. i looked for a keyboard driver on hps website but was unsuccessful.<br />

            <p>Hi Marshall,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologize for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you still facing the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would not find Windows 10 drivers for this model as Windows 10 is still in its developing stage.
</p>
<p><br />
You can try installing the keyboard driver in compatibility mode and check if that helps:</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Locate the&nbsp;<strong><span>executable</span></strong>&nbsp;file (.exe file) for the driver installation program.<br />
b. Right-click the file, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>.<br />
c. In the&nbsp;<strong><span>Package Name</span></strong>&nbsp;<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Compatibility</span></strong>&nbsp;tab.<br />
d. Click to select the&nbsp;<strong><span>Run this program in compatibility mode for</span></strong>&nbsp;check box, click&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows 8/8.1&nbsp;</span></strong>with which it is compatible with in the Run this program in compatibility mode for list, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.<br />
e.&nbsp;<span>Double-click</span>&nbsp;the executable file to start the installation program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Restart the laptop and check the issue.</span></p>

            <p>You need to rssociate the .pub extension with the new version of Publisher.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To change file associations in Windows vista or windows 7:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default</a></span></p>
<p><span>Though these&nbsp;directions are for XP I think they are&nbsp;a bit more clear:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307859</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In brief <span>right click&nbsp;a .pub file &gt; Open with and this will bring you to the Open With dialog. If Publisher 2013 is not listed as 'recommended' or 'other' programs then you need to click the browse button and drill down to
 where the mspub.exe file is located on your computer. It will vary with your installation but you can look:</span></p>
<p><span>C:/program files (x86)/microsoftoffice/office15/mspub.exe</span></p>
<p><span>or</span></p>
<p><span>C:/Program Files/Microsoft Office 2013/Office15/mspub.exe</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to check the option to always use that particular version of Publisher to open .pub files.</p>
