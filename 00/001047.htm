<h2>            Can&#39;t edit comments in Word Online&#63;</h2>
                    I can't seem to edit or delete comments. Is there a way to do so from Word Online? I have to use a Chromebook for work and I need to be able to edit and delete comments.

            Hello A.,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately you cannot edit comments in Word Online. You can find the basic tasks available in Word Online in the link below :

<p>It appears that comments can be created in Word Online but not necessarily edited in that version.

<h2>            Potential Phishing Email&#63;</h2>

</p><p>I automatically assumed it was a phishing email and didn't click on the link. I went to the Microsoft website to double check (as I have a Hotmail email too). When I signed in, it didn't recognize my computer (as I logged in from my work computer) and said
 that I would need to a seucirty code to verify. So, it sent one to my Gmail. I received two messages: one providng the security code, the other&nbsp;looks very similar to&nbsp;the one I initially thought was a phishing email. Can someone please tell me, has my account
 been compromised? Here's what the second email looks like. The sender also had the same exact email address.

            <p>Hey there, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0b18a420-42f0-4e52-b11a-8bbc7d3b05c1" title="P_239">
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft community forums</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am mainly thinking you have two step verification enabled on your account. Which is why you got a security challenge on your account. To check this, you can go to:
<a href="https://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a> and sign into your account. Then click onto security and password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do believe someone else is accessing your account, I would change your password and then update your security information, if needed. You can also check your recent activity through account.live .com as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think this is an email to try and access personal information, then please leave it. You have done the right thing by coming onto these forums, I would also try and see if someone from Microsoft can verify if this email is legit to you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope everything I provided was usefull to you</p>
<p>Regards, </p>

Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft Community.<br />

Please answer these questions:<br />
<br />
1.Have you tried to use another SIM card?<br />
2.Did you check if other phone will pick up a good signal using the same SIM card?<br />

<p>Possible after a system update, the device report that have low signal from network when initiate a call, even if it have two or three bars on the SIM signal strength indicador, aborting the call operation. Every time it back to normal (complete the call
 operation with the same signal strength) with a system reboot (turn off and turn on cycle), but the issue turn back few hours later, day after day...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I solved the problem applying "restore to default" (factory reset) on the device; only the device, not wiped out my SD Card (i choosed "no" when asked to wipe the memory card). So, on the new system "first use", i signed in with my account, but not choosed
 to restore the old backup (to not install old 8.1 system apps that i had even on the 10), so i started as a "new phone" (you not lost your contacts, but only personal system settings and apps -- few minutes and you do it manually again). I also choosed to
 install apps on the internal device memory (only apps and maps), when asked to choose where you like to save my things on the first use setup.</p>
<p>Later, on my Microsoft Store library, installed only the W10 compatible apps, and not installed any system app&nbsp; (beta or not) that i had on my library (purchased apps); i hided every old systems apps on my library to not install again accidentally (it's
 not possible to exclude from library).</p>

<h2>            Unable to Download Most of the apps after updating to Windows 10 on Lumia 730</h2>
                    <p>Need Help,</p>
<p>After updating my Lumia 730 to Windows 10 i am unable to download most of the apps from the store. Firstly after updating, the phone displays SD Card Error, after going through several methods to fix this problem my SDXC card gets corrupted. I replaced it
 with a new one but still after doing soft reset it says me same to fix SD Card Error. Now after spending more than a week on fixing this error and not finding any permanent solution I Hard Reseted my phone, instead of getting permanent solution to all these
 problems now my phone is displaying error code 0*80070003 while downloading Whatsapp Messenger. Most of the default apps are also in pending status tried signing out store and again signing in still unable to fix. Coratana is also down everytime i try to ask
 it about something it shows me Something went wrong. Please let me know is there any permanent solution for all these problems or should i have to use the phone without considering any issues.</p>

<p>There is no Format tab per se.&nbsp; You have formatting options on the Home tab.&nbsp; And you have a Font dialog box by clicking the quick launch button in the bottom right corner of the Font group on the Home tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Paragraph dialog box can be opened by clicking the quick launch button in the bottom right corner of the Paragraph group on the Home tab.</p>
<p>There are various other formatting locations depending on what you want to format, for example if you are working with a table you have the formatting options on the Home tab and those found under Table Tools, Design and Table Tools, Layout (these are only
 visible if you are in the table).&nbsp; There are quick launch buttons on some of these tabs.</p>
<p>You can also customize the QAT to allow quick access to frequently used formatting commands.</p>

    <title>How can I insert tab after right indentation. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeshan ali  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I insert tab after right indentation.</h2>
                    <p>Recently, i shifted to Word 2013 from 2007's counterpart. However, in earlier version of word, i can insert a &nbsp;tab for right alignment beyond the right indentation.</p>
<p>I found that this facility in not available in word 2013. Is there any way to do that?</p>
<p>For more illustration, I have also added a snapshot from &nbsp;word 2007.</p>

            <p>You cannot set such a tab on the ruler in Word 2013 (it doesn't allow you to place or drag a tab to the right of the right indent), but you can still set it in the Paragraph &gt; Tabs&nbsp;dialog:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I know that i can still set such tabs by using the Tabs dialog. However, in this scenario all text is indented along the right indentation and &nbsp;tab seems to be useless.</p>

            Make sure that your installation of Office 2013 is fully updated. There was a bug in the earlier releases that prevented you from adding tab stops within a right indent.

<h2>            Track changes in Word for Windows Mobile</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to make the 950 XL with docking station my exclusive machine for business and personal use. So far it is 100% capable, with a single exception: there doesn't seem to be any way to track changes in a Word document when using the mobile version.
 There is indeed a ribbon button for tracked changes, but when I click it, I am told that I need to install Office 365. I have a 365 subscription, but there doesn't seem to be any way to activate it on the phone. Can someone tell me if this is possible, and
 whether the tracked-changes function will ultimately work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Windows 10 Enterprise edition is almost always activated by an organization.&nbsp; Was yours activated in this way?&nbsp; Are you certain that your license is for Enterprise Edition?&nbsp; Your error message appears to suggest that your organization needs to activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder what Product Key is in use for it.&nbsp; There is a free utility from Nirsoft called ProduKey which can reveal the Product Key that is in use.&nbsp; If that has recently changed, usually it will also show the previous key still associated with Internet Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html</a></p>

<h2>            microsoft 10 upgrade</h2>
                    Well I wasn't so excited about the upgrade fear of things not working. &nbsp;I did finally installed windows 10, and I loved the layout, how everything transferred from windows 7. &nbsp;I loved loved it, until 8/5/15 my internet stopped working. My husband a programmer
 started with the simple things, rebooting the modem/wifi, rebooted the computer, ran a test, thought it was the ethernet card and he also bought a new ethernet cord. &nbsp;He installed the card and cord, still my internet didn't work, BTW I had to use the upstairs
 computer which was an inconvenience, until he could install the card and cord. &nbsp;Finally he just gave up and reinstalled windows 7, the updated took hours and hours, but I got my internet back on my computer, that I love. &nbsp;I'm scared to reinstall windows 10
 but know that I do love it, I just want the internet to work. &nbsp;What could be the solution to this problem of the internet not working on windows 10?

            This appears to be a driver issue. You may want to check with your card manufacturer to see if they have a win10 driver and download it to a usb, Then reinstall win10 and run the lan setup from the usb.

            <p>there are afew people who are having the same problem and it seems a lot to do with Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller from what I ve read but its the driver that's causing the problem .....look through your updates once windows 10 is installed you might
 find your problems start once the driver has been updated ...but it could be another driver
</p>
<p>I ve had no problems so far so it might depend on model and make </p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't understand how this could be the case for a couple reasons. &nbsp;First, Windows 10 worked fine for a good few days before failing right after downloading an update. &nbsp;Second, I already considered this and went out and bought a brand new nic card to test
 this possibility and got the same exact behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behavior on both nic cards is as follows. &nbsp;The PC confirmed that it was connected to a network even when the internet was not available. &nbsp;The internet connection bounced in and out continuously on both nic cards.</p>

            <p>you say it happen after an update if you go to update look through them you might find the one for your card try and unstall it
</p>
<p>if the systems been updated you could connect 10 cards still be the same outcome as windows has been updated not the card the fault is within the window drivers that have been updated as you stated it worked fine before it got updated

<h2>            Logging Attendees</h2>
                    <p>My company uses Skype for Business for both internal and external communication. I send email invites through Outlook and external people often forward or otherwise share the conference invitation. I would like to record who attended each meeting automatically.
 If they dial in then there is a phone number or there will be an email or skype address or perhaps more than one as people connect via skype and and dial-in for audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However to the best of my ability I would like to start with a report from skype on all the connections.&nbsp; Is this possible?</p>

<p>Thanks for posting in our forum. For your problem, if you’re using OneNote, I suggest you try adding the meeting notes when creating a Skype for business meeting request in Outlook.</p>

<p>Hi Huni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you following up. I think we are talking about two different things. I would like an automatic report generated by Skype that show the meeting and who attended, capturing phone numbers if they dialed in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I take Skype for Business meetings on my phone regularly and may be presenting when on my computer I have no time or ability to manually record anything. In addition if I see someone logging in via phone 213.555.1212 I am not sure who it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply want a log file of who was on and when. I can get this easily and automatically from Webex,&nbsp; Here are the reports available in webex. I want the "Session Detail".</p>
<p>

<h2>            Make the N95 8GB screen look like a WM phone. Possible&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all!<br />
<br />
Just curious (and not trying to start a WM vs. Symbian flame-war) whether it is possible to make the screen of the N95 8GB look like, for example, the HTC Touch Cruise:
<a href="http://www.letsgomobile.org/images/news/htc/htc-touch-cruise.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.letsgomobile.org/images/news/htc/htc-touch-cruise.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Is it possible to make changes like this to the layout of the N95 8GB screen?

            what are you particularly after ? The weather ? or something else ? Because in the pictyure there is the active idle like you would have in a Nokia phone also, so that is pretty similar. It is easier to suggest something if you be very specific what you
 want there to be ?

Well, there is a HTC Touch-like design on <a href="http://gdesk.wetpaint.com/page/GDesk+designs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

I'll give it a try. It looks quite promising. Thanks! :)<br />

<h2>            Word for Mac opens new documents in half size</h2>
                    I updated my MacBook Air a few days ago and ever since then, when I open a new Word document, it is half the normal size. I can drag and resize it, but it's a pain to keep doing this. I've tried saving a regular size document and shutting down word and
 re-opening, no luck, tried saving the right-sized document as a template, and tried deleting Microsoft Word 2011. Nothing works! Any way to fix this annoying bug?

            Hi Lynn, <br />
<br />
This is currently a known issue for Microsoft Word for MacOS. Please refer to the following post in relation to this issue:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/word-for-mac-1625-cannot-remember-window-size/ddc088b7-9a06-42d2-95bf-f8e521d5a156">
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/fo...</a><br />
<br />
It is currently being worked on by Microsoft, with a resolution expected in the near future.

<h2>            Word 2007 doesn&#39;t create hyperlink when Enter is pressed</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I recently installed Office 2007 on a new PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;Word 2007 is&nbsp;missing a behavior I relied on a lot with Word 2007 on my&nbsp;previous computer.&nbsp; On the old PC when I type a valid URL or email address and hit Enter the URL or email address would immediately
 become a hyperlink.&nbsp; It doesn't do that in the new installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to create a hyperlink using the context menu or the Insert menu but I prefer to have the old behavior restored.&nbsp; I must have inadvertently changed an option but cannot find it now.&nbsp; Any help will be appreciated a lot!</p>

    <title>Objects Only Move in One Direction with Arrow Keys - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Objects Only Move in One Direction with Arrow Keys</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am using Visio Pro 2013 on a Windows 7 x64 platform.</p>
<p>Editing an office layout drawing imported from AutoCAD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the most part, everything is going well.</p>
<p>I'm not a very experienced Visio user, but so far the application seems pretty intuitive.</p>
<p>Except for one thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to nudge shapes (or groups of shapes) using arrow keys, they will only move in one direction!</p>
<p>If I try to nudge in opposite direction, Visio just beeps at me.</p>
<p>However I can drag the object with the mouse...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example,&nbsp;nudging an object to the left will work, but it refuses to nudge right.</p>
<p>It just goes ding! with every press of the right arrow key.</p>
<p>Same situation with up/down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest why this happens? This is driving me crazy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can use SHIFT+ARROW KEY to nudge shapes&nbsp; in four direction. This may be due to the SCROLL LOCK key is enabled.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>
<p>I've done&nbsp;some basic&nbsp;research before posting.</p>
<p>It's not the Scroll Lock setting that is pretty well documented.</p>
<p>Also, I understand that Shift+Arrow nudges one pixel at a time, as opposed to one gradation mark without Shift.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in this case, the program is just beeping at me and not moving at all - except in one direction.</p>
<p>Infuriating. Illogical.</p>

            <p>Hello Sir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose this may be due to the keyboard conflict. Some third-party program/add-ins impact Visio. Please try to preform the cleanboot to check if this issue still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
