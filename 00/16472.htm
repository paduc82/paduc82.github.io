    <title>Subscribed Public Folders Disappear in Outlook for Mac 16.14.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> npeg74  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subscribed Public Folders Disappear in Outlook for Mac 16.14.1</h2>
                    <p>This has apparently been an issue for mac users since 2015 and possibly before.&nbsp; In Outlook 16.14.1 calendar, the subscription to 'Subscribed Public Folders' will drop intermittently.&nbsp; This has caused me to miss events and deadlines.&nbsp; Also of note is the
 fact that when subscribing to a 'Subscribed Public Folder', it takes a solid 15 minutes before all the calendar events display.&nbsp; I can't imagine why, in this day and age, it would take that long, especially without any user feedback indicating that the events
 are loading. This leads the user to believe that the connection/subscription is not working... very bad user experience.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a hunch that the issue is related to Exchange settings and that I would have something to communicate to our IT dept. if outlook programmers would have built some basic error handling into the program's public folder subscription process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find the Microsoft products for mac are generally stripped-down, bug-prone versions of their PC counterparts and I generally try to avoid them but Outlook is the exception as our company is committed to exchange.&nbsp; It's disappointing that MS lets the problem
 persist for this long and, in my mind, indicates their willingness to take money for products but not to invest in refining them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be great to hear if anyone has been able to find a solution to this problem...it's been over 4 years.</p>
<p>

            As Rich indicated, there is no such feature in Word. Realistically, it's best to properly prepare images
<i>before</i> inserting them into a document rather than expecting a word processing program to enable such processes.<br />
<br />
IMO, you'd be far better off to use a decent graphics app to save new versions of the images scaled to the required dimensions. Once the images are prepared, replace those in the document with their appropriate counterparts. Depending on how many images are
 involved it may be a fair amount of work, but it will be far simpler &amp; more effective than trying to force it in a program not intended for the purpose.<br />
<br />
If you <i>must</i> do it in Word you can select more than one floating image at a time by shift-clicking each image. Then go to
<b>Format&gt; Object - Size</b> to make the change. This won't work if an image is <i>
In Line</i>, though -- You cannot select multiple In Line objects or select an In Line object &amp; floating objects at the same time.<br />
<br />
Just to make certain that you're aware of it, unless the images all have the same aspect ratio to begin with, changing them to identical dimensions most likely will induce distortion to at least some of them.<br />

            You can define the print area using a dynamic named range. All you need to do is find the last row. One way to do this is to use COUNTA in an offset formula if your data is continuous without any blank cells in between.<br />
<br />
So for example, if you know that your column B will always have filled cells, till the last row (whichever that is), you can edit the Print_Area in the names manager, and instead of the static print area already assigned, you can use a dynamic formula in its
 place like so<br />
<br />
=OFFSET(Sheet2!$B$1,0,0,MAX(1,COUNTA(Sheet2!$B$1:$B$4000)),1)<br />
<br />
Here you are assuming that your data doesn't go beyond 4000 rows. At the same time, you are counting the values in range B1:B4000, so depending on how many cells are filled, the counta will feed the correct number in to the row height parameter of the offset
 function, thus making your print area dynamic. Make sure you keep formula calculation to automatic.<br />
<br />
For non contiguous ranges also you can find the last filled row. Post back if that's what you need.<br />

            <p>I have data in rows 1 to 5.</p>
<p>I have used conditional&nbsp;formatting on&nbsp;100 rows with the&nbsp;formula =MOD(ROW()),2)=1 to make each odd row green.</p>
<p>When I look in Print Preview only 5 rows show, so this solves your problem.</p>

            <p>Hi, I used this exact formula however I had 750 rows formatted with grey, however upon print preview it shows as many as 5000 pages to be printed where only 4 pages have actual data in cells.&nbsp; I feel like I must be missing something but I am clueless. Thank
 You for your help.</p>

            <p>I confirm the above. The 9860 seems to have broken something.</p>
<p>My games seem to have started crushing after the update but I managed to run some of them using the Windows 8 compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Memory Diagnostic Tool with no negative checks as well as repaired the game archive to narrow down possible causes. Problem still persists hence something in the update must have went wrong.</p>

            <p>From what I have seen on the Pinball FX page at the store and the XBox support community the problem with FX is with FX itself not using it on 8960.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile Minesweeper and Treasure Hunt remain un accessible and as other Xbox signin games work the Xbox account is not the reason</p>

    <title>C5-03 Issues.. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smshaaban  say:</h3>
<h2>            C5-03 Issues..</h2>
                    
<p>Ok. First, I have to admit that I been in love with my C5-03 since the first time I saw it. But unfortunately, the phone gave me real hard time.</p>
<p>1- I can't change the message memory to memory card. It works for a while, and then an error message pops out, statimg that "memory card not found" and that the phone will revery the message memory to phone memory.</p>
<p>2- The phone memory is almost full. I have 11.4 MB left, and I don't know what's filling the memory. I have 3 apps installed, 1 MB each, besides the default apps. Browsing the memory was of no help: almost all folders are empty. I tried emptying the browser's
 cache, but 11.4 MB is all I could have.</p>
<p>3- Nokia store and the web browser give me the "memory full" message after a couple of minutes of browsing, and then they close automatically, making them almost useless.</p>
<p>4- The battery life is not impressive. I have to charge the phone every 1-2 days even with light usage (15 min of calls, no Wi-Fi or music playing).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the phone and I've been having it for 6 months now. Can anyone help me solving any of these annoying issues?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NB. I have installed the latest firmware 2 months ago (v.20.0.024, version date 25-05-2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance..</p>

            I had these memory issues also and found that deleting apps made lttle apparent difference. Running "Clean-up" in Nokia suite achieved nothing either, because it found nothing to delete.<br />
Finally I stumbled upon a solution of sorts:<br />
1. Delete al unnecessary CONTACTS. (I had several hundred imported from my N900)<br />
2. Delete all old SMS messages Up to today<br />
3. If you use CHAT, set it NOT to save conversations.<br />
It's a workaround rather than a solution, but it prevents that error message appearing and the app your using crashing inconveniently.<br />
Good Luck.

<h2>            Outlook 2011 for Mac - On My Computer folders missing</h2>
                    A few days ago, I accidentally deleted the "Microsoft User Data" from my MacBook without realizing it. When I opened my Outlook 2011 I noticed that everything I had in there was gone. My account, and most importantly the emails I had stored in files that
 were on my computer. Using Time Machine I went back to the last day I remember having the folders, which was only a few days and restored that file. Once it was back in the folder, I opened outlook again and still nothing. I had to go in and add my iCloud
 email back in and have rebuilt the database and still my folders are missing. Can anyone help to fix this? I want to avoid having to do a full restore to that day on my computer.&nbsp;

<h2>            How can i made &#123; Drop Down List &#125; search not by the full name but by some letters only of the name&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a list contains a lot of names, when I search by the drop down list for this name to write it in the same cell have the drop down list, I must search in all the list for it which take a lot of time an effort.</p>
<p>I need in the drop down list to easy for me the search to be by a few letters I write in it.</p>
<p>example: </p>
<p>What I have</p>
<p>In column D started from cell D6 I have in it list contains&nbsp;many names approximately 1000 names . And I have column F from cell F6 I have in it the drop down list search when I open its arrow box in all the 1000 names and I go searching for one name (each
 time in each cell contains the drop down list) in all the 1000 names to find it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I need</p>
<p>In column F from cell F6&nbsp;I need the drop down list to search by a few letters of the name [ as example in stead of opening the drop down list to search in the 1000 names I write one, or two, or three letters so when I open the drop down list in each cell
 in this column F open for me the names contains only the one, or two, or three letters I wrote I can search in a little numbers of names&nbsp; not the whole list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I found a blog article about how someone solved this problem. The user reset the phone to factory settings and that somehow fixed the glitch. So, I tried it. It wiped out all of my programs and text files, but the phone will at least function properly once
 again. In case anyone reading this needs to reset their phone, these are the instructions I followed for the Nokia 521

<p>So basically, Skype HAS NO FIX for my problem (I'm not able to receive calls to my Skype number from those not in my Contacts). Unbelievable. After 7 years with this Skype number I'm going to have to cancel it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note that this is across all of my devices: MacBook Pro, iPhone, and iPad. I have downloaded the recommended software version and confirmed that my call settings are set to receive calls from Everyone.)</p>

            For whatever reason, undoubtedly money, Microsoft has decided not to allow the use of Word starter 2010 in Windows 8.&nbsp; A big turn-off for mes.&nbsp; One would have thought that with such a tumultuous history Microsoft would try to suit the needs of as many

            <p>I recommend doing a fresh install rather than the upgrade, so you can multi boot between Win7 &amp; Win8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the "SetupConsumerC2ROLW" application as an administrator in isolation from the other installation files, but connected to the internet of course.</p>
<p>Microsoft have now fixed all the downloading files so that it runs in Win8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively run from the "USB stick To Go"&nbsp;as MS have fixed that as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Classic Shell 3.6.2 is recommended for Windows 8 to put the old Start button on the desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am delighted with Win8pro, and do make sure you download the Media Centre while it is free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do a full backup using the Windows 7 File Recovery option in Win8 control panel.</p>

 all 2007 and 2010 users.&nbsp; My way didn't work because it was still cached somewhere.&nbsp; This was the permanent fix.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Charles, I found the fix in a google search that pointed me to your website, LOL.&nbsp; So thank you very much.&nbsp; It said to do this the registry tweak below. This has completed fixed out issue: &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Word 2007-2010</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This is a registry tweak. If you don't already know how to do edit the registry with regedit don't attempt this.
<strong>Backup</strong> your registry before making any modifications.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select individual keys and rename them to remove individual templates, or rename the top level key (8F622... etc) to remove them all, including the tabs. Add the word "NOT" to
