<h2>            Qualcomm&#47;Killer 1525 BT adapter suddenly not recognized by Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My bluetooth was working fine<em> just yesterday</em>. I was playing music through bluetooth speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put my laptop to sleep overnight, woke it up this afternoon, was NOT notified of any Windows update or anything else unusual that might have happened.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>LCD readout on speakers claim to connect to my laptop, but no sound came out. I tested the speakers with my phone, and the speakers worked just fine, so I decided to toggle the bluetooth on my laptop. (Note: I do not have a physical toggle for bluetooth.
 I used the icon in the settings menu.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to toggle the bluetooth off, but then the toggle grayed out and I was unable to turn it back on. Closed and reopened settings...same issue. Bluetooth toggle grayed out and couldn't be clicked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted my computer, only to discover that bluetooth was completely GONE from the settings menu. Even searching for bluetooth in the search bar reveals nothing at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled the problem and tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>tried to have another bluetooth device search for my computer (my phone, in this case) - no effect.</li><li>stop and restart bluetooth services - no effect.&nbsp;</li><li>make sure bluetooth services were set to start automatically - they already were.&nbsp;</li><li>uninstall and reinstall the driver - actually made things <em>worse</em></li></ul>
<p>Now my bluetooth adapter doesn't even show up in the device manager, even after clicking "show hidden devices." I got no error messages when installing the driver. In fact, it supposedly installed successfully and prompted me to restart, which I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried clicking "scan for hardware changes," no effect. I tried hardware troubleshooting, and all it changed was a setting to automatically scan for driver updates. No effect on bluetooth. I tried re-downloading and reinstalling the driver from MSI and
 from Killer Networking. Nothing. Tried installing the driver with Windows 8 compatibility (which was recommended for another user with BT problems). Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bluetooth adapter remains completely missing from the device manager, and bluetooth settings are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>While I appreciate that you took the time to respond, my original post addresses both of the things you mentioned. I included all that detail in hopes that people would not suggest things I've already tried. If some part of my post is unclear, please let
 me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: after the Killer adapter disappeared from my device manager, I installed the newly downloaded drivers by double-clicking on the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps anyone, here is what the bluetooth section of my device manager looks like. Please note that the USB BT dongle is NOT the adapter I am talking about. I bought the dongle yesterday after my internal adapter stopped working. My internal BT adapter
 (Qualcomm/Killer) is GONE from the device manager list completely. I need to know how to get it back.</p>

<p>Windows version is:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">OS Build 14393.1066</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like there <em>was </em>an update on 4/22! Usually, I get a pop-up notification that updates were installed. I don't remember getting one this time, so I didn't even realize. Maybe that messed something up?</p>

            I have this exact same issue onlu with the 1535 in msi gaming carbon board. Just vanished, cant detect the bluetooth device at all, bluetooth is now hidden from device manager entirely with no device listed, wireless works fine, tried uninstalling and
 re-installing drivers with no joy. No real updates since last time working

</p><p>In this case, <span>try to use system restore point. This option will take your PC back to an earlier point in time. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you create a restore point manually. Restoring
 won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are the steps on how to restore from a system restore point:</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press and hold (or right-click) the <strong>Start </strong>button, and then select

<strong>Next</strong>.</span><br />
<span>4. Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select
<strong>Next </strong>&gt; <strong>Finish</strong>.</span><br />
<br />
<span>If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. To check, go to the Control Panel, search for Recovery, and then select Recovery &gt; Configure System Restore &gt; Configure and make sure Turn on system protection

            <p>Thank you for the help! This worked. System restore brought my bluetooth adapter back to the device manager, though it still wasn't working at that point. However, all I had to do then was scan for hardware changes, re-install the driver, and restart the
 computer one more time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the question is, what happens next time Windows tries to re-install this same update? My understanding is that you can't turn off updates in Windows 10 (other than the workaround to set my home wifi as a metered connection, which I will do for now),
 so this is just going to keep happening.</p>

    <title>File sharing problem between Windows XP Home and Windows 7 Starter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bruno gianardo  say:</h3>
<h2>            File sharing problem between Windows XP Home and Windows 7 Starter</h2>
                    Hello, I've got a file sharing problem: my desktop comupter runs Windows XP Home Edition, and my netbook runs Windows 7 Starter Edition.<br />
<br />
On WinXP I shared a folder: Win 7 is able to open the directory and list the files, but there's no way I can open any file in the XP folder, nor that I can transfer any of those files to my netbook.<br />
All I get is an "Access denied" error.<br />
<br />
The XP Workgroup is the same as the 7 Home Network, and the users have all Administrator privileges on both PCs.<br />
<br />
Can you help me sort out what is going on, please?<br />

            To begin with, you have XP Home which means that "Simple File Sharing" is enforced on that machine.&nbsp; Further, that means that any network connection to your XP Home machine from any other machine is forced to authenticate as "Guest" user, no matter what
 privilege that the actual user may have.&nbsp; Going from here, it would appear that the "Guest" user does not have privilege to the files or folders that you are sharing.&nbsp; To fix this, you need to change the access permissions to these files.<br />
<br />
If you drag (move) files from elsewhere on your computer into your share folder, the original permissions on the file will be maintained.&nbsp; Rather, I would suggest that you copy the file into the share folder by dragging with the right mouse button and select
 "Copy" instead of "Move".&nbsp; A copied file will end up with permissions matching the destination folder which usually will be more suitable for sharing.<br />
<br />
For files and folders that are already in this shared folder, to change permissions you will need to access the "Security" tab under the properties screen.&nbsp; In XP Home, this is only possible if you log in as an administrator in "Safe Mode".&nbsp; So start up your
 computer in Safe Mode (repeatedly tap the F8 key while booting), log in as an administrator user, navigate to the file or folder with access problems, right-click on it, select "Properties", select the "Security" tab, and set the security such that "Everyone"
 (or at least&nbsp; "Guest") has the access privilege that you desire.<br />

<p>Hello Christine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider the following steps to troubleshoot the Skype application:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure Skype is no longer open. Quit Skype, then in the menu bar click
<strong><span>Go</span></strong> &gt; <strong><span>Go to folder</span></strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type <strong><span>~/Library/Application Support/Skype/</span></strong> into the box and click
<strong><span>Go</span></strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drag the file called <strong><span>shared.xml</span></strong> to the trash.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the folder that has&nbsp;</span><span>your Skype Name, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
and locate <strong><span>config.xml</span></strong> and drag it to the trash.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">5. &nbsp;&nbsp; Click </span><strong><span>Go</span></strong><span> &gt;<strong><span>Go to folder
</span></strong>from the menu bar again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type </span><strong><span>~/Library/Application Support/
</span></strong><span>and click enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; locate the Skype folder and rename it to <span>
<strong><span>Skype_old</span></strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your Applications folder and drag your copy of Skype to the trash.</span></p>

    <title>WLAN Autoconfig service causing wireless ping spikes every 5-6 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shan jin yeo  say:</h3>
<h2>            WLAN Autoconfig service causing wireless ping spikes every 5-6 seconds. Any solution other than to disable it with command prompt&#63;</h2>
                    Hey all,<br />
<br />
My computer's WLAN autoconfig service has been causing my wireless connection to have ping spikes every 5-6 seconds interval.<br />
This is causing me a lot of inconvenience and I'm wondering is it a Windows 10 update that caused this problem.<br />
I know of the cmd line to disable and re-enabling it but is there any permanent solution to this?<br />
<br />
I'm able to provide any other information if required.<br />
Will be happy if anyone knows of any solution to this issue!<br />

<p>Hi Shan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's possible that there are drivers that are no longer compatible with your PC now that it has been updated.&nbsp; While it's likely you already have the most recent drivers, it's recommended that you verify if there are missing or outdated drivers that may
 cause incompatibility.&nbsp; Let's start by checking if your drivers are updated.&nbsp; Check out this support
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>for steps to update drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, try changing the<strong> Wireless Network Adapter</strong> settings.&nbsp; Below are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on the wireless icon located on the lower right of the taskbar.</li><li>Choose <strong>Open Network and Sharing Center</strong>.</li><li>Select<strong> Change adapter settings</strong> on the left side.</li><li>Right click your wireless connection that's having an issue and click <strong>
Properties</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Configure</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Advanced tab</strong> and change the following values:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>802.11n channel width for 2.4GHz connections to 20MHz only.</li><li>Preferred Band to 2.4GHz.</li><li>Roaming Aggressiveness to 1.</li><li>Wireless mode to 802.11b/g.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. <strong>Save </strong>the settings.</p>

            Hi there!<br /><br />Many users have reported having difficulties with the new version. Maybe this could be solved soon. In the meantime, I suggest you try installing Classic Skype <a href="https://download.skype.com/5d7ac191986ccb485223c4e4e9e3e4ce/SkypeSetupFull.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://download.skype.com/5d7ac191986ccb485223...</a><br /><br />Please make sure you uninstall the current version first

<h2>            I can&#39;t turn on Bluetooth on my Windows 10 notebook.</h2>
                    Hi. I never had problems previously using Bluetooth, but last week I turned it off to undo a pairing. Since then, I can't turn Bluetooth on. On the Settings/Devices/Bluetooth &amp; other devices page, no Bluetooth option appears. The linked devices appear
 in grey and say "Bluetooth is turned off". There is no longer a Bluetooth icon in the Hidden Icons popup (that's where it used to be), and Bluetooth isn't offered in the Action Center.
<br />
<br />
I tried to update the Bluetooth driver, but get the message "The best driver for your device is already installed". The driver is listed as Intel R Wireless Bluetooth R. I've downloaded and installed an update to this driver:
 Intel® Wireless Bluetooth® for Windows® 10
<div>
<p><span>20.30.0.3.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But nothing works. Please help. </span></p>

<p>Hi Lucy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Bluetooth is not enabled, there might be a program that is conflicting with your Bluetooth device, or that the Bluetooth service is not running. We recommend that you run the Bluetooth troubleshooter and let Windows find and resolve problems with your
 Bluetooth. Here's how to run the troubleshooter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, then select <strong>Settings </strong>
&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security </strong>&gt; <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Find and fix other problems</strong>, select <strong>Bluetooth </strong>
&gt; <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the troubleshooter doesn't resolve the problem, do not hesitate to post back to us.</p>

<p>I’ve done this already. No result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my computer mainly for text-based &nbsp; work. No gaming or complex software. So software conflucts are not likely. This problem arose simply after switching &nbsp;Bluetooth off - Plus regular Windows updates, of course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi David, </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, the error message cites code 52. Same code message when I inspect the settings on the Device Manager: it says that the driver is not digitally signed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate help with this. </p>

<p>I have the exact same problem here.</p>
<p>Installing the newest version of the driver available at the Lenovo support page does not help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that helps so far is disabling the signature-check of the drivers, but thats of course not a good option for the long term.</p>
<p>Something must be wrong with the digital signature of the Intel Bluetooth Driver or with the drivercheck.</p>

<p>Hi Markus, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. I uninstalled the new Intel driver and went back to my laptop manufacturer's site, Asus, to download an older version from there (version 17.1.1532.1814, dated 2015). But that also brings up the error code 52 message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asus said: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>On the official website unfortunately I couldn't manage to found any guides,however I found you one in external website.<br />
Please follow the link below to find out how you can disable the driver signature enforcement:<br />

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><span>Helpful, no? It's not worth doing a Windows reinstall, so I grudgingly conclude I am going to have to live without Bluetooth. But I really don't get why a driver from my own laptop's manufacturer won't install properly.
</span></p>
<p><span>Can anyone else help? Intel is useless, of course.

<p>Yes, I also did see the wintips.org page before I found this page.<br />
"Solution 1" works indeed, but is no solution, since 1. it is a security problem and 2. I would need to enter my Bitlocker recovery code on every re-start :-(</p>
<p>"Solution 2" does not work for me. The Problem persists also in Test-Mode.</p>
<p>I even tried a 3rd solution by changing a policy with gpedit, but that one seems to work only for the installation of a driver without signature.</p>

<p>Dear David, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did that. I downloaded an older driver from the Asus website (my PC is a Windows 10 64-bit Asus Zenbook, quite new). I still get the same error message. As you'll see above, Asus haven't helped much other than to suggest I disable the requirement for drivers
 to be signed. </p>
<p>

            Hi Lucy,<br />
I fixed it!<br />
Sound unbelievable, but its true: Due to other problems with my PC, I wanted to reinstall windows. To do that, I needed an installation media. So startet the Media Creation Tool, which broke with an error message. Searched for a solution for it and came to
 this:&nbsp;
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/media-creation-tool-fehlercode-0x80042405-0xa001a/bc016db3-4eb0-4912-9732-89c45ef83433">https://answers.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/media-creation-tool-fehlercode-0x80042405-0xa001a/bc016db3-4eb0-4912-9732-89c45ef83433</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">--&gt; Uninstalled Bitdefender, and restarted the PC and before creating the install media tested if bluetooth is working, and IT DID !!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Also one of my other issues with my PC has gone away (had issues with some of my installers).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">You may try to uninstall your security solution and test bluetooth. If it works, please inform your security solution manufacturer about this issue such that he has the chance to fix it.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Well the other day I created a new admin account, and also another "limted" user account, everything was fine until i realised that i couldn't log back into my main admin account. I should've had:</p>
<p>-1x Original Administrator Account (with all my files)</p>
<p>-1xNew "Admin" account ( no files)</p>
<p>-1x"limited" user account (no files)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But....i only have the bottom two. AND, i lost all my files. I know other people have experienced similar problems, but i really need to know:<strong>How do i log back into the original admin account???</strong></p>

<p>At the welcome screen there are only 2 accounts, there should be 3 :S</p>
<p>Please Help!?!?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You should be able to get the 1x Original Administrator Account by restarting PC and keep tapping F8 key and go to safe mode.</p>
<p>Also you can get the files from the above by,</p>
<p>Start - double click My Computer - double click harddisk C:\ - Documents and Settings -</p>
<p>You should see a all user folder and 3 user Folders including Your 1x Original Administrator Account folder.</p>
<p>You should be able to access your files&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>If you want to copy the files to the new admin users folder. Copy the My Docs, Favorites, Desktop folders and paste them to the 2nd Admin folder.</p>
<p>Say Yes to all messages.&nbsp;</p>

Please bear in mind, that my answer is based on the details given in your post. The more I get the better the answer, Slan go foill, Paul

<h2>            &#34;other user&#34; problem</h2>
                    I am using Windows 10. &nbsp; Not realizing what I was doing at the time, I established a PIN number.&nbsp; Originally, when I rebooted, started or woke from sleep, I needed no user, pin or password to get into the computer.&nbsp; Once I established the Pin, everything
 changed and I now need either the password or pin to get in.&nbsp; Normally, I just clicked on the "ok" prompt and it entered the computer.&nbsp; I've read and been trying all the things including "never needs password" to sign in.&nbsp; Additionally, I was trying the local
 user info I read about to change with no result.&nbsp; I did the netplwiz deal as well.&nbsp; In the end, to get in, it prompts me for my pin.&nbsp; I would like to return to what I had before where I just click the ok and it opens everything up.&nbsp; I believe when I set it
 up in the past, but don't remember exactly, that I didn't enter a user or passcode in the set up which is how I was able to sign in without it.&nbsp; I want to go back to that. So

            Thanks Mike, but it didn't work either.&nbsp; I was able to remove the pin.&nbsp; When I did the password it wanted to know what my current pswd was.&nbsp; I never used a pswd to get onto the computer.&nbsp; To complete this part as you suggested, I had to use my Microsoft
 acct pswd and I left the others blank.&nbsp; Did a restart and it did not ask for pin but still asked for password. &nbsp; I followed a forum suggestion that would have me uncheck that a user name and passwd are required.&nbsp; When I did this, and I did a restart, it listed
 me as a user and then "another user".&nbsp; Both of these were never on my computer previous to the whole mess for your information.&nbsp; So I don't know what set them up on the bottom left of my desktop.&nbsp; However it still required me to use a pswd&nbsp; to gain access.&nbsp;
 So again I used the Microsoft acct password to access my computer.&nbsp; I checked control panel to see if I could delete the "other user" block and it doesn't show up so there

            sounds like you should be able to use the NetPLwiz to reach the desktop without you typing in the password on each startup.

            In NetPLwiz you would select &amp; highlight the named account you login with and want to bypass the password, uncheck he box that says users must enter a password.....
<strong>click Apply</strong> at the bottom of the window... then enter the password &amp; confirm it in the popup that appears.&nbsp;

                    <p>hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Windows Memory Diagnostic for once, and&nbsp;after the test completed it places an icon&nbsp;in my taskbar, left click or right click does nothing to it!! I tried to see if it's in my msconfig Startup but I couldn't, I find it only under Processes and when I
 end task it, it comes back when I reboot!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any hint! I guess it's a bug needs a fix. </p>

            I even can see the process in Windows Processes without the app, anyway I tried the app and I killed the task, but my problem as I mentioned when I reboot it's back like a virus.. I can't find it in msconfig startup to remove it from there.. What a bug!!

<p>
</p><p>I think it's a bug still which microsoft should fix, running Memory Diagnostic is checking the memory and it shouldn't schedule any task parmenantly and with no user control over it!!</p>

</p><p>As of now, we don't have an option for changing Cortana's Voice from its default. Off course it's a good idea if&nbsp;we have that option available with Cortana. Let's see what&nbsp;our developer's will think about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you to post your feedback using Cortana feedback. Click on the Search box on the taskbar and select Feedback. Your feedback will help us improve your experience with the future updates.</p>

<p>So did everything and its still there. Not a hardware problem everything was running and operational.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Its a Surface Book the first generation</p>
<p>2. No, it doesn't lag it works fine just not in that specific horizontal line. when i get to the deadzone it just cuts off but continues as a pass it almost like a jump. it doesn't go crazy and write all over the place it just jumps.</p>
<p>3. Am using the sketch pad that came with the surface and uploaded a better photo. top is where camera is and bot is where you latch to the keyboard.</p>

            yes it is still present in the UEFI i tried changing the date using the touch key board that pop-up and a whole row is untouchable so the issue is still their. if it is a hardware problem i don't know why. it was sitting on my desk for more than 2 weeks
 not moving when i went on vacation. But when i came back i plugged it in to the charger, since it was completely drained from not being used, and that's when the problem first stared. Am wondering if this was the cause and if anyone else had the same problem
 occur when their laptop was completely drained up to the point where the low battery logo appeared on the screen.

<div><span><span>I got the 1170000 error code last night on the Solitaire collection, I do not have a problem with my Microsoft Jigsaw. The game will not let me log into Solitaire but I do not have a problem logging into Jigsaw. I have tried the troubleshooter
 5 times and it said it fixed something, I have rebooted my Win 10 Pro machine numerous times and I still cannot log into Solitaire. My machine did upgrades earlier last night that needed a restart.&nbsp; A few hours later I tried to get into Solitaire and kept
 getting the screen to sign in.&nbsp; I am disabled and spend most of my day in front of the computer enjoy playing Solitaire as it stimulates my mind.&nbsp; I want to play, PLEASE HELP ME.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgot to mention this,&nbsp; as you know, Win 10 does NOT have an option to uninstall
 the APP so you can try installing it again.&nbsp; I think that a new install should clear up the issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just checked, my Jigsaw game has the uninstall option but the Solitaire does NOT.</span></span></div>

<p>Like yourself I have Windows 10 Pro and have been getting the 1170000 error code for the past 2 days. I have also rebooted my PC and used the troubleshooter with no success. My machine has all the windows updates, and Solitaire was working after my last
 update (on the 6th) before it no longer worked (on the 10th) so I don't think this is the cause of the problem. I can log into XBOX Live through the website with no problem. There is no mention of the service being down for this game. You CAN uninstall and
 reinstall the game by right clicking on Microsoft Solitaire in the start menu and selecting uninstall, then go to the Microsoft store to reinstall it BUT I have already done this and it unfortunately does not fix the problem :(</p>

            Hi HUMANi,
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

<p><span>I've had similar problems trying to apply 1803 to my HP Compaq NC6120.</span></p>
<p><span>After trying the .iso route and many hours spent with various MS Techs remoted into my machine, 1803 is no longer offered when I check for updates. Maybe MS have taken the model off their list of machines
 to which 1803 will be offered. At least the machine's useable again on 1709 rather than being swamped by continuous futile attempts to apply 1803. The only issue MS Tech could see was that 1709 reports an error with the Display adapters: 'Windows cannot initialise
 the device driver for this hardware. (Code 37)'. Fortunately this doesn’t prevent the display working perfectly well...</span></p>
<p><span>MS 2nd level Tech support told me I'll still get security patches for 1709 until next year, so for now, I'm happy. Maybe by then the laptop will actually have broken, or I'll have switched it to Linux!</span></p>

<h2>            DPC Watchdog violation &#40;0x133, 1&#41; with Win10 1809</h2>
                    <p>Hi -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having sporadic blue screens, with stop code 133, 1 DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION. Anecdotally this seems to have become an issue with Windows 10 1809. It only seems to occur with web browsing, most often when looking at media heavy pages - interestingly the
 system will play CPU/GPU/memory intensive games absolutely rock-solid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some system details:</p>
<p>Intel i7-6700K (8 core)</p>
<p>32 Gb RAM</p>
<p>Gigabyte Z170X Gaming 3 motherboard</p>
<p>Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1070 G1 Gaming 8G</p>
<p>Intel SSD 600p 512Gb boot</p>
<p>Western Digital WD2003FZEX 1.8Tb data drive</p>
<p>Killer E2200 ethernet (part of motherboard)</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro, x64, 1809 - Hyper-V enabled</p>
<p>Running Windows Defender, default settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have crash dump(s) available, including one with kernel circular logging enabled, happy to supply to MS. WinDbg !analyze points to nvlddmkm (see below), but as I understand it, these DPC watchdog violations are tricky to diagnose since Windows is complaining
 of a cumulative error and the DPC itself could be servicing frequent interrupts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried just about everything I can think of - updating BIOS, removing/downgrading/upgrading NVidia drivers (now back to latest), updating SSD firmware, updating network drivers, disabling HDMI audio driver to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Note dumps vary, I have one where pretty much the only DPCs in the queue are ndis, dxgkrnl and nvlddkm. The ETL trace shows dxgkrnl flatlining CPU 0 prior to the bugcheck.</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<p>I'm at the point of thinking I need to change the graphics card, but before going down those lines it'd be great to get some confirmation of whether I'm looking at genuine hardware problem or not.</p>

            Hi Damian
<br />
<br />The System crashes are caused by your Nvidia graphics card device driver . .. 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running       
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply - I've tried rolling back to 397.93 (quoted on a Geforce forum as having worked for others), using DDU to make sure all traces of previous drivers had gone and disabling auto-update of device drivers. Didn't work :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might try an Nvidia support channel, as per your advice.</p>

            If the old driver hasn't helped, try updating BIOS to F22J and see if it resolves it

<p>Quick update -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on comments here, and from an Nvidia support engineer, I've taken the card out of the PC completely and plugged my display into the motherboards adapter (so I'm now on a rubbish resolution and can't play games ... but in the name of science lets see
 what happens).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm reasonably confident its something amiss either with the graphics drivers (but if so its an edge case bug in all the recent Nvidia drivers) or with the hardware (but then why do games play fine?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For interest, and since I know my way around Windbg ... I thought I'd dump all stacks contains dxgkrnl:</p>

<p>Another update, in case anybody else out there has similar symptoms in the future. Speaking more to NVidia support, their opinion was this was a hardware problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I bought a new GPU, swapped it in, and so far the system is stable.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  LParma, if you are running the new version of Skype, that option is not available, until Microsoft resolves the bugs and lack of functionality in the new Skype, it would be best to revert to the Classic Skype
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic, which most users prefer to the new app: 
<br />

            Skype uses the desktop scaling within Windows. 
<br />
<br />
<br />	Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />	Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.
<br />
<br />Choose 125 to 150% to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />Try lowering the screen resolution and it might help.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

            The remastered version of that game inherited the same bugs and issues as the original game. If you google it up you will see a lot of gamers having this in-game issue. The developer is defunct now so there is no hope for a patch so far.&nbsp;

                    Hello. Problem with order history. Do not display purchases (games) made in the store. Before that, I did not notice such a problem. Orders made before 4 February 2019 are no order history.

<p>Just to verify, at the Order History page, can you verify the timeline you have set?&nbsp; Under "Order History" title towards the top of the page, there is a drop down selector.&nbsp; That selector is for the timeline of purchases it's pulling from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Past 3 months</li><li>Past 6 months</li><li>Past Year</li><li>All Available</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please make sure you have an appropriate filter set on the page to see the desired purchases.&nbsp; If you do, then contacting support would be the best way to go, and you can find out how to do so by clicking "Get order help"<br />
&nbsp;under any listed order on that page, and it will take you to a page with descriptions on who to contact for what particular inquiries you have.</p>

    <title>Win 10 won&#39;t boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobm123x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 won&#39;t boot</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Win 10 for about 2 weeks with no problems until today when my Dell desktop would not boot up. &nbsp;It took me past the screen where I could choose which OS to boot to (it hasn't been able to boot to win 7 since the upgrade) and finally ends
 at a black screen showing only the cursor. &nbsp;I ran start up repair and it says the. boot file is corrupt. &nbsp;How do I get a boot disk so I can repair (reload windows) or what would you suggest? &nbsp;There have been no recent changes to my system.</p>

            <p>you should have created a repair disk while you could :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can create install media with the install media creation tool (pick the correct OS for your system) then boot that media, and when the first install screen pops us, there is a choice at the bottom left to do a repair instead of an install</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid a driver update may have nailed you, there seems to be some of that going around.</p>

            Thanks for the reply mac1-131. &nbsp;Would it work if I create a win7 boot disk from one of my business computers? &nbsp;Would I then re-download and install win 10, or is there a way to repair the boot file?

            <p>your thinking is right but you really have to use the Windows 10 repair.&nbsp; I don't think the Windows 7 one would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not that hard - you can use another working machine (one of your Win 7 business PCs) to download the media creation tool, run it, and create a Windows 10 USB stick (8mb) or a DVD.&nbsp; Then boot the DVD or USB on the broken machine, and instead of running
 the full Windows 10 install, click on Repair instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It won't hurt the Win 7 machine to run the media creation tool to make the media to use on the broken one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally you would just use a repair media (USB or CDROM) but the full install media includes the repair tools also so that will work</p>
<p>
</p><p>once you get it fixed, then create a repair media for next time (hopefully never).</p>

            <p>I created a win10 media creation tool on another machine. &nbsp;On the machine I am having problems with, I booted to the USB drive with the tool, chose repair this machine, and then the reset (while saving files) option. &nbsp; It now says that the drive with windows
 is locked, to unlock it and try again. &nbsp;I don't see any wat to get to a command prompt, which is apparently needed to unlock the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I just reinstall Win 7 and a re-install Win 10 at a latter time? &nbsp;All my data is on another drive . &nbsp;My boot drive is SSD.</p>
