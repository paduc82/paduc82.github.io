<h2>            One Note Ipad App typing too slow</h2>
                    <p>I run the lates version of the app, under the latest IOS version and current/latest &nbsp;Ipad model, nevertheless I am finding typing too slow.
</p>
<p>It feels like One Note stumbles into the the next word, every single time.</p>
<p>Any clues?</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would like to gather some more information regarding this. The Latest OneNote version we have in the market is ONI 2.1.3
 (131010) which we released on Monday 10/17/2013. We had some performance issues with East Asian languages in our earlier builds. Are you seeing any degradation in those languages?
</span></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Secondly, are you typing on a page while the notebook is being synced? . In other words if you have a large notebook in
 you SkyDrive, very first time you are syncing the notebooks. The app can have a performance hit since syncing is a heavy operation. Once this completes you should be back to normal performance especially typing on a fast device.</span></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please let me know if this information was helpful. You can also get back to me directly norberth at Microsoft dot com.

            Tks Norbert. I've replied via email as well.
<div>Latest version upgraded, no other language but English, not a massive notebook.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Maybe the sync issue is valid, don't believe I have to turn on my airplane mode to work woth Onenote though... Seems like a patchy solution nevertheless shall try.</div>
<div>Any further advise?</div>

            <p>Hi Tks, </p>
<p>Somehow I haven't received the email yet. Can you double check the email address once again. This typing slowness is something we would like investigate further. Once the Notebook is completely synced down you should have a much better performance.
</p>
<p>Another suggestion would be to close the notebooks that is not currently in use. You can re open them as an when needed.
</p>
<p>cheers </p>

            Norbert, the email has not bounced, nevertheless let's continue the conversation here.
<div><br />
<div>Yesterday I have tried switching airplane mode on, and typing was smooth, perfect. It is a rather patchy solution, but before this issue is properly sorted (an app update one of these days) I shall cope with it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The fact that you cannot manage major preferences within the app &nbsp;doesn't help.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As per your suggestion, I have one notebook with some 50+ pages. My secondary notebook, shared with peers I do not sync in the Ipad, only desktop.</div>

<p><font color="#000000">A suspected syncing is a heavier operation. Hers is something that I would like you to try. Before you start using this notebook again, let’s make sure&nbsp;you have synced all your 50 +
 pages first. In order to do that, there is a manual sync trigger switch under the file menu.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Regarding the preference to switch within the app, we shall definitely have that added to our feature items for future releases.
</font></p>

            <p>Norbert, </p>
<p>manual sync trigger you refer to desktop, right?</p>
<p>The app syncs anytime, all the time. Unfortunately I am having to work with airplane mode on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>tks for your great assistance, I shall hope and wait for new improved updates. As a final note, the version before last, before Onenote app was completely revamped (layout, font sizes, etc) was lighter to run, although with less tools.</p>

            <p>I have been having this same issue with the App since the upgrade to the iOS app last fall.&nbsp; I currently use the Desktop version on my computer and Win8.1 tablet but it's the iOS app that is the problem.&nbsp; In the prior iOS editions this was never an issue.&nbsp;
 It appears that the app is constantly trying to sync with every keystroke.&nbsp; Where I mostly use the iOS app is for my grocery list.&nbsp; Just checking and unchecking the checkboxes is extremely slow.&nbsp; Typing is painfully slow.&nbsp; I have begun to seek another app
 for this purpose but none function as well as ON.&nbsp; I may have to go back to paper and pencil but I don't really want to do that.&nbsp; I just tried the Airplane Mode workaround suggested above and that helped somewhat but it was still a problem for my larger list.&nbsp;
 The smaller lists there was a definite improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp; What this forced me to figure out was that my main list has become rather large (approximately 350 lines counting blank lines).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a limit to the iOS app as far how many lines a note can handle?&nbsp; When I go to the Web App or the desktop app with this same synced list, there is no slow down.&nbsp; I am also frustrated with how long it take this app to open up in General.&nbsp; Even when
 I haven't shut the app down every time I switch back to the app it appears it has to go through a refresh rather than just pulling up the screen where I left off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help, suggestions would be appreciated as I would love to continue to use this app without having to carry my laptop to the store with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently using 2.1.5 (131123) on iOS7.06 (11B651).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>

<h2>            Opening up an older word document in microsoft word for mac 2016</h2>
                    <p>HI, I'm trying to open up some of my resumes, which says it was created using Microsoft Word 97 - 2004 for windows in the properties .</p>
<p>I've used Microsoft Word for Mac 2011 and Microsoft Word for Mac 2008 to open up this document, which I've edited using both, and never had a problem.</p>
<p>The resumes can be opened up in Microsoft Word for Mac 2016, but I've lost all the formatting done to it, such as bolding certain titles and italics.</p>
<p>I've never had this problem before. Usually the newer versions of word open up the document and don't do anything to the formatting, but this version of word will open up the document and lose that formatting which is pretty important.</p>
<p>I really don't want to have to create another resume and would prefer to open up my older resumes.</p>
<p>If anyone could help, I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>

            <p>William and John,</p>
<p>My apologies for not having replied sooner. John's solution sort of worked. </p>
<p>I have access to Word 2008 for Mac and tried his solution, saving my older .doc file into a newer format, the .docx file using Word 2008. Then I tried opening it up in Word 2016 for Mac and the same problem happened - all of the older formatting was gone.</p>
<p>Then I tried opening that same . doc file in the "Pages" program - the Mac equivalent of word.</p>
<p>The older file looked the way it was supposed to with all of the older formatting having been left intact. I had the option to save into the newer format for word. So I saved it as a .docx file.</p>
<p>I then opened up that same document where I had used "Pages" to save it under a newer format in Word 2016 for Mac - the Pages saved .docx file. I don't know how or why but it worked.</p>
<p>All the formatting came over and Mac word 2016 was able to see the document with all of the formatting from the .doc file having come over from the Pages saved .docx file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I appreciate John's help and yours as well.</p>
<p>I hope this weird solution also helps other Mac users of Word 2016 where they may have experienced the same problem as I did.</p>
<p>I'm also very disappointed in Microsoft for having destroyed their backwards capability in Word for Mac 2016. I would often do editing on work documents using Word for Mac on my home computer but I may not be able to use Word for Mac 2016 in order to do
 that in the future.</p>

    <title>Line not showing from PowerPoint Master - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayne57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Line not showing from PowerPoint Master</h2>
                    <p>I have created a new Master slide in PowerPoint with a picture placeholder covering all of the slide, and&nbsp;a title place holder and a content place holder on top of that.&nbsp; I have drawn a line below the title place holder and whilst this shows on the Master
 it won't show at all on the slide.&nbsp; I have switched the Selection &amp; Visibility Pane on and moved the line to the front of the stack and it still won't show on the slide.&nbsp; When I view the slide and use the Selection &amp; Visibility Pane to switch off the display
 of the picture placeholder the line shows.&nbsp; It is as if the Master is ignoring the stacking order and placing the line under the picture placeholder even though I have sent it to the front.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought I understood layers and stacking orders, but obviously there is something here I'm not getting.&nbsp; There are no animations on this slide.&nbsp; I would be really grateful for any help having wasted a rare sunny afternoon trying to get a line to show up
 on a slide!&nbsp; Thank you. </p>

</p><p>Why would you want to do that?&nbsp; It introduces redundancy and the risk of update anomalies.<br />
<br />
The date can be returned whenever required, either by joining the tables and returning MIN(REFDATE) from CREDHFIL, or, if an updatable recordset is required, by calling the DMin function, as described by Hans, in a computed column in a query or a computed control
 in a form.<br />

<p>HI Ken</p>
<p>Cool, so what I am trying to do ultimately is to compare the first date of purchase of an item to all subsequent purchases, not to exceed a year from the first date. This is because we only pay commission on items in the 50000 to 59999 range for one year
 from first purchase.</p>
<p>So a report showing all transactions for the product range that fall inside that one year window is what I really need.</p>

<p>
</p><blockquote>So a report showing all transactions for the product range that fall inside that one year window is what I really need.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you can do this with a simple query constructed in design view.&nbsp; You would need to restrict the query by means of a subquery which is correlated with the outer query on whatever is the product identifier, where the subquery returns purchases
 with dates BETWEEN MIN(refdate) AND DATEADD("yyyy",1, MIN(refdate)).<br />
<br />
A correlated subquery in effect runs separately for each row potentially returned by the outer query, so, by virtue of the correlation on the product identifier, the subquery would return separate sets of purchases by date for each product, thus enabling the
 outer query's result able to be restricted to rows with dates within the range on a product by product basis.<br />
<br />
This is not trivial, and I cannot provide you with an SQL statement for the query without access to the tables themselves.&nbsp; All I can do is point you in what appears to me to be the way forward on this.<br />

</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key and go to <strong>Settings &gt; Time and Language &gt; Date &amp; Time</strong>.
</p>
<p>2. Correct your Time zone, Date and time settings. Check if the issue persists.

<p>
</p><p>If the issue still occurs then try using a different browser to access Outlook.com.</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>The only way to share an MS Access database is to split the database into 2 parts: the Back-End -&gt; stores all the tables (the data) and the Front-End -&gt; stores queries, forms, reports, vba.&nbsp; You place the back-end in a central location, relink the Front-end
 to this new location and then give a copy of the Front-End to each end-user.&nbsp; They need their own copy, they should never share a copy!</p>
<p>Read the post I gave you a link to and check out the reference included in the post itself.&nbsp; Until you set this up correctly (using a split database design)&nbsp;you will be chasing after your own tail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't get this at all. If you are having people with their own database, how is each able to have the correct data and update it at the same time? Does one have to go around copying databases each hour?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new computer and copied the databases from Access 2010 (part of Office 2010 Pro Plus) on a win7 machine, and placed them on my new stand alone computer win10, with Office 2016 Pro Plus; Now I can't even open the databases; says it can't open a copied
 database. Why not? This is dumb or dumber.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, all my electronics were stolen and I had to use backups of the databases; from there I had to update as best I could on an old machine because they stole the backups too. (maybe they work for MS cloud?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I can't use this new machine for anything but letters, and accounting. Why does ms access&nbsp;make moving databases differently than Word or Excel files?</p>

            <p>You truly need to start your own thread and not continue a discussion that was answered 4 years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the setup, you place the data file, the back-end on a central server/PC and link the front-end to it and distribute a copy of the front-end to each user/PC. &nbsp;The front-end does the back and forth with the back-end which has the data. &nbsp;So there is
 only one set of data, but multiple sets of the interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving a database isn't very difficult either. &nbsp;Move the back-end to a new PC, relink the FE and use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you give us the exact error message you are receiving and number. &nbsp;Perhaps with that we might be able to better assist you.</p>

<p>You truly need to start your own thread and not continue a discussion that was answered 4 years ago.</p>

 only one set of data, but multiple sets of the interface.</p>

            The error message explains that your database uses Replication and that replication is no longer supported. &nbsp;So you need to continue to use an older version of Access to be able to continue to use your database or switch the database so it doesn't use

<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>The only way to share an MS Access database is to split the database into 2 parts: the Back-End -&gt; stores all the tables (the data) and the Front-End -&gt; stores queries, forms, reports, vba.&nbsp; You place the back-end in a central location, relink the Front-end
 to this new location and then give a copy of the Front-End to each end-user.&nbsp; They need their own copy, they should never share a copy!</p>
<p>I don't get this at all. If you are having people with their own database, how is each able to have the correct data and update it at the same time? Does one have to go around copying databases each hour?<br />
</p>
<p>I have a new computer and copied the databases from Access 2010 (part of Office 2010 Pro Plus) on a win7 machine, and placed them on my new stand alone computer win10, with Office 2016 Pro Plus; Now I can't even open the databases; says it can't open a copied
<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>First Access is different from Word and Excel. Each Word or Excel file is a self contained "document". So copying files is easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second your problem is because you setup replication on your database. Replication is a deprecated feature that allows you to have multiple databases that are not directly linked and have changes to them replicated when they can be linked up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a multi-user system, the data is placed in a shared location and each user has a front end that links to the shared data. So everyone is updating the same file and can see the updates made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Daniel noted, you have to remove replication from your database.</p>

<h2>            &#34;My Family&#34; settings are preventing me from downloading apps</h2>
                    I've just swapped my Iphone with a Nokia Lumia and I try to download some apps but there is this 'My Familiy' setting that is preventing me from downloading. (Apple OS doesn't have this). When I try to set it up it says that another family member has to
 set it up. None of my family members have Outlook except for me, so is there a way to disable the setting?
<div>Thanks</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">My Family</font></a> on the Windows Phone website is the way to turn on app and game downloads for a child's phone. If the child has a Windows Phone 8, you'll also be
 able to manage their app and game download settings, including game ratings, on the My Family page.
</p>
<p>To set up My Family, you'll need to sign in with both the child's and the parent's
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/start/what-is-a-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Microsoft account</font></a> email address and password. Then you can accept the Windows Phone Store Terms of Use so the child can download apps.
</p>
<p>If you want the child to be able to download Xbox games as well, you'll need to go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=189140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Xbox website</font></a> and accept the Xbox Terms of Use on their behalf. This is separate from the Windows Phone Store Terms of Use.

<font color="#0072c6">My Family FAQ</font></a> for answers to some common setup questions.
</p>
<div>Note
<div>
<p>My Family is only available for Windows Phone 8. </p>
<div>To set up My Family so a child can download apps and games
<ol>
<li>
<p>On your computer, go to <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">My Family</font></a> on the Windows Phone website. </p>

<p>Sign in using the parent's <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/start/what-is-a-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Microsoft account</font></a> email address and password. If the parent doesn't have a Windows Phone, that's fine—you can still set up My Family. If the parent doesn't have a Microsoft account, you'll have a chance to create one.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the My Family setup page, click <span>Get started</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>To add the child to My Family, click <span>Go</span>. On the sign-in page, enter the child's Microsoft account email address and password. If the child doesn't have a Microsoft account, click

</li><li>
<p>To enable the child to download Xbox games as well, go to Xbox.com, sign in with the child's account, and follow the instructions to accept the Xbox Terms of Use.</p>
</li></ol>
<div>Tip
<div>
<p>You can also add another parent to My Family so both parents can jointly manage kids' settings. Go to the My Family home page and click
<span>Add a parent</span>. Parents won't be able to change each other's settings.
</p>
<div>To change app download settings for a child
<p>You can set whether or not a child can download apps and games from the Windows Phone Store and which game ratings you want the child to be able to view and download.

<span>Allow free and paid</span>.</li><li>To allow the child to download only free apps and games, under <span>App+game downloads</span>, select
<span>Allow free only</span>. This will also prevent the child from making in-app purchases, even from within free apps.</li><li>To prevent the child from downloading any apps or games, under <span>App+game downloads</span>, select
<span>Don't allow</span>.</li><li>To set the most mature game rating you want the child to be able to browse or download, turn on the

<span>Change rating</span>. </li><li>To allow the child to browse and download unrated games, select the check box next to
<span>Allow unrated games</span>. (Some unrated games might have content you'd rather the child not see.)</li></ul>

            <p>OK, so at Microsoft, a child account is defined as any Microsoft account that’s affiliated with an adult Microsoft account when the age of the child or teen is less than the age of majority for his or her country. When this is the case, the child must be
 linked to an adult’s Microsoft account in order to participate in the Xbox Live service.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do not know what country you are from but that might be the case.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So if 18 is definitely the adult age of where you are located, then I would look to verify that the dob that is entered is absolutely correct on the Microsoft account AND on Xbox.com. Possibly one or the other has a error in the dob.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It may be that you have to promote the old child account to an adult account. I have never had to do that so my experience (and advise) is very limited.<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made a Sway with the new layout but do not like it. As a web designer I am used to working left to right.&nbsp; The preview on the previous Sway was really good as opposed to this one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the previous Sway everthing just fell into place and it was easy and comfortable to use. I was really pleased with the other Sway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I believe Sway has been spoiled not improved and will not use it again. However, many other people may disagree with me and you cannot please all of the people all of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Wishes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Well said, Ann. I, too, would prefer the cards on the left. I am a new user and Microsoft's engineers have made all the tutorials (which show the cards on the left) pretty confusing. Did the programmers at Microsoft ever thinking of surveying users to
 find out whether any changes needed to be made to the program?

<p>The changes to Sway were made in reaction to user feedback and were definitely weighed against the potential confusion that could be caused.&nbsp; We strongly believe the new UI is an improvement and that once users try it out they will find things to be better
 streamlined to creating the best Sway possible.&nbsp; We also realize that the changes may not please anyone and will continue listening to any feedback you have for future updates.</p>

            The cards on the left is reflected in all the tutorials. I thought maybe I didn't have the full design permissions. If planning to keep the UI change consider updating the tutorials.

<h2>            How to delete an account requiring parent&#39;s permission</h2>
                    I recently created a family account for my wife and myself to use for bills, family stuff, etc.. Anyway, when registering the account.. I thought it would be clever to put the date on the birthday as our anniversary.. Well.. I quickly found out that now
 outlook thinks I'm a minor and wants me to verify my child's permission to have the email with a credit card..
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to just delete the account and re-create it once I do with a different birthdate? &nbsp;I really don't want to use a credit card to simply verify I'm an adult.. I realize this was my own fault.. Every time I login under the "child" account..
 I can't do anything but have a parent verify I can use it... No settings to delete account or anything like that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated.</div>

                    <p>Heya, first time user of word on an iPad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wanting to apply for a new job. Found an old cover letter attachment in my emails that I was going to alter instead of writing a whole new cover letter from scratch..this was initially a word doc created on my laptop, and I opened this in word on my
 iPad. Made the desired amendments and needed to save it...not being familiar with the auto save function, I opted to save it to my iPad. I have no idea where these documents end up when u choose that option but I figured I'd find it on my iPad somewhere lol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Came back to word today and I couldn't find the document in "open" (although I did find my CV which I was working on at the same time as the cover letter). I went to my home page to try a search, and the cover letter did come up but when I try open it, it
 says "can't open file"....does anyone know why this would be and if/how I can open it ever again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hello Shayna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your earnest effort to reach out with Microsoft Community. We understand that you were unable to open Word file that you created from your iPad device. Word for iPad automatically saves your work every time you make even a small change. In
 most cases, you don’t have to do anything at all to save your document. To get you sorted, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>

            &nbsp;Hi Vanessa, thanks for your reply. I'm unsure what version of windows the laptop was running sorry. I went to file, then save a copy and then clicked the "iPad" option...but I have no idea where on the iPad that saved to. And when I open word, it shows
 the cv document that I was also working on, as well as some very old docs that must be saved to one drive, but no sign of the cover letter doc that I'm needing. I don't think I saved it to any cloud<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5294546d-0d41-49ce-be91-1b7fe7e79a02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5294546d-0d41-49ce-be91-1b7fe7e79a02" /></a>Hi

<h2>            One of 4 email account syncs - rest only after &#34;s&#253;nc directory&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just installed Windows 10 and use Office 2013 (Outlook 2013). I have 4 email accounts installed previously under Windows 7 and the same version of Outlook.</p>
<p>When pushing send/receive it only syncs the primary email address only. The following other email addresses do not sync. This happens only after activating the sync directory button.
</p>
<p>I have looked at various settings, but not managed to send/receive all addresses with one push on the button.. (or even no push).</p>
<p>Can anybody support me?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Tjeerd</p>

    <title>Cells with wrap text enabled will not center properly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cells with wrap text enabled will not center properly</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a strange issue I've never had before. The workbook I'm using is a simple, one-sheet staff list. All I want is to center the text in these cells, but when I have wrap text enabled (which I need to have for this column), it seems that the center
 of the cell gets "shifted" to the left. When I disable wrap text the centering goes back to normal. I also noticed this in some cells that had carriage returns, so initially I thought that was the problem, but it's happening in cells without carriage returns
 too. The common denominator is the wrapped text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the attached image, notice that on the left-hand screenshot there is less space before the words than there is after them, as though the center of the cell has been shifted slightly to the left. In the right-hand screen shot, wrap text has been turned
 off and the cells are centered evenly. I've tried clearing all formatting, copying and pasting as values, TRIM(); nothing works!</p>

            For my sanity, yes, it really is a problem. It doesn't make any sense and it's definitely not just one pixel. If it was just one pixel, I doubt I would've even noticed, but there's a clear difference between the two.

            Hi Katie:
<div><br />
<div>You need to re-start the computer. &nbsp;Restarting Word doesn't clear everything, you need to restart the Operating System to clear the memory.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Re-installing would have no effect either: the parts that get damaged are not on the CD to be re-installed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This problem began because a dialog box generated by Word managed to slip behind the window, where you couldn't see it (that's what "modal" means: it's waiting for a response from you).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Restarting the computer should clear it. &nbsp;If it doesn't, perform Steps 1 and 3 (only) from here:</div>
<div>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768</div>
<div><br />
<div>(and re-start the computer again...)</div>
<div><br />
<div>That should clear it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

<p>
</p><p><span>What type of account you have configured in Outlook. (POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync or an Exchange account)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us try opening Outlook in safe mode and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do that, close Outlook. Let us type in ‘Run’ in the search bar next to start button, click on the 'run' icon that appears – in the 'Run window' type in Outlook /safe and hit ok. (Note: There is
 a space between Outlook and /).&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</span></p>
<p><span>Click the File tab. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Go to Options.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>In the Manage section, select COM Add-ins and click on Go.</span></p>
<p><span>Now uncheck the Add-ins and click on OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the indexing works fine in the Outlook application safe, open Outlook, click File---Options---search----Indexing Options---- Modify and unchecked Microsoft Outlook.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, let us try the following steps:</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Strange string of characters under Outlook Profile ID - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ad 533  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange string of characters under Outlook Profile ID</h2>
                    <p>After I sign in to Outlook, on the drop down screen with my profile on it, instead of my email address under my name, I am seeing a strange string of letters and numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY ACCOUNT NAME</p>
<p>Default- bb5a5cff-edxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx...@sct-15-1-448-x-msonline-outlook-965e3.templateTenant</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;My true email address is no longer on the page I am seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is this? Why the "Tenant" at the end? This account is not shared or managed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p>

            <p>Don't panic. The issue has been already reported by a few users. I guess it's a mutation of another bug - my account doesn't show my primary account but one of aliases. On OneDrive tab the address is correct.</p>
