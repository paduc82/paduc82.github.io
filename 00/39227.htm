            Do you have a Lexmark Printer installed?<br />
<br />
On the Internet, where everything you read is true, if you have a Lexmark printer installed, this seems to work (assuming XP is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
Using Explorer, Navigate to this folder:<br />
<br />
<span><span>C:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86\Lexmark_x1100_seriesf27b</span></span><br />
<br />
Locate the file called:<br />
<b><br />
</b><span><span><b>lxbkprpr.dll</b><br />
<br />
If you can't find or don't have that folder, use Windows Search to find that file and when you do, copy it and paste it into this folder:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
Reboot and test.<br />

    <title>After Windows 10 upgrade, my user profiles are blank - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellisdee37  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Windows 10 upgrade, my user profiles are blank</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 two days ago. Everything went smoothly. Yesterday I noticed that my Office 2013 was no longer activated, so reinstalled Office 2013 and it activated fine. I then spent the rest of yesterday putting the finishing touches on my preferences:
 cleaned up my start menu, chose my theme and accent colors, etc... Everything was set up perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I logged off (there are two local user accounts) and put the computer to sleep, just like I do every night. This morning, when I log in to either user profile, all my settings and documents are gone. It's as if this is a brand new machine I've
 never touched before. All my firefox bookmarks and add-ons (and stored usernames/passwords!), outlook emails, start menu customizations, desktop wallpaper; everything is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say the two accounts are named Ellis and Test. Looking at C:\Users, I see the expected Ellis and Test folders, and they do contain my documents, but apparently I'm not given an option to log in as those users. This is strange, since the welcome screen
 gives me the same two options I always had: Ellis and Test. And lets me log in as either of them. Only instead of seeing all my documents and settings, logging into either gives me a blank, "factory default" profile with no documents or settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to the Ellis&nbsp; and Test folders that actually contain my documents, I also see two new suspicious-looking profile folders:</p>
<p>C:\Users\Ellis.Test-PC </p>
<p>C:\Users\Test.Test-PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those profiles are blank. I'm guessing those are the blank profiles the welcome screen is offering me. How can I get back to my actual profiles?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: This issue is now resolved. The resolution was to format the hard drive and reinstall Windows 10 from scratch. I posted more specific details (how I backed up my hard drive before formatting, etc...) to the end of this thread, but I can't mark my on
 posts as "the answer."&nbsp; I would if I could.</p>

            <p>Hello Ellis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess you have logged into a temporary profile. Before I assist you in this regard, please check this and confirm, to guide you accordingly.
<span><strong>You are logged on with a temporary profile. Roaming options are currently unavailable</strong>.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, then this means Windows created an extra account for you when you switched to Windows 10, so you‚Äôll need to restart your PC and sign in with a different account. I mean the actual account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be sure to copy anything you worked on since you upgraded to an external drive or it will be deleted when you sign out.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if it doesn't fix the issue, to guide you further.</p>

            <p>Just to let you know, before you replied I saw somewhere else a similar issue, where the suggested fix involved creating a new profile. So I created a new profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I created the new profile, the first thing I did was log off to the welcome screen. Unfortunately, the welcome screen is no more. All I get now is a black screen with a circular progressmeter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer no longer functions at all. I can't boot into any account, or do anything, because the welcome screen has been replaced with the all-black progress circle thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it matters, after my profiles became corrupted (assuming that's what happened) but before I created the new profile, I was able to switch profiles on the welcome screen without issue, which I did many, many times. (My computer has two profiles.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully I can figure out how to convert my doorstop back into a computer, at which point I can resume trying to figure out how to fix my profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to pull my old XP box out of mothballs to connect to the internet.</p>

            Turning on the computer with the media disk in, and changing the BIOS to boot from DVD, I first get the message "You are in the middle of an upgrade and inserted a media disk. Press Cancel to resume upgrading." I hit OK to boot from the media disk and
 try its various options.<br />
<br />
- Repair Windows 10 Startup...Failed ("Unable to repair")<br />
- Reset Windows 10, Preserve Files...Failed at 1%<br />
<br />
So then I went to the Command Prompt and used the command:<br />
Bootrec /RebuildBCD<br />
<br />
This added my original Windows 7 OS as a boot option in the various menus on the disk. Trying that was the same deal:<br />
<br />
- Repair Windows 7 Startup...Failed ("Unable to repair")<br />
- Reset Windows 7, Preserve Files...Failed at 1%<br />
<br />
<br />
So, yeah. It's looking like I have no chance at saving any existing files, which is a bummer. I backed up all my critical files, but there's a ton of media files on there I'm unhappy about losing, and took up too much space to reasonably back up.<br />
<br />
I also tried plugging in my old CRT monitor just in case the display was being routed to the wrong monitor. Not only did that not work, the old CRT monitor was physically damaged by this attempt; everything looks much, much worse than the already bad picture
 it had to begin with.<br />
<br />
Next up is to try and Reset Windows 10 (delete all files) but to be honest I doubt that will work either.

<p>What you're trying to say with this line "This added my original Windows 7 OS as a boot option in the various menus on the disk"?</p>
<p>Did you tried going to Safe Mode using Media Creation Tool?</p>

            <p>I am not using Windows 7 Bootable media to try and repair Windows 10. I am using the disk created by the Media Creation Tool you linked earlier in the thread. That link is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the clarification you requested, when I booted from the dvd as directed, and went to "Repair Startup" and "Reset Windows" screens as directed, the only option on either screen was Windows 10. (And both failed.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, again as directed, I went to the command prompt (still using the dvd) and typed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bootrec /RebuildBCD</p>
<p>
</p><p>This dos program asked me "Windows 7 found, add it?", to which I answered yes. Then when I went back to the "Repair Startup" and "Reset Windows" screens, they both now have two options: Windows 10 and Windows 7. But all of them fail.</p>

            <p>Hello Ellis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us required details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have tried with basic troubleshooting option in Windows Recovery Environment, but the problem still appearing. If you're willing to do a Reset with out keeping files, then I suggest you to take a back-up of important files by going into Safe Mode
 using Bootable media.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<div>Insert the installation media you created, and then restart your PC.</div>
</li><li>
<div>On the Install Windows screen, select <strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong>. (If you‚Äôre not seeing this screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on
 how to boot from media, and then try again.) </div>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Choose an option</span> screen, select
<strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong>. From there, you can use Safe Mode. Select
<span>Advanced <strong>Options</strong></span><strong> &gt; <span>
Startup Settings</span> &gt; <span>Restart</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>After your PC restarts, select 5 or F5 to restart you PC in <strong>
<span>Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Once you're on Safe Mode, plug in any External Storage device and move files into it.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After doing this, initiate the Reset process by removing everything. It will do following,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Removes apps and drivers you installed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Removes changes you made to settings.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Removes any apps your PC manufacturer installed. (If your PC came with
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, apps from your PC manufacturer will be reinstalled.)</p>
</li><li>Reinstalls <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> and removes all your personal files.
</li></ul>
<p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Cool, I'll give that a shot. I was also thinking I might try copying files directly with the command prompt feature on the media disk. (The same place I ran Bootrec /RebuildBCD, since that clearly accessed my hard drive.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also saw a suggestion from elsewhere that a bootable linux disk should be able to access the hard drive for copying files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I figure a few days to back up all the remaining files I want to save, then I'll try a fresh install. (Reset Windows / Remove Files) I'll post back here to let you know how it went, even if turns out I'm all set. Everyone likes closure.<br />

            <p>Resetting the Computer (Remove Files) got to somewhere past 10% progress, then failed with "Windows could not be reset" and no option other than "Cancel." So I tried it again. And again. And again. It always failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I rebooted to the Windows Media Disk and chose fresh install, formatting the hard drive before I started. This (finally!) worked, and I've spent the last 3 days banging my head against the wall to get things set up how I like them. Everything was incredibly
 difficult to figure out: Multiple local user accounts, Quick launch bar, Change the display DPI (not the scaling %)? It was basically an endless nightmare of googling to figure out how to set up simple options that apparently Windows 10 really doesn't want
 you to do anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is now finally back up and running. For how long, who knows. All I know is that in my ~30 years of using Microsoft operating systems (The original MS-DOS after they bought out PC-DOS, Win 3.1, 95, XP, 7 and now 10) Windows 10 is by far the worst
 upgrade experience I've had by a wide margin, and is the single biggest regret I have in terms of home computing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've learned my lesson: I will never again upgrade any home computer's OS. Ever. As I buy a new computer every 5-10 years I'll start out with whatever's current and stick with it. I no longer trust Microsoft for any kind of upgrade.</p>

<h2>            Another pair of errors&#58; DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL and PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA</h2>
                    <p>Hello! Some of you may have seen my other post about the like, 5 different errors for around 7 bsods. Well, I'm back... I recently got 2 new errors. First came the error PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA, although it only occurred once. I've read up and one person
 who had this error had 2 antivirus software, to which a moderator replied that that was a bad idea. We have McAfee and SpyBot: Search and Destroy 2. Just the regular of SB, not home or pro or whatever. Our friend who fixed some issues on our laptop previously
 is the one who installed SB and I believe my dad said he installed something else, as well. He works with computers on a daily basis and for a living and We only got this error AFTER he fixed our computer. Also, even after he fixed it, we still got BAD_POOL_CALLER,
 the page fault error popped up. We have also received 2 DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL errors and just a few minutes ago, I got a BAD_POOL_HEADER &nbsp; error -- which is one of the errors that had been fixed previously. Could SpyBot: Search and Destroy and McAfee
 interfere with each other? Also, I noticed that every time I get a bad pool caller error, whenever I get back onto the browser, McAfee tells me that the firewall is off! Please help in any way you can with that information. I can't get you any minidump files,
 due to the fact that my profile isn't an administrator profile. Thank you for reading!!</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Oh! Also, the friend that fixed our laptop before said that it was a video driver error that caused our bunch of blue screens, but after he fixed it, it seems like we've had more. I haven't wanted to count, though. Our laptop is a Lenovo G700 with Intel
 Pentium and Windows 8.1. Thanks again!!</p>

            Okay, so just a minute ago I received another Driver IRQL error, but something was different about it. When I receive things like page fault and driver irql, etc. I normally get a little thing in parentheses. This is usually afd.sys, but this time it was
 different. This time it was mfefirek.sys. Can someone please explain what they mean and what the difference between them is? Thanks!

<h3> fillennn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Install MTP driver on Windows 8.1 N Pro</h2>
                    <p>HI, i tried to install and MTP driver to get my PC to recognice my phone.&nbsp;<br />
When i tried to isntall the usb driver for my phone it said i had to install an MTP driver and redirected me to&nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30685.<br />
I downloaded the installer and tried to install it, but when i did it just said: "windows update standalone installer error the update is not applicable to your computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Its an LG G3 D855.<br />
<br />
When i connect the phone it shows up as Lg phone in my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my problem is that when i press manage and then press devices its under portable devices instead of android phone or adb interface. When i right click the driver under portable devices (my lg phone) it tries to install the latest driver but
 fails and tells me to install the MTP driver and redirects me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get no error code just the message i said before (not sure if it is the exact words because my system language is in swedish but i think its the same.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am i to do? </p>

            <p>Hi, sorry for not posting the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its an LG G3 D855.<br />
<br />
When i connect the phone it shows up as Lg phone in my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my problem is that when i press manage and then press devices its under portable devices instead of android phone or adb interface. When i right click the driver under portable devices (my lg phone) it tries to install the latest driver but fails and
 tells me to install the MTP driver and redirects me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get no error code just the message i said before (not sure if it is the exact words because my system language is in swedish but i think its the same.)<br />

                    <p>There seems to be a reported problem with msvcr120.dll according to stellarium. Possibly a problem with the stellarium builds inclusion of redistributables for visualC++&gt; I have msvcr120.dll in system32 buy it is old (2014). Do I need to update it, and how
 can I do this? Where do I find the latest version number? I have just updated WIN10. I have a 64 bit computer.</p>

<p>Hello CJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, the issue with the installation of other program that requires updating of
<strong>VisualC++. </strong>To address your concern, follow the workaround under <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Visual Studio 2017</a>
</strong>and then click <strong>x64: vc_redist.x64.exe</strong> to download the latest version of VisualC++. Kindly ensure that you uninstall the old VisuallC++, to avoid conflict with&nbsp; your programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done, let us know the result.</p>

            I needed to uninstall all the old C++ redistributables and then reinstall stellarium. The stellarium installer then installed the C++ redistributals it needed. The program works correctly on my desktop with an AMD processor, but not on my laptop with an
 intel processor. I will try an earlier version of stellarium and then another laptop.

            Hi Arunav,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I completely understand your concern and feel sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Did you install all the pending updates and driver updates on your system? &nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Did you make any changes on the system, prior to this issue? &nbsp;<br />
3. Are you facing this issue on the Microsoft account or a local account?&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. Which apps are you referring to? (Microsoft apps or third party apps)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the&nbsp;system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Also, I suggest you to install any pending updates on the&nbsp;system to check, if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A default app is the program that Windows uses automatically when you open a particular type of file, such as a song, movie, photo, or webpage.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>For example, you might have more than one photo-editing app installed on your system. You can choose one of them to be the default app that starts whenever you open a photo.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I suggest you to follow these steps below and check, if it helps.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
1. Type Default programs in search bar on your system and open Default programs under Control Panel.<br />
<br />
2. Select Set your Default programs under Choose the program that Windows use by default.<br />
<br />
3. Select&nbsp;the app&nbsp;as default program in the Set your Default programs Window.<br />
<br />
4. Then click on OK and check, if it helps you.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<div>Also, you can refer to the following Microsoft article to set a program as the default application.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Choose the apps Windows uses by default.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><br />

<strong>Note:</strong> applies to Windows 10.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Hope the above information helps. Reply with necessary information and the result to help you further.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <p>I'm not the original poster, but I had a similar problem.&nbsp; I cannot answer for OP, but here are my answers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. All updates are current.&nbsp; I am currently on Windows 10 Professional, version 1511, build 10586.164, upgraded from Windows 10 Home OEM through the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I installed the Hyper-V feature, and installed Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I face this issue on a local account, the only local account on the machine.&nbsp; I am not going to use a Microsoft account to log into my machine, as I feel it gives Microsoft far too much ability to invade my privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I am unable to change the default web browser app.&nbsp; It is currently showing that it is unassociated (just a black plus on a gray square background).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I touch the square, and it comes up with Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Look for an app in the Store.&nbsp; I select Mozilla Firefox, and nothing changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to "Choose default apps by protocol" and FTP and HTTPS are set to Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; (HTTP is set to Firefox.)&nbsp; I select FTP and HTTPS individually, attempting to set them to Firefox; the icons do not change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was only finally able to accomplish what I want by going to "Set defaults by app", selecting Firefox (it says "This program has 5 out of 8 defaults"), and selecting "Set this program as default".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who would have thought that Microsoft would skate so close to the Edge of its DOJ Consent Decree (which, admittedly, has probably now expired, but which if ignored can only lead to the imposition of a new one)?</p>

            All right, enough already. There are a zillion replies to this issue and NONE of them seem to work. It's time to ask the bigger question of why is this happening? Windows 8 is an unstable piece of **** that is so bad you can't even upgrade it to a "fixed" release without something being broken. How about allowing people to download 8.1 WITHOUT using the Windows Store, or having to pay for a fix for the Win 8 horror story? Is that asking too much?

            You are saying that you can not move up or down the list of Startup&nbsp;Options using the UP/DOWN Arrows Keys.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, try doing a Startup Repair:<br />
<br />
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Download the ISO file at the supplied link, and make a Bootable Repair Disk from it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the
 Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you have changed that, insert that Bootable Disk you have made in the Drive, and reboot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc with it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Repair Vista disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is not a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested<br />

<h2>            DLC sharing</h2>
                    <p>So me and my buddy are gamesharing (he's got my profile on his Xbox as well as his, and I have his profile along with my own) and when we gameshare, one person usually has to buy the game for both to have access. And when I start downloading, he starts downloading. For Tom&nbsp;Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands, if I buy the season pass for the games, including DLC's, will he have access to them as well? If I'm the only one buying it? My main concern is if I buy the DLC's, does it work like the gamesharing does?</p>

<p>Hi Jacob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is mostly being caused by compatibility issue. We would like to know if you made any modifications/configurations on your computer prior to the issue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you update the driver of the video card. You can get in touch to your hardware (video card) manufacturer to get the latest driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concerns, feel free to post back on this forum. <br />

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t read my SD cards</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently my windows 7 installation does not want to read any SD card inserted into any port at all. My SD card reader was working but now isn't plus my microSD card on my phone will also not show on windows explorer when plugged into the reader or through
 my phone. However both the reader and my phones USB mode work fine on my laptop but as my desktop is my main computer and I will be selling my laptop soon I wanted to know whether there was a fix for my problem as I would like to get my photo's etc off my
 cards and also be able to put stuff on them.</div>

Now look everywhere EXCEPT USB Controllers for your device&nbsp;and if you find them (may&nbsp;have<br />

for&nbsp;all instances.<br />

            Thank you Zackary, but I already have auto updates turned off. And while I was logging on here just now I got a pop up saying Disney Magic Kingdoms had installed...&nbsp; As you say, patience is a virtue.<br />

            You can try these troubleshooting steps below:
<br />
<br />1:
<br />
<br />you should try signing out of the Microsoft Store.
<br />
<br />Click your Profile picture at the top right &gt; click your account &gt; sign out.
<br />
<br />Restart your PC, and sign back into the store to see if that fixes it.
<br />_____________________________
<br />
<br />2:
<br />
<br />Run the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Try again and see what happens.
<br />_______________
<br />
<br />3:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />It will open a prompt, run through things, then close or you will have to close it yourself.
<br />
<br />
<br />4:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type all of these and hit enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download

            Didn't try 1, as I'm signed out anyway. (I checked that I was). I've tried number 2, have uninstalled the wretched game again, and will see if it reinstalls over the next day or so.&nbsp; I'll post the result.<br />
