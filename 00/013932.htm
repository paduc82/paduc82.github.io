    <title>Inactive Skype account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Inactive Skype account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am asking this on behalf of my elderly father, but as he has not used Skype for sometime he says now that it is "not available" now. He did indicate that he's forgotten the password but I feel that this also has something to do with the fact that his account
 has perhaps been cancelled because of inactivity. Is that true?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, the account would need to be reset first before a new password is&nbsp;created. &nbsp;As he does not live anywhere near me, I may have to go back and forth on this for a while. Thank you in advance.</p>

<h2>            MS office refuses to start-- all details are in the body text. Please help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, </p>
<p>So here's the situation. After getting a new keyboard put into my laptop, MS Office refused to start. I went to the control panel- programs and features- clicked "change."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the message that came up:</p>
<p>Office </p>
<p>Something went wrong</p>
<p>We're sorry, but we are unable to start your program. Please ensure it is not disabled by the system. Go online for additional help.
<br />
Error Code 1058-13</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked the "Go online for additional help" links for Windows 7. It gave advice to do the exact thing I had already tried (which obviously didn't work.) I then downloaded the "uninstall and reinstall" utility at the "repair your office installation link"...
 started going through it... the "are you sure you want to uninstall office from your computer" link came up. I clicked yes. The "resolving problems, this may take several minutes" screen came up. And finally "Microsoft office could not be removed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pressed next, and a "problems found: multiple copies of Office found" box came up. I have no idea what this is talking about. No way to find out what to do next. PLEASE please help me resolve this. I'm working full time and going back to school, and I
 just need this fixed quickly!!! Thanks in advance for any help/advice. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 professional, service pack 1. Processor:Intel (R)Core(TM)i5 CPU. Installed memory:4.00 gig. 64 bit operating system. HP Elitebook.

            Yes, that was the one, and it didn't work-- it just gave the results above. :( Everything else seems to be working. For instance, text files can be created and printed, browsers work, Quickbooks work, etc. Is there really no other way to take care of this
 than to manually uninstall Office? I can see so many ways that could go wrong...

<h2>            Nokie E75 and root certificare</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello Everybody<br />
I recently purchased phone mentioned in a subject and i have a little problem.<br />
Phone WiFi is working fine in my home network but it has problems connecting to my school wifi.\It is WPA2 enterprise with AES encryption which is supported by the phone. However to work properly I need a root certificate, and I was able to obtain it, however
 it looks like it is not supported by phone (certificate file extension is .crt). When i try to open it on my phone (I transferred it through BT ) it just says bunch of random stuff.<br />
How to install that root certificate on my phone?<br />
Thanks</p>

<p>***UPDATE***<br />
<br />
Sorry for posting under my own post however for some reason I cannot edit it.<br />
<br />
Network in my school is using UTN-USERFirst-Hardware(not sure about the spelling) as root certificate authority, and my phone was missing it which most likely caused problems with connecting to network, even though everything else was setup properly as it was
 required (WPA2 Enterprise with AES encryption and authentication method PEAP using EAP-MSCHAP v2).<br />
<br />
I was able to find it for download on the web(if somebody else needs it here is the link for it
<strong><a href="http://crt.comodoca.com/UTN-USERFirst-Hardware.crt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://crt.comodoca.com/UTN-USERFirst-Hardware.crt</a></strong> just type it in your phone browser) and properly install in on my phone.<br />
<br />
Also as for root certificate, IT tech completely confused me and there was either some kind of misunderstanding and/or miscommunication between us. One of them told me that it is REQUIRED for me to have it in order to connect and work with a school network,
 so I tried to install it blindly believing him, but after some more dwelling by me, it came up to that you need it so the browser won't ask about unsecured web pages that belong to a school.<br />
<br />
Also I found that the phone is opening root certificates with a file extension *.der<br />
<br />
I don't know if the phone will be able to connect to school network since I am will not be present at campus till Monday.<br />
<br />
Also I would thank everybody that tried to help me and endured some of my stupid questions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Use Microsoft 365 on one PC with multiple user accounts</h2>
                    <p>I want to install Microsoft office 365 on the family's "main" PC.&nbsp; Each member of the family (6 people)&nbsp;has there own "desktop" in Windows 8 on this PC.&nbsp; Will each family member have access to Office 365, and will each user count as one of the 5 allowed
 PCs?&nbsp; My guess is we all will have access and that it will count as only one install, thereby allowing installs on other PCs/laptops we own,&nbsp;but how do I give each user access on the one computer?&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to do this correctly the first time :)</p>

            <p>You want to switch from Office 365 Personal to 365 Home (allow up to 5 users/computers at the same time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The short answer is you buy Office 365 Home and "apply" it "over" your existing 365 Personal subscription in the MyAccount site. Very easy. &nbsp;The link Palcouk provided gives the details.&nbsp; And it has an added bonus. Your remaining time on the Personal subscription
 is converted to extend you new 365 Home subscription time!</p>

    <title>outlook 2010, unread email folder indicator IMAP account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hankho  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook 2010, unread email folder indicator IMAP account</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Our office upgrade computers to Windows 7, and use Office 2010.<br />
<br />
On some users, we need two account, one is POP, another one is IMAP. <br />
<br />
I setup Outlook check new message every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
On POP account, when users received new emails, the inbox will become bold, and showing number of unread emails.<br />
<br />
but on IMAP account, user need to click on the folder, then the folder become bold and show number of new emails.<br />
This did not happen before we upgrade to office 2010 (we use Office 2003 before).<br />
<br />
Is there any way to solve this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

    <title>Custom XML Data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roaner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom XML Data</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Word 2013. When I opened a few files that had been created in Word 2007, I noticed that under "Inspect Document" it said custom XML data was found. I saved the files under new names and let Word remove the custom XML, but I'm a little
 concerned about how it got there in the first place as I did not (intentionally, at least) add any XML data.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is the presence of XML data any sort of danger or security risk to anyone who might be sent or open the file? And how could it have gotten in there without me knowing?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>---</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(Sorry if this sounds paranoid. I had an issue last weekend where Word was throwing a false positive and triggering a security alert on one of my documents. Both a Microsoft support agent and a response from someone on the community assured me it was nothing
 to worry about, but it left me a bit jumpy so when I saw the XML warning on multiple documents,I was concerned)</div>

            Like the false positive security alert, this is not something to be concerned about.<br />
<br />
A little background will help: Documents that are saved in the .docx format actually consist almost entirely of XML (which stands for eXtensible Markup Language). Most of that XML is standardized to mark things like headings and tables.<br />
<br />
In the initial release of Word 2007, there was also the ability to include special ("custom") pieces of XML for whatever purpose was desired. That capability wasn't used very much, but when it was used it was usually by add-ins or macros, not by end users.<br />
<br />
In 2009 a company named i4i won a <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/170148/microsoft_word_xml.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
patent lawsuit</a> claiming that Microsoft infringed its patent, and the court required Microsoft to remove the custom XML feature from Word. Further, from that date onward, any version of Word that opened a document in which custom XML was already present
 would be required to remove the custom XML from the file.<br />
<br />
So the bottom line is that <b>custom XML in a Word document is not a security risk
</b>to anyone. It's just a very expensive headache for Microsoft and for anyone who might write an add-in that would benefit from using the forbidden custom XML.<br />

    <title>Undo in OneNote Deletes Text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Undo in OneNote Deletes Text</h2>
                    <p>I have OneNote 2013&nbsp;on my Surface Pro and just recently this morning when I was using it to take notes and I accidentally&nbsp;typed something incorrectly so I pressed Ctrl + Z to undo it. Surprisingly, I did not get rid of just the typing error, but a whole
 block of text! Luckily the text was still on the board I was copying it from when this happened so I didn't miss any information. I thought this would only happen once so when I needed to undo&nbsp;some other things&nbsp;again, (undo and Ctrl + Z both do this) it kept
 happening and deleted everything the first undo did in addition to all text I typed after. After the second time it happened, I was still able to get what I lost and copied it that time because I am so used to undoing errors. It's a habit for me to undo something
 when I type wrong, so I need to get this fixed<em>&nbsp;</em>as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I forgot to mention,that one time undo didn't work, redo didn't bring anything back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem solved, after I posted this I closed and opened OneNote and everything worked just fine.</p>

            <p>This actually stopped happening after I closed and reopened OneNote. I probably should have tried that before I posted a question. Also, never until this one time yesterday did any Office program on any computer I ever used delete a chunk of text by&nbsp;an undo.
 If you haven't already, you should post a question about this - that would be really annoying if that happened every time. Also, I forgot to mention,that one time undo didn't work, redo didn't bring anything back.</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />Try working with the Word Safe mode and check if it helps.
<br />Hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ on the keyboard to launch the Run command &gt; Copy and paste the following command line in the open box and click Ok.
<br />Winword /safe
<br />
<br />If, word works properly do you need to disable add-ins:
<br />Go into Word
<br />Click on File menu.
<br />Click Options.
<br />Click Add-ins.
<br />Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-Add-in.
<br />Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.
<br />Close the Word and restart it.
<br />
<br />In the link below explain how disable add-in:
<br />

<br />
<br />If, the procedures above didn't work, I refer to repair Office in the following link for more information:
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Add and Remove Programs and highlight Microsoft Office. Click on Remove. A menu will pop up allowing you to choose repair or reinstall. Try a Repair Online and verified after repair it fix.

<p>interesting.</p>
<p>following the advice here I ran the program with</p>
<p>winword /a</p>
<p>and definetively I opens the program immediately.</p>
<p>so I need to find out which thing is relenting the program from opening fast</p>
<p>
</p><p>however , before modifying the Registry I would like to ask if that is not going to delete my Normal.dotm which includes lots of shortcut customization and macro. (And my computer opened fast Word with my Normal.dotm)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean the problem of slow opening Word is pretty new.</p>

 the next time a full sync occurs. If you don’t want to wait for the next automatic sync, you can force a full sync by pressing Shift+F9 while OneNote is running.

<p>Hi Counrtney,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the problematic notebook stored on your OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online document library?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, please try navigating to your OneDrive for Business folder or SharePoint document library in web browser to check whether you can open the notebook in OneNote Online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, please try <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Close-a-notebook-in-OneNote-2016-for-Windows-d4b52723-6f33-430b-b1f7-35dbb07548a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
closing this problematic notebook</a> in OneNote first, then click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Open In OneNote</span> button in OneNote Online to open this notebook in OneNote and check whether the sync error exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I would like to confirm some information for investigation:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Where is your notebook stored? Your personal OneDrive,
 or OneDrive for Business, or a SharePoint Online document library?</span></li><li><span>Does the sync error only happen to some specific sections or all sections of the problematic notebook?</span></li><li><span>A screenshot of your OneNote product information, check it from
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">File</span><span> tab&gt;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Account</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>A screenshot of the error message.</span></li><li><span>Does this happen to one specific notebook or all notebooks?

<h2>            Can not set up Outlook 2016 on Windows 10 for a POP 3 Account</h2>
                    I am trying to set up a POP 3 email account on a new laptop with Outlook 2016, Windows 10. &nbsp;I receive the error: Outlook cannot connect you to your outgoing (STMP) email server. &nbsp;The incoming mail server and outgoing mail server are the same and worked
 with previous Windows and Outlook platforms. &nbsp;When I select test, it accepts my incoming server, but not the outgoing server. &nbsp;I have followed the instructions provided by Microsoft in regards to setting up a POP account and received the correct address for
 the mail server from my ISP, including the Advanced and Outgoing Server tabs. &nbsp;They are stumped as well. &nbsp;<br />

    <title>Disable AutoArchive for other data files than the default one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sorinau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable AutoArchive for other data files than the default one</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have multiple data files in Outlook (backup per year).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I configure the AutoArchive feature and I say "Apply to all folders", it applies it to folders in all data files. The result is that Outlook tries to archive mails from 2010 even if the rule say "older than 2 weeks", which is a waste of time and resources.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can it be changed for an entire data file without manually changing for each of my ~100 folders per year?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you! </div>
                </div>

I have both Exchange and IMPA e-mail accounts.<br />
<br />
As explained, I don't want to set this option in each folder ( ~100 folders per year!!), but at data file level.<br />
<br />
And the problem is for AutoArchive, not the manual Archive operation.<br />

    <title>Any way to resolve all of these issues I have with Skype&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drew angell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Any way to resolve all of these issues I have with Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been a Skype user for many years.&nbsp; Unfortunately, ever since Microsoft took over it seems to have gotten worse as time passes, to the point that I can no longer use it, and I'm sad about this.&nbsp; I'd like to offer this feedback in hopes that some action
 can be taken to fix these problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Voicemail</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Skype In as my primary phone for many years.&nbsp; I was able to use Skype Voicemail with a custom greeting, and this worked great for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Microsoft took over and started moving all of the Skype settings online, the custom greeting got killed.&nbsp; The only option I had was to let a very generic message like "the user you are trying to reach is not available."&nbsp; This was not good at all, and
 as such, I had to simply forward all of the calls to another line of mine, which made my Skype In line worthless to me.&nbsp; I had to cancel that service and switch to Google Voice as my primary phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Broken Icons</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Windows 10 on all my computers; two MS surface laptops and 1 desktop.&nbsp; On every machine, the icon for Skype has shown up as a dead icon for a long time now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6959b7d-4734-4ab1-8c7e-ef84e6779e20?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6959b7d-4734-4ab1-8c7e-ef84e6779e20?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Minor annoyance, but I mean, really?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Broken Chat Window</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Often, when I open up the Skype window (the app already loaded) and try to type to somebody, the cursor simply will not show up in the chat window so I cannot type anything.&nbsp; I can click around into other users, but I cannot get the cursor to actually show
 up and let me type anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I kill Skype and re-load it that seems to fix it. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Notifications (or Lack thereof)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype never notifies when I get a message.&nbsp; I have all notifications enabled, yet it never gives me any audible or visual notification other than all of the bubbles inside the app once I think to actually load it up and take a look.&nbsp; Because of all my issues,
 though, I have been moving to other platforms like Slack for my messaging needs, so I often don't think to look at my Skype for days at a time.&nbsp; Then I finally do and I see lots of messages from people I haven't been responding to.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Contact List Confusion</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, lately it's been very easy for me to lose track of contacts in my list.&nbsp; I will try to find somebody I know I just talked to the day before, and they are no where to be found in my "recent" list, or when I search for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Audio / Video Settings</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype now seems to look directly at my system settings for audio/video, but it doesn't always work properly.&nbsp; There are many times where I cannot do a Skype call or Screenshare because it's telling me it can't find audio or video, yet everything else sees
 it just fine, and the system settings show everything working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, all of these issues have pushed me away from Skype.&nbsp; This is my last ditch effort to save it.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 calendar iCloud error &#34;MAPI was unable to load...&#34;</h2>
                    My Microsoft Outlook 2016 running under Windows 10 suddenly gives me an error when attempting to open my iCloud calendar:<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message that you've encountered usually appears if iCloud fails to load properly in Outlook 2016 when accessing Calendar, Contacts, or Tasks. The loading of unregistered MAPI services has been disabled by default to make Outlook more secure. To
 resolve your concern, we recommend that you <strong>uninstall</strong> and <strong>
reinstall</strong> iCloud in your Outlook 2016 application. Please also refer on this
<strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for further information.</p>
<p>

            Crixus, what I did after uninstalling and reinstalling iCloud, is I made sure Outlook was closed, &nbsp;opened iCloud settings and unchecked "Contacts, Calendars and Tasks with Outlook," gave it a few minutes, and then re-checked/enabled it again. Then when
 I opened Outlook again iCloud was back as an option.

<p>It's nice to know that your iCloud calendar is now opening properly. On the other hand, since your appointments are still not showing up, we'd like to confirm if you've already tried to restore it through iCloud.com. If not, we suggest that you perform the
 suggested step. Here's how to restore your missing appointments:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign in to your iCloud account.</li><li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Scroll down and click <strong>Restore Calendars and Reminders</strong> under <strong>
Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Restore </strong>option next to the date before you deleted your calendars and reminders.</li><li>Click <strong>Restore </strong>again to confirm. As soon as the restore process completes, you'll receive a notification on iCloud.com and an email to the address on file with your Apple ID.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us the with result after performing the suggested steps.</p>

<h2>            Crashed Insider Update 15025 to 15031 What now&#63;</h2>
                    System update for new version to 15031 from 15025 progressed normally up to system restart. Then as system restarted got a blue screen Your system need to be fixed. Wiped out my duel boot menu though I can access my live 1607 system on another partition.
 MSCONFIG boot section shows three systems - my two Windows partitions and a ROLLBACK WINDOWS entry. Well there it sits , I cant access or fix the Insider Preview system. How do I fix this or reinstate the Duel Boot menu?

            <p>With Dual Boot you might have to turn off <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Fast Start</span> so your system will use the conventional boot system.</p>
<p>So you might try this first by going to Control Panel and Click on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Power Options</span> then up near the left top Click on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Choose what the power buttons do</span>. On the next screen Click on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Change settings that are currently unavailable</span> then you can uncheck <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Turn on fast start (recommended)</span> and Click on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Save changes</span> at the bottom of the window.</p>
<p>If this helps you will have to remember to make this change every time a new build is installed because it defaults to Fast start on the new install.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Another thing you should check is the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Timeout</span> setting in the boot tab of the msconfig. Some of the builds I have had in the past set it to 0 and that makes your computer boot to whatever is the default with no time to make a choice.:)</p>

            <p>Thank you, The timeout was set to zero, after setting it to 10 secs I was able to regain the menu and boot into the Insider preview system. I has rolled back to 15025 but at least I have a running system. Can't understand why the Update failed as I haven't
 installed any new software or made any changes to the system. </p>

            <p>Yes It boots normally from the duel boot menu now that on advice I changed the menu delay to 30 seconds. It had rolled back to 15025.</p>
<p>It went through the whole update routine for 15031 again but failed in the same&nbsp; place again as described in the message above. It has since rolled back again to 15025 and is usable again. I confirm that this installation has been used for over a year and
 has successfully updated though many, many builds. This is the first one that has failed. Unfortunately I do not have any screen shots of the failure. but I have detailed the error message in the message&nbsp; above.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 unable to open folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carolebrown1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 unable to open folders</h2>
                    <p>I have a number of IMAP accounts running on Outlook 2016 on my home PC . About 6 months ago I tried to add an Exchange account from a new employer. Couldn't get it to work - can't remember exactly why - but I deleted it from the list of Outlook accounts
 and all seemed OK. I continued to receive and send emails from my IMAP accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week, the employer changed to a new email domain and deleted all the old email accounts. Since then, I have not been able to open my old Outlook profile. I get a message saying "the set of folders cannot be opened".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a new Outlook profile but I have lost the sent and stored emails from the old profile. I can see the old.ost files but I cannot open them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot see a .pst file anywhere for either the old or new Outlook profiles. I can only see .ost files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I set up the new profile, it automatically offered me the employer account details so that's why I suspect it has something to do with that account even though I cannot see it in the list of accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried importing the old .ost files into the new profile but Outlook says they are not data files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Can anyone advise how to get my old data back</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I understand that the .ost files are a copy of .pst data held on a server somewhere . How can I find out what server my Oulook is connecting to ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help to point me in the right direction for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>*.ost and *.pst are two completely separate and unconnected types of data file.</p>
<p>A pst is used by a pop mail account</p>
<p>But an ost is used by an IMAP or Exchange mail account</p>
<p>Once Outlook or the mail account has been reset you cannot connect/access an old ost</p>
<p>If you actually added a new Profile using the Control Panel&gt;Mail applet no previous mail account would be shown or suggested</p>
<p>So by new Profile is this what you actually Mean?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, when I do control panel/mail/show profiles as per your screenshot .. and then select "Add" to create a new profile, it automatically populates the name and address fields with the employer account details. I thought I had deleted that account so I don't
 know where it is getting the details from</p>

            #1 - Imap accounts are stored in .ost files
<br />#2 - An .ost file can only be opened in Outlook using the same Outlook profile/email account that originally created the .ost file.
<br />#3 - You mentioned that you created a new profile. If you did not delete the original profile then set Outlook to open the original profile so you will have access to the .ost files for the old email accounts. Once this profile is opened, export the desired folders to a PST file via the Outlook export wizard. 
<br />#3a - When completed, you will then be able to import the data from the PST files 
<br />when opening Outlook using the new profile you created (or you can add the PST file(s) to the new Outlook profile and copy the data from the PST folders to the corresponding folders in the Imap folder trees
<br />#4 - If you deleted the old Outlook profile, your only option to retrieve the data in the .ost files will be to use an OST2PST conversion utility and then item (#3a) applies

Running the /resetnavpanecommand removes all customizations to the navigation pane.<br /><br />Close Outlook.<br /><br />Choose Start &gt; Run.<br /><br />In the Open box, type Outlook.exe /resetnavpane, and then choose OK.<br /><br />Source:<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-can-t-start-microsoft-outlook-2016-2013-or-2010-or-receive-the-error-cannot-start-microsoft-office-outlook-cannot-open-the-outlook-window-d1f69da6-b333-4650-97bf-4d77bd7abb85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-can-...</a>

            First my apologies for overlooking the "Folder" error you provided in your original post and not answering all the questions asked
<br />
<br />Re: How can I find out what server my Oulook is connecting to ?
<br />
<br />You would need to open the original Outlook profile using the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app and look at the settings for each individual email account (select the &lt;Change&gt; option after highlighting the account). At that point you'll see the email the server info the account is connected to for the applicable email account/address
<br />
<br />Re: the set of folders cannot be opened
<br />
<br />The way Outlook is supposed to work is to work with the account "offline" if it can't connect with a given email account (whole purpose of having an "offline data store" so either Outlook is trying to connect with a non-existent account and throwing the error instead of treating the account as "offline" OR there is an issue with a given OST file but the error doesn't indicate which account that is
<br />
<br />You can try the /resetnavpane suggestion described in the article provided by others but don't have a whole lot of confidence it would be applicable in this case. 
<br />
<br />What you DO NOT want to do is delete an account from the profile since that will also delete the .ost file for that account.
<br />
<br />At the end of the day, if you can't open Outlook using the original profile, your only option to recover the data you're looking for is to use a 3rd party OST2PST utility.

            &gt;&gt;  have created a new Outlook profile but I have lost the sent and stored emails from the old profile. I can see the old.ost files but I cannot open them.
<br />
<br />If you need to extract the mail from the folders and recently removed the accounts, and have the ost files (which you apparently do) use system restore to restore windows to before you removed the account. Export the contents to a pst then either remove the accounts from the profile are restore the lastest restore point.
