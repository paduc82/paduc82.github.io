<h2>            Intel&#174; WiUSB bug</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
I was having problems lately to open my smartphone in the computer, sometimes it worked, sometimes not. I went a bit deeper to try understanding the problem, and discovered som kind of bug with (if I remember correctly)&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Intel
 WiUSB USB-IF xHCI Host Controller. Error 31.</span><br />
I went to troubleshooting as recommended by the posts I saw, and did found the solution for the problem, just reinstall the driver. But once I followed through with the installation, I had to restart the computer, and after I did it, the device simply disappeared
 from the Device Manager.<br />
<br />
If I go to the troubleshooter now, it says I only have to restart the computer, to complete the installation, but I've done it several times with no result.<br />
<br />
Also some other bug made me loose my last restore point, so I can't restore it now.<br />
Would really like to give it a full reset, but I'm away from my external HD for a few months, and cant go through with it.<br />
<br />
Any help?<br />
Thanks!!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Daniel

<p><span><span>I realize that you are facing issues with the USB device on the computer. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Ensure to install all pending Windows updates on the pc to keep it up to date. In the search box on the taskbar, enter Windows Update, select Windows Update. On the Windows Update page, select Check for updates.</span></p>

<p><span>Plug in another USB device into this PC to check the status. You may also plug in the device into a different USB port to check the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the driver update does not help then I would suggest you to completely uninstall the USB driver and reinstall it to check if this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps.</span></p>

<h2>            Spotify won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have Spotify installed and recently I had a problem with it won't opening first hand when I clicked on it. After installing Spotify, the Microsoft Store would still open directly to the Spotify page although I already had it installed. Another
 problem is that I can't create a tile from Roblox (installed from the Microsoft Store) in the start menu. It just wouldn't allow me to. My current Windows 10 version is 1903 build 18362.116.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Upgrade 1803 -&#62; 1809 Failed &#38; No Longer Available</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for a bit of help. I'm trying to upgrade my Windows 10 however the installation keeps failing. Current version is 1803 and trying to go to 1809. When the install reaches 42% the PC locks up and I have to restart, causing it to roll back to 1803.
 After a few attempts the updates says everything is up-to-date, however the PC is still at 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking around on various places there's a few things I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing antivirus + malware (Avira + Malwarebytes).</li><li>Unplugging all non-essential USB devices.</li><li>Updated GFX drivers to latest.</li><li>Ran the Windows Update Assistant.</li></ul>
<p>All sadly to no avail. Thoughts? I can provide logs if needed (although please advise which ones are required and how to locate them)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p />

            Hi ,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should upgrade to 18909 through Media creation tool. Execute the below steps to go to 1809 
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />

<br />
<br />3. A. Take a backup of your computer before you proceed.
<br />B. Uninstall any third party Antivirus (After update is successful, you can install it again)
<br />C. You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link (media creation tool) and follow the instructions there to upgrade. Use the very simple instructions given under Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

            Hi ABT_PC,
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

            Hi, thanks for taking the time to reply.
<div><br />
<div>I get the error message when either using IE to access You Tube (it seems to affect Flash), so moved to using Google Chrome. It also comes up when trying to load Microsoft Movie Maker.</div>
<div><br />
<div>"The program can't start because d3d10core.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The errors starting coming from about 2 weeks ago, possibly at the same time as the computer crashed (when had too much loaded at same time - whoops!). I hadn't made any significant changes to the system before it happened. Subsequent I have tried (re)installing
 Flash, Quicktime and of course have installed Chrome (which seems to work fine).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have done a system file checker and got the following: &nbsp;</div>

<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span>‚Äòd3d10core.dll‚Äô is a DirectX component. Check the version of DirectX installed on your computer. Generally on Windows 7 you will find DirectX 11.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Which version of DirectX is on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Which-version-of-DirectX-is-on-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Which-version-of-DirectX-is-on-your-computer</a></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may try the following methods and check the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Try to download the latest version of DirectX. To do so, refer the following article.</span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Diagnosing-basic-problems-with-DirectX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Diagnosing-basic-problems-with-DirectX</a></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Update display card drivers. Also, check the optional updates under ‚ÄòWindows Updates‚Äô for drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Restore the computer to a previous state when it was working fine using ‚ÄòSystem Restore‚Äô.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-System-Restore</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state,
 programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></p>

            Hi, thanks for your very comprehensive reply and suggestions.
<div><br />
<div>When trying to run dxdiag I get the same error (d3d10core.dll is missing), and then an error reporting "could not load dxdiagn.dll"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just to clear up some dead-ends; I haven't changed / fiddled with setting / added any graphics card, or installed any games or game devices. Furthermore I don't have any games on my laptop! My laptop is as it rolled off the production line, with standard
 Microsoft programs and "mainstream" other programs (such as Google Chrome).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't recall&nbsp;knowingly&nbsp;installing anything that led to this problem starting...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried using System Restore, and successfully restored back to a date before the issue, but I still had the issue!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Around the same time as this issue starting, I couldn't get Flash to behave (i.e. access You Tube or download updates to Flash), hence having to move to using Google Chrome. The error pops up when trying to load Microsoft Live Movie Maker.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help, &nbsp;Simon</div>

            Hey Simon,
<div><br />
<div>I think a important step that may have been looked over is the&nbsp;system&nbsp;checker. If you refer to Kiran's first post he suggested that and I never saw you report those results.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>System restore not correcting it tells me a great deal. I highly suggest/ask you to run system checker. Also because you keep saying it is related to flash. So I think it would be worth a try totally removing flash from your system and doing a fresh install,
 the missing file might find its way home.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know your status after you try these. Thanks!</div>
        </p>

            Hi, thanks for your reply and your help. I ran and copy &amp; pasted the relevant bits from system checker in my posting of 27th Nov (it said everything else was verified complete)... please let me know if you need anything else from the results file?
<div><br />
<div>The&nbsp;mystery&nbsp;continues. I have uninstalled Flash previously (using the add/remove programs tool)... when using IE (as Chrome has it built in), when I go to the Adobe (UK) site, and run the Flash installer (carefully following the instructions on site),
 it reports:</div>
<div>
<p>"The program can‚Äôt start because d3d10core.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."</p>
<p>In fact, it gets rather stuck and when I click OK, the same error comes up again and again (had to use Task Manager to get it to quit)....</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you as we quest for a solution!</p>
<p>Thanks, &nbsp;Simon</p>

<h2>            After upgrade system will not detect the TV tuner anymore</h2>
                    
<p>I upgraded my desktop to windows 7 64 bit from 32 bit, and everything was fine except for the TV tuner card not being read! So I went back to 32 bit and the remote controller is in devices but with the yellow exclamation mark, and wont load, and still the
 system tells me i have no TV tuner installed.</p>
<p>when i installed the driver from the website, it just loads what i already have - the files and&nbsp;application extensions, but no actual application to re-install it with????</p>

<p>Hi jrg200,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>How are you updating the drivers? What method of installation are you using to go back and forth between 64bit and 32bit?</p>
<p>Removing the card and restarting the computer to remove instances of the tuner software/driver is done to make sure the computer doesn't try to reinstall the device while you're cleaning out the old program/driver.</p>
<p>When you reinstall the card, and restart the computer, Windows will go through the plug and play install with less concern that remnants of corrupt installation (loaded in RAM or something) are inhibiting proper installation. Not that any physical&nbsp;interruption
 of the card has&nbsp;occurred to cause the issue.</p>
<p>Here's an article on installing the driver from the manuffacturers website. I suggest the section titled "To download and update a driver yourself":</p>

<p>Depending on the person you meet tbh. Meet someone over 40 and they'll say only people over 40 should be able to play. Meet someone over 20 and they'll say they don't really care. Most people just prefer people who play similar to themselves to be able to
 play the game. Which I can understand, but wholeheartedly disagree with. </p>

            <p>‚ÄãHi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue that you are facing is better suited in Microsoft Te3chnet forum. Exchange 2007 self sign certificate issues need advanced troubleshooting and Technet is the right place for this type of issues. I would suggest you to post the same question in
 Microsoft Technet forum.</p>

            <p>Win8.1 Mail supports self-signed server&nbsp;side certificate. You can go to Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Your Exchange account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You should see a warning of "There's is a problem with a server's security certificate", you can check the Ignore certificate errors to make the sync works.</p>

            Checked and the certificate is there since last year on Trusted Root Certification Authorities.<br />
Today I added the certificate on the Personal container and it still gives me the error message.

            <p>You should have a Client certificate which was issued by this server. The certificate you installed under trusted root certification authorities is the server side certificate.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Or if you have control to the server try to <strong>Ignore the client certificate</strong> by going through Server configuration -&gt; Client Access -&gt; Exchange ActiveSync -&gt; Authentication.</p>

<br />
BTW - personal cert&nbsp;is how we were working in 8.0 - CLient cert - in the personal store - our root chain in trusted roots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We get the error to please select a valid cert or contact your administrator.&nbsp; Well I am and it hasn't been clear on what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I do see a different error in&nbsp;Outlook saying that the server name on the cert does not match.&nbsp; Basically &nbsp;we have a different internal domain from external domain.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does it have anything to do with CRL checking?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Oui, tu peux jouer en coop xbox live avec un seul profil Gold. Il faudra que la personne qui joue avec toi joue avec un compte "invit√©". Pas besoin de second profil donc.</p>
<p> Sinon tu peux utiliser un autre compte pour jouer en local.</p>

<p>Hi Arshad Mirza,</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: I suggest you to peform a robocopy on your computer and check if it fixes the issue.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use Robocopy</strong></p>
<p>Use the Robocopy utility that is included with Windows 7 to copy the files. For example, type the following command at a command prompt, and then press ENTER:</p>
<p><strong>Robocopy source_path destination_path file_name</strong></p>
<p>For more information about how to use Robocopy, type <strong>Robocopy /?</strong> at a command prompt, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: To use xcopy</strong></p>
<p>The following command line includes the syntax and the switches that you can use with the xcopy and the xcopy32 commands in MS-DOS mode:</p>
<p><strong>xcopy source [destination] [/a | /m] [/d:date] [/p] [/s] [/e] [/v] [/w]</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The square brackets ([]) indicate optional switches. The brackets are not part of the command.</p>
<p>The following table describes the optional switches you can use with xcopy and xcopy32:</p>
<p>Collapse this tableExpand this tablesource Specifies the file to copy.</p>
<p><strong>Destination Specifies the location and the name of new files.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;/a</strong>&nbsp; Copies files with the archive attribute set. This switch does not change the attribute.<br />
&nbsp;<strong>/m</strong> Copies files with the archive attribute set, and turns off the archive attribute.<br />
&nbsp;<strong>/d&nbsp;</strong> Date Copies files changed on or after the specified date.<br />
&nbsp;<strong>/p</strong>&nbsp; Prompts you before creating each destination file.<br />
&nbsp;<strong>/s&nbsp; </strong>Copies folders and subfolders except empty ones. <br />
&nbsp;<strong>/e</strong>&nbsp; Copies any subfolder, even if it is empty. <br />
&nbsp;<strong>/v&nbsp; </strong>Verifies each new file. <br />
&nbsp;<strong>/w</strong> Prompts you to press a key before copying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ashad</p>
<p>Can you please include some details???</p>
<p>So far all we know is that you are copying some mysterious file to an XP machine and you are seeing the 255 character path&nbsp;limit.</p>
<p>What is the exact error message?</p>
<p>What are the exact names of the files and folders that are being copied?</p>
<p>Are these folders and files from the User account?</p>
<p>Let us know.</p>

<p>There is no mistry just make a folder name it up to 255 letters and than put a file of 1 to any letter in it and u will get the</p>
<p>"Destination Path Too Long</p>
<p>The file name(s) would be too long for the destination folder. You can shorten yhe file name and try again, or try a location that has shorter path"</p>
<p>I hope u try/ exp. at ur end and have a way out for this</p>

<h2>            What is &#34;File System Error &#40;-1073741819&#41;&#34; and why am I getting it when I try to install new software&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded from windows 7 to windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently tried to install several programs, however upon double clicking the installers for these programs I immediately receive the following error:&nbsp;<a href="http://puu.sh/jzL9O/42086373b9.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://puu.sh/jzL9O/42086373b9.png</a>
 or sometimes I receive this error:&nbsp;<a href="http://puu.sh/jzLgj/56ab10655c.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://puu.sh/jzLgj/56ab10655c.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which error I receive is dependent on what software I am trying to install. The common thread however is that all of these softwares require administrative privileges to install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only step I have taken to fix this problem is a complete disk cleanup (including old windows installation files) followed by a reboot. This has not done anything to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running a desktop PC&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an AMD Phenom II 6 core Processor 16GB of DDR3 RAM and a Samsung 850 EVO SSD as my main hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've changed my View settings in Advance View Settings: Messages, Other Settings..., however when I restart Outlook the previous settings are back.&nbsp; I've searched for views.dat file but cannot locate it.&nbsp; Another post mentioned changing the views.dat to
 views.old, restart and it should remember my settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Being I cannot locate views.dat, is this file hidden?&nbsp; Changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions.&nbsp; I'm trying to increase the font size on the various panes, poor site.&nbsp;

    <title>Memory leak using beep&#40;&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff_bif3800  say:</h3>
<h2>            Memory leak using beep&#40;&#41;</h2>
                    <div>I have several Windows 7 64-bit machines that have exhibited a rather annoying problem. &nbsp;After about a week of running my application, the computers which started with 4GB of ram run out of available memory.
<br />
<br />
After 6 months of trying to run this down, I finally came up with the following test code:
<br />
<br />
#include &lt;windows.h&gt; <br />
void main (int argc, char *argv []) <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while (TRUE) <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beep (8000,50); <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep (50); <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} &nbsp;/* main */ <br />
<br />
<br />
With this program running, I loose about 100MB (yes, MB) of memory per hour. &nbsp;Using sysinternals, I can see that this is consumed as "driver locked" memory. &nbsp;I have tested this on several windows 7 machines and get the same result.
<br />
<br />
Only a reboot will restore the memory. &nbsp;Can anyone help me come up with a solution to this problem??
<br />
<br />
Thanks. <br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
All of the attached DMP files are of the <u><b>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e)</b></u> bug check.<br />
<br />

<p>You might check out 3rd party virtualization software that will run on Windows 7 Home Premium. Then you could run your Medal of Honor game in that<br />
Virtual PC mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>This may have been the screensaver that is connected with Media Center, go into media center, then navigate to tasks, then settings, then navigate to pictures, then to Slide Show Screen Saver. Also one other note this feature cannot be used with password

<p>My desktop used to have icons on it that I could move around at-will and have "only" what I wanted on there. (old)</p>
<p>The present one is something that was put together by microsoft, with local weather, ect. ect. that I do not even use. &nbsp;All the things I could use are not there. &nbsp;My Open Office is missing and I cannot access it when I want to, to draft letters, ect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10 on a newer HP desktop computor, have had it for 2 years. &nbsp;The desktop icons have copmpletely changed in the last month or so. &nbsp;Just was changed one day and I did not ask for it or desire it.</p>

<h2>            COMPLAINT&#58; updates take too long to download on Slow internet connections</h2>
                    <p><span>I'm an electrical engineer using 10 Pro.&nbsp; The problem is my internet speed is only 1 Mbit/s.&nbsp; (Yes I said 1.)&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>It
 takes a long time to download ~100 GB of updates over a 1 Mbps line...... 20 hours on the latest update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Nuts!</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore
 I want to complain.&nbsp; &nbsp;MS should Not be forcing users to download huge updates, if their lines are tooooo sloooow to handle the size.&nbsp; Microsoft should have enough RESPECT for their users, not to hog their net connections with outrageously huge files.&nbsp; &nbsp; (Like
 give the option of updates via CD... or turn-off updates like previous Windows versions.)&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Per usual Microsoft is being abusive.&nbsp; I have better things to do than wait 20 hours for Bloated updates to slowly trickle down
 my internet line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It's enough to make me consider to Linux or OS X instead</span></p>

            You have a couple options.
<br />
<br />You can block automatic updates and manually download them:
<br />
<br />You can create a stop and start script for Windows Update. 
<br />
<br />Create a Notepad file with each of the following and save them with the .bat extension.
<br />
<br />stop-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= disabled
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= disabled
<br />net stop bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= disabled
<br />net stop dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />start-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= auto
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= auto
<br />net start bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= auto
<br />net start dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />Now you can simply right click on stop-updates.bat and select ‚ÄúRun as Administrator‚Äù

<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 Pro disabled that option.&nbsp; It allows me to "defer" upgrades for 30 days, but then they start downloading automatically (and taking 20 hours to do it).&nbsp; There's no way to stop the updates.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Indeed. I too have a very slow connection just 768/128k ADSL and it is the only option in our area, sat and 4G cell service are not possible either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My connection is so overwhelmed by these humongous updates that it chokes the connection and it shuts down the service and I get the error&nbsp;&nbsp;0x80240034</p>
<p>on all PCs I try and update. It's clearly the internet connection being choked by MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they want folks like us to update they should provide the option of a CD/DVD disc sent by mail! I'd gladly do this if the cost was just shipping for 5 bucks.&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start &gt; Type Regedit</p>
<p>Click Continue on UAC window</p>
<p>If you want to selectively clear the Common Dialog file names MRU, you need to delete these two registry keys manually:</p>

<p><br />
I would suggest downloading and running the Genuine Diagnostics tool (MGADiag.exe) from this
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">web site</font></a> *on the machine in question*. Click "Continue", wait patiently, click the "Copy" button then ‚ÄúPaste‚Äù the report into a reply message in this conversation.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In addition - if you have a sticker on your computer that says what version and edition of WIndows is supposed to be installed - post the name (Windows 7 ____ Edition) here from that sticker as well.&nbsp; Not the "Product Key" that may be on the sticker as well
 - just the Windows version and edition.)</p>

<p>This response should not be marked as the answer without explanation from the original poster (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/fad3ac2f-42d1-471e-b979-3bc23a70c7e6"><font color="#0072c6">RachelChoi</font></a>) as it just

    <title>USB flash drive continuously needs reformatting... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB flash drive continuously needs reformatting...</h2>
                    
<p>I am using a flash drive that is 8 gb, and I have twice now reformatted the drive when the xbox says it needs to be formatted... Twice now I have spent the time to download a game of about 6.5 gb onto the flash drive.&nbsp; I downloaded it on the xbox, thru xbox
 live, and was able to play, and then a few hours later i came back and played again from the saved point as well.&nbsp; (I left the flash drive plugged into the back of the xbox&nbsp; and the xbox was powered off)&nbsp;&nbsp; if I leave it longer tho, I will come back and all
 of a sudden i can't find the game to play again.&nbsp; When I go to system storage it shows my drive as a flash drive, but acts like it isn't formatted.&nbsp; When I access the drive it says it needs to be formatted and will erase all the data when it formats....</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the problem is here, but I'm sick of having to download the 6.5 gb of the game I want to play, even if I have beaten it before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the newer edition 4gb xbox with the touch sensor eject and power options.</p>

<p>the flash drive is pretty new and has never seen any other problems except when formatted with my xbox, and it's getting really annoying wiping the drive over and over,</p>
<p>If I have the game downloaded on the drive but the xbox wants to reformat, I can insert the drive into a computer and the computer shows that the amount of memory the game takes has been used already, so I know the files are on the drive, so it really bugs
 me that the only option I seem to have is erase a game that's there and download it again, only to have it get the same problems again.</p>

<p>I have another flash drive that is smaller, like 2 gb and has worked with my xbox constantly for many months now.&nbsp; never unplugged it or anything.</p>

<p>Now that you have started having problems with your USB flash drive, have you tried using it as a normal flash drive with your computer? It may be that the flash drive has failed, especially because you are having no problems with the smaller one.</p>

<p>Hi their Gunslinger. &nbsp;Here is a Troubleshoot posted for your convience. &nbsp;For USB Storage Devices.
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/7/t/153178.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../153178.aspx</a> &nbsp; I should note. &nbsp;This particular part of the post. &nbsp;May/maynot help.</p>
<p>My USB device un-configured itself! </p>
<p>If your USB device suddenly has no data in it, or it has reverted to its pre-configured state, it may not meet all the requirements for using it with the Xbox 360 console. Did you get a warning message during configuration? The best thing you could do is
 to find a USB device that better meets the requirements for use with the console.</p>
<p>If you want to give your USB device another try, format it to FAT32 again on the PC and then try the configuration process over again. It would be recommended to make sure your files are saved on the console as well in case there is another issue.
</p>
<p>I hope this helps you out. &nbsp;And have a good day. </p>

<p>thanks for the tips, </p>
<p>I wish I could make sure the files are saved on the console but since the game is over 6 gb and I have a 4 gb xbox. &nbsp;</p>
<p>will give the tips a try and see if i can do much else.</p>

<p>There is only two reasons this will happen. 1) There is insufficient space ... 2) This is the most popular, when using the flash drive on the computer there will an icon at lower right on task bar that when hovered over says click to safely remove media.
 Flash drives are really sensitive when it comes to trading information between 2 different types of hardware. So if you use it on your pc and just casually unplug it as most people do and then plug it in your xbox. The xbox will register it as being corrupt
 because you didn't safely remove it causing the automatic reformat message.</p>

<p>Look the only way to fix it straight from your Xbox is to make it a 8gb device ... Go to storage on your Xbox 360...click y ( device options ) ... Remove Xbox 360 storage ... Then go to customize...take the bar down to 8gb...then hit A...after that clear
 cache and rename it or whatever bam its ready to go...I know it sucks that you'll be missing half your space but better than nothing...might not work in all cases but most of time only half of space is corrupt ... If you're looking to get all your space you'll
 have to do it through a laptop or buy a new one...hope this helped</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the desired languages are chosen: English (US) - default language, and Spanish (Argentina).</p>
<p>So its quite odd that more keyboard languages appear (both english UK and english international).</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Taskbar does not work properly</h2>
                    <p>The taskbar and system applications/functions on the taskbar of my computer (Start button, Cortana, Edge, Store, Networks, Volume, Notification Center, Calendar) suddenly stops working very regularly (almost after every time I turn on my computer and work
 for a while). I have tried frequently mentioned methods, but none of them seems effective, and applying all the methods cost a huge amount of time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my touchpad also fails to respond sometimes. Although it lasts as much as a minute, it is still frustrating.</p>
