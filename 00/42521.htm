    <title>Windows 10 Administrator&#39;s Permission Needed. I AM THE ONLY - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quintonbarker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Administrator&#39;s Permission Needed. I AM THE ONLY USER&#33;</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So recently I installed Civilization IV Gold Edition, which in my opinion, the fourth one is the best one, but not the point. I installed it on my HP Beats 15 Notebook PC laptop. I got the Windows 10 upgrade back when it first came out. It has been
 working great so far, but when I finished installing and went to play my game, it said I need to login with administrator access to continue! How do I not have administrator access! I decided to uninstall and reinstall the game. The same result happened. So,
 I created a new account and made that the administrator and mine a standard user. A short while later, I switched them back, deleted the new account, and the same result occurred. HELP!!!!!

            <p>Hi Quinton,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern that you are unable to play the game Civilization IV Gold Edition after upgrade to Windows 10, we will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know the following information to understand the issue and assist you better:</p>
<ol>
<li>As you have already created new user account, have you tried to log-in with that account and access the game?</li><li>Is this issue confined only to the specific game?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try few of the below steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> I suggest you to check the number of user accounts created on your laptop and also to ascertain the administrator account.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press
<strong><span>Windows +&nbsp;R</span></strong> key together on your desktop screen.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type
<strong>netplwiz</strong> and hit <strong>Enter.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 2: Enable Built-in administrator.</span></strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to enable built-in administrator account, try to log-in with that account and access the game to check if there is any issues with the current user account.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press
<strong><span>Windows + X</span></strong> key together on your desktop screen.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on
<strong><span>Command Prompt (admin)</span></strong> to open
<strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type the following command and hit Enter:
<strong><span>net user administrator /active: yes
</span></strong>(Check for the spaces)&nbsp; </span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now log off from the current user and try to login to the administrator account that is enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Please follow the same steps
 and type net user administrator /active: no to disable admin account after the troubleshooting is done.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Try the above troubleshooting steps, reply to the post with an updated status of this issue and required information. We will be happy to assist you accordingly.</p>

            <p>I am having the same problem as the above Microsoft customer related. I am the only user and am always signed in as the administrator. The Game I have is a Games for Windows version of Civilization IV. It won't play on Windows 10. The reason Microsoft Windows
 is telling me it won't play is that I'm not signed in as administrator. This reason is wrong, I am signed in as administrator. It is an error on Microsoft Windows part. You guys need to fix this problem, not me your customer. So not only does a Game made to
 play on Windows not actually play on Windows&nbsp;but the reason Microsoft&nbsp;gives for it not playing is also wrong. Fixing this is Microsoft's responsibility, not mine. I await your mitigation of your error.</p>

            <p>There are occasions when a game will run when using the Compatibility setting 'run as admin', even when</p>
<p>logged in with an admin account, but with&nbsp; Win10 there is another possibility for this bogus error message.</p>
<p>A much greater issue. A malware from MS themselves. A 'feature' called DRM blocking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- This only affects disk based games, but contrary to the claim it will only 'affect a handful of games', it affects</p>
<p><em>many</em> games. If you are using a disk based version of games, and if the disk has a file on it with the title</p>
<p><em>secdrv.sys&nbsp;</em> you are one of the victims of DRM blocking.&nbsp; With Win10 the only fix is to use a noCD patch/hack.</p>

            Hi Diana.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is it paused for 30 days to reset your password?  I understand how annoying and possibly unnecessary it is.  I dont' know anyone else who requires something so draconian.  
<br />
<br />What you could do if you're really fed up is delete the account to get rid of everything:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/delete-your-microsoft-windows-live-hotmail-outlook-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/delete-your-mi...</a>
<br />
<br />You could then create a new account with any other Mail service and still add it to your MS account, then set it Primary to replace the Hotmail account if it also has this role:  <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/micro...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
Yes, it was working before... randomly stopped.&nbsp; My printer prints dual sided and worked fine but now I cannot access it because I cannot get through the properties.<br />
<br />
I'm an amateur when it comes to this so running a memory diagnostic is not a simple thing for me to try to do.<br />

            <p>Go to Control Panel, click on Administrative Tools. <br />
Double Click on Windows Memory Diagnostic. <br />
This will bring up dialog box and you can choose:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Restart now and check for problems</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Check for problems the next time I start my computer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will run a report. Once the test is completed, <span>
Windows</span> will restart automatically. If the tool detects errors, you should contact your computer manufacturer for information about fixing them, since memory errors usually indicate a problem with the memory chips in your computer or other hardware problem.</p>
Advanced options for running the Memory Diagnostics Tool
<p>We recommend that you let the Memory Diagnostics Tool run automatically. However, advanced users might want to adjust the tool's settings. Here's how:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When the Memory Diagnostics Tool starts, press F1.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can adjust the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Test mix.</span> Choose what type of test you want to run:
<span>Basic</span>, <span>Standard</span>, or <span>
Extended</span>. The choices are described in the tool.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Cache.</span> Choose the 
cache setting you want for each test: <span>Default</span>, <span>
On</span>, or <span>Off</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Pass count.</span> Type the number of times you want to repeat the test.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Press F10 to start the test.<br />
<br />
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p>

            No, not yet... quite frustrating.<br />
<br />
Could it possibly be the Norton anti-virus software?&nbsp; It's not new, but I wonder about an update.&nbsp; No idea!?!?<br />

    <title>Surface Pen or Multi-touch not working after Fall Creators update is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike17112  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pen or Multi-touch not working after Fall Creators update is installed on Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book</h2>
                    <p>After installing the new fall creator update, my surface pro 4 pen no longer writes, erases or interacts with the screen at all. All the buttons function normally. I used the Microsoft diagnostic trouble tree which had me replace batteries re-install the
 device, which did nothing. Is anyone else having this issue after the Fall Creator update installed, and if so do you have a solution? Thanks.</p>

            Hi O.B.911,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall 
<br />
<br />4: Turn off filter keys in Ease of Access
<br />Type ease in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Ease of Access &gt; Click Make the Keyboard easier to use &gt; Ensure Turn on filter Keys is not checked  
<br />

<br />
<br />There are two other actions which you can undertake. You can try them one by one and check after each.
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>

<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            How do I change my default download Folder&#63;</h2>
                    Hi<br />
Using Windows Vista - new computer. I'm not familiar with Vista.:)<br />
Whenever I want to download anything (from IE or FF) it asks if I want to save or cancel. But if I select save then it automatically saves the item to my downloads folder. I want to select where to save my downloads as it means nothing is ever saved to the
 correct place. <br />
Please advise on how I can change this to allow me to choose where a file is saved to.<br />
Many thanks.

            In Firefox, Tools&gt;Options&gt;Main tab. You will see the section for Downloads. Click the Browse button to select the folder you would like Firefox to use for downloads.<br />
<br />
Looking at IE8 (sorry, but I don't have machines running IE7) I don't see where you can set this. IIRC, IE will remember the last location to which you downloaded (Desktop, for instance). However, I'm far from expert in IE8. You might want to post your IE question
 in an IE newsgroup:<br />

<h2>            Number lock malfunctioned.</h2>
                    Hi. My son likes to be on the computer. One day he ended up pressing down many keys and suddenly the number lock key stopped working. Now I cant use the right side of the keyboard as the number lock key is not functioning. How do I make this key work again?
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for answers!

<br />
<br />I would strongly recommend you factory reset the system back to Windows 7 and stick with that release if you want maintain functionality such as Bluetooth. 
<br />
<br />If you recently upgraded, you can try rolling back to Windows 7:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />If you don't have the option to rollback, then you will need to manually downgrade.
<br />
<br />Step 1: You need to download the install files for Windows 7 if you are reinstalling it on a system where it was previously installed. You can use the following resources:

<h2>            How do connect to a Hyper-V server without a domain&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I just got Hyper-V, and I wanted to connect to it from another computer without a domain, but I couldn't set it up so that I can connect to it without a domain. All the time I try to connect to the server, it simply denies connections. How do I make it
 allow connections without a domain?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could be caused by Display drivers. Try the steps provided below in order to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the display drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on
<b>Start</b> &gt; type in <b>devmgmt.msc</b> in search box, hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the
<b>Display drivers</b> from the list of devices and click on <b>Uninstall</b>. 
</span></p>
<p><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the
<b>Confirm Device Removal</b> page, select <b>Delete the driver software for this device</b> if you also want to remove the device driver package from the driver store.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>The
<b>Delete the driver software for this device</b> option removes the package from the driver store. It does not remove the currently installed driver for any other operational devices that use the same driver. If you remove the driver from the store, and the
 device is connected to the computer again, Windows must search for a copy of the driver package in the standard search locations, including possibly prompting the user for media.</span></p>
<p><span>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you restart the computer, you can download the latest drivers from the manufacturerâ€™s website install the same on the Computer.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>We suggest that you download the drivers first to your Computer before uninstalling it. Also, keep the Drivers disc in handy with you during the troubleshooting period.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Update drivers: recommended links</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</b></a><b>
</b></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could also be caused by Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable dll.</span></p>
<p><span>Download&nbsp;the files below depending on your operating system version. I would install all versions as they may be needed for different programs. Check in&nbsp;Programs
 and Features, do you show that you have installed Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable and Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable? If not, download from the links here.<br />

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes. 
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem

            Hi Shajal, Visual Studio is a huge installation and contains many virtual drivers and plugins, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

You mean reinstall the OS completely? If you have the Windows 7 DVD's you can do this however<br />
be sure to totally backup your data off the drive and you will need to reinstall your programs. If you<br />
do not have Windows 7 Disks you can buy them from your system maker cheap. If you do not care<br />
about existing programs&nbsp;then you can do a complete fresh install - just select the format options<br />
which wipes the entire disk (this erases all data as well).
<p>Some System makers use Recovery Partitions as well as other methods to allow you to revert<br />
back to a completely fresh installation. So check with your System maker to see what options<br />
you have to do that - and it certainly can be done - just a matter of knowing the processes the<br />
System maker put in place for you.</p>

<h2>            Comment passer son chat du casque &#38;&#35;224&#59; la TV</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour,</p>

<p>VoilÃ , je viens d'acheter une xbox one, et j'ai donc le casque inclu dans le pack. Lorsque j'ai plusieurs amis Ã  la maison, il est pÃ©nible d'avoir le chat uniquement dans le casque, donc j'aimerais savoir si c'Ã©tait possible avec le casque de base de pouvoir
 basculer le son chat sur la tv tout en Ã©tant capable de parler avec le micro du casque?</p>

<p>Merci d'avance</p>

<p>Salut, il me semble que non... Si tu veux faire sortir le son par ton Ã©cran de TV, il faut dÃ©brancher ton casque.

<p>Pour l'avoir utilisÃ© pendant plusieurs semaines, je n'ai jamais pu faire ce genre de chose.
</p>
<p>Je sais juste qu'avec un casque branchÃ© en jack sur la manette (avec l'adaptateur), le son du jeu sort aussi bien dans le casque que de la TV... Pas le chat, dÃ©solÃ© :/</p>

<p>Salut,</p>
<p>Cette option magique n'est disponible que sur 360. Pourquoi ? Demandez Ã  mister Phil Spencer, Ã§a fait plus d'un an qu'on en parle...</p>
<p>Pourquoi ne pas avoir repris tout ce qui se faisait de bien sur 360 ??? POURQUOI ???</p>
<p>Je suis dans le mÃªme cas que vous tous, j'aimerais pouvoir entendre le chat via les enceintes mÃªme quand le casque est branchÃ©. Chose qui Ã©tait facilement modifiable via les option de la 360.</p>
<p>En fait j'utilise un Tritton Warhead 7.1 qui ne me permet pas de profiter de son option chat vu qu'il Ã©tait &nbsp;fait uniquement pour 360. Du coup je dois mettre le Tritton + Le casque chat de la ONE sur la tÃªte. Si on avait cette option de sortie son du chat
 sur les enceintes je pourrais avoir le Tritton sur les 2 oreilles et le casque chat autour du coup pour n'utiliser que le micro.</p>
<p>Cette requÃªte me fait pÃ©ter les plombs depuis la sortie de la ONE mais visiblement chez Microsoft tout le monde s'en fout :(</p>
<p>Peut-Ãªtre au menu d'un prochain DLC ;)</p>

    <title>After Windows 10 Home upgrade have no sound on ear phone jack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> susanbecker  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Windows 10 Home upgrade have no sound on ear phone jack</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell n5030 laptop that was working fine with external speakers before the windows 10 upgrade. I had windows 7 Home.</p>
<p>Now the external speakers have now sound (tested the earphone jack with a set of ear phones and no sound). Un plug the external speakers and the laptop internal speakers work fine. This laptop is desk mounted, does not travel, has external screen, and is
 in great shape (for its age mid 2010 date).</p>
<p>All drivers are checked and OK.&nbsp; Dell Support, systems check, sound showed nothing out of line except that this model Dell laptop had not been checked for Windows 10.</p>
<p>Anybody know if there is a fix or do I have to live with the little tinny speakers?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Susan</p>

            <p><span>Hi Susan,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to update the Audio inputs and outputs drivers and check if it helps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on 'Start' and type 'Device Manager' in the start search box and press enter.<span>&nbsp;
</span></li><li>Click on the â€œAudio inputs and outputsâ€ to expand the list. </li><li>Right-click on drivers and update it. </li><li>If there are no update available, then go ahead and reinstall the driver by clicking on 'Uninstall'.
</li><li>Restart the PC.</li></ol>
<p>If not I suggest you to go to the manufacturerâ€™s website download the audio drivers and install it in compatibility mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.
</p>

            <p>Karthicka_R,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick response to my computer problem.</p>
<p>I tried all of your suggestions and the only one that worked was the last..."manufacture's website."</p>
<p>I un-installed the audio driver for the earphone and then downloaded the new driver from Dell. Did a restart and everything worked fine for about a minute and then no sound again.</p>
<p>So I repeated the process over again and then went to "Sound Effects" and shut them all off. So far I have sound to external speakers and it is working just fine.</p>
<p>Funny thing though, The Dell website said that the Dell n5030 is not compatible with Windows 10 home. Said that it has not been tested for windows 10 and all items on the n5030 won't work. Why doesn't Microsoft tell you this when they do tell you that the
 Windows 10 install will work on the N5030?</p>
<p>Anyway, all is good so far and again thanks a lot.</p>

<h2>            Graphical glitch in windows explorer &#40;left pane arrows&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've noticed a graphical glitch in Windows Explorer :</p>
<p>
</p><p>The left pane arrows (to the left of the folders) are not displaying properly when fading/</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't look like it's a theme issue, since i've tried other theme (online/default) and the glitch is still here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a screenshot :<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84daadbc-dcf2-4877-ac9a-000625731bbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84daadbc-dcf2-4877-ac9a-000625731bbd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, the glitch only happens when the arrows fade in or out.</p>

It plugs into the cigarette<br />lighter outlet. They are inexpensive.</p><blockquote><p>Also, can the internet be accessed while driving?</p></blockquote><p>If your laptop has wi-fi you can use it if you are near a wi-fi<br />source. But the problem is that if you are near it now, you will no<br />longer be close enough in a few seconds. So for practical purposes,<br />you can't do this.</p><p>Ken Blake, Microsoft MVP</p>

<p>Beyond that, and as noted by <em>Ken</em>, look at using a power inverter to convert 12 VDC to 120 VAC. Here are
<u><em>examples</em></u> from Walmart..</p>

<p>Besides using WiFi, which as <em>Ken</em> alluded to is very short range, AT&amp;T/Verizon and other carriers offer 3G/4G adapters you can purchase and either pay a contracted monthy service charge or a monthly pay-as-you-go charge for data service. With&nbsp;hardware
