<p>I had the same issue this evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message means that it lost connection to the server while downloading the new definitions.</p>
<p>Could be your network connection OR their server is getting flooded with requests and lost the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened Windows Defender and went to the Update tab - clicked update.&nbsp; It failed again but then finally succeeded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try again and have patience.&nbsp; It will work eventually.</p>

    <title>EXTREME overheating of laptop on Windows 10 TP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            EXTREME overheating of laptop on Windows 10 TP</h2>
                    I just installed Windows 10 TP, and my fans became really fast. I installed HWMonitor as fast as i can, and guess what i saw.<br />
A 100c gpu and a 85c CPU. The GPU is an ATI Radeon HD 3650, cpu is the AMD Athlon TK-57 (i may be wrong here lol).<br />
Is it possible to stop this overheating or atleast lower the gpu and cpu temperature? I cannot download drivers as my cpu and gpu become very slow when they hit that (2 minutes after boot up). I do not want to risk the death of this non-cheap laptop. (i had
 to fix it myself as the old 8400m g died and this gpu costed me 80$ (50 dollars) )

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum. Let me assist you with your concern.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What anti-virus software are you using?</li><li>Have you recently added new software?</li><li>Have you cleared the system completely of dust bunnies?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the high CPU consumption issue, please use Performance Monitor to view performance data either in real time or from a log file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Resource Monitor lets you view detailed real-time information about hardware resources (CPU, disk, network, and memory) and system resources (including handles and modules) in use by the operating system, services, and running applications. In addition,
 you can use Resource Monitor to stop processes, start and stop services, analyze process deadlocks, view thread wait chains, and identify processes locking files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Use the Performance tab in Task Manager to see how your computer's CPU is being used by Windows and other programs running on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Task Manager by right-clicking the taskbar, and then clicking Start Task Manager.
</li><li>Click the Performance tab.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>A high percentage means that the programs or processes that are running require a lot of CPU resources, which can slow your computer. If the percentage appears frozen at or near 100%, then a program might not be responding. You may Exit a program that isn't
 responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<strong>To exit a program that isn't responding</strong>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Task Manager by right-clicking the taskbar, and then clicking Start Task Manager.
</li><li>Click the Applications tab, click the program that isn't responding, and then click End Task.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to put your system in clean boot state and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<p>You have to clean install Windows.&nbsp; You cannot upgrade from 32bits to 64bits because the 64bit version of Setup.exe cannot run on a 32bit OS.&nbsp; You have to boot with the 64bit media.&nbsp; Your present Windows license covers both architectures so that isn't a
 problem as long as you install the same edition.&nbsp; Perform your usual data backup and make sure you have installation media for your programs first. You can download the 64bit ISO file from MSFT and make either a DVD or USB.</p>

<p>If you are referring to the situation which you just install Windows and have all drivers installed without user interaction, that is the goal of Windows. However , if you look around , you will see there are may devices and drivers out there and supporting
 all is not possible. However, many of drivers automatically being recognized during installation of Windows and some others during Windows Update. There is program for hardware vendors which they could work with Microsoft to make their device compatible but
 it is up to them to join this program or not.</p>

<h3> mister green&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keep getting &#34;Internet has stopped working&#34; pop and then IE closes.</h2>
                    <p>I have Vista home premium, 32 bit all current updates. I seem to be unable to launch the Windows Internet Browser (IE8 at first and now IE7, after having uninstalling IE8). Kept having the message pop up everytime I tried opening a new internet explorer,
 only way I could open a new window was to have one open and use CTRL + N.</p>
<p>I was watching a movie then it suddenly froze and couldn't open IE it ever since. I tried using a System Restore to various earlier restore points. Nothing.. I have searched through posts and found nothing that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried it with add ons disabled, tried resetting Interner Explorer still can not open Interner Explorer. Recently I have noticed that everything has stopped working, i.e. Macrovision Manager Agent has stopped working, Windows Media Player has stopped working.&nbsp;I
 get message pop up saying "Windows media player has stopped working" when Im not even using it.</p>
<p><br />
I had noticed a peculiar process named cwikbmdmfqeitwwv.exe or something similar that keeps asking to be run? I always end the process? Found out it was located in App Data\Local\Temp&nbsp;so I deleted it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way i can open IE is by running as administrator :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help on this would really be appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>That .exe you found in the processes does look a little suspicious have you ran virus software to make sure you aren't infected?</p>

<h2>            when installing Word,it asks for 25 chac. key, certificate of authenticity only has 20</h2>
                    I have a college paper due, it has to be in a format with doc. after file name. I can'r download free trial of Works because I have dial -up at the moment(will take days literally). I have old 2000 disk for works with a 20 character code on the sticker
 of authenticity but when trying to install, it asks for a 25 character code.&nbsp;

            The 20 digit number on the sticker of authenticity is not the product key. Office product keys have 25 digits in 5 groups of 5. The key is usually printed on an orange label on the disc packaging.<br />

<p>I have been using Known Folder Redirection for a long time, to move all of my user data off of my C: drive. Originally, this was because I only had a 128GB SSD for drive C: and I was always running short of space. Now I do it because it enables me to wipe
 drive C: at any time and reinstall Windows 10 with minimal impact. I do not have to worry about data loss and a clean install of Windows only requires some reconfiguration, such as re-enabling the Known Folder Redirection and some reinstallation of software.&nbsp;
 I do not use a lot of installed software, as I do not have anything like MS Office or similar installed. What little I could use Office apps for, I do with the web versions or with Google online apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I did make sure that any data in the original C:\Users\... location was moved when enabling KFR, so this issue did not affect me.</p>

<p>These columns must be true:</p>

<p>ColumnB=Month (This has a formula to determine month from the date i enter on column C)</p>
<p>ColumnG=Name</p>
<p>ColumnM=Payment (This is a drop down list column, it has "Ordered" or "Payment" for types)</p>

<p>Hi Eppab</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I created range names and they can be scoped so they refer to the Workbook so just entering the name refers to both the range and its parent sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not gone that way you must include the sheet in the range.&nbsp; If Name refers to Sheet1 D2:D400 the your formula in sheet 2 &nbsp; will be =Sheet1!D2:D400.&nbsp; The easieast way is to type = then point to the range in sheet 1 and Excel will fill in the reference
 for you.</p>

</p><p>I had another look @ the file and think a Pivot Table might Be the way to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f66e318-6074-4365-bc21-34f95e09e2a4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f66e318-6074-4365-bc21-34f95e09e2a4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I included a small macro that updates the pivot table when you switch to the sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just included the fields as shown here:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05cdf7e2-0716-493f-97ab-e261f6cce7eb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05cdf7e2-0716-493f-97ab-e261f6cce7eb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go this route right-click the Pivot table tab &amp; click View code and paste the following</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Private Sub Worksheet_Activate()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable3").PivotCache.Refresh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWorkbook.RefreshAll<br />

<p>Thank you Peter. I don't know how to do pivot tables or macros.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just needed to know if the client made a payment that month or not. No $ amounts needed.&nbsp;</p>

                    I'm using Excel 2013 (Windows 8) and one out of three times it crashes when I'm saving files without saving. I do this a lot so it hampers me significantly.

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us open Excel in its application safe and check if the issue occurs:</p>
<p>Click <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span>, go to <span style="font-weight: bold">
Programs,</span> go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Accessories</span>, click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Run</span>, type <span style="font-weight: bold">excel /safe </span>(note there is a space between<span style="font-weight: bold"> excel
</span>and<span style="font-weight: bold"> /</span></font>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">File</span><span> tab.</span>
</li><li><span>Go to </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Options.</span> </li><li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Add-ins.</span> </li><li><span>Clear all the options.</span>&nbsp;</li></ul>

            I've got the SAME problem in Excel 2013. Our example is a Macro heavy spreadsheet. Running in SAFE MODE did NOT resolve the problem. Need a fix as well.

            <p>I had the same problem. It is most likely a COM Add-in causing the problem like it was for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable add-ins:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open a new empty workbook and go to File -&gt; Options -&gt; Add-Ins</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. At the bottom of the window, select to manage "COM Add-ins" and then click "Go"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Uncheck 1 of the listed add-ins that has a check mark next to it and&nbsp;click "Ok"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rinse and repeat until you are able to close Excel without the crash issue. As with most issues of this nature, your mileage may vary but work your way through the add-ins until you have ruled them out.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook has stopped working</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have recently installed Office 2010 Professional Plus and i am experencing a problem with Outlook. When you either press the new menu button to create an e-mail or try to forward/reply or open an e-mail outlook crashes displaying a progress window saying
 Mircosoft Office has stopped working.</p>
<p>This problem only seems to be connected to a profile which has an exhange account attached to it. I have created a second profile with a simple POP3 account and all seems to work fine.</p>
<p>My exhange account is hosted by <a href="http://www.fasthosts.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.fasthosts.co.uk</a>. I have spoken to their technical support who do not believe there are any issues with their exchnage service.</p>
<p>I would be grateful for any assistance as this problem is preventing me from using Outlook 2010 all together.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Iain</p>

            Linda, that was about the same time of day yesterday that it happened to mine, and even though this "fix" is supposed to have reached almost everyone one, I am still getting that error msg. I know this doesn't help, but.... it isn't just you, so check
 back. If yours starts working, send a reply. It helps Microsoft and other consumers, like you and me, too.

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>ARE YOU ON?&nbsp; I am as of about 1/2 hour ago.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did three total system recoveries and then bought McAfee Security and downloaded it and then when it was all re-booted for the last time...I clicked on my HOTMAIL account and it opened!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea if any of what I did helped or if it just 'happened'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How are the rest of you doing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Linda</p>

            Some folks have even edited the registry to allow larger files but I don't think that is a great idea.&nbsp; You will be very happy with Audacity.

<h2>            Login into Office 365 with Google Apps SSO works only once&#33;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have set up the federation of Azure AD to use our Google SSO to access Office 365 following this guide (plus some others):<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6363817?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6304952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.google.com/a/</a></p>
<p>
</p></div>

<p><span>After creating a new user in the Google apps admin console and adding the corresponding user to Azure AD through Powershell (and paying attention that email address and ImmutableID are identical) the user a) does get forwarded from<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.microsoftonline.</a>&nbsp;to
 Google's sign in page, b) can log in with his Google account&nbsp;and c) gets redirected back and is&nbsp;<strong>logged in<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>to the office 365 Portal.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
....But upon<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>second try<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(in a different browser or after logging out (and clearing cookies)) the Log-in does not work anymore and instead Google redirects
 the user back to the MS login page with error "<span style="color: rgba(226, 41, 16, 1)">We don't recognize this user ID or password"&nbsp;</span>and keeps reloading endlessly.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
My Question is; has anybody successfully set Google SSO for Office365? And is there any trouble shoot output (console) to find out what our problem could be.</span></p>
<div><span><br />
Thanks!<br />
:Phil</span></div>

            <p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the AD FS is the only official supported way to achieve SSO in Office 365, and we have limited resource to troubleshoot the Google SSO for Office365, we are not able to provide technical support on this. Your understanding is highly appreciated.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h2>            Getting error &#34;Could not syncronize record...ChangeKey is required for this operation.&#34;  Error code -19946</h2>
                    We currently have a Microsoft hosted Exchange environment (Microsoft's Live@edu).&nbsp; Some of our Outlook for Mac 2011 user's receive the following error one or more times per day for certain calendar events:<br />
<br />
<p>Error</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Could not synchronize record: <span style="font-style: italic">
(event name)</span>&nbsp; to Exchange server:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">(Exchange Server Name)</span><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>ChangeKey is required for this operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error code -19946</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I believe the change key is a record that the client and server use to keep track of changes for synchronization.&nbsp; Any idea why the client can't find it?&nbsp; Is there anyway to make this error go away?&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

            I'm not familiar with ChangeKey in relation to Exchange Server. I suggest you also post your question in the Exchange forum to see if this means anything to them there. One of the Exchange experts may be able to offer some advice.

<div><br />
<div>As far as Outlook is concerned, I would suggest emptying local caches but since this is happening to multiple users I'm not sure Outlook is necessarily the issue. If the events are in the past then you might consider simply deleting them to reduce the
 number of error messages.</div>

            <p>Garry, &nbsp;I've now spent 2 days trying to get my PC and phone calendars sync'd, with no success. &nbsp;I had to reset factory defaults because my Calendar icon disappeared from the start screen. &nbsp;Now the icon is back and I've reinstalled everything - but Calendar
 is the one thing not working. &nbsp;It gets my Calendar from Hotmail (which I don't use), but won't let me into calendar.live.com. &nbsp;I have a very accurate record of all my passwords, and live.com or Calendar won't accept the correct passwords. &nbsp;Also, it keeps telling
 me that "Calendar isn't available" - but I don't know if the server is down or I haven't set up the account correctly.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 435 standby battery life</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Lumia 435 a couple months ago and I've never been able to get more than 3 days of standby time vs the advertised 21 days, even when I don't use the phone at all. &nbsp;About a week ago, I restored the phone to factory condition, updated the phone
 to 8.1, update 2, then I followed all of the suggestions here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/11546/windows-phone-battery-making-it-last</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also turned off everything or disallowed apps to run in the background except for the phone and text to I'm still getting 3 days when I don't touch the phone. &nbsp;How do I increase standby time? &nbsp;Even half of the advertised 21 days would be enough.</p>

            the answer is you will never get that much from a battery the advertised time is ridiculous if you are getting 3 days on standby it's not the best but certainly not the worst either you will just have to resign yourself to the fact that that's all you
 will get

            Ps it helps to turn your phone onto flight mode when you have finished with it for the day that way you can still use it for an alarm clock and depending on what time you put it on flight mode and what time you take it off flight mode it can use less battery
 than restarting it every morning

<p>It's hard for me to believe that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft would think it's acceptable to get 14% of the advertised battery life. &nbsp;I assume that some past version got 21 days or I have a defective phone, but Microsoft isn't some second
 rate company that would knowingly make false claims. &nbsp;The standby battery life was the main reason I bought the phone, so I'll need to keep looking. &nbsp;Thanks for your reply.</p>

<p><span>If your Skype account was created before Skype migrated to Microsoft (legacy Skype account) and you use a specific Skype name to log in, you can still link it to your
 Microsoft account by signing in here: <a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://login.live.com/</span></a> using your Skype credentials.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, you can't use an existing Microsoft account or one that has been previously connected to a Skype account. You will have to create a new Microsoft account to
 link your Skype account. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are logging in to Skype using an email address, it cannot be linked anymore with your MSA.

            No - custom lists cannot be numeric (they can be mixed alpha-numeric, though). &nbsp;Excel has a variety of methods for autofilling with numbers... &nbsp;what is your list?

<h2>            VBA&#58; Need help rotating an object a specified amount</h2>
                    This follows on from a question about being able to rotate an object by a specified number of degrees, originally without using VBA, but one person suggested this should go in the VBA forums.&nbsp; I attempted to put something together, but it doesn't work
 very well.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macpowerpoint/in-powerpoint-2011-how-do-i-rotate-an-object-using/539da4c5-31fc-4066-9775-7d429d65bd2e?page=1&amp;tm=1325199963723#footer">Original Question</a><br />
<br />
I have had a go, but I am not able to get it doing exactly what I want.&nbsp; I can add the rotation with a specified number of degrees, but if it is the first animation, it appears as well as rotating.&nbsp; Once added, it is an entry-animation, and none of the parameters
 are adjustable, so I need something that also adds all the parameters.&nbsp; Anyone got some better code than this?&nbsp; At least it does work correctly for inserted pictures as well as shapes.<br />
<br />
If I try to add a spin, it sets it to 360˚, and I cannot seem to set that as anything else.<br />
<br />
Sub adddetailed()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim osld As Slide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim oshp As Shape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim cw As Boolean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim i As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rot1 As Single<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error Resume Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Err.Clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set osld = ActiveWindow.View.Slide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oshp = ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange(1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Err &lt;&gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Looks like no shape is selected!", vbCritical<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rot1 = InputBox("what rotation angle do you want to add? ")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With oshp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set effNew = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine.MainSequence _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .AddEffect(Shape:=oshp, effectId:=msoAnimEffectRotation)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set aniNew = effNew.Behaviors.Add(msoAnimTypeRotation)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With aniNew.RotationEffect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Rotate "rot1" degrees from current position<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .By = rot1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />

            The trouble is that you can do practically anything you can think of using VBA.
<br />
<br />
I ran your code and it works like a charm! Congratulations!<br />
<br />
In the Visual Basic Editor, on the Toolbar, click the Object Browser button. In the search field for the Object browser type the word Animation and you will find hundreds of animation controls to play with. Pasting one that looks interesting into a Google search
 along with the term vba will usually give you code samples and examples of how to use a command.<br />
<br />
You can generate your own version of the Reorder dialog by making a UserForm (In the VB Editor use Insert &gt; Userform). As you can already see, VBA gives you greater control over animation settings than the built-in dialog, so you can experiment with various
 controls to adjust input. <br />
<br />
You probably will enjoy trying things out before settling on a final version.<br />
