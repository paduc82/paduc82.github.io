<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get rid of that annoying&nbsp;little video window that pops up occasionally in the bottom-right corner of the screen?&nbsp; First, it would play an advertisement and then would go blank.&nbsp; I have to close the ie to get rid of it each and every time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have
 already tried anti -"<strong>everything,</strong>"&nbsp; including anti-virus, but, so far, no infection has been detected.</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint - move to new directory on your hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I got a new laptop with a limited SSD C: drive. &nbsp;When I installed my Office 365, I just accepted the defaults and both Sharepoint and OneDrive installed to my C: drive. &nbsp;Suddenly, my C: drive was out of space!! &nbsp;I found the article to move my OneDrive directory
 to the D: drive, but I can't find a similar discussion to move my Sharepoint settings. &nbsp;I would really hate to uninstall all of Office 365 if an easier method exists. &nbsp;With the new SSD drives out there, has anyone made this same mistake?</p>

    <title>Lumia 920 physical camera button not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicolassf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 920 physical camera button not working</h2>
                    
<p>Strange thing going on:</p>
<p>the physical camera button doesn't seem to trigger the camera anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot launch the camera app with&nbsp;it and it doesn't do anything when the camera app is running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was working since I got it and it&nbsp;just stopped working today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried soft reset and hard reset to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody has seen this? It seems suspiscious that it would be a hardware issue as I imagine those buttons are pretty reliable (for years of usage not days).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I diagnose this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

If you have tried the soft and hard resets then only other option is to take your phone to local Nokia Care point for them to inspect. to locate nearest Nokia Care:<br />

<p>To close on this:</p>
<p>I could never fully diagnose this (wish there was diagnostics available).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera key was not working and the flash was also not working (I only realized this later).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ended up swapping my phone and I have been a happy camper since then.</p>

<p>My experience with the Lumia 920:</p>
<p>March 7: purchased new 920 from Nokia DX</p>
<p><br />
March 20: screen freezing, blackouts, and strange performance from some apps (i.e. not working properly)</p>
<p><br />
March 21: reported to DX, they say "soft reset"</p>
<p><br />
March 27: (after many soft resets and removing some apps) phone still not working properly, hard reset</p>
<p>(note: hard reset is a painful process; aside from the fact that you don't actually know if it will work as many people came away with bricked phones trying it, even when it works, you have a lot of work to set it up again with your purchased apps, data,
 etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the hard reset, phone seemed to work for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 10: camera button won't open the camera, camera app itself won't open (both try to open and then return to Start screen), Heat 7 can't steer, Rotate to Landscape doesn't work, Brightness can't be set to auto-adjust (keeps returning to last setting),
 unit gets way too hot when wireless charging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 30: bring back to Nokia DX, they will only coordinate with Nokia Care, no exchange, no loaner, etc.</p>
<p>May 1: bring it to Nokia SM Megamall; they do the firmware/software resets, etc. ("which should fix all the problems"), but nothing works, need to send to Level 2 support to replace parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe, after 7 days, I will get back a p25,000 Lumia 920 that has been opened, probed, replaced parts, hopefully put back together again properly and hopefully works for the 2-3 yearsa that I had planned to use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To NOKIA: this should have been an immediate replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's hope these actually can be fixed and be dependable units afterward.</p>
<p>From a purchaser of a new Lumia 900, and recently a Lumia 920, Nokia may be right, #timetoswitch ??</p>

    <title>Emails with sensitivity set to Private visible for Delegates with Full - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marekhalfar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails with sensitivity set to Private visible for Delegates with Full Access permissions</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering how the sensitivity Private works when someone has Full Access to someone's mailbox. Imagine scenario when User2 has Full Access set to mailbox of User1. If someone sends an email to User1 with Private sensitivity should the User2 see that
 email when accessing User1's mailbox? </p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've seen it's not straightforward as in my tests such email was not visible if accessing User1 mailbox in Outlook client but such email was visible when accessing through OWA.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please clarify how this Full Access and Private sensitivity is related?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Table lines disappearing</h2>
                    <p>Recently had an issue when opening a DOCX file in Word 2003 with the Office 2007 compatibility pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file included many tables, and in some of them the cell borders disappeared. After some playing around I suspected that tracked changes might have been causing the problem. I opened the file in Word 2007 and accepted all changes. When I opened next in
 Word 2003 all was well.</p>

<p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be "well know" but I have never seen any discussions about that limitation anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in this case, accepting the tracked changes with the document open in Word 2003 didn't help. I had to open in 2007 and accept changes for the formatting to reappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I just posted this to make it easier for others in the same boat to find the solution.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I haven't searched recently, but there should be several threads in this forum that mention different formatting issues in conjunction with "unresolved" tracked changes. In that respect, it is clear that you have encountered a well-known limitation of the
 tracked changes feature.</p>

<h2>            VBA has become disabled - Excel features no longer avaialable - HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I know exactly what my problem is - VBA has become disabled, so when I run Excel, several Excel features are no longer available.</p>
<p>When I open an excel workbook, I get the message "this workbook has lost its VBA project, ActiveX controls and any other programmability features.</p>
<p>My issue is exactly that described in MS article ID 282847 revision 5.0.</p>
<p>Is it possible to re-enable VBA?</p>
<p>If so, how do I do that?</p>
<p>If not, is the solution to uninstall the whole Office Suite and reinstall it again?</p>
<p>I am running Office Home &amp; Student 2013 on a Surface Pro tablet.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>I am not sure about doing this on a Surface Pro, however, if you go to the Control Panel, if there is an Uninstall Program item and you click on the and then select Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2013 and there is a Change link above the list of programs
 and you click on that, there may be an Add or Remove Features item that you can select and then click on Continue and then expand the Office Shared Features item, you may see a Visual Basic for Applications item that you should set to be Run from My Computer.</p>

</p><p>Are you missing just some or all messages? </p>
<p>
</p><p>With classic Skype, if your contact deletes his/her message, it will also be deleted on your end. It is possible that the messages have been removed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are missing all messages, it is possible that you are logged in to the incorrect Skype account. You need to sign in to the right account to view the messages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly try signing in to <a href="https://web.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Marial,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John was replying to someone who had asked for help with PowerPoint for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have PowerPoint for Windows, so I split your inquiry off and moved it to a Windows 7 forum. We Mac geeks don't have much expertise on your platform, and the solutions for Mac users simply don't apply to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for any confusion, but if you add some additional information in a reply, such as what version of PowerPoint you have on what sort of hardware, I am sure someone who knows about Windows PowerPoint will come along and offer an assist.</p>

    <title>Multiple Hyperlinks in Email Signature - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cpongo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Hyperlinks in Email Signature</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create an email signature in <strong>Outlook 2016 </strong>that has an email hyperlink, a hyperlink to our website along with hyperlinks to our Facebook and Linkedin pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook will only allow me to have an email hyperlink along with one other hyperlink. So for example, I create a hyperlink on the facebook icon and copy the address for our Facebook page but then it overrides the previous hyperlink I have set up for our&nbsp;website.
 When I try to use the&nbsp;first hyperlink to our website it takes me to our Facebook page rather than the website. Furthermore, when I review the hyperlinks on the Facebook and Linkedin icons, and the website address they are all the same URL even though I entered
 the correct individual URLs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I only able to create one URL hyperlink in the Outlook email signature? Or is there a way that I can set up more than one link to websites?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

</p><p>My email signature was built in Word and then copied into the Outlook email signature editor. As you can see I have confirmed that the hyperlinks are associated with the correct sections before saving the email signature, but once the signature is applied
 and sent the links change and only direct you to our web address.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that make more sense?</p>

<h2>            Error 1026&#58; Specified string literal size exceeds maximum supported string literal size</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help with my issue. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I keep getting error 1026 "Specified string literal size exceeds maximum supported string literal size" on my 2011 MS Office for Mac in Outlook. &nbsp;I use MS Outlook as my main mail application and it syncs my outlook.com account. The below are my settings:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Incoming server: imap-mail.outlook.com :&nbsp; [993]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Override default port&nbsp; (selected)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use SSL to connect (selected)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always use secure port (not selected)<br />
<br />
Outgoing server: smtp-mail.outlook.com : [587]<br />
&nbsp; Override default port (selected)<br />
&nbsp; Use SSL to connect (selected)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My question is: how do I stop this error? &nbsp;It is not stopping me from sending/receiving emails or using Outlook in general but would like to stop this annoying error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for my lack of technical knowledge, but I think I had the same problem as you. After some investigating online, I tried a proposed solution that worked for me...:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the outlook tab/preferences/accounts - then delete your password</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close outlook, re-open outlook, insert password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That seems to have fixed it for me.</p>

            <p>Thanks to all who mentioned this fix. I couldn't figure out how to do the search in all mails, but did permanently delete the deleted folder, and that worked. I don't know why in this age of "intelligent" computers/software, they can't just point to the
 error...and even offer fixes! Thankfully there are good folks like you who have experienced errors and are willing to share your fixes...MUCH appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi RS1_919,</p>
<p>As of earlier this year, subsequent views from the same user will not increment the view count, so you can expect that the view count to be close to unique users.</p>
<p>

<p>In addition to the existing view count feature (which is available to all Sway users on each Sway tile on the My Sways page), Office 365 users can now access additional information about how their Sways are being viewed via the new Analytics tab on the My

    <title>Another New Version and Still Features lacking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jsurge1974  say:</h3>
<h2>            Another New Version and Still Features lacking</h2>
                    <p>So while I was away for a few days&nbsp; I was upgraded from version 12.1807.264 to a new version (12.1809.217).&nbsp; Still the feature of being able to sort my contacts by&nbsp; 'active' is absent.&nbsp; I along with many other users of this forum have complained about this
 feature lacking in any of the recent versions.&nbsp; I believe that if you were to go back months in the forum posts you would see that this feature is the one that most people want back.&nbsp; Every time the support staff say that they have forwarded this on to the
 developers.&nbsp; I am beginning to think the following..... either this isn't being passed on or the developers just don't give a care what the users want.&nbsp; Perhaps a page or something on the Skype Support Main page of 'features we are working on' would be a good
 customer service .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also... When you click on the 'About this App' and then the 'What's New' and then on the 'Read More'&nbsp; it does take you to a new page ( https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34685/what-s-new-in-skype-for-windows-10?platform=uwp&amp;setlang=en ) but this link and
 page is 2.5 months old and still lists version 12.13.217 as the most current version.&nbsp; Someone is falling asleep on the job and not doing their job of updating.&nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your feedback, along with others' have been noted. We already raised this feature of being able to sort contacts by "Active" status
<em>(Skype for Windows 10 v12.18)</em>, but do not have a time estimate of when will it be available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the "What's new in Skype for Windows 10" Help article, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will include this feedback of yours to&nbsp;our developers for them to update.</p>

    <title>Where does it get this font from &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronaldoonenil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where does it get this font from &#63;</h2>
                    In Access VBA I use the DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet etc. to export several queries to an .xlsx file or files. When you open the xlsx file or files after the export, they are always in MS Sans Serif font size 10. Where does it get this from ? It is not the
 default font/size for Excel or Access tables/queries. I have googled and searched for an answer to this but can't seem to find one.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The export wizard in access has an "Export data with formatting and layout" check box which keeps the .xlsx files in the correct font but there doesn't seem to be a VBA coding option for this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I even searched my windows registry to try and find where this font and size is held.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know I can use VBA to open the exported spreadsheet when export complete and format it how I want but I was just wondering if anyone knew why it picks MS Sans Serif size 10 or where this setting is held so I can change it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>You can set the font yourself after the export using Excel COM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a look at the code I have here on my website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.btabdevelopment.com/ts/default.aspx?PageId=110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.btabdevelopment.com/ts/default.aspx?PageId=110</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has an example of the code to do the formatting.&nbsp; You can run the Transferspreadsheet and not have it open, open it with code and not display it while it does its thing.&nbsp; Then make it visible when done.</p>

            Thanks for the response, but as I explained in the question, I can format the output using VBA as I am skilled in VBA coding but I wanted to know why TransferSpreadsheet picks MS Sans Serif size 10 as its font. Where does it get this setting from ?

<p><span><span>The Skype name is the
</span><span>username you created when you first joined Skype, other than your email address or phone number. If you are using an email address or phone number when signing in on Skype, then you have a default

<h2>            Office 2016 - Chinese Conversion Tool Crashes Software</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I decided to try using Microsoft Office 2016 and I am finding that when I try to use the Chinese Conversion Tool in Office 2016, it crashes the program. Conversion to Traditional as well as Conversion to Simplified do not work. It doesn't matter if it is
 in Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. I am not even able to access the Conversion Tool's Convert With Options menu as it just gives me the same issue. Has anyone else had this issue? I don't think this was a problem when I was using Office 2013. This is happening
 on a computer with Windows 10 (Office for Windows 10 Desktop), by the way.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not install any Chinese Language Packs prior to this. I did install the Chinese Traditional&nbsp;Language Accessory Pack as well as the Chinese Traditional Proofing Tools. These were programs that I had when I was using Office 2013. My issue is that I unfortunately
 am unable to even convert any text to Traditional or Simplified. Regardless of if I try to use the tool when there is no text or text in the document, the program crashes and restarts itself. I do have input methods for Chinese Traditional, but I doubt that
 this may be causing any issues? I have attempted to uninstall and reinstall Office 2016 using the Fix it tool, and it still gives the same problem. The same issue happens when I follow the steps to "Repair an Office application" via the Programs and Features
 menu of the Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know your thoughts at your earliest convenience! Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>Kinda reassuring to see that I am not the only one who is having this issue. Have you tried reinstalling your OS and making a clean install to try to solve this issue? I also thought this might be an issue of the software versions not matching up (x86 version
 tools being used with a x64 office suite), but I found the version of my copy of Microsoft Office 2016 to be the 32-bit version...</p>

    <title>Build 10130 Breaks Creative Sound Blaster - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> synchronous-failure  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10130 Breaks Creative Sound Blaster</h2>
                    <p>My Creative Sound Blaster ZxR was working just fine with practically every Windows 10 build I've ever tried -- until I updated to Build 10130. Now I have no sound and every time I try to test it via the Control Panel I get the error "Failed to play test
 tone." That said, the Device Manager shows absolutely no errors, the Creative software works just fine, and it is listed as my default device. The funny thing is when I select "listen to this device" for my microphone via the Sound Blaster Z-Series Control
 Panel I can hear my voice just fine, however I cannot do the same through the Windows Control Panel which means there's something wrong on the Windows end rather than the driver end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also specific to Creative. I installed the latest Realtek drivers for my onboard audio and they work perfectly fine at any setting. With the sound card I've tried changing the sample rate (24bit 48KHz to anything else) with no success, I've tried
 setting everything to default, tried disabling audio enhancements, I've played around with the number of speakers (5.1 to stereo), I've uninstalled three times and each time making sure absolutely no trace of Creative software was left on my PC (including
 via the device manager), I've made sure to turn off my internet connection before reinstalling just to mitigate the chance that Windows Update might be interfering with more bad generic drivers, I've run an sfc/scannow twice, I've tried compatibility mode,
 and then I tried some of the more esoteric solutions I found on the internet that involve registry changes (deleting hkey_local_machines\software\Microsoft\Ole\DefaultAccessPermission) and adding "Local Service" to the Administrators group. I also tried restarting
 Windows Audio via the Task Manager and a few other related services (like the Creative Audio Service). Lastly, I tried to install the generic Windows audio drivers for the ZxR and though I got no sound I was able to "test" the device and successfully see moving
 audio bars at a 16bit sample rate. But again, I got no sound and installing the actual drivers results in zero usability at any setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know Creative will be releasing their Windows 10 drivers for my device around July but the latest W8.1 version was working just fine prior to Build 10130. I hope there's a solution I can try right now, lest I have to wait for the next build update and
 suffer through onboard audio until then. I was stupid enough to accidentally run CCleaner (including the registry cleaner) without checking the settings in desperation and I accidentally deleted "previous versions of the Windows installation" so now I can't
 roll back the build update lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Ok, I was 100% certain I tried every speaker and sample rate setting but I might have accidentally missed the only one that worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Headphones now work on stereo (not 5.1) and 16 bit 96000 Hz. But that still means I lose out on surround sound, which is unacceptable for me.<br />
</p>
<p>In my defense, switching the sample rates seems to be somewhat hit or miss. When initially setting the headphones to 16 bit 96000 Hz and 2.0 config it would show that sound was playing but I wouldn't hear anything until I set it to a different setting and
 back again -- hence why I might have missed it. My theory is that the Sound Blaster drivers automatically set the Windows sound configuration to 5.1 at different intervals and you need to manually switch it every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is still a really weird issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm glad you were able to dig your way through to working audio, and I'm sorry we broke it in 10130. Here's what's going on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a bug in the audio stack that causes stream initialization to fail on a very specific cross-section of configurations. As you've discovered, changing the sampling rate fixes it, though not the same sampling rate works on every config (Conexant seems
 to like 192 KHz, for example). It's not a driver issue, it's really a core Windows audio stack problem. We think we've figured it out and should have a fix in the next flight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the troubleshooter not working, we're also aware of that. It wouldn't have helped you in this case, but until the next flight you can manually run the audio troubleshooter with this command (from an elevated command prompt):</p>

<h2>            External Sharing automatically adds user to tenant root site collection</h2>
                    
<p>I have O365 tenant site say <a href="http://xyz.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xyz.com</a>.</p>
<p>I have many site collection under it. I shared one of the site collection for eg.
<a href="http://xyz.com/sites/abc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xyz.com/sites/abc</a>&nbsp;to external user with microsoft account using External Sharing feature.</p>
<p>When I see through my tenant Admin screen &gt; External Sharing &gt; Sites &nbsp;I found that the external user is also added to my base site collection&nbsp;<a href="http://xyz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xyz.com</a>&nbsp;and can access all the content in the same.</p>
<p>Is this a bug in O365 as it should not allow external user to access the root site collection contents, when the shared site is some other site collection in the tenant.</p>
<p>Kindly update?</p>

<p>hi kundal,<br />
<br />
regarding the situation, i suggest you check the sharing setting for the root site collection.<br />
<br />
1. open the root site collection, then click <strong>share</strong> on the ribbon.<br />
2. click <strong>shared with</strong>, and check if <strong>everyone</strong> is listed.<br />
<br />
if so, we need to remove it. click <strong>advanced</strong>, then click <strong>
check permissions</strong> to find the group everyone is belonged to. then open the group, and remove it.<br />
<br />
if not listed, please check the permission of the external user for the root site collection, and provide the screenshot for our investigation.<br />
to upload a screenshot, click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> just under the textbox, then click this icon<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7636329e-061a-4b48-a724-a07988945286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7636329e-061a-4b48-a724-a07988945286" /></a>
 to insert images.<br />
<br />
in addition, could you confirm if you have removed the external user from <strong>
both</strong> the root site collection <a href="http://xyz.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xyz.com</a> and the site collection
<a href="http://xyz.com/sites/abc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xyz.com/sites/abc</a> in <strong>step 2</strong>? go to
<strong>office 365 admin center &gt; external sharing &gt; sites</strong>, select the root site collection and click
<strong>manage external users for this site</strong>.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

            Hi Ran,<br />
<br />
While collecting the file, I'd double confirm if the site is deleted rather than changed URL. Please also try the following steps:<br />
Go to the related group in OWA &gt; Click Files tab &gt; Check if you can find the files there and create/upload new files.<br />
&nbsp;If so, click Browse library button on the right cornor, see if you can browse to that site.<br />
&nbsp;If not, please share a related screenshot.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jim
