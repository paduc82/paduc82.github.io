<h2>            WIndows thinks I have a windows to go install, but I don&#39;t&#33;</h2>
                    This is apparently causing it to have problems when restarting.&nbsp; It also makes the windows store inaccessible.&nbsp; Is there someplace that this setting is specified?&nbsp; A registry entry or something?
<br />
<br />
Often I get the warning on startup:<br />
<br />
Keep the USB drive in until windows finishes shutting down.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Usually after windows has failed to start several times.&nbsp; Sometimes windows freezes, or doesn't shut down correctly.&nbsp; Then it often takes several tries to get started again--it will freeze halfway through startup.<br />
<br />
I installed a full regular version of windows 8 pro from DVD in the normal fashion, and it has been properly activated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h3> craigye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem connecting KVM switch</h2>
                    I am using a KVM switch for 2 computers.&nbsp; One is a Pc and the other is laptop with a docking station.&nbsp; When i try to connect to the laptop it causes the setup to keep toggling between the two displays.&nbsp; It will auto switch to extended desktop and show
 both displays and then after a few seconds will switch back to single display, and this just keeps going and going.&nbsp; Is there any reason for this to occur and what is the fix?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It&nbsp;might be a problem with the KVM switch itself, I would suggest you to check if the switch is proper by checking betwen 2 different computers.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to &nbsp;to check and make sure all hardware connections are proper.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also contact device manufacturer for better assistance.<br />

            The issue was caused by the KVM switch you have. <br />
There are many KVM switches based on different levels of technologies. <br />
<br />
Your KVM switch did not provide Full-time DDC/EDID communication between connected PCs/ Laptop and shared display monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Pleas find KVM switches support Full-time DDC/EDID. <br />

            The issue is with the KVM Switch you are using. You might want to check if scan mode is enabled. Your best bet is to get support from the manufacturer. I use KVM Switch solutions for installation and I would recommend checking KVMSwitchTech's Cat5 KVM
 Switch products for future use. I have bought several units from them and they work great.

<h2>            Console&#47;TV A&#47;V settings help.</h2>
                    
<p>First off I do understand this is a crazy topic. My head is spinning from all the different forums and websites and dissimilar facts. I would just like to ask a few questions to straighten things up, please dont bite my head off. I have a Sony W600B it does
 support Full RGB, and deep color. I just bought this tv and when I set the console to PC RGB(Full) and my TV to full I went into the calibrate TV and the closed eye was not visible at all, no matter the brightness. Is that ok, or should I go back to limited.
 Also I understand not much content has deep color but since my TV supports, should I enable it? Right now I have my TV set to game original ( all advanced image enhancers off, warm1) and I went through the calibrate TV under limited for the time being just
 to see how the TV performs. Thank you very much!</p>

<p>Hi Cybershot! You're right, this topic is nutty and has a lot of conflicting info! First, RGB Full and Limited are HORRIBLY named. :-) You would think you always want the "full" range of info. However, a TV receiving a game console, blu-ray or cable box
 input should always be set to RGB Limited. (Don't worry, you're not sacrificing anything by setting to limited, and actually, it gives a better picture.</p>
<p>Typically, the RGB Full setting is used with PCs, which display a full color range of 0-255. Even though most HDTVs are compatible with RGB full, they only do that for calibration purposes to make black level easier to calibrate, but it is misleading because
 most video sources don't supply content in the 0-15 (blacker than black) or 236-255 (whiter than white.) What happens is, when you set the TV (and Xbox) to limited, it converts the 0-15 range up to 16 and the 236-255 down to 235. If the TV can't do this (i.e.
 when it's set to Full) then shadows and highlights lose a LOT of detail, appearing more stark white or black (as in the example of the calibration eye not appearing.)</p>
<p>FYI, to make this MORE confusing, the opposite is true for PC monitors; if you use one of those, the console should be set to full. :-)</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>That sort of cleared things up alittle. I did try the standard game original settings with both the console and TV set to full and Battlefront looked better than ever. I will try both on limited and see what that brings. Thank you</p>

<p>I tried to edit last post. When the console is set to standard and TV to full the picture is washed. When the TV is set to limited and the console set to full it is a vibrant picture but alittle too dark. Now I'm still switching between both full and both
 limited to see what looks best</p>

<p>Sounds good, let me know how it turns out! You definitely do want both to match, full-full or limited-limited. Limited on both should look better, but it basically boils down to what "looks" best; every eye is different!</p>

<p>Thank you very much. You have been a big help. It is very misleading I think FULL range would be better knowing my TV supports it and I get the entire range. How I am understanding it, most content isnt in the 0-255, so having both set to full defeats the
 purpose right? So why have the option on the XBOX anyways?</p>

<p>That's a great question, and there's actually a 2-part reason. The first is that PC Monitors are designed to display the full 0-255 color gamut, so, if you set your xbox to limited while on a pc monitor, the shadows &amp; highlights will be dull and grayed.</p>
<p>The other reason is that even though developers use dev consoles to design, much of the coding is done on PCs and even the dev consoles are connected to PC monitors. So, in an odd quirk, the games are programmed on a full 0-255 scale, even though most people
 will play on HDTVs, which are native to 16-235 (limited.)</p>

<p>Just an information, when you download files from online, they go directly to your hard drive. This happens when you download Steam games. When you said "<strong>I cannot figure out how to Save steam games, or any downloaded files to my hard drive</strong>"
 does this mean that you want to save files into different location?</p>

            Yes that is what i mean. They directly save to a storage called "Local disk (C:)" and it only has like 280GB. I want to save it to the one that is called "New Volume(D:)" because that one has 2 TB.

<h2>            Is Windows Live Mail compatible with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 appears to be incompatible with Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;Upgraded yesterday and it refuses to synch with Comcast server. &nbsp;All settings have been checked, tried every possible port, matched exact settings to my other machine that is still on Windows
 8.1, have deleted account in the Windows 10 mail app, ..... nothing allows it to work. &nbsp;Call to help desk first line rep could not even tell me if it is compatible and after an hour on hold have given up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Windows Live Mail 2012 works well on Windows 10 in my 48-hour experience, so there is something else at play here.

            <p>My Win Live Mail also stopped responding correctly after upgrading to Win 10. It boots properly, no lost data and appears normal to that point. Once loaded it checks for&nbsp;new mails&nbsp;on 3 accounts. It connects, checks each one&nbsp;and then the error code appears.
 I have tried several fixes that were recommended by community members but to no avail. I have also checked for answers to the specific error code and&nbsp;any that have to do with Live Mail have gone unanswered, some since 2012. I have&nbsp;posted on 2 separate sites
 but have not as yet received a reply. The error message is as such:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Server: 'plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com'</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800C013E</span></p>
<p><span>Protocol: POP3</span></p>
<p><span>Port: 995</span></p>
<p><span>Secure(SSL): Yes</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It will send from all the accounts, checked in with my server to see if they were sent and received. Although this is only one of just a very few issues with Win 10 it is the most important of all. The rest I can blindly wander through and correct.</span></p>
<p><span>I have not deleted but did reload Essentials. I have information in the folders&nbsp;that I didn't wish to lose. Maybe will have to risk it and try that.</span></p>
<p><span>The included mail program with Win 10 is a sucky little creature that has few options and is time consuming in removing deleted content.</span></p>
<p><span>I do realize that discussion threads may not be the preferred way to go but there is little help in the question and answer section.</span></p>
<p>If you have any suggestion other than the question and answer section please advise, thank you for any assistance you may be able to render.</p>

            <p>I 'upgraded' from 8.1 to 10 on the 1st August and have been trying to sync Mail and Outlook 2013 since then without success. Unfortunately, any request for help from the Windows or Office team resulted in being put on hold for an indefinite period ( nearly
 an hour last time I tried). So, it seems that MS haven't yet got to the bottom of this glitch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone has had any luck with this problem, I'd be glad to hear about it.</p>

            Thanks for the idea, tried it and got the same error codes again. It may be a moot point now, I have uninstalled Win Live and now it will not reinstall. Guess I will have to find a decent e-mail program or live with the Win 10 excuse of one.

            <p>Thanks K for your tip. </p>
<p>On the task bar of Windows 8.1 was Mail (not Hotmail) with an envelope symbol. I could get my emails by using this. Mail in this form is also available in Windows 10 but will not sync (I assume with Outlook). I can get my emails by going straight to Outlook,
 which makes me wonder, what's the benefit of having the Mail facility? If there's no real benefit, I'll not waste anymore time trying to sync it. Any ideas on this?</p>

 <p>Every profile takes up server space,which costs money.</p></blockquote>&nbsp;<p /><p>That's not very good reasoning when a&nbsp;single profile would end up costing something like $0.0000007 per year for the server space. Changing the name associated with a tag does not make any difference in the amount of space it consumes, unless the new name happens be longer but even then it's a couple of bytes.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p /><blockquote>&nbsp;<p /><p>If gamertag changes were free then nearly everyone would just be changing their tags willy nilly.</p><p>

            The idea that it "costs them money" to change your username is ridiculous. What they should do is allow a free username change every 90 days or something similar then allow people to change their username as many times as they want for a $10 fee. This
 would keep people from abusing it but also give people the flexibility they've been asking for over 10 years. Why they don't allow that already just shows the kind of company they are. Purposely restricting a feature that almost any service in 2019 allows
 you to do for free just to make money because they can. That's just part of the reason why I switched to PC and never looked back.

    <title>START menu says not enough room. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zack s. mitchell  say:</h3>
<h2>            START menu says not enough room.</h2>
                    When I click START it says "There is not enough room to show all the items you have added to the start menu..." and goes on to suggest deleting some, etc. There is plenty of space left and no matter what I do, or how many I delete I still get this message.
 What is causing this?

Tricky -- Thank you for all your attention and help for my START menu problem. I got lucky yesterday and the problem is now gone. Previously when I tried what its msg asked (that is, getting rid of some of the menu items) the items I deleted were in the lower
 sections of the menu. This time, I removed just one item from the TOP LEFT section of the menu and now the msg ("Not enough room," etc.) no longer appears! It could be that it had to be deleted from that section, but maybe it was just "the straw that broke
 the camel's back."&nbsp;

<h2>            Arc Touch Bluetooth Mouse - Not turning on. Changed bateries and still no life</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro and until today was using it perfectly with the Arc Touch Bluetooth Mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it didn't connect I assumed its&nbsp; batteries were dead, I then changed them and still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Physically rotating the batteries just to rule out bad connection has also failed to make it turn on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No blue light.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched online for a way to troubleshoot this or why it would happen but can not see a similar issue. there is no problem with pairing... as it doesn't turn on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no noticeable damage and everything 'clicks' correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempted to contact Microsoft it directed me to phone them... im in UK and their number is USA, so I would rather not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gard</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's help you get the situation sorted out. For Microsoft Surface Arc Mouse, you need to flatten it and re-arch it again to turn the power on and off. If that doesn’t work, that means the batteries are low and need to be replaced or recharged. However,
 since you already mentioned that you already replaced the batteries and issue is still the same, then we recommend contacting
<strong>Microsoft Support</strong> <strong>UK </strong>by calling <em><strong><span>(0)344 800 2400</span></strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, kindly let us know by replying to this thread. We'll be notified and respond to you as soon as we can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

It is too sensitive and every time I go to click the button it moves over a little and it does not click.&nbsp; It takes me several tries to get it to click and it is very hard to press compared to the IBM Thinkpad.<br />

    <title>Cannot install Security Update for Windows 8 &#40;KB2909210&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattomic13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install Security Update for Windows 8 &#40;KB2909210&#41;</h2>
                    I have tried dozens of times to install the latest Windows 8 updates to my computer and to no avail. My computer refuses to install them with the automated Windows Update. Every time I try, I get a message that says, "No updates available," with a green
 bar on the side, as if everything's OK.<br />
NEXT, the Windows Update window refreshes and once again I get a yellow shield, exclamation point in the middle, and a message that says that I still have 38 important updates to install and 2 optional.
<br />
<br />
So then I decide that fine, since this <b>refuses </b>to work, why don't I go to the Download Center and try installing each patch or update individually and manually. For example, I went to the manual download page for the Security Update in the title of this
 message, KB2909210 - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41800</a>. I select English and click 'Download' as instructed. A new window opens (I'm using Firefox) and it asks me if I would like to open the file with the Windows Update Standalone Installer (default)
 or save the file. Whether I choose to open the file directly from this point or save it first and then open it with the WUSI, I get a new message, giant red 'X' prominently displayed, that says "Windows Update Standalone Installer" in large blue text, beneath
 that, "The update is not applicable to your computer." <br />
<br />
BALONEY! This specific update was listed when I tried to use the automated Windows Update feature from the Control Panel. As I said earlier, I tried repeatedly to install it through that route, but it refused to install. The manual route through the Download
 Center equally fails. Apparently, there are security updates back to 2012 (!) that haven't and will not install.
<br />
<br />
Help! I already did a system restore over a month ago after my hard drive got corrupted. I then performed a system reset to start over from scratch with what I thought would be a totally clean machine. Now it looks like my hard drive is irreparably corrupted.
 Hence, Windows refuses to update properly and patch up many, many vulnerabilities and security holes. I'm tired of this. Help me make my computer secure and trustworthy again!<br />

<p>Windows Update corruption errors prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing.
</p>
<div>
<div>
<br />
<div>To resolve this problem, use the inbox Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. Then, install the Windows update or service pack again.
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<b>Search</b>. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click
<b>Search</b>. Type <span>Command Prompt</span> in the <b>Search</b> box, right-click
<b>Command Prompt</b>, and then click <b>Run as administrator</b>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<b>Allow</b>.</li><li>Type the following commands. Press <span>Enter </span>after each command.<br />
<b>Note</b> It may take several minutes for each command operation to be completed.
<ul>
<li>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</li><li>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</li></ul>
<br />
</li><li>Close the command prompt, and then run <strong>Windows Update</strong> again.</li></ol>
DISM creates a log file (%windir%/Logs/CBS/CBS.log) that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. %windir% is the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, the %windir% folder is C:\Windows.</div>

            Maybe one day.....You never know. They did it with apps when they had no paywall on other consoles so maybe they will do it with free to play games like everyone else does. It would be a push of a button to make it happen.

            Some apps you can use without Gold. Gold was basically created to be able to play online with your friends. Yes, it would be cool to not need gold to play online, but unfortunately, that won't change.&nbsp;

<p>while it would be nice to have free 2 play games not needing a gold membership, Unfortunately this is something that will never happen as you are still using the xbox live servers which cost a lot to keep running and maintain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also once a F2P game is made so gold is not required then theres nothing stopping other paid for games to start requesting the exact same perks for their games.</p>

            In my opinion the membership is a small price to pay for a service that offers quality. Other platforms might seem cheaper yet their service is in proportion with the price you pay. &nbsp;

            You can always join Microsoft Rewards and earn points by doing daily tasks, web searches using Bing and the odd quiz. This earsn points that can then be redeemed for Xbox Live Gold, Game Pass and many other things too. It costs absolutely nothing. There
 is also a Microsoft Rewards app for your Xbox, so you can pick up even more points. In a 6 month period, I earned enogh points to add 15 months of Xbox Live Gold to my account at no cost to me.

<h2>            Error messages in TEMP files every 7 minutes Error code&#58; 0x80041014.</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roughly every 7 minutes there is a new file created in Windows\Temp named something similar to cliEF78.tmp. The name changes slightly each time. The contents are always the same:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ERROR: A critical error occured while converting genuine authorization tickets on disk licenses.<br />
Error code: 0x80041014.<br />
ERROR: Failed! Error 0x!08X.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, Win 10 says it is activated and M'soft Office is activated, so what can be causing all these files and how do I stop it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>~Bob</p>

<h2>            Vista Ultimate - Install.wim</h2>
                    
<p>Installation of Vista Ultimate produces this error:<br />
Windows cannot open the required file C:\Vista\Sources\Install.wim. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code: 0x8007000B<br />
<br />
Also, my error log produces this error:<br />
Error [0x0603dc] IBS SelectImages: Failed to retrieve the WIM files's XML info; status 0x8007000b[gle=0x0000000b]<br />
<br />
The file install.wim is taken from an installation disc and placed on a web server for distribution and download. This is done in accordance to the Microsoft Campus Agreement in which my university participates.&nbsp; The install.wim file works fine when used directly
 from the disk, but when the file is placed on the server and is downloaded, then the above errors occur.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>When was sound from inbuilt speaker working fine on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you see a red X on the speaker icon on the taskbar?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you remember setting up headphone or speaker as the default sound device?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To work with this issue, I would suggest you to follow these methods. </span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Go to <strong>Start</strong> and click on
<strong>control Panel</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click in <strong>
Sound</strong>, then a new window will open up.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In the new windows click on the tab "<strong>Playback</strong>" and right click in the window and click on
<strong>Show Disabled devices</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now check if <strong>Speakers</strong> is listed there.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select and right click on ‘<strong>speakers’</strong> and select ‘<strong>Properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In ‘<strong>General'</strong> tab drop down,&nbsp;go to&nbsp;option under ‘<strong>device usage’</strong> and select the option
<strong>‘use this device (enable).</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on ‘<strong>Apply’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>h)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on ‘<strong>OK’</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If there are more than one speaker options, select the option “<strong>set default</strong>” for the preferred speaker.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
