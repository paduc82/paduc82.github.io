<h2>            Wifi connectivity problems</h2>
                    hi I am using a Lenovo g580 and have windows 10 build 10130 &nbsp;installed on it I have had wifi problems on windows since the first build release in October but not as severe as this. every 10 to 20 minutes the wifi stops working and when I turn wifi on and
 off it doesn't fix it like it did in previous build. I use to have to turn wifi on and off maybe every few hours or so or less . Please fix wifi. I have read the know issue sections but this bug has been present for a long time just not this severe.

            <p>Over the weekend I spent way too much time fiddling around with wifi.&nbsp;&nbsp; Constantly rebooting wifi access point or modem/router.. or unplugging them..&nbsp; reconfiguring them... etc. etc&nbsp; trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>USA&nbsp;&nbsp; ATM DSL Westell&nbsp;modem/router seemed to be the culprit.&nbsp; Replaced it about 7 hours ago and not a yellow&nbsp;sliver seen in my slice of wifi connectoid pie since.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The router was often showing two ip's for my laptop..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have A/G N .. and both get used
 but not usually separate IP.&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow that&nbsp;seems to have been&nbsp;my problem..&nbsp; The modem/router is the DHCP server and supplying too many IP's to one laptop somehow for some reason...&nbsp;... after a while it clogs up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appears that way anyhow.&nbsp;&nbsp; I may discover
 that wasn't it.&nbsp; But for right now its got an old wifi/modem/router supplying my dhcp through a Asus AP.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if Win10 Preview stuff is somehow causing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; its only started happening here with 10130...&nbsp;&nbsp; works a while then when I turn my back.. it was broken connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; Connect to wifi access point just fine but not connect to the modem/router.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow I'm still in wait see mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; but the modem/router was screwing up with too many lan ip for 'some reason'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoping the new/used one stays clean.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 630 bugs</h2>

1. The folders of WhatsApp photos are not showing in the photos section. Though the WhatsApp photos are in the picture folder in sd card. They are not showing in all photos also.<br />
2. Not even a single song is showing in music section . But other third party software are showing them.<br />
3. The .xap files are not showing in store . In the install local app section only few software are showing but i have many other .xap files also.<br />
4. While calling with headphone plugged in i could not able to change the volume of headphones. It's always remain on full volume.<br />
<br />
Please help me to solve these problems. I am facing many problems. And its disappointing me. During first 2/3 months it was going ask right and none of these problems were there.<br />
Please please help me to drive these problems. I have already tried hard reset many times but after 2/3 days it again showed the same problem. Please tell me is there any way to backup all downloaded apps so that i can try a hard reset.

<p>OK, taking them one at a time.</p>
<p>1. Due to the security designs within the O/S, applications are not allowed to see each other's storage areas.&nbsp; Each app is 'sandboxed' to their own operating portion of memory and management of their own files, etc. within that storage area.&nbsp; (i.e. there
 is no c: drive or public folders where they can store stuff anyone can use).&nbsp; Hence, the pictures in WhatsApp have to be managed by WhatsApp within it's own area.&nbsp; There are
<em>some</em> exceptions to the rule, which MS has provided for camera apps, Office files, etc. but these are specific.</p>
<p>2. The same is true for music files -- depending upon where you are getting them from.&nbsp; The app you are using only has access to its own storage -- not to the overall Music Hub folders.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I'm not sure what you mean by "...the .xap files are not showing up in the Store".&nbsp; The Store has apps for sale/download which are essentially .xap files but you request the app via its name, not the specific .xap file.</p>
<p>4. This sounds like a hardware problem with the volume control buttons.&nbsp; Or possibly a problem with a specific app.&nbsp; Can you change the volume of notification sounds, etc.?&nbsp; what about call volume through the headphones?&nbsp; This might be solved by a hard reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Thanks for your reply. For the music section problem i just did what it is given in Lumia help + tips that i can connect the mobile with a data a cable and directly transfer my songs from pc. But artist they show in music but after 1/2 hours they automatically
 vanishes from music section and it shows that "is lonely here . Add some music.".<br />
2. I mean to say that if i downloaded an app via PC then its downloaded as .xap first (suppose i downloaded angry birds from windows store via pc then it showed like angryburds.xap") and then transfer it to my phone then i should able to install it from store
 where an option is there "install local apps". But i downloaded more then 10apps from windows store via pc and transferred it to my phone but only 4/5apps are shown in install local app section. Why not the others??<br />
3. I don't think its a hardware problem cause the volume buttons are working well and i can also change volumes of other notifications or ringer. Even while listening to music with headphone i can change the volume. The problem arrives only during phone calls
 while headphone is plugged in. Without headphone i can change the volumes. But only during headphone plugged in whenever i change the volume UT doesn't respond. It showed that it's minimizing but doesn't minimize.

<p>Hi &nbsp;,</p>
<p>Most of the trouble can be explained by a corrupted or failing SD memory card.</p>
<p>The disappearing music files and the missing installer files is&nbsp;particularly worrying.</p>
<p>- Please confirm if you use a memory card for storage of music and other files?</p>

<p>Memory cards do wear out over time. Since you already tried formatting and still have issues, the next troubleshooting step is to replace the SD card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows Phone it is in my opinion best to keep the SD memory card in the phone at all times. Swapping the card between a PC card reader and the phone, or between different phones and other devices, could easily cause trouble.</p>
<p>The phone is able to perform a correct formatting of the SD card if needed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;,</p>
<p>The phone must be otherwise stable before starting specific troubleshooting on the headphone volume. Hanging or stalling in other processes&nbsp;on the phone caused by the memory card issues could make the phone unresponsive when trying to adjust the volume.</p>
<p>Also, from your previous posts, there has been several issues using headsets on your phone. Was it ever inspected and/or repaired by an official care point?</p>

<p>Please explain in more detail, is the audio missing in the earpiece, when on loudspeaker, or when using headphones?</p>
<p>Try all 3 options, and remember that the volume for phone calls is adjusted during the call. The first press brings up the banner at the top of the screen, it takes more presses to actually adjust the volume.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi George</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean the final version, this date has not been announced yet. The only information that Microsoft has released states an 'early fall' rollout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the 'free' versions are concerned, users who upgrade from Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are eligible. Nothing about others who are using the preview.</p>
<p>

            You will need to use Access 2010 or 2007 to convert them to accdbs. Once there you can use 2016 to convert to current format.

<p>This can be done with Access 2000-2003.</p>

            <p>Hello Gregg,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting.</p>
<p>As you want to become an administrator of the group kindly let me know you are using yammer free basic or yammer standalone enterprise network or yammer enterprise associated with office 365 network.</p>
<p><span><span>If </span></span><span>your network is free or basic and therefore it does not have a Verified Admin at the moment. Here are your options to attempt to manage the group:</span><span><br />
<span>Click the Ellipsis (...) and select groups -. Click All groups -&gt; Look for the group and join the group. If there is an option to become an admin in the upper right hand side of the page, click it for you to become an Admin of
 the group. </span></span></p>
<p>But I would like to inform you if you using or yammer enterprise associated with office 365 network than verified admin of yammer network then after joining the group you will become the group administrator if the group is public and open group.</p>
<p><span>You can delete the group by following below steps and can try to recreate the group.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Login into yammer as a verified admin</li><li>Click on gear box icon setting left bottom of screen</li><li>Click on network admin</li><li>Select Content Mode &gt; Private content mode. (Burt default mode is recommended)</li><li>Access to the desired group.</li><li><span>Please click on the gear symbol (settings symbol) at the top right corner of the Group's page</span></li><li><span>Now there is option Delete this group.</span></li><li><span>Or you can change group name add image, add group description, add or remove members.</span></li></ol>
<p>

            <p>Hi Sushil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; So we are using the Enterprise 365 version.&nbsp; I don't really want to delete the group since it has members already.&nbsp; I just want to be able to administer to the group.&nbsp; I'm not real clear on the instructions you've written about the
 Enterprise 365 version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>"But I would like to inform you if you using or yammer enterprise associated with office 365 network than verified admin of yammer network then after joining the group you will become the group administrator if the group is public and open group."&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you clarify?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much for the help Sushil!</p>

<li><span>Public groups<strong> </strong>mean anyone in the network can view content and participate in the group activity.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>By using private groups<strong>,</strong> you can limit membership and participation to invitation or approval only from group administrators. You can hide private groups from the group’s directory.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Suppose there is a group in your yammer network and that group type is public and open.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When you will join that group and if you are a verified admin of the yammer home network then you will become the group administrator automatically.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Verified admins also have access to these options for all groups. Network admins have access to these options for public groups, but can only access the private groups they belong to. You can access these options by navigating
 to any group page and clicking<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Settings<span>, located on the top‐right of the page.</span></li></ul>

            Hi Hetti,
<div>Thanks for the response, however the process you suggest won't work as the browser version (IE 6.0) on the re-imaged laptop can't log on to the update site to download anything..</div>
<div><br />
<div>I resolved the problem by using a second machine to download Service Pack 3.0, copying the file across to the laptop using a USB drive then running the executable on the laptop. &nbsp;That updated the OEM image to SP3.0 and "Bingo" I was then able to connect
 the updated laptop to the MS Update site and continue the update process.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks &nbsp;for the reply, hope my experience can help others. &nbsp;PK</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Preview 14367 -- reboot loop then restoring your previous windows version.</h2>
                    <p>This issue occured on tons of Microsoft Insider updates. On top of that I don't get other updates if I have insider builds on, and it doesn't let me fully turn them off, it only lets me stop receiving insider builds and start receiving again in 5 days?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Configuring updates for Windows 10 ..81% complete..</p>
<p>then eventually it shows my BIOS or whatever that first black screen when the computer starts up ... and it goes to restoring your previous version of windows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to debug the windowsupdate log, but it shows GUID errors aka missing symbols I even tried decrypting the symbols etc... downloading the latest symbols pack and all that but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas..</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>so I used the MediaCreationTool.exe file which basically lets you update windows without losing your files an alternative way.</p>
<p>Windows update itself doesn't really let you see the log, but this tool gave me an error message this time.</p>
<p>We couldn't install windows 10 the installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during the BOOT operation 0xC1900101 - 0x40017</p>
<p><strong>Update: Progress. Disabling Ethernet/Wifi + removing all VPN software, antivirus, malwarebytes, etc... I had a LOT of those. All packet sniffing software like wireshark, just to be on the safe side I removed I then got this error</strong></p>
0x8007002C - 0x4000D

<p>Wow 30GB+ ...OMG... &nbsp; Thank-you! that may very well be the reason. Mine had 17.8GB free ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>to clarify this is an update from current insider build 10547</p>
<p>I am guessing by clean install of public build you mean, on a blank hard drive, or something like a fresh install. I am doing more of a windows update type of thing, as I have a lot of files and can't back up and completely wipe and rather not go that route.</p>

            Thanks for your response, I think I am doing more of an upgrade type of thing , I am not sure what you mean by clean install, but I definitely don't want to format my hard drive just to get the latest OS rather go the update route.

            In this situation, you can't, because all the headings appear to be at the same level. If 3.0 and 4.0 were at Level 1 and 3.1, 3.2, etc., at Level 2, you could right-click and select
<strong>Show Heading Levels |&nbsp;Show Heading 1</strong>. In order to be able to do what you ask, you need to redo your multilevel list with the headings at different levels. See

<h2>            Windows7 and Office 2000 compatibility</h2>
                    <p>I bought a lap top 2 years ago which ran Windows 7. I installed my copy of Office 2000 Professional and I have been able to use Word, Excel and Publisher with no problems. I now find that various documents saved using these programmes will no longer open.
 I uninstalled Office 2000 and reinstalled it from the original discs but still can't open the documents. Is it possible that a recent upgrade to Windows 7 has rendered Office 2000 incompatible? How can I open my documents? hope you can help.</p>

    <title>INDEX and MATCH and Automatic 12 month data table. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            INDEX and MATCH and Automatic 12 month data table.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time ago I required a data set that grabbed data from another excel sheet so that my graphs for the end of the month would automatically change for the new month, as it grabbed data from this data set. Someone on the forum showed me a INDEX and MATCH
 formula which worked a charm....until the data for the month of January, it came up with #REF!. Please see pictures for a better understanding. I am not sure why it is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the formulas:</p>
<p>Date in 1L December is: =EDATE(EOMONTH(TODAY(),-2)+1,COLUMN(K$1:K$9)-12)</p>
<p>Date in 1M January is: =EDATE(EOMONTH(TODAY(),-2)+1,COLUMN(L$1:L$9)-12)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Data for L2 December is: =INDEX('Project Statistics'!$B$18:$Y$26,MATCH($A2,'Project Statistics'!$A$18:$A$26,0),MATCH(L$1,'Project Statistics'!$B$1:$AK$1,0))</p>
<p>Data for M2 January is:&nbsp;&nbsp; =INDEX('Project Statistics'!$B$18:$Y$26,MATCH($A2,'Project Statistics'!$A$18:$A$26,0),MATCH(M$1,'Project Statistics'!$B$1:$AK$1,0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unsure why it won't pick up the data from my first sheet...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated, thanks.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7764688-96d4-4b60-adf6-751eb7bc7b96" /></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I believe the issue is your range of Index formula (=<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">INDEX('Project Statistics'!$B$18:$Y$26)&nbsp;</span> is to be extended. What happened, Y1 in your project Statistics is Dec-14 and Z1 is Jan-15 thats why
 its showing #REF error. If you see 3rd part of your formula the range is (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MATCH(L$1,'Project Statistics'!$B$1:$AK$1,0) where its refering till
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">$AK$1</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So change your formula at L2 to,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">=INDEX('Project Statistics'!$B$18:$AK$26,MATCH($A2,'Project Statistics'!$A$18:$A$26,0),MATCH(L$1,'Project Statistics'!$B$1:$AK$1,0))</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Another way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the cells with the numbers, then click Data &gt; Text to Columns. Select "Fixed Width" and Next. In this screen click between each of the numbers to place a dividing line after each digit, then click Finish.</p>

<p>Here is the documentation about turning numbers into words with VBA:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/213360/how-to-convert-a-numeric-value-into-english-words-in-excel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/213360/how-to-convert-a-numeric-value-into-english-words-in-excel</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use VBA to split the number into its digits, then run the SpellNumber VBA across each resulting digit and write the result back into one cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bit of coding work and you would need some basic understanding of VBA in order to understand the approach and be able to maintain it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link above will give you the core functionality to do that.</p>

<p>Hi kingson,<br />
<br />
There is no logical relationship between the new public site hosted in GoDaddy or WIX in Office 365 and the SharePoint Online collaboration sites and other Office 365 components.<br />
<br />
For the second question, the answer is yes. Microsoft provides <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/api/api-catalog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
REST APIs</a> to authenticate and authorize outside services for their access to Office 365 online services. For example, someone needs to get data from Office 365 site.<br />
<br />
Regarding code or API questions, we suggest you post in the <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sharepointsearch%2Csharepointdevelopment%2Csharepointgeneral%2Csharepointdevelopmentlegacy%2Csharepointdevelopmentprevious%2Csharepointgenerallegacy%2Csharepointgeneralprevious%2Csharepointsearchprevious&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

First: NEVER, ever, work on any document on a <b>USB </b>(flash, thumb) drive from within Word. This means, do not
<b>save </b>to that location, do not <b>open </b>from that location, do not <b>print
</b>from that location! Doing these can result in permanent loss of the files.<br />
<br />
That said, using documents on your computer and not on a thumb drive you can<br />
<br />
1) Double-click on the template's icon from within Windows.<br />
<br />
2) Right-click on the template's icon and select New.<br />
<br />
You are best off keeping your templates in either the folder designated as the <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm#UserTemplates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
User Templates</a> Folder or the <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm#Workgroup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Workgroup Templates</a> Folder, or subfolders. In Word 2013, the Custom Office Templates folder is the default location for the User Templates. There is no default setting for a Workgroup Templates folder.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can't you just navigate to the template file in Windows Explorer and then double-click on it?&nbsp; That should create a New document based on that template...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, from within Word, do File &gt; Open... browse to your template file &gt; right-click on the template file and choose "New", then click Cancel.&nbsp; (You might get an error message about not being able to do this because a dialog is open - just ignore
 (OK) it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>

    <title>Vertical Absolute Position - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bookworm542  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vertical Absolute Position</h2>
                    Hello. I'm working in Word 2013. I would like to position Wordart on a blank page a half of an inch above the top margin. The Vertical Absolute Position option listed on the position tab of the layout dialog box doesn't seem to offer this specific option
 yet the solution is probably here.&nbsp; Would someone with knowledge of absolute placement please provide feedback -- thanks!

<p>Assuming the top margin doesn't change, you can position the WordArt relative to the top of the page instead. That is, if the top margin is the default 1", you would put the WordArt at 0.5" from the top of the page (0.5" below Page).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you could try -0.5" below Margin; that works for me.</p>
