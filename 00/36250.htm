<h2>            Installing languages not listed in the spellcheck section of Windows Live Mail &#40;2009 as well as 2011&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another thread titled "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/92cdf5b9-c56d-4afb-947f-da0873faa468">Language Package, spelling check for Windows Mail 6.0</a>", in response to the spellchecker problem of the Original
 Poster somebody suggested using Windows Live Mail because it supports more languages (37, it said, though it was a two years old thread). Around the Internet, I've seen that many people have trouble finding the options for changing languages and tutorials
 have been provided to show how to do that. However, in all those tutorials everybody seems to have dozens of languages in the list in the options panel for spellcheck, with those installed marked as such and those not installed but listed marked as "available".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is, why don't I have those options? I have used WLM 2009 under XP and 2011 under Seven, both English and Italian (my native language), and the first only comes with pre-installed English languages (variations for US, UK, Canada and Australia),
 and the second comes with the same plus Italian. But if I want to install Spanish or German, say, there simply is no option. The list is limited to those I've mentioned, the buttons to its side are all dimmed, the only choice I have is which one to set as
 the default. Why is that so? Why isn't there a way to install all those other languages? Or is this feature limited to the 2011 version only? And why would that be, since it's only available from Vista upwards and tons of people, businesses and administrations
 are still stuck with XP? </p>
<p><br />
I've seen around a few tutorials to manually install languages by moving some files and editing some ini files, but first I'd need the actual files containing the languages I want to use, and I assume these should be available somehow through the MS Download
 site. Or am I supposed to download each localized version of the WLEssentials, pick it apart and extract the files on my own? Isn't there a more straightforward option?
</p>
<p><br />
Thanks in advance for any input on the subject, best regards.</p>

            <p>The accelerator keys given by Ken only apply to WLMail 2011 and later.<br />
<br />
I don't know why the configuration file isn't being delivered to your XP machines. Perhaps Ken could ask&nbsp;his product specialist.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you can download the proofing tools for the language you want using the URLs given in the 2011 file. Use the lower versions. For example, the German tools for WLMail 2009 are at<br />
http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/6/1/261207BB-401C-4C7A-9065-635646CF297E/spl_dede7.cab&nbsp;<br />
<br />
(<em>dede7</em> indicates German/Germany, version 7)<br />
<br />
<br />
Extract the three files to a temporary folder. <br />
<br />
With WLMail closed, the three files should be placed in a folder called<br />
<br />
%AppData%\Local Settings\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Proof\prf<strong>0007</strong>\<strong>7</strong><br />
<br />
where <strong>0007</strong> indicates the last two digits of the locale ID (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/221435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LCID</a>) for Germany in hex. Germany&nbsp;(1031)&nbsp;is 0407, Spain (1034)&nbsp;is 040A and so on, so the proof folder for Spanish would be prf000A.
 The last folder in the path is the version number.<br />
<br />
Launch WLMail and see whether the languages are now available for installation on the
<em>Spelling </em>tab.<br />
<br />
[Incidentally, these are the same tools as used in Office versions before 2007, so other languages not included in oeconfig.xml can also be added if the Office proofing tools are available. If your users have custom dictionaries in Office, these can also be
 ported over to WLMail, but that's another story...]</p>

<br />
<br />2. Scan for Virus / Malware
<br />A: Use Defender / ESET Scan

<p>Hi guys</p>
<p>i have turtle beach px5 headset and i use it on my new xbox one; i used this headset on ps3 before and the sound was more louder than now; I've linked the receiver of the headphone to the xbox one&nbsp; through optical audio but when i play cod ghosts, the volume
 is lower then system sound, voice chat and then the volume game when i was on ps3...and obviously also footsteps are lower then before.</p>
<p>when i played on ps3 i put the volume of headphone on half, now instead i've to put it on max level!!!</p>
<p>Is it because optical audio works only with stereo sound for now while my px5 are dolby 7.1??</p>
<p>Tnx a lot!!</p>

<p>First off, the PX- Turtlebeach line is made specifically for the Playstation 3. They are not made to, and thus will not work on Xbox, whether it be the Xbox 360 or the Xbox One. Although you may get some functionality on the Xbox One, the headset is not
 made to work on the Xbox One. </p>
<p>If you want your Turtle Beaches to work with the Xbox One, you will need to buy a X series (Such as the X12's or the X32's) for the 360 and get an Xbox One adapter. Sadly, as far as my knowledge goes, Turtlebeach has yet to give us the adapter, assuming
 they're intending to in the first place. You may have to wait for the next generation headsets to be released.</p>
<p>I would suggest making your way to the official Turtle Beach forums if you have anymore questions, as this is really more a question for them.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>The PX5's are compatible with the Xbox 360 and the PS3. This comes from Turtle Beach's website and mine say "Xbox Mode" evertyime I turn them on. Not sure why you are having a lower volume on the One. &nbsp;Hopefully we will receive an update to the One in the
 future to address the issue.</p>

<p>I have the PX5's and they most certainly work with both the 360 and the PS3, the instructions have hookup details for both systems, the headphones will tell you if you are in the PS3 mode or the Xbox mode, and it comes with a 360 talkback cable that plugs
 into the controller to allow voice chat.</p>

    <title>Print Screen and Snipping Tool not working. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dude 100  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print Screen and Snipping Tool not working.</h2>
                    
<p>Neither the Print Screen nor the Snipping Tool are working.&nbsp; They have been working fine in the past but now neither one works.&nbsp; Rebooting didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>Print Screen doesn't seem to put anything in the copy buffer because even though Paste shows up, nothing pastes in.</p>
<p>Snipping tool just shows a black screen with a red border around it, instead of the actual screen shot (no matter which option I select IE Free Style or whole screen, etc)&nbsp; I have Vista Home Premium with all service packs.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>This should be the final resolution to my Snipping Tool/Print Screen problem:</p>
<p>1- I downloaded and ran the Malwarebytes program as recommended.&nbsp; And BTW I don't see that recommendation anymore here.&nbsp; I am fairly new to participating in Forums, so maybe there is some reason I don't see that recommendation here that I am not aware of.&nbsp;
 The Malwarebytes really did its job and even though I run MS Essentials the Malwarebytes program found 25 hits of Mal-ware on this PC.&nbsp; Once I it corrected these problems, the symptoms of my Snipping Tools problem at least became consistent.</p>
<p>***So Malwarebytes fixed part of the problem with the Snipping Tools.***</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- But the final resolution is that it turns out there is only one Internet site where the Snipping Tool will not work and that is my bank.&nbsp; I do know that my bank suggested I run a program to enhance security called Rapport.&nbsp; It is my theory that either
 my banking site and/or Rapport has something programmed into it that prevents screen shots with either the Snipping Tool and Print Screen.&nbsp; Whether I go into my banking site with Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, the Snipping Tool will not work.&nbsp; However
 the Snipping Tool works everywhere else.&nbsp; That is all other Internet sites and in every other program.</p>
<p>***The Snipping Tool won't work at my banking site (possibly because of RAPPORT) and perhaps it will not work on other tightly secured sites***</p>
<p>Thanks for so much for the help.</p>

<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>
<p>As for the product disk, it is the manufacturers responsibility to provide installation media for Windows 7 installations that came preloaded with the OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a work around:</p>
<p>Download the ISO Image of Windows 7<br />

https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/17156/windows-10-connect-to-bluetooth-devices</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your PC may or may not have a BT adaptor, check with HP and/or the HP system specs for your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if it has or if it hasn't, you can purchase BT adaptors that plug into a USB port for very little money. Just look in your fav PC store or a reputable on-line shop.&nbsp;They should not cost a lot, just make sure you get one that is compatible with your system/OS.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for your considered reply. Much appreciated. The problem got solved when I replaced a faulty mouse and also reinstalled the drivers for the mouse.

    <title>Xbox freezing 10-25 minutes after startup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox freezing 10-25 minutes after startup</h2>
                    My xbox will freeze after i turn it on and wait about 10 or 15 minutes while playing or just sitting on the dashboard. Heres how it goes- i start up my xbox, play the game, then 10 or 25 minutes into playing the xbox will just randomly freeze making me
 restart it. This happens even if i just let it sit on the dashboard. Which this problem completely does not let me play my xbox. And i have already done the issue where you clear your updates but still no luck.

    <title>Windows 10 faulty audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harrisshallcross  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 faulty audio</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently posted a question regarding the audio on my laptop and received a reply off one of your support engineers. After following his instructions with no meaningful results, I replied ASAP asking for the next piece of advice. Days later, I asked again
 and received no reply, therefore I'm going to keep making new posts until I get a sufficient reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was previously told to try updated drivers, along with the windows default drivers. NONE of these have helped my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have is that my audio seems to be extremely glitchy. To help diagnose the problem, I've actually taken a recording of the sound coming out of my laptop speakers (with my phone - excuse the relatively poor quality) so you can get a better idea
 of what it is like listening to audio from my laptop (Acer Aspire 5755g). I've also checked my DPC latency which to my horror (though not surprise...) is sky high with every audible glitch with lows still around the 2000us mark. I've gone past my month of
 downgrade so I'm stuck with Windows 10 and want to get this problem solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/360cb39c-b0de-4f6c-8c87-c99fa6404009" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio example can be found here:&nbsp;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1c208ZxUfy_Zk9CeFNUSF84ZWM/view?usp=sharing</p>

<h3> lizzyyo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accidently Unpinned Internet Explorer App from start screen windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I accidently unpinned the Internet Explorer ( Modern IE 11) App from the start screen on windows 8.1. For the life of me I can not get the App version back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I've tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Searching in the App screen for internet explorer it is not there.</li><li>Typing in Internet Explorer on the start screen- nothing found</li><li>Searching the App store --it is not there.</li><li>Searching under my Apps in the app store not listed.</li><li>Making sure Internet Explorer is set as the default browser.</li><li>Opening command prompt as a User (not admin), entering the command <em>C:\Windows\System32\ie4uinit.exe -UserIconConfig
</em>and hitting Enter will also create the IE tile. Didn't work</li></ol>
<p>I can pin the desktop version&nbsp;of Internet Explorer, but I can't seem to find the App version to pin. I really do prefer the app IE.</p>

<p>only game im even remotely interested in is Oddworld New 'n' Tasty , one of the first games i ever played, im only youngish, and thats the game i remember most, loved it to bits, but i still have the ps1 and still have that game so im no fussed, other indie
 games i just wouldnt be interested in mainly because i prefer bigger AAA titles now from published companys, indies just dont do atin for me, if i didnt played oddworld when i was young i wouldnt even notice indie games at all :L i understand alot of people
 like indies so im all for it if microsoft do it, but it wouldnt be my cup of tea</p>

<p>Tbh , I'm pretty sure MS will allow self publishing on the X1 , but it will be to set standards . That way talented indie devs can release games without restrictions , but anything weird/embarrassing can be 'weeded out' .</p>

<p>Don't for get stuff like DayZ Dean Rocket Hall has all ready said he does not agree with the whole needing a publisher to get a game on the Xbox. Then there are games like Outlast, Dead Linger ect that could skip xbox.</p>

</span>This is just a few games that the Xbox One won't be getting unless Microsoft changes their policies of Indie Game Developers &nbsp;</p>
<p>[/quote] I'm not worried, some will agree with Microsoft's standards and other won't it's not like the Xbox has go without indie games, but &nbsp;I do think the pay to patch your game needs to go away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am confused as to the question but basically Xbox Live Indie Games will not be moving to the Xbone. &nbsp;MS stopped development of XNA after the release of 4.0 in 2010. &nbsp; Now the marketplace for Xbone will have Arcade and I believe Games on Demand combined.
 &nbsp; As far as I know, there are no self-publishing plans for the Xbone for indie games.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 File Explorer file Details are not being saved - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert woodruff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer file Details are not being saved</h2>
                    <p>On Windows 10 from File Explorer when right-clicking on a .mp3 file in the Downloads directory, select Properties-&gt;Details tab. Make edits, click OK.&nbsp; Whatever changes are made to the details are not saved. They do not show in the Details tab when looking
 the next time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b32a469-58fc-4219-b567-795509ca50dd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b32a469-58fc-4219-b567-795509ca50dd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever changes/edits are made here seem to be ignored/forgotton. Any suggestion on how to debug/correct this so that Details can be edited and saved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            A moment ago I changed the title of an .mp3 fille. It worked as expected and the "Date modified" (as seen by File Explorer) changed at the same time. Which property are you trying to change?
