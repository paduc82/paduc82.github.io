<h2>            Antimalware service exceutable is always showing 17&#37; cpu usage on windows 10 home</h2>
                    <p>I have a pretty new asus laptop with nvidia 1070 gpu. Today I ran windows update which installed&nbsp; "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1803"</p>
<p>After rebooting i noticed my systen fan was making a lot of noise (overworking) (earlier it was pin drop silence)&nbsp; so i checked the cpu usage in task manager&nbsp; and noticed that "Antimalware service exceutable" is always at 17% cpu usage and continuously disk
 usage of around 25mb/s. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using windows defender as my security service and donot have any other antivirus software installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I waited for more than 5 hours and its still at 17% cpu usage and 25mb/s disk usage. Can you tell me why this always clocking 17% cpu usage of a very powerful core i7 machine and how i can shutdown the "antimalware service executore" or&nbsp; windows defender.</p>

            "Full" disk scans by antimalware can be both CPU and Disk access intensive. A newly installed AM would do a full disk scan. So, if you "accidentally" installed a "pup" (Potentially Unwanted Program). Some programs are paid to give you "free trials" of other programs (some are antimalware) when they are installed.  It happens if you do a "default" install or do not pay close attention to what you are saying "yes" to during the install process.
<br />
<br />Here are some tools you can use to investigate this potential problem program
<br />
<br />TROUBLE SHOOT PROGRAMS HANGING- PROCESS MONITOR
<br />I suggest that you use process monitor <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals...</a> . 
<br />
<br />It will capture a log of what the program is doing when it hangs, which should provide some additional information. Upload the log to the forum or onedrive so that people here can have a look. 
<br />
<br />Another useful tool is procdump <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd996900.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals...</a> - it can gererate a dump file once a window stops responding. 
<br />
<br />PROCESS HACKER ‚Äì MONITOR, DEBUG AND DETECT 
<br /><a href="http://www.technibble.com/process-hacker-monitor-debug-detect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.technibble.com/process-hacker-monito...</a>

<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/what_is_hang.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/what_is_hang.html</a> 
<br />
<br />Sometimes, Windows or a running application hangs, the user interface abruptly stops responding, and you cannot determine what has caused the problem or how to trouble shoot the issue. This utility tries to detect the software or process that is currently hung, and displays some information that may allow you to sort out and understand what exactly is at the root of such unexpected behavior. Most of the information displayed in WhatIsHang‚Äôs report, like Call Stack, Stack Data, Processor Registers, and Memory Data is designed for users with Windows programming knowledge. However, WhatIsHang also presents a list of strings and dll files related to the hang issue that can help users without programming skills understand and overcome the causes of the problem and restore normal operation.
<br />
<br />It may provide a clue that points to addins in Office Word / Excel.

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is caused by the latest windows update which installed number or components (which also updated windiws defender to latest version) as i had not logged into system for two months. I did a restore it rolled back to previous image and the issue with
 cpu usage went away completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the automatic windows update started as there is no option to disable windows update. Fortunately before it could reinstall all components, i was able to shutdown automatic windows update with work around i.e going to old admistrstive services
 and disabling windows update service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its just so unfortunate that microsoft has chosen to remove the ability of users to disable windows defender and windows update tool and then push crappy software which screws our system.</p>
<p>

            If you install another anitmalware program, Windows will automagically disable defender.

<p>I tried installing avg antivirus to see if that resoved the issue but no, high cpu usage was still there and windows defender security service was still showing under 'Antimalware protection service'. My guess is avg software doesnot replace all components
 and services like folder / file protection, windows firewall&nbsp; etc are still run under windows defender and so high cpu usage remained</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i did a restore it rolled back to older windiws defender version that i previousl had, and issue is resolved. Only issue is i cannot do any windows updates untill microsoft fixes the issues with Windows defender.</p>

<h2>            PC Crash , Error &#34;The driver &#92;Driver&#92;WudfRd failed to load for the device&#34;</h2>
                    <p>For the last 2 weeks my PC has been randomly crashing/Blue Screen/restarting &nbsp;, it does not have a specific task or event that triggers it , my PC can be just sitting &nbsp;, or i can be on the Internet , or playing a game (FarCry 3 for example*single player*)
 and it just goes to a blue screen saying it had a issue &nbsp;, after its back up and running i go to the Event Viewer and find 3-4 errors all saying the same thing &nbsp;"The driver \Driver\WudfRd failed to load for the device" &nbsp;(i will list the exact error below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not changed anything physical on my PC &nbsp;, the ONLY items that have changed is the latest Windows Updates (which i think caused this but i don't know which one) and a Video Driver update which i reverted back to the old one and the crash still happens
 , so that obviously was not the issue &nbsp; , i read some posts about setting "Windows Driver Foundation" to "Automatic" , that did not fix the issue &nbsp;, the PC is crashing 3-5 times a week &nbsp;, sometimes in a row , but at different times of day/night &nbsp;, i have done
 System Scans , which of course say nothing is wrong , and i have searched for this issue , and seen plenty of posts of "similar" errors , but not the exact error i am having (random crash , as most seem to be a booting error , this gives no error when booting
 nor at any other time &nbsp;, just the random Blue Screen , and a restart , then nothing about it crashing , unless i search the Event Viewer myself to find the cause)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the error , it appears about 4 times for each crash ,&nbsp;the <strong>Event ID</strong> is
<strong>219</strong> every time and the <strong>Task Category</strong> is <strong>
212</strong> every time &nbsp;and the <strong>Level</strong> is <strong>Warning</strong> , if that makes any difference&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The driver \Driver\WudfRd failed to load for the device SWD\WPDBUSENUM\_??_USBSTOR#Disk&amp;Ven_Generic-&amp;Prod_USB3.0_CRW-CF#MD&amp;Rev_1.00#201601060924&amp;0#{53f56307-b6bf-11d0-94f2-00a0c91efb8b}.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas ??? , this is a Win 7 Pro Upgrade to Win 10 Pro (64 bit) , its been working fine for at least 6 months (which is when i upgraded the hard drive to 2tb from 1tb) &nbsp;</p>
<p>Specs are basically I-5 4440 @ 3.10GHz , 12gb ram ,2gb Nvidea GTX750TI video card</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any actual solution to this issue would be appreciated &nbsp;, as mentioned i have done pretty much all the Windows Scans and come up with nothing that resolves this , and anything i found suggested for similar issues also failed to help .... Thanks .... Jim</p>

I was looking for the best mouse replacement for the old right-click context menu option, now that Windows 8 did away with the Organize menu as well. And avoiding the ribbon menu which turns the simplest tasks into minutes of hunting for a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew about the Ctrl-A shortcut. Your post reminded me of this old method:</p>
<p>1. Select first item in folder</p>
<p>2. Hold Ctrl-Shift</p>
<p>3. Select last item in the folder</p>
<p>Not as quick as the methods they removed, but adequate. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be an issue with the driver compatibility. I would suggest you to try installing the ACPI diver in compatibility mode and check if it works for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ACPI diver from the manufacturer website.<br />
<a href="http://support.asus.com/download/options.aspx?SLanguage=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/download/options.aspx?SLanguage=en</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After downloading the driver, refer to the following Microsoft Help article to install the driver in compatibility mode.</p>
<p><strong>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</strong>:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</a></p>

<p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then if you have any driver CD/DVD from the manufacturer, then try installing that in compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not a disc also, then the right please to contact for the driver related queries will be the computer manufacturer that is Asus for further assistance.</p>

            The file is undocumented, often a telltale sign that it may be a virus or other such pest.&nbsp; Your AV program probably removed the pest but failed to remove its startup entries.<br />
<br />
If you are comfortable editing the registry you can search for it and remove all references to it.&nbsp; If you are leery about editing the registry you can use Msconfig to see if the entry is present in the Startup tab and disable it there, to launch the utility
 just enter&nbsp; msconfig&nbsp; in the Start menu Run box.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If Msconfig fails to find the entry use <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SysInternals' Autoruns</a> to find and disable it.&nbsp; Autoruns is a very comprehensive utility which will show all startup items,
<b>be very careful with it and don't disable items that you are unsure of</b> as you may cripple the machine and render it unbootable if you disable essential components.<br />

            Windows 8 Consumer Preview is prerelease software, but it's a fully functional operating system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Checking Compatibility Without Installing - There is a readiness tool built into the Windows 8 Consumer Preview setup file.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Windows 8 Consumer Preview setup file download: <br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=242045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=242045
</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. After downloading the file double click it to start. <br />
2. It will begin checking for hardware and software compatibility. <br />
3. When finished it will tell you how many apps and devices are known to work, and how many will not.
<br />
4. To view the list click See the compatibility report. <br />
Note: clicking Next here will begin the installation process - if you do not want to install Windows 8 close the window at this point.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. The Windows 8 Consumer Preview is prerelease software and will only work for a limited time - when it expires you will have to remove it.
<br />
2. The Consumer Preview is stable and has been thoroughly tested, but it¬ís not the finished product. Your PC could crash and you could lose important files. You should back up your data and you shouldn't test Windows 8 Consumer Preview on your primary home
 or business PC. <br />
3. If you install the Consumer Preview on the partition Windows is currently installed on you can not uninstall the Consumer Preview. To go back to your previous version of Windows, you'll need to reinstall it from the recovery or installation media that came
 with your PC. <br />
4. In addition to dual booting, here are ways to install Windows 8 Consumer Preview without affecting your current Windows install:
<br />
A) Remove your current hard drive and install the Consumer Preview&nbsp; on a spare drive.&nbsp;
<br />
B) Install it on a spare computer. <br />
C) Install the Consumer Preview in a virtual machine. <br />
&nbsp;<br />

 to change a sound scheme the default scheme was fine. The list of schemes in Control Panel&gt;Sounds drop down list have disappeared.&nbsp; Is there away to get them back.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any change to the computer recently?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
Sounds like you possibly deleted or moved your Media Folder and/or files which is normally under the C:\windows folder (so it would be c:\windows\media) - that's where the sound files are located you are referring too.<br />
Can you do a Search for the Media Folder and see if it was accidentally moved?&nbsp; If you find it, move it back to c:\windows<br />
If the folder is where it should be, is it empty?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
In few of these cases running a System File Checker (SFC) has seemed to do the trick. Give it a shot. Let‚Äôs see if SFC scan replaces the corrupt or missing files. If it does, SFC will try to automatically repair the same. If it doesn‚Äôt repair on its own, you
 may have to follow the manual steps given in the article to replace the file.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Check this link for details.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;<br />
How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3.</strong></div>
<div>This behavior can occur if there is a null value at the root of the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive. In Regedt32, the value appears as:<br />
<strong><br />
&lt;No Name&gt;:REG_SZ:</strong><br />
<br />
Delete the null value in the registry.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Here‚Äôs how:<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Important:</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the windows help article below.</p>
<p><strong>Back up the registry<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</span></strong></a><br />
<br />
<strong>Steps: <br />
<br />
</strong>1.&nbsp;Start Registry Editor by typing regedit in the start search orb.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click HKEY_CURRENT_USER.<br />
3.&nbsp;Check for a value in the right pane that looks like this:<br />
4.&nbsp;&lt;No Name&gt; :REG_SZ: <br />
5.&nbsp;If this value is present, click the value, and then press DELETE.<br />
6.&nbsp;Quit Registry Editor.<br />
7.&nbsp;Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).<br />
8.&nbsp;Click HKEY_CURRENT_USER.<br />
9.&nbsp;Check for a value in the right pane that looks like this:<br />
10.&nbsp;&lt;No Name&gt; :REG_SZ: <br />
11.&nbsp;If this value is present, click the value, and then press DELETE.<br />
12.&nbsp;Quit Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
You do not need to restart the computer to make the change take effect.<br />
<br />
Go to Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Sound and verify the sound scheme.</p>
<p>Hopefully this should work.</p>

            Hi Geordie Boy,
<br />
<br />The command below, should have activated the built-in default Administrator account:
<br />
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />
<br />The command below, should have failed, since it is malformed:
<br />
<br />net user George Adminstrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />
<br />The command below should add your user account to the Administrators Group:
<br />
<br />net localgroup administrators George /add
<br />
<br />
<br />If you log in with a local account, the command below should change your login password (replace NewPassword:
<br />
<br />net user George  NewPassword
<br />
<br />If you log in with a Microsoft Account, you can reset your Password on this link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>
<br />
<br />Since you cannot now get into Windows, your best option is to go into Command Prompt from the Windows recovery Environment and see if you can use these commands to either activate the built-in Administrator Account or change your login password to get you back into Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Command Prompt       
        </p>

            <p>I have been having the same problem for a couple of days. On Friday and Saturday, I was able to get past the issues by playing different games. Neither rebooting nor updates my Windows has solved the problem for me today. I thought maybe if I just waited long enough something might load, but after 3 hours of letting my computer sit, I&nbsp;had the same white screen with no apparent change. I am unable to play any of the Microsoft Solitaire games today.</p><p>Not sure what it is going to take to solve this problem.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Completely Missing Human Interface Category from Device Manager - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Completely Missing Human Interface Category from Device Manager</h2>
                    <p>Hey there!<br />
<br />
I was having some trouble getting my touch screen to connect to my computer. The screen was working, but my computer didn't seem to register that it had a solid connection. I updated all my drivers just in case, and tried again. Still, the same problem. I updated
 the entire windows system. Still, the same problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I finally realized that the entire section for HIDs is missing. It's not anywhere on my Device Manager, nor is it under any tag. I tried looking for hidden devices and got the same thing. I tried to use troubleshooting under any related service I could find,
 as the hardware section was ALSO not showing up. I then looked for HID installers for Windows 10, to which I was rerouted back to install the new updates I had just installed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Help.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Lifecam HD-3000 Not recognised by Lifecam software</h2>
                    <p>First installed this on Saturday, but have been unable to get it to work properly. This is a Windows 7 x64 bit computer, running SP1, and latest updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The webcam wen connected via USB installs and is detected by Windows fine, it appears in both the
<strong>Sound, video , and game controllers</strong> and <strong>Imaging Devices</strong> sections,<strong>
</strong>and does not show any kind of error in either, both say working properly. All USB ports have been tried, both USB2 and USB3. There is no antivirus software except Microsoft Security Essentials, and no separate tuner, or other USB device, except a keyboard
 and mouse is installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LifeCam software itself, also installs properly, but after it has been installed opening the program simply displays the following: "There is no camera connected to this computer". The version being installed is the current version, 3.6 from the Microsoft
 website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skype also can not detect the webcam. It can detect that the webcam has a microphone and this can be selected for an audio source, and works, but the webcam itself does not appear as an option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These have been tried and not solved the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Run the Microsoft fixit mentioned in the link below.</span></p>
<p><span>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried using Webcam Diagnostics <a href="http://www.afterdawn.com/software/audio_video/webcam_tools/webcam_diagnostics.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.afterdawn.com/software/audio_video/webcam_tools/webcam_diagnostics.cfm</a>&nbsp;to check the camera is working.&nbsp;After going through all the tests it does work, just not with Skype or the official drivers ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera does work, because it has been tested on a separate computer running Windows Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated please.</p>

<br />
<br />After you removed that driver, and a restart, did that driver not appear again in Device Manager?
<br />
<br />Are you actually now able to see that Western Digital drive in Windows File Explorer?

    <title>How can I change labels on taskbar icons&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I change labels on taskbar icons&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am running several version of the same program. I would like to know if there is a way to label the icons in the taskbar so I can know which icon is associated with which version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's how - I'll use Microsoft Word to illustrate:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Right-click on the taskbar icon for Microsoft Word. You'll see 'Word' in the context menu.</p>
<p>2- Right-click on Word. Select Properties from the next context menu.</p>
<p>3- In Word Properties, switch to the General tab.</p>
<p>4- In the input box at the top of the General tab, substitute whatever name you wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do this because the taskbar icon in this case is merely a shortcut, and a shortcut can be (re)named whatever you wish.</p>

            Hi Catbill
<br />
<br />It depends on the actual program you are using the multiple instances of. some applications will provide different txt for each icon automatically, you certainly cannot manually change the icon text on those icons . .. 
<br />
<br />Please check this setting
<br />
<br />Right click your Taskbar, choose Taskbar Settings
<br />
<br />Is 'Combine Taskbar Buttons' set to Never?

<p>Oh, I didn't realize that I could right-click on the name of the program to open another dialog. Good to know.</p>
<p>It sort of works, meaning that it changes the name that appears when I right-click on the icon. However, it does not change the name that appears in the tooltip when I hover the cursor over the icon. Sounds like the outcome depends on the program.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>It is set to "always, hide labels."&nbsp; My question may not have been clear enough. I was trying to ask if it is possible to rename the tooltip so I can see the version without opening the program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see from my reply above, it looks like the program won't let me change the name of the tooltip. However, by right-clicking I can see the version of the program. and that is helpful.</p>

<p>You can change the tooltip as well but it's a little more work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, create a desktop shortcut to the executable. Remember, since this is a shortcut, you can call it whatever you want, so rename it as you wish. Then, drag the shortcut to the taskbar. The taskbar tooltip should be whatever you called the shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just now tried that (I'm on v.1809) and it worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know, you can also change the shortcut's icon, to further distinguish it.</p>

<p>Good ideas. I just tried it and the only problem is that when I drag the shortcut to the taskbar, it doesn't paste itself in the taskbar.&nbsp; This is before the red circle with the line appears.</p>

            This is not a Windows issue. Contact HP tech support for help with the printer or replace it. These printers don't last forever and it sounds like yours is failing.

                    The updated version of Skype does not have any way to show that I am "away". Was this feature removed and why?

</p><p>Unfortunately, this option is no longer available with the new Skype. You can now change your presence status to:
<strong>Active, Do not Disturb, </strong>and <strong>Invisible. </strong></p>
<p>

<p>but the bigger question is,&nbsp; why remove the "Away" status?</p>
<p>version 8 and 12 do not have "away" as a status, while version 7 and the website does.</p>
<p>and then along with redefining what IDLE actually is - creates confusion and unhappy users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>do you guys see how many people are reinstalling version 7 after they see what 8 is like?</p>
<p>
</p><p>also, so many configurable items are removed with versions 8 and 12 that exist in version 7.</p>
<p>defining individual sounds, ports used, uPnp yes/no, for example.</p>

<h2>            Import the Comcast address book into the Windows 10 People app</h2>
                    <p><span>A bit convoluted but...</span></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Export the Comcast address book into a CSV file.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Move the email addresses in the CSV file from column ‚ÄúI‚Äù (‚ÄúHome E-mail Address‚Äù) to column ‚ÄúF‚Äù (‚ÄúE-mail Address‚Äù)</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Create (Log into) an account in Outlook.com (not the Mail app, but in a browser window) and go to the Outlook Mail screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the blue tic-tac-toe box choose People.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select Manage&gt;Import Contacts and enter the name of the CSV file.</p>
</li><li>

</li><li>

Add the Outlook.com account from above to the app.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
The imported contacts should now be in the People app.</p>
</li></ol>

<p><span>PLEASE TEST THIS WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF CONTACTS FIRST (edit the CSV file) in case I screwed up the above directions.</span></p>

<p><span>Below&nbsp;is a map that shows the mapping of the columns, by letter, in the CSV file to the fields in the People app, in case you‚Äôve used fields other than the email address and some other fields in the
 CSV file have to be shuffled.</span></p>
