<h2>            Unable to launch XBOX 360 games in XBOX ONE Console</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded few XBOX 360 games(Backward Compatible) using my Gold member ship in my XBOX ONE Console. But unable to launch them. I see message saying 'downloading your XBOX 360 profile" and then a pop up asking me to sign in (I've already signed in my XBOX ONE console)</p>
<p>I am able to launch all XBOX&nbsp;ONE games, But not XBOX 360 games.</p>
<p>Please let me know a solution for this. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hey there - </p><p><br /></p><p>Does this happen with all your backward compatible game titles or only specific ones?&nbsp;And which games, specifically, are you running into issues with? First thing to try will be clearing your Xbox 360 local storage from your Xbox One console. Starting from your Xbox One home dashboard:</p><p><br /></p><p>*Open the Guide menu</p><p>*Scroll down to Settings</p><p>*Select 'All Settings'</p><p>*Navigate over to 'Storage'</p><p>*Select 'Clear local Xbox 360 storage'
</p><p><br /></p><p>Give that a shot and let us know if you continue to experience issues. :)

<h2>            BSOD - BAD_POOL_CALLER</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing a BAD_POOL_CALLER ever since I build my new PC and I can't figure out why it's happening. I have tried a few things which I will list below and thought that I had resolved the problem, but it cropped back up a few hours ago. I'm
 stumped and wondered if anyone could have a quick check through to see if they are aware of what's causing it? It would be much appreciated!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This happens every other day and only when I'm surfing the internet. I've not had it happen while gaming or when left on the desktop but it could be a coincidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have run a MEMTEST for 12 hours with no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I have reinstalled the UEFI to the latest version, cleared the CMOS and left everything at stock settings with no overclocks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I have tried reinstalling a few drivers in relation to the networking and NVIDIA graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple of dmp files if anyone can read them and tell me something please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pq1cf4zcseoq65o/AADDYbJOrA_2YPxz5d9IVICWa?dl=0</p>

</p><p>Many thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not worry any further as I have resolved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded another program called WhoCrashed which was able to analyse the MEMORY.DMP file which told me the below. As this only appears to happen during surfing the web and my BAD_POOL_CALLERS had issues with the TCP drivers within Windows, it makes perfect
 sense. I have Googled the issue and found that the Killer Networking drivers are simply rubbish, to run a full uninstall, and just install the drivers without the software suite. Should this continue to happen again, I will try uninstalling the drivers, disabling
 the device, and use my Intel NIC as I have two ethernet ports on my motherboard (EVGA Z270 Classified K). It's annoyed me a little as I have lost my overclock settings now after running a CMOS so I will have to play around with those over the weekend but at
 least it's not a hardware issue and I can resolve it over time :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologise for wasting your time as it could have been used helping someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

<p>Typically, the drifting controller issue is due to a faulty controller. &nbsp;Make sure you have fully updated your controller. &nbsp;The only other thing that I can even remotely suggest would be to remove the batteries from the controller completely and not connected
 to the console via a USB cable. &nbsp;Once that is done perform a hard reset on the console like this.</p>
<p>Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug the power cord back in and restart the console. &nbsp; Once it is back up and operational put
 the batteries back in the controller and test. &nbsp;This should reset all internal components but like I said earlier drifting in typically caused by a bad controller.</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes. &nbsp;Good Luck!!</p>

            Hi Luismoralez,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on the issue description I understand that your headset on the computer is not working and microphone is not recognized.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can understand how frustrating it could be when things don't work as expected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please help me with the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model of the Microphone/headset device?</div>
<div>2. Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>3. If the headset jack connected firmly to the port on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This issue might be caused due to bad/corrupted audio driver or due to incorrect audio settings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Connect a different headphone and check whether the headphone jack is working properly.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue persists, then here are a few methods which you can follow to resolve the issue:</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method&nbsp;1:</strong> You can try setting the headphone as default and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>a. Right click on the volume icon in the system tray and then click "Recording devices".</div>
<div>b. Right click on the blank space in the popped up window and then select "Show Disabled Devices" and "Show Disconnected Devices".</div>
<div>c. Right click on Headphone and then click "Enable".</div>
<div>d. Highlight the microphone and then choose "Set as Default Device".</div>
<div>e. Click Apply and Ok.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>I would suggest you to refer to the link and follow steps given in the Microsoft KB article:</div>

<p>
</p></div>

<h2>            Xbox One S - loud buzzing from TV then console turns off</h2>
                    <p>I have a couple of Xbox One S's.&nbsp; One of them - it seems when there's alot of on screen activity (in any game) the TV seems to emit loud buzzing, the game freezes, then the console does a hard shut down.&nbsp; I can watch streaming videos all day long on that
 device with no problems, but Destiny 2, Fallout '76, Hand of Fate 2, Fortnite - anytime there's alot of on screen activity, it freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched for solutions - I don't think it's uninstall/reinstall since it affects any game.&nbsp; I've cleared the persistent storage (I don't think that should have been an issue, anyway, since I never watch Blu-ray movies).&nbsp; So far, nothing has helped.</p>

    <title>Samsung M55 Laptop - SoundMax High Defintion Audio device not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung M55 Laptop - SoundMax High Defintion Audio device not working</h2>
                    I have a Samsung M55 laptop with an integrated Intel 945 chipset that has a SoundMax High Definition Audio soundcard onboard.
<br />
<br />
Since installing Windows 7, Windows installs the device with the generic Microsoft high definition audio driver and I have no sound. The device says it is installed correctly. There are no Win7 drivers available on the Intel site.<br />
<br />
I have tried my old XP drivers, the new Realtek drivers and everything in between but nothing works.<br />
<br />
I have seen lots of other people on the net with this problem so it is obviously not just my laptop at fault.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas or can a Microsoft person tell me when this problem is likely to be fixed?

            You would need to ask Samsung this question. Laptop hardware is generally made especially for the laptop mftr., who provides the drivers for the hardware. Check on Samsung's site for your M55 for Windows 7 drivers. If they don't exist, then you can try
 the Vista drivers. If they don't work, possibly finding out the motherboard mftr. and model would enable you to go to the motherboard mftr.'s website for sound drivers.

            Your best bet would be to contact the developers/publishers to see if they would agree to allow the game on the back compat catalogue. If however either of them are no longer around, then the game cannot be made compatible.

<p>Hey Rober4,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;the publisher of this Mortal Kombat game has ceased operations during 2009. Most of there assets have been purchased&nbsp;by Warners Bros.&nbsp; So there won't be a way to get the game relicensed for BC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            changing privacy and online safety</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to change my settings so that I can purchase things on the online store. I have gone to my parent's account and am trying to access my privacy and online safety settings from there. However each time I have done this I have been told that there
 is a temporary problem with the service. This has been happening for a few days now and I want to know whether I will have to wait or if this can be fixed.</p>

            Please re-read my first posting.&nbsp; I recommend you do a clean complete re-install of Windows 7 using a windows 7 install DVD.&nbsp; You can try lots of different&nbsp; things to try to get your rolled back install working.&nbsp; They may work.&nbsp; Based on my experience,
 your best result will come from a total re-install.

    <title>Windows 10 update and uninstalling Spy Sweeper - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beckleston  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update and uninstalling Spy Sweeper</h2>
                    <p>My laptop already runs on Windows 10, and is trying to install an update. A box popped up saying it could not uninstall the Spy Sweeper app, that I would have to do it myself then click refresh. I have searched my computer applications for Spy Sweeper and
 it is NOT listed anywhere as being on my computer. After reading through discussion answers, I also searched for Webroot thinking it may be connected with them. But Webroot is not on my computer, either. I am stumped as to what I can do to allow the upgrade
 to continue. Any help would be greatly appreciated - thank you!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error " <strong>it could not uninstall the Spy Sweeper app</strong>" mean that the said app is still installed on your computer though the shortcut was deleted. In the meantime, please check if the both apps are listed in Programs and Features in Control
 Panel. <br />
<br />
To check, press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> &gt; type <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; click
<strong>Uninstall a program</strong> under <strong>Programs </strong>&gt; check the apps under

            Is this the newer LCD type screen (flat panel) or the older style CRT Monitor? If it is a CRT Monitor you may want to adjust the refresh rate. Try setting it to the highest supported rate for your monitor. You will find the refresh rate in the "Advanced
 Settings" of the dialog box where you were changing the resolution. In the Advanced settings go to the monitor tab and the refresh rate settings are there.

            Are you connecting to it with a VGA cable or a dvi&nbsp; or hdmi cable? <br />
<br />
Couple of things to check.<br />
1. Set your Display Resolution at <span>1680 x 1050. Refresh rate should be 60. (That should have been your only choice in the refresh setup)<br />
2. Double check that your cable connections are good at both the monitor and at the computer.<br />
<br />

            Not sure what type of cable - I use the one that came with monitor.<br />
Tried steps one and two already. The least flickering setting is 1360x768 but it makes&nbsp;my desktop icons&nbsp;too big. I might have to just live with it.<br />
Strange thing, it stopped flickering awhile ago, but starts up again intermittently.<br />
Never had a problem with XP. Hateful Vista!<br />
Thanks for your suggestions.

            It sounds like a loose or a faulty cable connection. Does it flicker even when you have not yet fully booted up into vista?<br />
<br />
Do you have any othe rmonitor to test with this pc?

            If it is intermittent it is probably the cable connections or the cable itself. If those are fine then it is the monitor. Since this is a new monitor under warranty I would check with HP on this. You should not have any flicker on the screen and the intermittent
 nature of it rules out any thing software related.<br />

            Thanks all so much for the suggestions.&nbsp; I checked the cables, they seem secure.<br />
Thankfully, the monitor stopped flickering several hours ago...don't know why, but that's good.<br />
I'm going to try and reset the resolution again, and see what happens. The desktop icons are way too large.<br />
My screen saver also hasn't worked since installing this new computer last week.&nbsp; I see a forum on possible corrections on that too.<br />
<br />
BTW- My monitor is 6 months old and under warranty.<br />
You guys are great for the advise.....I'll update you if any problem

            Guess what!&nbsp; I went into the display settings and changed it to 'Classic Windows' and was able to reset the size of the icons by&nbsp;setting the resolution at 1680x1050 and it's not flickering and looks 100% better!&nbsp; Who knew??<br />
I would say that this case is resolved!<br />

            Well, I spoke too soon yesterday when I thought this issue was resolved.<br />
After I turned my computer back on this morning, the flickering returned and my icons aren't the way I left them.<br />
Checked all cables, reset the resolution, no luck.&nbsp; <br />
Please keep this question open for now.<br />
I will contact monitor warranty to troubleshoot<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Task Manager Stops Responding when opened to kill a non-responsive program.</h2>
                    <p>I used to have Windows 7 Ultimate, and when I wanted to kill tasks that were unresponsive, the Task Manager worked perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently upgraded to Windows 10 Professional, and now when programs stop responding (like Guild Wars 2 run in Administrator), I open Task Manager, but then when Task Manager opens, it won't respond. I can't click anything, and I don't even get a non-responsive
 message. I can switch between tasks, but I can't use the task manager, or switch tabs, or even click anything in task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO, what is happening? How do I determine what is happening? How do I fix this?</p>

            <p>You can't purchase a standalone key, you will need to purchase it as part of a retail upgrade or full version package; or a OEM System Builder license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.<br />
<br />
Full version (Retail):<br />
<br />
- Includes transfer rights to another computer.<br />
- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.<br />
- Expensive<br />
<br />
Upgrade version (Retail):<br />
<br />
- Includes transfer rights to another computer.<br />
- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.<br />
- Expensive, but cheaper than full version<br />
<br />
OEM System Builder version:<br />
<br />
OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:<br />
- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel<br />
- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on<br />
- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard<br />
- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with using it too, especially since all future releases of Windows will be full versions anyway.

    <title>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service dependency on Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bertram moshier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service dependency on Windows Search service &#40;SSD as boot drive&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't get the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service to start, as I can't get the Windows Search service to start, as I have solid state disk drive. &nbsp;The manufacturer (Samsung) says Windows 10 has built in (forced?) configuration, which includes
 turning off Windows Search. &nbsp;(In earlier versions of Windows, such as Windows 7, Samsung had software to optimize Windows, but this is no longer true / going to be true with Windows 10.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As they put it bluntly, it is Microsoft saying you can't start the Search service because you have a SSD (not us, as in the past).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really used on Windows 7 the Windows Media Player Network Sharing service and the need continues even after going to Windows 10. &nbsp;As I plan on every computer going to Windows 10, using another computer is NOT an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need is EITHER:</p>
<ul>
<li>To start the Windows Media Play Network Sharing without requiring the Search service OR</li><li>To start the Windows Search service without indexing the SSD.</li></ul>
<p>NOTE: &nbsp;My system has over 15TB of data, which only 95GB is on a SSD. &nbsp;I REALLY could use the Windows Search service for the non-SSD hard drives (SATA, USB, and eSATA). &nbsp;The last option would be the best overall solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, please, how do I get WMPNS server started? &nbsp;How can I start / use the WS server without it affecting the SSD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to start the service I get an error saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Windows could not start the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service service on the Local Computer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Error 1068: &nbsp;The dependency service or group failed to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at the dependency services, I find:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP Service</li><li>Windows Search</li></ul>
<p>When I look at Windows Search I find it disabled and upon close examination it's disabled because I have a SSD (boot drive). &nbsp;As for the HTTP Service, I'm not sure about its status, as I can't find a service by the exact name HTTP and thus assume (yeah,
 I know) it has a different name. &nbsp;BUT, until I get Windows Search not to be a dependency or to start (say ignoring the SSD). the HTTP service doesn't matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BTW, the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service worked fine on Windows 7 (same physical hardware)!!! &nbsp;Why can't it work on Windows 10??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply and hopefully this information will be helpful to you.</p>

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long delay, as I missed your message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your instructions and no change.&nbsp; The Media Server refuses to start as it has a dependency upon the Search service.&nbsp; The search service won't start as Windows disabled it and I can't get it enabled.&nbsp; Per my reading Windows disables Search because
 I have a SSD in my system.</p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other
 security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus
 software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></font></p>

c) In the command prompt type in the following command: ‘<b><font>sfc /scannow’</font></b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than
 minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></font></p>
