<p><span>Hi obxsurfdog,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers forums!</span></p>
<p><span>This issue is caused by damaged or incompatible Internet Explorer settings or add-ons. You can usually resolve
 the problem by resetting Internet Explorer settings.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to optimize internet explorer and then reset internet explorer, you have a
<strong>fix it</strong> in the reset internet explorer link below just click on it, to resolve the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox Enforcement... What did I do wrong&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since my last post got immediately locked and I haven't&nbsp;found another way to contact Xbox Enforcement (I've heard rumors that you can contact them) I will continue to make forum posts although XBLPET do&nbsp;not monitor the forums. I will not give up so easily, considering that I did not do anything wrong during January 28,&nbsp;2018.&nbsp;IF YOU HAVEN'T READ MY PREVIOUS DISCUSSION OR YOU JUST DON'T KNOW THE STORY, I WILL POST IT BELOW.&nbsp;I'm just really lost and I do not know where to go,&nbsp;I will not start over after I have spent 8 YEARS on that account and have spent thousands of dollars in games, micro-transactions and DLC. Also, I currently have $45 on my Happzy account and I'm not able to use it,&nbsp;not even&nbsp;for Xbox Live so I can talk to my friends.&nbsp;I would like this post not to be locked instantly and if thinks they can help me, please do so.&nbsp;I am getting extremely desperate. If it comes to it,&nbsp;I will even make a video showing my GAME DVR, Game c

<p>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;I will admit, some of the memes I uploaded were offensive and they should've been removed from Xbox Live. As a matter of fact, even when I tried to upload videos that were offensive, they wouldn't upload and I would get a message from Xbox. Some had curse words but they did not show anything graphic. I also tried to upload some videos from my YouTube channel as well and some went through. I stopped uploading memes/funny videos after I received a month suspension, I learned I had to stop after that. The month suspension took place somewhere near fall. At that point, I decided to delete every video containing a curse word or may even be offensive to someone. Video was too loud? Deleted. Somebody said "damn"? Deleted. I only left videos that didn't have a curse word and videos from my YouTube channel, although some of my YouTube videos had minimal to no curse words.&nbsp; After the month suspension, I only uploaded videos from my YouTube channel. Most of them didn't upload to Xbox Live which I found odd



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I only played with my friends and started streaming more often on Twitch. Unfortunately, I got some messages from people asking "where are all the memes at"? I would usually reply with "I stopped uploading them because I don't want to get communications banned for a month again and if you don't want to follow me anymore, just remove me :)". The majority of them reported me for harassment, spam and inappropriate content because of this and most of the reports actually went through. I kept on getting reported over and over again and my punishment was usually Xbox Live restrictions. I tried to apply a case review on several occasions, put every time I do I am met with a "copy and pasted" response.&nbsp; That was until the 28th of January, 2018, in which I received a permeant suspension.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I haven't received a message from Xbox Live in a long time, so I thought I was done being reported. That was until I received three consecutive reports in a row, one of which being the permanently banned suspension. I tried to sign back into my account and I was met with this message: "This account is permanently suspended from Xbox Live due to inappropriate conduct or content" I was baffled. I thought Xbox reviewed every report that went through? I go to the Xbox Enforcement site and try to find ANYWHERE for me contact somebody besides the case review.&nbsp; The case review is treacherous. I thought to myself, "I only have 500 letters to type to try to get my account". But to no avail, I found nothing. I tried the case review and to my expectation I was met with a copy and pasted response. If I could remember (The reason why I don't want to paste the enforcement members response is because I can't and I will say that later and also, I do not want to violate another person's privacy) it said that the main 



<p><br /></p><p>The worst thing about my Permaban was that it just wasn't my account, it was the whole console. I don't know why Microsoft/Xbox jumped to a console ban, especially on somebody who is innocent. This wasn't only affecting my account, but it was affecting other accounts as well that were on the Xbox when the ban took place. A month passed since the ban took place. I lost all of my digital games as well. I had around 160 digital games, including DLC (Downloadable content) in most of them. I have added up all the prices of all my digital games and I would have lost over $5,000 dollars (that is of which I have spent over an eight-year period).&nbsp; I had enough after that, in February, I tried to find any means necessary to contact someone of the enforcement team to tell them what happened, I knew there had to be some way, but there was none. I started to give up, by the end February every time I tried to access a part of the Xbox store signed under my Permabanned account it would take me to the en



<p><br /></p><p>I hope somebody can help me with this problem. I want my account back and that is final (sorry if I seem livid I just haven't played video games in a very long time) I will not make a new account and start over because I would've lost YEARS of progress in several games. I would've lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Please... From a gamer's perspective this really hurts. Put yourself in a gamers shoes and have everything taken away from you even though you did nothing wrong... to put it bluntly, it sucks. I have played Xbox for 8 years of my life and it has become part of my personality, it wouldn't make sense for me to throw it away like that. I'm not a toxic person. My gamer tag even says it... my gamer tag is Happzy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a bad thing before and Xbox suspended me for a month because of it, but I've learned my lesson. I'm not the only person to experience this, I know there are thousands of people who play on Xbox who has been in the same exact situation that I have been and h

    <title>Windows 10 System image restore. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewabarnes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 System image restore.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I have a new clean disk I had to put in my Asus X55C as the old one failed. The origional shipped with W8 then I upgraded to 10 as per the push notifications.</p>
<p>Any way, I have a system image backup on an external HDD and have created a recovery drive on a 4Gb USB drive.</p>
<p>The system boots to the recovery drive ok, I follow the instructions that I have read several times to recover from an image, but I keep getting the message that its not available in this version of Windows.</p>
<p>I also had the error that the drive with the recovery files needs formatting, but that went after I swapped USB drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>

<p>Plenty of warts.... </p>
<p>I remember once all most used programs disappeared from the start menu list </p>
<p>I restored a system image I had where they all were there = Of course I was disconnected from the internet when I restored the image and yes most used programs were listed :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I connected to the internet they were gone again :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restored the image again</p>
<p>Didn't boot to win-10 for a month or so and they didn't disappear then so it just shows how weird win-10 can be and how cool system images can be using the right utility to create them :)</p>

            <p>Might download and make yourself a bootable win10 installer and run its repair environment for the ... System Image Recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had the so called 'recovery drive' not work here a couple times with re-imaging,&nbsp;when the&nbsp;repair environment on the
 win10 install&nbsp;would work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If that fails you,,&nbsp; you could install win10 fresh and as long as its system partitions are at least as large as they were in the old drive.... use its System Image Restore.</p>

            <p>I created a x64 MCT USB drive on a HP laptop(32 bit) for my Asus machine but it wouldn't work I tried many suggested fixes that I came across on the net, however the way I got it to work eventually was to create the MCT on a x64 Lenovo thinkpad and choose
 the repair option (which is written in very small writing in the second page of the menus after keyboard selection), and choose the advanced option, system image etc etc. Also just to note, from my experience the recovery DVD I made and used did not allow
 me to run the restore of my system image.......strange.</p>
<p>So thanks for all the replies and thoughts, up and running again....for now.</p>

 my administrator has blocked my useage.&nbsp; This is a private computer with no administrator but myself.&nbsp; I tried logging on as "Administrator" but still got the same message and could not open Program Manager.&nbsp; Any help?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            If you are seeing things like this:<br />
<br />
You do not have sufficient security privileges to restore your system.<br />
The System Restore tab is missing from My Computer Properties.<br />
System Restore has been turned off by group policy.&nbsp; To turn on System Restore, contact your domain Administrator.<br />
The System Restore tab is available, but the Turn off System Restore (disabled by Group Policy) box is greyed out.<br />
Registry Editor has been disabled by your System Administrator.<br />
Task Manager has been disabled by Group Policy.<br />
Registry Editor has been disabled by Group Policy.<br />
The command prompt has been disabled by your administrator.&nbsp; Press any key to continue...<br />
The operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer.&nbsp; Please contact your system administrator.<br />
The "Run" option is missing from the Start menu.<br />
The "Log Off..." option is missing from the Start Menu.<br />
Add or Remove Programs hs been restricted.&nbsp; Please check with your administator.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The usual advice is something along the lines of "something has been disabled in Group Policy...", and that is probably true that something has been disabled, but you need to know what that something is and what to do about it.<br />
<br />
If you are using XP Home, you will not get far with advice to use the Group Policy Editor since there is no Group Policy Editor in XP Home and that really doesn't tell you where to look in the Group Policies even if you could run Group Policy Editor.<br />
<br />
You need a comprehensive solution that will work for all versions of XP and do not require hunting around in the Group Policy Editor or the registry to find where things are that might have been disabled.<br />
<br />
Unless you disabled these things on purpose, the chances are good that your system has a malicious software infection.&nbsp; The malware knows what tools you are going to use to try and find and remove it, so the malware disables the things you are most likely to
 use and keeps them from running so you can't find the malicious software and remove it.<br />
<br />
If your system has this kind of affliction, whatever malicious software tools you are currently using or have been using have failed to protect your system so you may want to expand your malicious software prevention and detection horizons to prevent these
 kinds of afflictions in the first place.<br />
<br />
The malicious software will be happiest to fool you into thinking you need to so something drastic to fix your system - like a Repair Install, System Restore point, or a total reinstallation of XP.&nbsp; That is what it would like you to do, but such measures are
 not required.<br />
<br />
You need to fix the immediate problem of the tools not working, then scan your system for malicious software when you are done.
<br />
<br />
No matter what kind of malicious software scanning tools you have already used, they are unlikely to fix this problem because they cannot tell if the changes to your system were on purpose (you or an Administrator made them) or some malicious software changed
 them, so the scanning tools will leave these things alone (this is usually a good thing).<br />
<br />
If your system is afflicted in this manner, there are probably other things that also don't work - like Registry Editor, System Restore and Command Prompt, so fix them all at once even if you haven't found out they are broken yet.<br />
<br />
These registry commands will remove the registry entries that are stopping the programs from opening.&nbsp; Even if the registry entries are not there, these commands are safe to run and will work for all versions of XP.<br />
<br />
Before making any changes to your registry, back up the registry with this popular free tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
Open notepad to create a new text file:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
notepad<br />
<br />
Click OK to open a new notepad file.<br />
<br />
Copy and paste the following lines of bold text into the new notepad file.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Save the new text file with a .reg extension to your desktop or someplace you can remember with a name you can remember, something like:
<br />
<br />
enableit.reg<br />
<br />
After saving the file, close notepad.<br />
<br />
Locate the enableit.reg file on your desktop and double click it.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can right click the enableit.reg file, choose Open With... and select the Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative to the question... Are you sure you want to add the information to the registry?<br />
<br />
You should then see a message that the information was successfully entered into the registry.<br />
<br />
Reboot your system and test.<br />
<br />
You can remove the enableit.reg file when you are done.<br />
<br />
If the Registry Editor has also been disabled, we will have to fix that first (not a problem).<br />
<br />

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the new Skype version, your status on Skype has its new behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will only being seen as online if you are using actively the Skype app and your status will be set to offline/away for some time for being idle. Staying online on Skype was previously
 available to Skype classic which will be soon deprecated. </p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to keep Microsoft Visual c++ redistributable 2010 and uninstall the rest of Microsoft Visual c++ because Microsoft Visual c++ redistributable 2010
 updated version Microsoft Visual c++.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also some program are not designed for using the same version of Microsoft Visual c++, However there are chances that you might
 need to install older versions to run a few programs.</span></p>

Ja gut, dann stellen wir uns doch mal dumm!<br />

Was haste denn für Daten darauf gezogen?<br />
Und warum willst Du sie entschlüsseln und bearbeiten?<br />
<br />
Aber vor allem&nbsp;möchte ich Dich fragen mit welchem Ziel Du sie bearbeiten, sprich verändern willst&nbsp;?<br />

<p>Wenn du bei Halo Clips bearbeiten willst gibt es die Möglichkeit die Clips mit Bungie Pro zu renderen und dann als WMV weiter zu verarbeiten.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player library does not update when new items added</h2>
                    I use Zune to do all my CD ripping but I have to use WMP to load up a USB Flash Drive for my car. The problem is that the media library in WMP never updates to include new music ripped in Zune, so I end up doing it in Explorer, which is not the way I want
 to work. I don't know why but WMP seems to have been severely broken for Win7. I'd much rather use Zune for everything but it still lacks a few essential features, like syncing to USB devices.<br />

            Sorry, I keep forgetting you assume that everyone is an idiot. I know how to use WMP, I've read the help cover to cover but this issue is not mentioned anywhere. In previous versions of WMP there was a button to re-scan the nominated folder(s) to update
 what it shows. Zune does it effortlessly without any assistance but WMP 12 seems completely incapable of updating anything of it's own accord. Instead I have to remove the folder, restart WMP, add the folder again and wait while it reads all 7000 songs again.
 It is not a viable way to get anything done. <br />
<br />
It might be relevant that my library resides on an external HHD, connected via USB, although that was never a problem on WinXP or Vista (my favourite version of Windoze).<br />

            Hi Kaarthik 
<br />
<br />That is an unusual error if you are just updating your system please provide a bit more detail on this . ..
<br />
<br />Are you upgrading form an earlier version of Windows to Windows 10, or are you updating Windows 10 by using the Windows 10 ISO?

            Hi Kaarthik.
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />We would like to see the Installation log to check what caused the update to fail/stuck/rollback.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named files from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.

<h2>            Windows Update Restart Popup</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>First up - I don't know where best to leave feedback for Microsoft so I'm going to post it hear for now and hopefully (if I'm wrong someone can tell me where I should have posted my comments).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Second - before anyone complains that my post is about Vista and this is a Windows 7 forum - I'm sorry, but trail of links I followed to arrive here was....</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows Forums -&gt; (Show all Vista forums) -&gt; Windows Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>and that brought me here!?!?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, I have a suggestion about the way the Windows Update Restart Dialog should work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What I'm talking about, in case I'm not clear, is the&nbsp;tool-tip&nbsp;type window that appears down by the system tray when Windows update has finished installing some updates.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;pop-up&nbsp;reminds you that you need to restart your PC before the changes will take effect and gives you two options, Restart Now or Postpone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What's very annoying, and needs fixing, is that the&nbsp;pop-up&nbsp;grabs focus, and more annoyingly, the buttons have&nbsp;short-cut&nbsp;keys associated with them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now this scenario doesn't happen&nbsp;every-time&nbsp;I get new updates, but today's incident was not the first time, picture this...</strong></p>
<p><strong>1, I'm writing an email, I can type quite quickly, so keys are being pressed at a fair old rate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2, Windows Update finishes installing the latest patches and flashes up a&nbsp;pop-up&nbsp;which grabs the focus.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3, I had no warning this was about to happen, and seeing as the buttons on the&nbsp;pop-up&nbsp;have keyboard&nbsp;short-cuts, it's a lottery as to whether I accidentally press the&nbsp;short-cut&nbsp;for restart or the one for postpone whilst typing my email.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As you can probably tell, today it was restart!</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Normally, I would just curse Microsoft and get back to it (once my PC had re-started).</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, seeing as the current TV marketing campaign for Windows 7 features some random bloke in the gym claiming to have submitted an idea to Microsoft and they implemented it, I thought I'd try and get my idea included.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Perhaps this has already been fixed in Windows 7 - in which case this has all been a complete waste of time! (Sorry).</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Like I said at the start, if anyone knows where I can go to make product improvement suggestions to Microsoft, please let me know and I'll re-post it somewhere else.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks,</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>CA.</strong></p>

            Basically you're too late for feedback for Vista, Windows 7 is now here:<br />
<br />
So you can provide feedback for Windows 7 here: <br />

<br />
You have to live with controlling the updates yourself even if you have to manually check for updates.<br />
<br />
I don't whether this will change in the future, it's up to the users to configure udates the way they wish to use it and not leave it at automatic.</span>

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

<p>How you activate Windows 10 after reinstalling it depends on how Windows 10 was originally installed on your device. If you activated a free upgrade to Windows 10 or bought and activated Windows 10 from the Windows Store, you have a "Digital entitlement
 / License" for your device. This means you can reinstall the same edition of Windows 10 that your device has a Digital entitlement / License for without entering a product key.
<strong>During reinstallation, if you’re asked to enter a product key, select Skip</strong>. Windows 10 will automatically activate online after the installation is complete.
</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you previously installed and activated a "Retail" version of Windows 10 using a product key, you’ll need to enter the product key during reinstallation.
</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>One of the most common is a generic key associated with "Digital entitlement / License" computers.</strong> Digital entitlement / License is a new method of activation in Windows 10 that doesn't require you to enter a product key:

<h2>            no fix in sight - error 0xC1900101 0x2000C while attempting to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have tried countless times upgrading to Windows 10. I have tried all possible solutions posted on the tech forums including the ones from Microsoft support (media creation tool disk, driver upgrade, unplug devices no anti-virus (really? not even MS security
 essentials?), clean drives, clean boot etc. too many to list.). I even moved from legacy BIOS booting to UEFI. Nothing helped!! Installation stucks after first boot at 2% every time. after hard reset: error code&nbsp;0xC1900101 0x2000C failed APPLY_IMAGE ... SAFE_OS
 blabla.</p>
<p>This is beyond simply annoying. A problem which obviously many people have and Microsoft can only offer random shooting-in-the-dark solutions! I have been waiting for a few weeks now since the first dozen or so attempts and tried again with same results.
 So no one (Microsoft...) seems to care to patch this.</p>
<p>And now I am getting spammed every time I login to my computer with a Windows 10 upgrade message! Unbelievable.
</p>
<p>It's not for lack of trying!! I want to install Windows 10. But hey, my ol' Win 7 works, so why upgrade amirite?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am waiting for a real solution and not some "try this and see" ****.</p>
<p>Why is this error happening? What is the actual cause? There are many explanations out there, all randomly right or wrong depending on the current number of dark spots on the sun I presume.
</p>
<p>If it is a summary of a number of issues than the error code is oddly specific!</p>

<p>I have a very new computer with Windows 7 Professional and two weeks ago it had a critical update.&nbsp; Since then McAfee had problems.&nbsp; I fixed McAfee but yesterday when&nbsp;I turned on the computer&nbsp;I received a message that my Windows was not genuine.&nbsp; I accidently
 clicked on the ignore (or activate later)&nbsp;button instead of the activation button.&nbsp; Now none of the software or applications work&nbsp;and I cannot recover&nbsp;the computer to any previous dates because of the message: file or directory is corrupted and unreadable&nbsp;0x80070570.</p>
<p>I checked today and my Windows 7 is genuine.</p>
<p>Many Microsoft Office updates cannot run also, since then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I fixe the 0x80070570 error and the applications error 0xc0000006?</p>

<p><strong>Buy a new HDD</strong> . Your HDD is dying:</p>

<p>Its possible your system has a recovery partition which you can use to reinstall Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows
 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9,
 F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>------------------------------------</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This is how the recovery
 partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For Dell, press CTRL +
 F11 directly after powering up the unit</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>If the recovery partition is not functional, then you can download Windows 7 Home Premium ISO using the Heidoc instructions at the following link, then create a bootable copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span><span>Download Windows 10, 8, 7 ISOs</span></span></p>
