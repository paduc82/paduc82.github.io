<h2>            Customise how SharePoint appears in the Office Hub</h2>
                    <p>I have my Lumia 710 connected to my Office 365 account.&nbsp; When I go to SharePoint, via the Office Hub, I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Announcements </li><li>Form Templates </li><li>Links </li><li>Shared Documents </li><li>Site Assets </li><li>Style Library </li><li>Tasks</li></ul>
<p>Some of those (Style Library, for example) are not things I want to go into every day, so they are taking up valuable screen space.&nbsp; How can I remove them?</p>
<p>My second, and more important, challenge is getting SharePoint lists to appear in the hub.&nbsp; This is easy enough for a "standard" list - they just appear in the Hub following a refresh.&nbsp; But, I'm struggling with "external" lists (ie those created using Business
 Data Connectivity) - I can't find any way to get those lists into the hub.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>

    <title>Word 2007 AutoCorrect not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lorigolzmane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2007 AutoCorrect not working</h2>
                    I recently got a new computer and loaded Word 2007 on it--a backup disc which I had ordered after purchasing the program via download a couple years ago. The problem I have now, which I didn't have on my old computer with the downloaded version of Word,
 is that even though the AutoCorrect settings are set to automatically replace straight quotes with smart quotes, two hyphens with a dash, etc., Word simply does not do this in any document. I have tried unselecting the AutoCorrect option and then reselecting
 it, but to no avail. Why is this not working?
<div><br />

<div>I'd appreciate any help you might have.</div>

            Note that there are two entirely separate tabs in the AutoCorrect Options dialog that cover these AutoFormat options. The AutoFormat As You Type tab is the one that replaces straight quotes with smart quotes, two hyphens with a dash, and so on as you're
 typing. The AutoFormat tab does the same when you manually run AutoFormat on an existing document. Which is it that you are trying to do? Have you made sure that the options are set correctly on both tabs?

<h2>            Outlook 2010 Non Domain Device connect to Exchange</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have been trying to setup Outlook 2010 – Exchange 2010 on a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Non-Domain Laptop</span> – via Outlook Anywhere. I have followed a number of suggestions both from Microsoft and other threads but to no avail.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop: Windows 10 Home (Build 10240) &amp; connected to the Network via Cable</p>
<p>Exchange Server: Outlook Anywhere is setup and enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of these threads is: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-Outlook-Anywhere-to-connect-to-your-Exchange-server-without-VPN-ae01c0d6-8587-4055-9bc9-bbd5ca15e817?CorrelationId=4096b55b-ba6e-482a-b159-576bc2a69ac2&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;ocmsassetID=HP010102444
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&amp; </p>
<p>http://exchangeserverpro.com/how-to-configure-exchange-server-2010-outlook-anywhere/
</p>
<p>Within the Advanced &amp; Proxy Settings of Outlook I also tried:</p>
<p><em><span>Webmail.domain.com.au</span></em></p>
<p><em>msstd:webmail.domain.com.au</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Network Security: NTLM</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have been advised that the previous employee had this setup. However, the client removed the employees email so I cannot verify the previous settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I either get an error message: Outlook cannot log on. Verify you are connected to the Network and are using the proper server and mailbox name....</p>
<p>Or, I get a Mail Application login pop up. I type the users credentials as domain\username - password combination. However, that pop up just keeps refreshing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also to mention, there is a different <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Non-Domain</span> Laptop that also has Win 10 Home but with Outlook 2016. It seems that this device with Outlook 2016 has
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">no</span> issues in connecting to the Exchange Server &amp; the email is setup with ease.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening up Webmail and log on in from the same device works without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your suggestions and ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>dj</p>

                    In Word 2003, you could select a check box in the Display Options to keep&nbsp;the Hidden Text hidden, so that when&nbsp;you clicked the Show/Hide formatting marks&nbsp;button, the Hidden Text never appeared. To get Hidden Text to appear,&nbsp;you&nbsp;had to&nbsp;first clear&nbsp;the Hidden
 Text check box in the Display Options.&nbsp; Now, in Word 2007, it appears that <u>all</u> the formatting marks (including Hidden Text) appear when you toggle between Show/Hide using the formatting marks button. How do I keep the Hidden Text hidden when I&nbsp;click
 the Show/Hide formatting marks button?&nbsp;

            <p>I think you're not remembering this correctly. In Word 2003 (as in all Word versions), Show/Hide
<span><font color="#000000">¶ toggles between the display of
<strong>all</strong> formatting marks (including Hidden text) and just those that are explicitly checked in the Options. In some circumstances (such as when inserting XE fields), users find that Word toggles on the display of Hidden text. I don't experience
 that in Word 2003; I find that inserting an XE field toggles on the display of all nonprinting characters, so that the Show/Hide
<span>¶ button works just as I expect it to.</span></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><span>If you want to see just specific marks, you can check them off in Word's Options, but the button will still toggle

            <p>I think Karma Chameleon is correct, in Word 2003 you could select which things you wanted to view (i.e., don't check "view all", just check the ones you want); then clicking the
 and the paragraph symbol toggles between the ones you have checked (the "always" ones) and ALL of them. It won't toggle to none. I know 2003 was like this (and I still have it installed on an old computer and just went and confirmed) because I did have terms
 indexed, and I wanted to see tabs, spaces, etc., but not all the index terms. Clicking on the

            <p>I'm sorry, but you are both wrong. I have Word 2003 installed and use it as my default version. As a test, at
<strong>Tools | Options | View</strong>, under "Formatting marks," I checked just "Tabs" and "Paragraph marks." This is what a document looks like with the
<strong>Show/Hide </strong><span><strong>¶</strong></span>&nbsp;button turned
<strong>off</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5567ba00-827e-45eb-855a-8b9d1094bb8d" /></p>
<p>Note that tabs and paragraph marks are displayed in this state. This is how it looks with the button turned
<strong>on</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc02858a-706e-4b15-87f4-9bab7f8ae4a0" /></p>
<p>Note that you can see spaces and Hidden text. And if I go back to <strong>Tools | Options | View</strong>, I see that the box for "All" is checked. This is the way Word works in

<h2>            How to change video export values in powerpoint 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have actually asked help for this issue a while ago but since it seems that nobody has been able to help, I will post this question again.</p>
<p>Does enyone know how to change fps and resolution values when exportin presentation into a video with ppt 2013?</p>
<p>The problem is that powerpoint automatically exports the video with 30fps but I want to create the video with 25fps. Another issue is that you can only create resolution up to 720p but I have a need to export as 1080p.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shyam Pillai helped and kindly informed that he has created a video tool add-in for (&nbsp;<a href="http://skp.mvps.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://skp.mvps.org</a> )&nbsp; ppt2013 for this problem but unfortunatelly this add-in does not work. It causes the powerpoint to crash and advices
 to deactive this add-in to avoid further problems. So that was an dead end there.
</p>
<p>Has enybody else downloaded his add-in and got it working with ppt 2013? If you did, please tell how you managed that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I once saw some forum that told that user can use coding to change these values and ppt would then create the video with wanted values, but I just can't find that information from the web any longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help, this problem is killing me...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Get the assistance from product activation team.. FIREWALLS never block virus malware it is used for packet filtering functions.. you need to install a antivirus solution for this..
<br />
<br />
"A firewall isn't the same thing as an antivirus program. To help protect your computer, you need both a firewall and an antivirus and anti-malware program."<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span><span><span>What else besides a firewall do I need to help protect my computer?
</span></span></span>
<div>
<div>
<p>You should do two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Turn on <span>Windows</span> automatic updating and make sure that updates are automatically installed on your computer. For more information,&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use <span>Microsoft</span> Security Essentials or another antivirus and antimalware program, and keep it up to date by regularly downloading updates from the program manufacturer's website. Many of these programs update
 automatically. They can help protect your computer from spyware and malicious software."<br />

<h2>            Word 2013 Picture Alignment Problem</h2>
                    <p>I have a PNG picture (50x50 pixels). When I add the picture inline with text, and resize it, at some sizes the picture does not align correctly with the base line. It is displayed at an upper position (See picture).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5354259f-a782-4965-ab09-6e28c429e577?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5354259f-a782-4965-ab09-6e28c429e577?upload=true" height="108" width="357" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The left-most picture is the original one (37.5x37.5 pts), the middle has a height of 32.25 pts, the right-most one has a height of 39 pts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I save the document as DOC and reopen all the pictures are aligned correctly. But not with DOCX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug? Is this issue corrected in version 2016?</p>

Thanks in advance</p>

            Word 2013 introduced a new document layout engine that is continued in Word 2016 with some modifications.
<br />
<br />I generally size pictures in another application. (I use TechSmith's SnagIt Editor.)
<br />Word has a reputation for not doing the best with editing pictures (which isn't surprising since it is a word processor).
<br />
<br />My recommendation would be to use the workaround you've found.

<p>I have tried Malwarebytes&nbsp; previously and it identified 12 infections incl. 2 called DNSUnlocker. I had malwarebytes delete those files and my search engine was disabled.&nbsp; I had to reset my computer to an earlier time in order to resolved the browser issue.&nbsp;
 the DNS virus was causing an awful addvertising issue until just after January of this year the add issue went away. At this same time I had read something about Microsoft's new Anti Malware and I assumed<br />
&nbsp;that this had resolved the DNS. issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; When my computer slowed down recently&nbsp; and My Charter Security could not identify any problem, so I downloaded Malwarebytes and again the anti malware ID'd some PUP malware and again, 2 DNS unlocker issues.&nbsp; This time
 I had Malwarebytes quarantine the malware and as a result I cannot open Malwarebytes and I cannot remove the program.&nbsp; It attempts to remove the program but an error message appears&nbsp; "RUNTIME ERROR 46:134 COULD NOT CALL PROC.&nbsp; I have limited computer skills
 and I have not been successful in resetting my computer to an earlier date prior to downloading Malwarebytes.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error <strong>RUNTIME ERROR 46:134 COULD NOT CALL PROC</strong> may happen when you're unable to connect to a server. A program may be unresponsive if it's outdated or corrupted. To better isolate your concern, we'd like to ask if have you tried updating
 your Microsoft Malicious Malware Tool. If you still want to reset your computer, kindly follow the steps in this article:

<p>
Clearing out the Credential Manger worked for a little bit. Outlook 2016 just keeps on going in a login loop with or without MFA activated. This has been going on for quite some time. It would be nice if Microsoft would come out with a patch or just fix the
 dang thing. This is ridiculous!</p>

<p>Hi Casen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should make sure the Outlook client is up to date. Go to <strong>File &gt; Office account &gt; Update Options &gt; Update Now</strong>. Then check if the issue persists. And based on your description, you may use an Office 365 for Business account, you can use&nbsp;Support
 and Recovery Assistant for Office 365 tool. For your reference:</p>

<p>The product licenses we have is Office 365 Enterprise E3. </p>
<p>Already checked for update with Office and Windows and all up to date. </p>
<p>The issue has been going on for the last few months ever since we turned on MFA, but the issue is only arising for users that are on the Surface Laptop/Pro (Windows 10). Other users on Windows 7 are not affected by this issue.

            <p>Hello mayankmehta_886,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting into the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you are getting an error code&nbsp;when entering the store, does this happen via data connection or Wi-Fi? Have you tried different Wi-Fi s?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well you should check how much free storage you do have on the phone itself and if your date and time are set correctly.</p>
<p>Are you facing any other issues apart from this store error on your phone?</p>
<p>did you try syncing your account, do you get any error code/message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>kind regards,</p>
<p>Marta&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the smartphone, you will need to go into ActiveSync on the device. Select "Menu -&gt; Options". With "Exchange Server" highlighted, select "Menu -&gt; Delete". This will remove all Exchange Server settings. You can then
 move forward with all of your new settings.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>What if, thereafter, you want to e-mail the pdf to someone.&nbsp; Can it be done, or not?</blockquote>
<br />
Then you need to "forward" the email to the person. Forwarding retains the attachment and lets you add different recipients and compose a message while also being able to remove the original message the the "FW:" subject prefix. Easy!</blockquote>
<p>No, this does not work in real world scenarios, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Suppose I received the e-mail with the .pdf attached.&nbsp; I open the .pdf with Adobe Reader.&nbsp; The .pdf is automatically saved to the phone.&nbsp; Suppose I delete the e-mail; the .pdf is still saved and can still be opened by Adobe Reader.&nbsp; What if I want to send
 it to somebody a week later, but the original e-mail is deleted, or it has fallen off my server sync?&nbsp; I can't forward the original message, and there is no way to send the .pdf attached to a new message.</p>

<p>Tap the file to open it.&nbsp; It will open in Adobe Reader if you've installed the application to your phone.&nbsp; If you haven't installed the application it will ask you if you want to install it and if you say yes, Adobe Reader will be installed to the phone
 and your PDF file will open up so you can read it.&nbsp; There is no save option - the file gets saved when you open it up.&nbsp; Later if you wnat to read the PDF file again, you can open up Adobe Reader and you'll see a list of the PDF files on the phone.</p>

            Hi Bjad,<br />
<br />
Firstly, I would like to confirm that you have followed the steps in the article Ran provided to uninstall Office instead of just removing the apps from Mac.<br />
<br />
The article Ran provided contains several more steps including deleting several files to make sure that Office is completely removed from your Mac.<br />
<br />
If you have and the issue persists, I would like to confirm whether you have any add-ins or macro that you are using, as it may be changing the normal.dotm file.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Sheen

<h2>            whatsapp download</h2>
                    I opened my phone after a year. Most apps need update. Each time I update the store asks me for a Microsoft account password which I forgot. After going through days of verification process Microsoft did not give my phone a recovery. No apps could be downloaded
 or updated. Shame on Microsoft. The password recovery should be done instead of giving all useless suggestions like open a new account etc...these people do not seem to be attentive.

<h2>            All my appointments are one hour ahead &#40;DST issue&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have an HTC Fuze smart phone (Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional operating system) using ATT wireless and haven't had any issues relating to synching between my smart
 phone and the Microsoft MyPhone service since installing the MyPhone software on 10/25/2009.&nbsp; I do not synch my smart phone to&nbsp;my computer. &nbsp;However, I just noticed that all my appointments are 1 hour ahead of the proper time.&nbsp; My phone's clock automatically
 changed with Daylight Savings Time and it is the correct time and zone.&nbsp;The Microsoft MyPhone service also lists me at the right time zone when I log in there on my PC.&nbsp; &nbsp;HELP!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; I don't know why this happened and I don't know how to fix it.&nbsp; I live
 in the Eastern US time zone (Florida).&nbsp; Since discovering this, I've installed the latest DST update from Microsoft (KB977014) for my phone's 6.1 operating system, but that hasn't changed anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

I've not experienced any issues at this point in time with my Touch Pro2.&nbsp; See if this makes a difference since you have installed the latest DST fix.&nbsp; Try changing to a different timezone (say for example Pacific).&nbsp; Soft reset your device then change it back
 to Eastern.&nbsp; Soft reset again and see if it works correctly.<br />
<br />

<p><span>Might it help to install a newer version of the Microsoft MyPhone service (currently version 01.05.2410.0400)?&nbsp; If you want to install a newer version, must you first
 un-install the current version or will that cause me to lose all my data?&nbsp; I do not want to lose my data.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<br />
I do not know if that makes a difference or not.&nbsp; Certainly reinstalling will not hurt if you choose to try it.&nbsp; I am not aware if there are any changes in MyPhone that would have an effect on the timezone but I will will check.<br />
<br />
If you do choose to reinstall, your data will be preserved.&nbsp; You could always archive all the data as a precaution but i don't think that is needed.&nbsp; If you remove the device from the portal, reinstall on your device then sync, all your data will be there.

<span>
<p><span>Tried last night and it didn't change anything.&nbsp; Note that when I rebooted after temporarily changing to the Pacific time zone, I went to change the time zone setting

<p><span>Also tried the same thing above after unchecking “Automatic change time zone and clock” with no luck (with my HTC FUZE with ATT with Windows Mobile 6.1:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Start, Settings, Personal Tab, Phone, Time Zones Tab, unchecked “Automatic change time zone and clock”).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I also just tried installing a newer version of the Microsoft MyPhone service (originally version 01.05.2410.0400 from download on 10/25/2009).<span>&nbsp;
</span>I first uninstalled the program, rebooted, no change with appointment time issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I freshly downloaded the MyPhone program and re-installed.<span>&nbsp;

This indicates to me that the timezone is being set by your provider.&nbsp; I am not sure how that affects the DST update that you installed (I don't think it should have an effect BTW).</p>
<p>If you enter a new appointment at this time, is it recording correctly on MyPhone when you sync?</p>

I've got an LG Incite with WM 6.1 on board. The problem started after I did a brain wipe not long after DST ended. Your idea fixed the problem. Thanks.

            <p>Hi TechSol01,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever enabled audit log search? If yes, we suggest you follow the steps below to use
<strong>Audit Log Search</strong> to verify if the user<span>’</span>s license is deleted by other admins.</p>
<p>1. Go to Security &amp; Compliance Center via <a href="https://protection.office.com/#/homepage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://protection.office.com/#/homepage</a>.</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>Search &amp; investigation</strong> on the left menu and choose <strong>
Audit log search</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a45a4a3-c12a-4581-a6ce-1b6266297a0f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a45a4a3-c12a-4581-a6ce-1b6266297a0f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above don’t help, please provide the following information for our troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1. Does it only happen to the specific user? </p>
<p>2. Does the entire license get removed or certain licenses get removed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

            <p>Hi Tina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have checked Audit log but didn't found any activity for "License Changed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;See the below inline as&nbsp;answer your questions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does it only happen to the specific user?&nbsp; -&nbsp; Few Users</p>
<p>2. Does the entire license get removed or certain licenses get removed? - Its not for all users, happening for random users. Also observed most of these users were associated with K1 license.</p>

            <p>Under a 2 tier CSP, there is a distributor CSP portal where you add or remove licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a unique situation that we have encountered when a license is removed from the CSP portal, and the removed licenses create a under-license situation, then seemingly random users will be unable to access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example</p>
<p>
</p><p>CSP portal licenses purchased = 10 K1</p>
<p>Portal licenses assigned = 8 k1 (2 K1 free)</p>
<p>
</p><p>CSP portal licenses removed = 4 (balance 6 K1)</p>
<p>Portal licenses assigned = 8 (2 licenses short)</p>
<p>Warning in Portal and 2 users unable to login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if that is your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check if Audit logs have been turned on in the first place (else nothing to show).</p>

</p><p><span>We checked users in your private message. They have been assigned licenses. Did you re-assign them licenses after the former licenses were removed automatically?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, as you mentioned these users had K1 license before, was the entire K1 license removed from their accounts (when they access Office portal they cannot see tiles for any app) or just some services in their account was disabled (when they access

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, Once those users reported that they can't access their email on Office 365 portal, then we reassigned license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there was few users who faced this issue not all, and we didn't checked whether they were able to access other services or not,&nbsp;we only checked Outlook page on office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi TechSol01,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After you re-assign the licenses, does the issue persist? Or does the issue happen to new users?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still exists, I’d like to confirm the following information for further investigation.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>How are these users’ accounts created? Are they created in the Office 365 admin center or synced from local AD?</span></li><li><span>When the issue happens, capture a screenshot of the user’s license page for us from Office 365 admin center &gt; Users &gt; Active Users. And let us know which option is
 unticked.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Ran</span></p>

<h2>            My emails are being bounced back from certain email addresses</h2>
                    <p>I've recently signed on for the business package of 365 Email and about 50% are bouncing back. &nbsp;These are some of the messages I'm receiving:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Diagnostic-Code: smtp; 550 1***.1**.1**.1* is not allowed to send mail from [my domain]</span></p>
<p><span>Diagnostic-Code: smtp; 553-SPF (Sender Policy Framework) domain authentication</span></p>
<p><span>Diagnostic-Code: smtp; 550 5.7.1 Sender ID (PRA) Not Permitted</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I've spoken to Microsoft and they said I just need to call all these companies and ask them to allow my email address. &nbsp;This seems ridiculous - I've&nbsp;never had to do this with any other hosting service. &nbsp;They recommended I change my IP address,
 which I did, but it hasn't worked.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Any ideas how to resolve this as I'm close to cancelling my subscription and going somewhere else. &nbsp;Thanks!!</span></span></p>

Hello Skye,<br />
<br />
What mail application and mail flow are you using?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are you sending bulk email or did you set up a multifunction device/ application to send email using Office 365?<br />
<br />
You can try to check with changing your custom domain email address to default onmicrosoft.com domain email address using admin centre and then send email to those receipents.<br />
<br />
In that way you can determine whether it is your domain issue or receipent email are rejecting from their server side.<br />
<br />
Hope this may help you.

</p><p>Do you want me to try to follow the instructions in the resolution anyway?</p>
<p>

            <p>The error log indicates that some components of Excel are missing. I can only surmise that something went wrong during the updating process. From your log:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Command: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Excel</span><br />
<p>
</p><p><span>Build number and project name for the component specified at that path indicate that something's missing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Things to do and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Make sure the Excel application is in Applications &gt; Microsoft Office 2011 directory. It might be that the Excel application file is somewhere else. Just drag it into the proper folder, restart your Mac and things
 should magically get better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Mac OS X disc permissions may be incorrect. Run Disk Utility (Applications&gt;&nbsp;Utilities) and repair your startup drive's disk permissions</span></p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I checked and the Excel application was in the proper folder</p>
<p>2. I run Disk utility and repaired the disk permissions</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I open, clear the contents of 1 of the columns and by the time I moved the mouse to save the change &nbsp;excel stop responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The funny thing is that I am able to open any other file and use excel without problems.</p>
<p>Do you think I need to re-do the whole file again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help</p>
<p>Nelson</p>

            <p>Since this is a problem with just one file, let's do a couple other checks before abandoning the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Spotlight to make sure you don't have two or more copies of the Excel application on your Mac. There should be only 1 copy, and it must be in the correct folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, rule out Excel preferences as a source of trouble. Do this by making a new User account in mac OS X preferences. Then open the problem workbook there. If it runs OK there, then we can go back to the regular account and trash Excel's preferences there.
 If the problem persists, then we can rule out bad preferences as the source the trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some other troubleshooting steps you might take:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try uploading the problem file to <a href="http://onedrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive</a> and see how it behaves there. If it's OK, use OneDrive to save the file. That might fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you can successfully open the file, do that and immediate use File &gt; Save As and change the file format to (.xlsm) or (.xlsb). Then Quit Excel. Restart your Mac, then see if the resulting saved file is normal.</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Jim,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. I used Spotlight: I have just 1 copy of Excel in my Mac</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. I had another user in my Mac, I copied the file to a share drive, I opened the file using the other user, cleared contents in one of the columns and after that the excel file was not responding</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. I opened and saved the document as .xlsm ,
</span><span>re-booted the computer</span><span>, cleared contents from one of the columns and when trying just to click into another cell, excel stopped responding. Same
 with&nbsp;</span><span>.xls</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I did not try the OneDrive because I need to signup and I already have enough users and passwords to keep with.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Any other suggestion you&nbsp;</span><span>might have before&nbsp;redoing the whole model?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Regards</span></span></p>

            If you know someone with Excel 2013 for Windows, there's a special little triangle in the File &gt; Open dialog that has an Open and Repair option. Try that.

            <p>I delete and then re-installed Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new file using the same data, everything was working find till yesterday when it crashed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can work in other files, but for some reason Excel does not like the data I am using , or multiple formulas and pivots...</p>

            I setup an iCloud account using the following in Outlook Mac. I don't see why it wouldn't work in Entourage.<br />
<br />
IMAP (Incoming Mail Server) information:<br />
<br />
Server name: imap.mail.me.com<br />
SSL Required: Yes<br />
Port: 993<br />
Username: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (use your @me.com address from your iCloud account)<br />
Password: Your iCloud password<br />
SMTP (outgoing mail server) information:<br />
<br />
Server name: smtp.mail.me.com<br />

            Rebuilding does not fix all issues. You will need to move to the new Identity.<br />
<br />
How to manually move your data. (when import fails and/or you need to move to a new Identity same version or revert to an older version)<br />

<h2>            Excel 2016 after update to latest version has issue with saving changes to file on SharePoint On-Premis</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after update Office 2016 to latest version (Excel (Office) 2016 version 1805 (16.0.9330.2073) 64bit) we have issue with saving changes in Excel sheet stored on SharePoint ON-Premis:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If I have sheet of Excel stored on SharePoint ON-Premis (rights on folders, files and sites are correct - read and write) and I open it (from IE, Chrome...) for editing (Excel open automaticaly, no downloading) and I want to save changes to this sheet
 -&gt; click to "Save" icon in left top corner (Floppy Disk with circulal arrowes), the choice of "Save" switch to "Save as" and appear window with path, where I want to store it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>..."OK", I would say - it navigated me to location of SharePoint, where I have that Excel sheet, I clicked to "Save" button, it trounced me, that file with this name is allready exist and asked me if I want rewrite it, I choosed rewrite, on bottom panel
 of Excel sheet it said "Saving to SharePoint.." and&nbsp;it also seemed so. I closed the sheet, refreshed the page, opened the sheet again, where SharePoint&nbsp;declared it to me that this sheet was edited by me few second ago, but "oh, come on" no changes saved here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2) Fine, I tried direct way, as Excel want -&gt; "Save as" button and I have the same issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Fine, I opened store place of SharePoint over File Explorer (icon in library options) where is that Excel sheet stored, again I made the changes and saving and also the same as in point no. 1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) The last variant was, that I made the changes in the sheet, no clicking on "Save" or "Save as" button, but I clicked to close cross of Excel -&nbsp;it trounced me, that I have the changes and maybe if I want to save it, I clicked to YES. Again, it opened window
 of "Save as" and again it navigated me to location of SharePoint, where I have that Excel sheet stored, I clicked to "save" button, ofcourse it shouted to me, that file with this name is allready exist, so I rewrited it and sheet closed by self. I refreshed
 the page, opened that sheet, where again was info about my editing few second ago, and "voilà", the change was there =) ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I want to ask, what kind of strange "BUG" is it and if have someone else this issue too and if someone solving (solved) this ;)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And one filling info:</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if is this "latest" Office installed on Windows 10 1805 or earlier or Windws 7 - this is really in Office, where this is happening all people in our company which was given new station with fresh installed Office or just now updated Offices
 - I tested it on one machine where were updates for Office in pending and before installing this pending updates, saving changes in Excel sheet in the same location was working clasic way, but after installing pending updates and update to latest version it
 stop working as well. Repairing Office not helped too :-/</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, thank you very much for your tips and informations =)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Lukas</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moved From: &nbsp;Office / Excel / Windows 10 / Office 2016</p>

                    I am unsure how to report an issue with the Bing rewards system. The second question on this iteration is multiple choice, and the correct answers is listed but will not register, nor will any of the other three answers be accepted, leaving one stuck and
 unable to proceed.
