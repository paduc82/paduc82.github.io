                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I use Windows Live Mail, and I have email hosting with Fasthosts.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I want to upgrade a 'Mail Lite' mailbox to a 'Mail Extra' mailbox... just to have a 2gb mailbox instead of the basic 100mb mailbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I don't want to lose any previous emails or contacts I have already have in Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
So, before I upgrade the mailbox type, I want to ensure that all existing emails are backed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
If I move all mail from Inbox and Sent Items to Windows Live Mail 'Storage Folders', are they then safely backed up?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Or do I need to 'export' all old email that I want to retain for future reference and import again when the upgrade is completed?</p>

<p>I wonder why you need a larger mailbox when you're using a mail client anyway. Windows Live Mail stores each message you receive and send as an individual file. Keeping copies of messages received also on the server (i.e. in the mailbox) is a sort of backup,
 in that you have two copies of each message, one local and one in the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the type of mailbox should not have any effect at all on Windows Live Mail, so long as you continue to use the same method of connecting to it - POP3, or IMAP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing an account from Windows Live Mail deletes all the accounts folders and permanently removes their contents. It isn't easy to do this accidentally, but just in case, you may want to consider copying or moving important messages from account folders
 to archive folders under Storage folders. These won't be affected by changes to the mail account. It's then easy to maintain a backup of important messages simply by keeping a copy of Storage folders somewhere safe - on an external disk drive, say, and/or
 at OneDrive, where you already have 5GB of free storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last suggestion: it's often not a good idea to keep old messages in the inbox at the server. The more messages you have there, the greater the chances of something going wrong. This can be avoided simply by doing some regular housekeeping, say once a
 month or so. Create archive folders in webmail and move messages out of the inbox into them, leaving only the most recent ones in the inbox.

<p>
</p><p>Noel... thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you have answered my question by suggesting I move all messages I need to keep into Storage Folders on Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already do the housekeeping you are suggesting and regularly move messages to Storage Folders... I don't keep messages in the Inbox for long, and I realise that all the account's folders would be deleted if I delete the Windows Live Mail Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't intend making a change to the Windows Live Mail account... it is my email hosting with Fasthosts that is going to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My domain name and email hosting is with Fasthosts Internet Ltd.</p>
<p>I receive and send email using Windows Live Mail, and my email account is set up as IMAP.</p>
<p>Currently, I have basic email hosting with Fasthosts, and this has 100mb of space, but I can upgrade this at no cost to 2gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sent and received email stays on the Fasthosts server until I delete it or move it to the Storage Folders in Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>Unless I regularly move or delete emails from the WLM IMAP Account's Inbox and Sent Items, the 100mb of space at Fasthosts gets used up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was OK when I first set up the email hosting account, but now I send and receive much more email, and 100mb is used up too quickly, and requires almost constant housekeeping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgrade the Fasthosts account I will lose all emails currently hosted with Fasthosts... this is why I needed to know if my emails were effectively backed-up and safely stored if I moved them all to WLM Storage Folders before changing the Fasthosts
 hosting account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that answer your question about why I need a larger mailbox? Or am I misunderstanding something here?</p>

<h2>            Looking for a game chair for legally blind player</h2>
                    
<p>I apologize in advance if this is in the wrong location and<br />
or if the spelling is terrible as due to an incidenct nearly two years ago I am<br />
legally blind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking for a decent but no frills game chair. Due to<br />
my above mentioned condition, I must sit roughly one and a half to two feet<br />
from the screen in order to properly see enough detail in order to play as well<br />
as use the computer that is now hooked up to the TV. As a consinquence, I am<br />
often sitting on the floor for extended periods of tim with no support for my<br />
back. I have tried looking on amazon for a decent chair, one that has no legs<br />
mind you, but again, due to my condition, reading the reviews and or using a<br />
text reader can be quite difficult so Im hoping to be pointed in the right<br />
direction here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am basicly looking for game chair that has no legs, offers<br />
good rear and back support, and ideally doesn’t have speakers built into them<br />
(I have turtle beach speakers already). Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>goto wal-marts website and search game chairs or video game chairs whatever you want and it'll come up with a good selection they have a video rocker which is just a chair with somewhat good back support (depends on your height) it has no legs and no speakers
 and is cheap </p>

<h2>            Surface Book &#40;1st gen&#41; battery limit</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The addition of the battery limit feature is very good as I mainly use my surface book (1st gen) attached on dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One question though, the tablet was limited to 50% charge but the base kept charging to full. Is there anyway to enable battery limit for the base as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That aside, for future wishlist, to be able to set the percentage instead of just toggle 50%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the bad english</p>

<p>Hi Pat</p>
<p>I tried to do what you advised, but no luck, I kept getting the message that windows would not let me load anything in safe mode.</p>
<p>In my original question I did say that the compatibility mode would not work, so with both these problems I decided to have another look.</p>
<p>I then used the upgrade tool and after half a day finally got the PC up and running again, then the compatibility tool decided to work and then loaded PSP no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for taking the time to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. other things now also seem to be working better after upgrading.</p>

            Thats by design. If you want to see your contacts, click the Contacts menu between the alerts and dial pad.
<br />
<br />If you don't like this layout, I recommend you reinstall Skype Classic:
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Hi  vineetbatra, Activation of Windows 10 after a format and re-install should be Automatic, you should not need a Product Key
<br />
<br />Activation issues after a clean install of Windows 10 is generally because a different Edition (Home, Pro . . etc.) has been installed, that does not match the original Edition installed on that PC
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to System - About
<br />
<br />What Edition of Windows 10 is reported there, and does it match the previously installed Edition?       
        </p>

            Press Windows key + X
<br />
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command:
<br />
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey

<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt chat support:

<br />Keep in mind, if the laptop originally had Windows 10 Home installed and you currently have Windows 10 Pro installed, the built in key won't activate Windows 10 Pro.

<h2>            How to control TV Tuner in Windows 10</h2>
                    Windows 10 deleted Windows Media Center that I had on Windows 7.&nbsp; I used Windows Media Center to CONTROL my TV Tuner card in my PC.&nbsp; I would schedule TV shows to be recorded off the air (antenna connected to card) and then play back when I wanted.&nbsp; I could
 also watch live TV shows off the air.&nbsp; How do I CONTROL my TV Tuner card without Windows Media Center??&nbsp; An answer I received was to use the Movies &amp; TV app.&nbsp; According to what I read this app is only to show movies and TV Shows I purchase from the App Store.

<p>I have tried a number of times to install flight simulator X deluxe onto my desktop - firstly when running windows vista and now windows 7.</p>
<p>Error 1311. Source file not found:E:\D2Feat~1.cab. Verify that the file exists and that you can access it.</p>
<p>I have tried installing with a clean boot and&nbsp;as administrator. I have tried copying all files from disks onto desktop (though this proved challenging as&nbsp;when going through explorer could only find readme files so had to do this through another pc)&nbsp;and installing.
 Always the same error message.</p>
<p>Contacted microsoft who promised to send out other uncoorupted disks which never arrived so sent back to vendor and had replacements sent out - still the same error when loading. Help please!!</p>

            What finally worked for me when I copied FS disk 1 to my desktop was to copy the contents of FS disk 2 and put the files in the same folder.&nbsp; When you are asked if you want to replace the files with the same name on both disks say no.&nbsp; This has seemed
 to work well for me when nothing else did.<br />

<h2>            Save to a different location&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason when I download things from the Marketplace, it default saves everything to my hard drive. This wouldn't be an issue except that it's almost full so I have a USB that I am storing all of my arcade games on. So when I go to update Halo Waypoint
 (which is on the USB) which for some reason requires you to re-download the game every time, it automatically creates a new copy on my HDD instead of just overwriting the one on my USB, which is what I want and I have no way to change this.</p>
<p>The only thing I can do is wait until it's done, then go to my system memory and move it from the HDD to the USB. A simple yet annoying task that I shouldn't have to do when I download things.</p>
<p>When I hit the "download again" button, the Save To: area is greyed out with my HDD, and when I press "download again" for the second time the "change storage device" option shows up for half of a second then disappears, making my only option to cancel the
 download.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong here or is this "the way it is"?</p>

<p>Sadly it is "the way it is" as you put it. Downloads from the marketplace must be stored on the internal memory while downloading, and then you can send them to your USB memory. Waypoint having to completely redownload is unfortunate in this situation.</p>

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ceffdf41-7637-4f40-8884-b7f68333d444">
<p>
</p><p>Windows Calendar - like some other "standard" Windows 8 Apps - is pretty basic and was obviously designed to expedite tasks "on the fly". As soon as it comes to advanced settings for those Apps you need to switch to the "extended" version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A good example is changing the 1st day of the week / the starting hour of the day... To do this you need to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;http://Outlook.com (what I called the "extended" version of Windows 8 Mail, Calendar, People... Apss).&nbsp;So, from your preffered Internet browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open http://Outlook.com and enter your email address + password if required<br />
==&gt; By default it shows your emails</li><li>Click on the arrow down sign that is next to <strong>Outlook</strong> - top left corner of the page<br />
==&gt; This displays 4 tiles: Mail, People, Calendar and SkyDrive</li><li>Click on the Calendar tile<br />
==&gt; This displays your calendar</li><li>Click the Options link - just before a blue <strong>?</strong> - on the top right corner of the screen</li></ul>
<p>Don't forget to Save your changes once you're done... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers &amp; helps</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Lz.</p>

<p>Dear Santosh,</p>
<p>I have uninstalled them using the control panel -&gt; uninstall programs. The windows that come up tell me that the program is uninstalled, however, when I search using search programs from the start button, there is still "debris." When I try to delete this
 debris, it sometimes seems to go, and sometimes refuses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reference link.</p>
<p>Good Day to You!</p>

<p>Dear Santosh,</p>
<p>I need to check back on this, but I seem to remember that the error message was that the file was already in use or that there was a missing part of the program that prevented me from uninstalling the whole game. I must try again to get&nbsp;the correct error
 message. Sorry.</p>

<p><span>This problem occurs because there are incorrect entries in the Shell folder of the user who is logged on to Microsoft Windows. When Windows Installer
 accesses the Shell folder assignment of the user who is logged on to the computer, Windows Installer cannot locate the correct entry. The solution is in</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/886549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/886549</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The steps to correct this problem involve editing the Windows Registry.&nbsp; Modifying REGISTRY settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that
 may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of REGISTRY settings can be solved. Modifications of these settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;</span>I suggest you first
 backup your registry as follows: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the steps to fix it.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click Run, type<strong>regedit
</strong>in the Open box, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the following registry key:</span></p>
<p><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders\</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete the entries that show the path that is listed in the error message.</span></p>
<span>From KB 886549</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/886549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/886549</span></span></a></span><span>:<span>&nbsp;</span>Open
 Regedit again.&nbsp;In the left pane, right-click <strong>User Shell Folders</strong>, point to<strong>New</strong>, click
<strong>Expandable String Value</strong>, type the Name value that you want to reinstate (AppData)&nbsp;and then press ENTER. Right-click that&nbsp;value, click<strong>Modify</strong>, type the value in the
<strong>Value data</strong> box for the Value name, and then click<strong>OK. The value data should be:&nbsp;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming.</strong><br />
<br />
Step 8 of KB 886549 suggests that you also check the values in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders. However, in fixing my problem, I did not have to modify any of the values in that registry key.<span>&nbsp;</span>If
 this does not work, follow ALL the steps in the referenced article.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</span>

<p>Are you telling me that you provided the ENTIrE error message and there wasn't anything else included like a file path that was causing the problem (like it almost always does - is there one for %APPDATA%)?&nbsp; How many entries are there in this location?&nbsp;
 If only a few, could you list them for me?</p>

<p>Hello roderick h,</p>
<p>Did you download the file from 886549 and then run the automatic FIXIT? This usually fixes most error 1606. If not, then you can manually run regedit and fix the entry yourself. If you don't feel comfortable changing entries in the registry, then you might
 want to find a friend who can help or take it to a reliable computer repair shop.</p>
<p>Please let us know the steps you have taken and we will be glad to help.</p>
<p>We need more information than what do i delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>UFD Detected on Other Computers But Not Mine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            UFD Detected on Other Computers But Not Mine</h2>
                    I have a USB flash drive ('UFD') that is detected by other Windows computers, but not by my computer. This is a USB 2.0 flash drive.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I insert the UFD to a USB port on my computer I don't hear the 'connected' sound, and the UFD does not show up in File Explorer, Devices and Printers, or in Disk Management. My computer runs Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, when I connect the UFD to other computers running Windows 8 and Windows 7, the drive is instantly detected and shows up in File Explorer - with a drive letter - as well as Devices and Printers and Disk Management.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So why isn't it detected by my own computer?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's what I've tried so far:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>On my own computer</i> -&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>plugged the UFD into several different USB ports - it was never recognized</li><li>plugged other UFDs in these same ports - the devices were recognized every time</li></ul>
<i>On other computers</i> -&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>formatted the UFD and tried again to plug it into my own computer - it was not recognized</li><li>assigned a drive letter to the UFD that I have never used on my own computer, then&nbsp;tried again to plug it into my own computer - it was not recognized</li></ul>
Since this UFD <i>is</i> recognized on other computers, and other UFDs <i>are</i> recognized on my computer, it seems that the problem is specific to the combination of this UFD and my computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This UFD is empty, and since it's old and didn't cost much when it was new, I wouldn't mind if I had to toss it. Still, just for the personal challenge I'd like to figure out why it's not getting recognized. Any ideas?</div>
                </div>

            And here is the correct answer, which I obtained with extensive internet searching:
<div><br />
<div>If an otherwise perfectly functioning UFD is recognized on <i>other</i> computers but not on
<i>your</i> computer, the problem may be that your computer previously assigned this UFD a drive letter that is currently used or reserved on your computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To solve this, attach the UFD to another computer where it is recognized, and use the other computer's Disk Management tool to assign a drive letter to the UFD which is not currently in use or reserved by your computer. In my case, I assigned drive letter
 X, which I have never used on my computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The next time I inserted the UFD to my computer, Windows 8 recognized it instantly and issued it an available drive letter. Problem solved.</div>

<h2>            Re-downloading issues</h2>
                    
<p>So, let me give the full story so there are no missing details. I live in the UK but I am currently in France staying with my parents for the summer. My account is registered in the UK, my copy of Black Ops is the UK version. While I was in the UK, I downloaded
 the Escalation Map Pack and the First Strike Map Pack both of them were the [EN] versions and I didn't have any problems downloading them. However, I downloaded them on a different console (my housemate's 360). I saved the Escalation Pack to my USB so that's
 fine, but I seem to be unable to re-download the First Strike map pack. It gets to about 97-99% before it says it can't download the content. I've tried to clear my system cache but that hasn't worked, I've looked at the port settings on my router and they
 all seem fine, is there anything else I can do?</p>

<p>Since your account and the actual region you are in don't match, it's causing you to be unable to redownload it. You would either have to wait until you go back to the UK or create a new account.</p>

<p>Seriously? Now I know you're probably not representative of Xbox's rules and regulations, but could you shed any light on why the physical region makes any difference? Or rather, why there isn't some form of failsafe for people who move a lot. I've been
 in four different countries in the past six months, hence my relative anger at the system =\</p>

<p>There is some content that is region locked, and in this case, it's the content you're trying to download. For that DLC, the account region, disc region, and actual location all have to match in order for it to be downloaded. It's basically a way to keep
 people from creating an account with false information to try to download something that's not available in their own country.

            Have you tried reverting back to your previous build? Although, if this was caused by a firmware update, I doubt you'll be able to revert back to the previous version.
