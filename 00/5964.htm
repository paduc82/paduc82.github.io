    <title>Music playback issues with Lumia 950 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Music playback issues with Lumia 950</h2>
                    <p>I had this issue for a while now, having multiple causes which i will list here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is hard to explain this issue, since it has multiple variations, but they all boil down to one result:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The music just stops playing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the scenarios i have encountered:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.) Surfing the Internet with Edge.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens all the time, where i just surf around some tech-sites and suddenly the music just stops.</p>
<p>The App then reports, that the music device is already in use by another device, with an error Code&nbsp;</p>
<p>So surfing AND listening to music is almost impossible!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.) Just listening to music.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a real pain and it happens randomly every day.</p>
<p>The App just stops playing. It doesn't have to be Groove Music, it happens with every music player.</p>
<p>I am just sitting in the subway, not even touching my phone and suddenly i hear a loud *POP* and the sound is completely gone</p>
<p>and i mean COMPLETELY.</p>
<p>Not even system sounds are audible, indicating, that the whole audio device just gave up.</p>
<p>I have encountered multiple variations on that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) The app just stops! It is like i pressed the stop, or pause button.</p>
<p>The music will continue once i press start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes right where it left off, but other times it just needs a while and then starts at the beginning of the song.</p>
<p>Really annoying, when listening to audio books.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) The app just stops and it needs 1-2 minutes until everything magically kicks back into action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) The audio device just gives up, but the app continues playing. Here it takes up to 5 minutes for everything getting back to normal!</p>
<p>
</p><p>d) Everything seems to just soflock, but internally it keeps going. After 2 minutes, everything just turns back to normal, but 2 minutes of audio playback have passed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e) Softlock! This is a real pain. Here everything just stops working. Sometimes it recovers after 5 minutes, but other times not.</p>
<p>Only recovery is a reboot!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing all of them seem to share is: <strong>DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING!</strong></p>
<p>Especially touching the play-button, will almost certainly cause the system to softlock. The only recovery, again, is a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to circumvent the issue, by using an external DAC (A Creative Sound BlasterX G1 portable), but no luck.</p>
<p>Yes, the external DAC works (which is an awesome thing!), but the issue happens here too and that tells me, that it is a general audio problem with Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>There is no way, that both devices are broken, especially the brand new external one.</p>
<p>And NO, it is NOT the sensor, that stops playback, when the phones are unplugged. This is a feature the Sound Blaster doesn't support at all, with standard drivers! So the headphones aren't the cause. Besides, i used different ones to test this issue, ranging
 from little headsets, to external speakers, an amp and my Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro and 990 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only situations, where it doesn't seem to happen, is bluetooth and the internal speaker!</p>
<p>I have tested some bluetooth speakers and those seem to work just fine, as do the external speakers, but i did not have too much time to test this, so take this with caution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I probably missed a couple of aspects, but it all in all seems, that Windows 10 mobile has some annoying issues here.</p>
<p>It happens every day, multiple times, randomly.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is, i know two people, who have the exact same phone and they're using it without any issues!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really thinking about moving back to android, but i kinda don't want to, because the Lumia 950 is the best phone i had so far.</p>
<p>Besides: A new phone is expensive ;)<br />

    <title>Emails deleted for no reason - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Emails deleted for no reason</h2>
                    <p>I have seen other threads on this but have not yet found an answer. Emails are being randomly deleted from my Live account which I access on my desktop via Outlook. Other email addresses are NOT similarly affected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails are being deleted from my inbox and folders. Like other people before, these include important emails, in my case car insurance, pet insurance and holiday bookings. I have set up a rule for new messages to be moved to an Archive folder after three
 days, this seems to keep them safe. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked rules, there are no other rules set up. I have tried to recover the emails via a link posted elsewhere, but no emails are found.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss and very wary of continuing to use this email address. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially posted this question to the Microsoft community who have advised me to try here. This is obviously an ongoing issue, has a solution been found yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Sue.</p>

            <p>I have exactly the same issue with mu Lumia 930. I have tried turning my phone on and off, tried checking for new updated, looked for new builds, and up voted the fast battery drain issues in Windows Feedback. This issue has been going on for some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally for me Microsoft Edge was sapping most of my battery life, then I disabled its ability to work in the background. However looking at my phone now (which dropped from 81% when I arrived in the office to 5% 20 minutes ago), Edge (which is listed
 as not allow)&nbsp;has used 50.3% (apparently most while it was active, and some whilst it wasn't) of my battery in the last 48 hours, followed by facebook App @ 17.2% then Messenger @ 12.5% then Mail and Calendar @ 10.7%</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I suspect that mail might be one of the issues, as it is taking ages to sync my mail (via WiFi or OTA).</p>

            Hi Stacy
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor and believe I can help with regards to your question.
<br />
<br />Are you putting the hyperlink directly into the text, or for the whole text box?
<br />
<br />Are you using the same slide master template for each of the other slides?
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you have any queries or questions.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards
        </p>

            Try inserting an action button that links back to the TOC slide instead. That will work on a slide master. You can style it to look like a footer as well.

    <title>Search feature is not working in Outlook.com. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suzanne_b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search feature is not working in Outlook.com.</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, I am using a hotmail account (converted to outlook.com account) and have not been able to use the search function for over a year. Every search results in the message that no emails were found with those search parameters, even if I am looking
 directly at a message in my inbox that I searched for. The advanced search has similar results. I have tried multiple browsers, multiple devices, updating my browsers and plugins, etc but to no avail. Upon searching the forums here I discovered multiple threads
 regarding this, but the only solution I could find was a "temporary" one to download Outlook and use it on my computer rather than online, a solution that I am not interested in as I don't want it taking up space and really need the functionality of having
 it accessible from any device. I did see a microsoft rep talk about needing to re-index my account, but there are no instructions regarding how to do that. I am really hoping to get this issue resolved asap, so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</span></p>

<p>Good day and it's a pleasure assisting you with your concern regarding not being able to utilize the Search feature.</p>

<p>Just to verify, do you have a <font>POP or other account configured&nbsp;in your account? If you do, please be informed that using POP aggregation or managing email accounts with large volumes of emails can hit&nbsp;your max quota very quickly.
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</span><span>so&nbsp;kindly</span>&nbsp;provide us the&nbsp;information I have outlined below<font color="#000000"> in the private message that I've created for you for further investigation.

            <blockquote>Hi RD_P. It seemed like such a hassle to send all of this in for something that should be easily fixed, so despite years of using hotmail, I set it to forward and now use it only through my gmail account. :) Much easier to search
 and set up filters and I am wondering why I didn't do it sooner. If I didn't have so many things already set up under this email address, I would go ahead and just switch entirely, but the forwarding method is working great and I don't have to worry about
 changing anything else. I can even send emails from my gmail account and make them look like they were sent from my hotmail. Works for me! Good luck finding a solution that works for you as well! :)</blockquote>

            This problem has existed for over a year for many Hotmail users, and it's only gotten worse. Microsoft must be completely baffled since they just send everyone private messages asking for fiddler logs and keywords, followed by no action. The problem is
 that we've invested so many years in this system that it's difficult to leave it. But we should, and for those of us who've been paying for the premium service all this time, considering the pain we're going through, a large lawsuit may be in order. I think
 about $100,000,000 would get Microsoft's attention...

<h2>            PowerPoint on SmartPhones</h2>
                    Can you create a PowerPoint presentation with hyperlinks, animations, and transitions that can be viewed on smartphones and offline? I've converted a ppt to an interactive PDF but it won't show most animations and transitions. &nbsp;A PowerPoint Show requires
 the user download a view app and we&nbsp;have thousands of users and can't guarantee they will do that. &nbsp;Seems so simple, but I'm stuck. &nbsp;Suggestions?

            Hi Cory,
<div><br />
<div>It seems you missed my answer post on <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macstart/mac-office-2011-update-1424-error-encountered/dfe71966-ebf3-4baf-bcf6-e8d3190a184a?tab=AllReplies">
the previous thread</a>. I've since split your post into it's own thread so we can focus on your specific issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Below is the answer that's posted in the previous thread. If you could, give it a read and see if the solutions described there work for you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>
There are two separate 14.2.4 installation issues that have shown up in this thread.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The first issue (and most common in this thread) stems from re-installing on top of existing installations. In general, don’t do this. Re-installing on top of existing installations can re-introduce files that should not be present.&nbsp;If you need to re-install,
 please be sure to remove Office 2011 as described on the following links:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b><a href="http://mac2.microsoft.com/help/office/14/en-us/outlook/item/9e879258-ed91-43d0-94b8-002c3292fdc6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Video | Uninstall
 Office 2011</a></b></p>
<p>
<b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Step-by-Step Instructions | How to completely remove Office for Mac 2011</a></b></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
One workaround for the 14.2.4 update that has helped some users is to temporarily move or rename the&nbsp;<b>/Library/Automator</b>&nbsp;folder.&nbsp;You can do this by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>With&nbsp;<b>Finder&nbsp;</b>open, choose&nbsp;<b>Go &gt; Go to Folder...<br />
<br />
</b></li><li>Type in the following path and then click&nbsp;<b>Go</b>:<br />
<b>/Library<br />
<br />
</b></li><li>Find the&nbsp;<b>Automator</b>&nbsp;folder, select it, and then click the name of the folder again to Rename the folder. Name the folder&nbsp;<b>Automator_Old<br />
<b><br />
Note</b>:&nbsp;</b>OS X may prompt you for your password. This is normal.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Attempt to install the 14.2.4 update again.<br />
<br />
</li><li>If the update installs correctly, rename the&nbsp;<b>Automator_Old</b>&nbsp;folder back to its original name:&nbsp;<b>Automator</b></li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If that solution does not work and you know you have re-installed Office 2011 on top of an existing Office 2011 installation, you’ll need to remove Office 2011 properly and re-install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The second issue was some users changed the size of the&nbsp;<b>/tmp/</b>&nbsp;directory on their machine which was too small for the update to fully install. Re-sizing the /tmp/ directory resolved the install issue for these users.</p>

<h2>            SharePoint&#58; Hiding items based on columns</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Currently I am using target audience to hide columns for certain users. One group inputs the data and one approves and add notes. Now a new set of users who need to view the same list, but they cannot see every item, only their own projects. I can't
 seem to make it work with the current audience in place. Is there any workaround around this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Vanice,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have understood your situation now. However, according to the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Target-content-to-specific-audiences-33D84CB6-14ED-4E53-A426-74C38EA32293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support article</a>, the out of the box feature we can target list/library to specific audiences is hide the items. Could you share the detailed steps how you set target audiences for list/library columns first? And then we can try our best to find if there
 is a solution can achieve your goal. Or do you use SharePoint customization?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>6120 Classic - very basic smiley&#47;T9 question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> funkydoctor---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            6120 Classic - very basic smiley&#47;T9 question</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a very basic problem with my new Nokia 6120 Classic in that I can't write smileys (emoticons) in SMSs using T9. Please note that I do *not* mean fancy pictures, just the possibility to write a text-based smiley like :-)<br />
<br />
I have browsed other discussions on this forum, and apparently on some phones it is possible to press the 1 key three times, and then use the * key to browse through different smilies. This is also what I am used to from my old Sony Ericsson, but this doesn't
 work on my Nokia 6120.<br />
<br />
This might be due to the Swedish T9 dictionary that I normally use, because I can get (two) smileys if I change to English.<br />
<br />
Is there a possibility to get around this deficiency? Why can't I "spell" a new word when I'm not satisfied with the choices that appear after pressing the 1 key three times?<br />
<br />
To my mind, this makes the phone seem clearly flawed, and I do hope that there is a solution out there. Thanks in advance!

            You can't use smileys on Series 60, Which the 6120c is.<br />
<br />
But there is an application in the Nokia Software Market that allows you to do this but you have to pay for it.

            But that application is for including pictures of smileys, right? I only wished to be able to put three symbols in a row without T9 objecting, like this :-(

            Sorry - T9 would not accept "word" of only symbols. It is too "smart" and detecting that there are only symbols (1-key) will redirect you to the Symbols screen.

            There's one simple workaround, which will make You able to choose the emotion icons (and else) like You do it with normal words.<br />
<br />
1) Turn ON the T9.<br />
2) Type one _letter_, "a" or something.<br />
3) Push "*" few times, so the (whatever word do You have for it in Your language) word for the high-left (not menu!) button changes to something like "type".<br />
4) Press the C button to delete the letter You entered first.<br />
5) Hold the "*" so the menu for symbols appear<br />
6) Choose the symbols (except for the last one!) by pressing the direction keys and choosing it with 5 (this way the menu will not dissapear)<br />
7) Choose the last symbol with central button and accept the word.<br />
<br />
I made this way:<br />
...<br />
;-)<br />

<br />
and others.<br />
<br />
Hope it was helpful (and You'll check the thread eventually).

            No problem ;). It is even possible to learn Your T9 such emoticons like (14841) (!!)...<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a different problem, though: T9 DIES from time to time - every word I got into it, everything just DISSAPEARS :/... for no reason. It can be overnight (I don't usually turn off the phone), so it's not that it's lack of energy or something...<br />
<br />
On my old 6310i I had a similar issue, but it kept forgetting the oldest/least used words I added, and now on 6120c it goes just empty :|... any reason and, preferably, solution?

            Hi again,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I have noted exactly the same thing - I haven't bothered to report this earlier. In my mind, several aspects of the 6120 classic is a disappointment.<br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />

    <title>Macro doesn&#39;t work on all sheets in workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lance salling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macro doesn&#39;t work on all sheets in workbook</h2>
                    I have a workbook with 12 worksheets, one for each month. I have installed a macro which changes the mileage to $$ (multiplies the miles by .565) in the same cell in which the miles are input. The function works, but only on the 'January' worksheet. The
 other 11 sheets do not respond. How do I configure the macro to effect all the mileage columns in all 12 worksheets?<br />
<br />
Here's the code:<br />
<br />
Option Explicit<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Excel.Range)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Target.HasFormula Or IsEmpty(Target) Then Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Intersect(Target, Range("E:F")) Is Nothing Then Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsNumeric(Target) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.Value = Target.Value * 0.565<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
I think that you must have a copy of&nbsp; the macro in every sheet where you want this feature.<br />
But I do recommend that you use one column for the mileage input and <b>another column</b> for the calculated $$. That way you don't need this macro at all, just normal formulas.<br />
To have the input changed is very confusing. You will have no safety against accidental typing errors as you never see your input (mileage).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps / Lars-Åke<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your macro would automatically run for any change in the Jan sheet - it is a worksheet change macro.&nbsp; So you have two options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Copy the macro in the code window of all worksheets; or</p>
<p>2. Assign the macro to a button.&nbsp; So the macro in this case will not auto run but will run only when the user click on a button.&nbsp; The modified macro for this option will be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub multiply_value</p>
<p>Dim ws as worksheets</p>
<p>For each ws in activeworkbook.worksheets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("E4").Value = Range("E4").Value* 0.565<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True<br />
Next ws</p>
<p>End sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cell E4 if the cell on all worksheets in which the miles are input.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Hi Lance,<br />
<br />
Try the Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As Range) event. This event is triggered on each worksheet change.<br />
<br />
IMO better then copying the code to each worksheet (maintenance).<br />

<p>I'm trying to help my dad out by moving all his documents from his laptop&nbsp; which has Microsoft office 2007 to his new computer that has Microsoft office 2016 professional.</p>
<p>But not a single document opens be it word or excel. I am guessing that office 2007 and office 2016 are not compatible but how do i go about converting all his files so they will work? Many thanks<br />

            Hi GizmoTheGremlin
<br />
<br />You should be able to open those documents in Office 2016 and while they will show as read only in compatibility mode, you just need to then save them in the newer file format . . 
<br />
<br />What is the exact error you are seeing, when you try to open those files?
<br />
<br />If you open Word, for example and choose File - Open, then choose one of those files - what happens?

            Hi gizmothegremlin,
<br />
<br />My name is Joshua, I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help you out.
<br />
<br />Dear,
<br />
<br />  Let's test with a file of those that generate the error by executing a quick repair to solve the problem of file association
<br />
<br />1.- In the Control Panel, choose Programs&gt; Programs and features.
<br />
<br />2.- Next, select the Office product you want to repair and choose Change.
<br />
<br />3.- Choose the option Quick Repair and choose Repair.
<br />
<br />For more information about the Office repair option, go to Repair an Office application.
<br />
<br />If the problem is not resolved, try manually associating the files with the correct application.
<br />
<br />1.- Click on the Start button
<br />
<br />2.- Write and select "Control Panel"
<br />
<br />3.- Click on Default Programs (if you do not see Default Programs, type it in the search box in the upper right corner of the window and press Enter)
<br />
<br />4.- Click on Set default programs
<br />
<br />5.- Select the Office application that does not open correctly and click Set this program as the default.
<br />
<br />6.- Click on OK.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this information can help you solve your problem.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards.

<h2>            Microsoft Word 2003 on Windows 10 HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    In 2003 I purchased MS Office 2003. I only use MS Word 2003. I am a writer. Suddenly, in the middle of a book I am writing, I cannot edit the book I have been working on for a year. I was almost ready to submit it to my publisher. I never upgraded to a
 newer version, because I LOVE using 2003. I don't want MS to think for me and change things that I do not want changed. I use it as more of a word processor than a computer program. Microsoft informs me that my version of Word has been disabled. I don't want
 to subscribe to a service on a monthly basis. Sometimes, I am in the middle of the woods with no internet access for days, sometimes weeks. I BOUGHT this program! MS is interfering with my means of producing an income. HELP!

<p>I have uninstalled Office 365. The document is no longer read only. However, now when I make a change, and save it, then try to close the doc, it asks me&nbsp;again and again if I want to save it. Finally, when I say no, the document closes. When I reopen it,
 the changes are not there. I have plenty of disk space left and plenty of RAM. I am at a loss.</p>

<p>I have uninstalled Office 365. The document is no longer read only. However, now when I make a change, and save it, then try to close the doc, it asks me&nbsp;again and again if I want to save it. Finally, when I say no, the document closes. When I reopen it,
 the changes are not there. I have plenty of disk space left and plenty of RAM. I am at a loss. There is never a real error message.</p>

<p>We can't change our Skype username. It is a unique ID for our account on their database, so it's unchangeable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, custom username was for old Skype process in creating an account. Due to recent changes, Skype accounts are migrated to Microsoft account. So, if you want create Skype account then you are creating a Microsoft account.</p>

</p><p>If you are using an XY Scatter chart, <strong>why do you think the trendline equation is incorrect?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A common mistake is to copy the very low precision coefficients that appear in the trendline formula by default into formulas in a worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, you should format the trendline label to display much higher precision.&nbsp; I suggest that you format the trendline label as Scientific with 14 decimal places.&nbsp; That will display the highest precision for all coefficients, regardless their magnitudes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, use a LINEST formula to determine the coefficients.&nbsp; For a 3rd order polynomial, select 4 horizontal cells and
<p>
</p><p>=LINEST(ydata, xdata^{1,2,3})</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a 6th order polynomal, select 7 horizontal cells and <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">array-enter</span></em> a formula of the following form:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=LINEST(ydata, xdata^{1,2,3,4,5,6})</p>
<p>
</p><p>The resulting coefficients are for the polynomial terms x^6, x^5, x^4, x^3, x^2, x^1 and x^0 (b).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If that does not&nbsp;solve&nbsp;the problem, I suggest that you upload a redacted example Excel file that demonstrates the problem to file-sharing website (e.g. box.net/files), and post the public/share URL in a response here.&nbsp; Please test the URL first, being careful
 to log out of the file-sharing website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The devil might be in the details that difficult to explain and easier to see in the worksheet.</p>

            &nbsp;I think you're right with the Precision issue. &nbsp; I copied the formula straight from the output on the graph and it only had one significant figure in some of the coefficients . &nbsp; I will try your suggestions on Monday when I get back to the office . &nbsp;
 Thank you very much !

    <title>Endless loop videos in powerpoint 2016&#47;365 stopp prematurely in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Endless loop videos in powerpoint 2016&#47;365 stopp prematurely in presentation mode &#40;Win 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I give regular presentation with powerpoint since &gt;15 years and I am an experienced user (starting with MS DOS and all windows and ppt versions). I usually present short video loops of a few seconds length which show medical images (ultrasound, echocardiography,
 exported from GE Echo Pac workstations in MS Video 1 codec) and which are typically shown in endless loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since some time, I assume since Windows 10, I have problems with looped videos - this problem has been reported by several other persons! When I insert a video in pptx and set it to "endless loop" and "play until next slide" the video plays perfectly in
 normal mode, but not in presentation mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video will play for 1-3 loops, sometimes a bit longer, and then stopp suddently. Usually it then can not be restarted by a mouse click. The presentation has to be advanced to the next slide and then back again, the video will play again for a few loops
 and then stopp etc etc&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- this issue occurs independently of the video codec with MS Video1 = MS-CRAM AND with WMV etc.</p>
<p>- it can be observed on different computers with Intel graphics and with Nivida graphic adapters (Lenovo ThinPad T450s, ASUS Zenbook UX31, MS Surface Book Performance base w/ NIVIDIA)</p>
<p>- this occurs with my standard pptx template, but also with a fresh pptx file/template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Newest updates installed - Office 365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS please DO NOT give me the typical advice how to insert videos! As written, I am a user with longstanding "regular" ppt and pptx experience! I also know who to convert videos, create videos, insert, compress etc etc&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Managing multiple accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rose_ann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Managing multiple accounts</h2>
                    <p>I've read a lot of posts on here about managing multiple email addresses, alliases and microsoft accounts. I cannot see anything with quite my question:</p>
<p>I have two Microsoft accounts, an old hotmail.com one and a newer outlook.com one.
</p>
<p>The outlook.com account is not used for subscriptions etc at the moment but I would like it to be my primary account / email in the future. The hotmail.com account has things linked to it and devices using it as a logon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like I cannot merge the two accounts and I cannot set one email (hotmail) as an alias of the other (outlook) because they are separate accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like my only option is to delete the outlook.com account, wait 60 days and then hope that I can get the same email address to add as an alias to my hotmail account, after which I can make it the primary alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please confirm if this is the case or if something has changed, or might be changing in the future, that would allow me to link these two accounts without risking losing the email address I have.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

    <title>How to create border only around sentences and not blank space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> winky11  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to create border only around sentences and not blank space</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I regularly need to put borders around individual sentences and it's quickest to highlight all the text and add the border. However, borders are put around empty space. Is there a quick way to only put borders around the actual text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I want this:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><sup>&nbsp;</sup>And He said to them, "It is written, 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER'; but you are making it a ROBBERS' DEN."</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;And&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>blind and&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Not this:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves. &nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>And He said to them, "It is written, 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER'; but you are making it a ROBBERS' DEN." &nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>This is a case where you will need to use an empty paragraph to provide the space between each item of text and you must select the paragraphs, one at a time to apply the border.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff1ab0f9-bfcf-4626-b3e8-ecfcf14cdcdd" /></p>
<p>If you have the space between the paragraphs created in the proper way, by having the paragraphs formatted to have that space, even if you attempt to apply the borders separately to the individual paragraphs, the result will be:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3e1ebc4-8fea-4d7f-bf49-c8f3494301ae" /></p>

    <title>how do I increase the font size of all selected text by 1 pt in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tigermo53  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do I increase the font size of all selected text by 1 pt in Word&#63;</h2>
                    I want to select text of mixed font sizes and increase all selected text by 1 pt at a time until it gets large enough, but not too large. Previous versions of Word for Mac had a toolbar option to increase font size by 1 pt. That seems to have disappeared
 in Office 2016. Is that completely gone or is there a secret keystroke combination to achieve that?

<p>Some of the other replies are close but not quite correct...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Chris &amp; John suggested increase the font size based on the <em>recommended sizes</em> listed in the
<strong>Font Size </strong>dropdown. The specific amount is determined by the listings which vary depending on the font. The keystroke suggested by Chris is associated with the same tool suggested by John.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Phillip suggested changes <em>all</em> selected text to the <em>same</em> font size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the text then use the built-in <strong>Command+]</strong> keystroke which executes the
<strong>GrowFontOnePoint</strong> command. It increases the font size in increments of 1 pt regardless of the sizes in the list. If you wish this can be added to the QAT using the method John suggested. It is located in the
<strong>Commands Not in the Ribbon</strong> category listed as <strong>Grow Font 1 Pt.</strong></p>
