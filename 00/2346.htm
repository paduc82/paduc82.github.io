<p>I am only using the envelope icon on the bottom status bar.</p>
<p>I think the email cloud&nbsp;won't allow me to update the settings and see my cloud&nbsp;emails from that status bar. I have to go all the way to google then type in icloud.com then the password. My Gmail and college of the canyons email (school) are adequately&nbsp;updated,
 but my cloud&nbsp;is the only one that says "nothing has arrived." No matter how many times I go to setting, it won't update when I follow the prompts.</p>
<p>I do not have a picture right now. When it comes again I will try to send it. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            asha 202 troubleshooting</h2>
                    I'm using nokia asha 202 (India). I bought this phone before 1 year. After few months, my phone is started to show some complaints.<br />
1. Bluetooth is not working properly. Sometimes I'm not able to 'switch on' bluetooth and also there is problem with data sending.<br />
2. Radio is not working.<br />
3. Camera is not working. It takes more time to save the captured image. As a solution for all these problems, once I changed phone's software. But there is no change in the situation. Now I dont know what to do? Any one please help me. I'm in a big confusion....

<p>Hi Naughtyashik,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>First make a backup:</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Select Menu &gt; Settings&gt; Sync and <span>backup</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Select Create backup</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Next: Perform a hard reset:</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to standby screen and enter <span><span><strong>*#7370#</strong>. Press ok. The process might take for about 5 minutes. The handset will restart after the procedure.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><u>Last: Restore a backup:</u></p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p>1. Select Menu &gt; Settings&gt; Sync and <span>backup</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Select Restore backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
If that does not improve anything, you may send a phone to a Nokia Care Centre for proper diagnostics. For more information please refer to this page at

<p>When I open the first file in Word 2010, there is no problem. But when I try to open a second file, I get the dialog "Word has encountered a problem" and the file. Show help &gt;&gt; then says "There is a problem saving the file.<br />

<p>On a clean Windows 7 machine, I had made a first install of Office 2007 with Outlook and Word, then installed Office 2010 Pro (everything except Outlook), since I need Outlook 2007 for compatibility with some other software.</p>

<div>Something is corrupting normal.dotm and that suggests a rogue third party add-in. I suggest that to prove this you disable all the third party add-ins, delete normal.dotm and test again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But I strongly suspect it may be the Outlook Connector which is known to cause similar problems.</div>

<h2>            Facebook won&#39;t connect over Wi-Fi on my Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    I have a Lumia 822 Windows Phone 8. My problem is with Facebook. It won't connect if I have my Wi-Fi ON. Doesn't matter if it is through the Facebook App or through Internet Explorer. It used to work just fine but now every time I want to open Facebook
 I must first go in &amp; turn off my Wi-Fi connection. My daughter &amp; son both have the same phone as me. My daughter can use hers over Wi-Fi no problem. I've even deleted Facebook on my phone &amp; set it up on my son's phone and it worked on his phone. So we know
 it's not the Wi-Fi &amp; it's not my Facebook account. It's got to be something with my phone settings or something. Can't see a difference in our settings though. This is driving me nuts! Any ideas?

<br />
Please advise how to go about it. I could not find any solution anywhere so I am posting this here. Look forward to a solution asap. Thanks!!!<br />

<p>No, that is impossible on any normal phone from any of the major manufacturers.</p>

<p>The only information that your phone is capable of getting from satellites is GPS data for positioning and navigation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Error when trying to open a new workbook in Excel &#40;not enough viable space or memory&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Error when trying to open a new Excel Workbook:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Excel cannot open or save any more documents because there is not enough available memory or disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read many answers regarding the type of file I am trying to open and the permissions and all of that.&nbsp; I am merely trying to open a new workbook.&nbsp; I am using Version 15.26 (Office 365 Subscription) and I have plenty of memory on my computer.&nbsp; I go
 to Permissions and it has No Restrictions.&nbsp; I am using a Mac (OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.4).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened one worksheet that I had used before but it will not start a new workbook.&nbsp; Maybe I should just delete everything from this worksheet and use it...but I would really like to know what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Try &nbsp;the following: </p>
<p>Opening the workbook in Numbers (Apple) or Download LibreOffice and try to open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes a different spreadsheet&nbsp;program will open an Excel Workbook that has corruption. The corrupted information may be missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now export as Excel Workbook&nbsp;either as .xls&nbsp;or .xlsx document. Save the&nbsp;file&nbsp;with a slightly&nbsp;different name then reopen. &nbsp;And replace the missing information.</p>

            <p>I see your Office install is behind on updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>INSTALL UPDATES:</span></p>
<p><span>I think the first troubleshooting step to take is:
<strong>Ensure your Mac and Office have the latest updates</strong>. Yes, sure, every rarely, an update causes a crash, but the clear majority of the time updating fixes crashes. Here’s how to install updates:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install the updates.</span></li><li><span>After, in any Office application go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates to launch the AutoUpdate app.
<strong>Let AutoUpdate install updates and then restart your Mac.</strong></span></li></ol>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Hi! I am new in this community, and hope my english is not as worse as I think, and you are able to read out what I want to tell you.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have exactly the same problem. I sent an HTML Multipart email to my email account. I received it with 3 different Outlook Versions via IMAP.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Outlook 2010<br />
2. Outlook 2013&nbsp;<br />
3. Outlook 2016<br />
<br />
On 2nd and 3rd Version I have the same problem: some pseudo HTML code shows up in the preview.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The code we use:&nbsp;<br />
We are using some Table-Design and spacer images in HTML to stabilze the view of the emails in many different email clients, not only MS clients. So there are some image Tags within the HTML Code before the Text itself (in Paragraph Tags) begins.<br />
<br />
Outlook 2010 shows up the Text correctly as 3-Line Preview, the other Versions shows the Link to one of th images in angle brackets, like a pseudo HTML Element.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just have a look to the screenshot:</p>
<p>(Outlook from Office 365 / Version 1706 (Build 8229.2073)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b767c7eb-8e57-4eb6-a43e-369d0665046c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b767c7eb-8e57-4eb6-a43e-369d0665046c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Highligted: without images before text content starts</p>
<p>Other one: same email code, but with an image before text content starts</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I remove the images from the email HTML Code (only the one or two before the Text starts), always the Text shows up in the 3-line preview.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tryed to hide the Images for Outlook by using Conditional Comments, but it don't work. The code still shows up in the 3-line preview.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think Outlook is accidently picking up wrong content for the 3-line preview, instead of ALT Text from Images or using the first real Text content.</p>
<p>

            Hi Carsten-72,<br />
<br />
According to your description, this issue happened in both Outlook 2013 and 2016 when auto-preview an HTML&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Multipart email. I would confirm whether this issue only happened to this one particular email.<br />
Also please check in Outlook 2013 and 2016 whether the message preview setting are all set to preview 3 lines. You can find this by clicking View-&gt;Message Preview.<br />
</span><br />
Then I would suggest you reset all the view settings to the default settings in both Outlook 2013 and 2016.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists after the steps above, I would collect the HTML message to check on our side in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">
private message</a>.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang

<p>Hi Yang,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this behavior is shown up in every HTML E-Mail when the Inbox-Preview is activated. Not specially in this specific E-Mail. I remember that I sent you some Code examples from Inbox and what was sent out from our System.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Playing movies purchased from Microsoft Store in Android</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a couple of movies on my laptop from the Microsoft Store. &nbsp;I have an Android TV Box connected to my TV and wanted to know the best way for me to view these films? &nbsp;I really don't want to have to rely upon watching them only on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much thanks!</p>

<p>Your best bet is to use an HDMI cable to connect your laptop to your TV and use it as a second monitor.&nbsp; There's no way to watch your movies on an&nbsp;Android device at this time.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 will not save changes to a contact group member&#39;s email address</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded from Outlook 2007 to Outlook 2010.&nbsp; I have some distribution groups that have transferred over.&nbsp; Now, when I go in, I see how I can right click a member of the contact group and go to their properties.&nbsp; I change the email address in
 the properties and click OK but it won't change in my contact group.&nbsp; I have even tried to add the contacts to my general contact list (I previously did not have all of these individuals listed as a separate contact if they were in a distribution list becuase
 I generally don't email them individually).&nbsp; This won't work.&nbsp; I click UPDATE and it does nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help?</p>

<h2>            People at Outlook.com shows &#34;Name isn&#39;t available&#34; for contacts that are companies with no proper name.</h2>
                    <p>I've tested that sync works fine for all fields when updates are made to either Outlook 2016 (client) or to the People section of Outlook.com. So, the fields are present and updates work quite well either direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Outlook.com at the People section, and sorted by Company Name only shows "Name isn't available".&nbsp; The preview pane of the contact will show the company name but it doesn't show up in the alphabetical list of contacts.</p>

<p>Why do that if sync between Outlook.com and Outlook 2016 works fine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "File As" issue with disappearing Company names is fixable in the client which then syncs to outlook.com and corrects the issue.</p>

    <title>SPF check disabled by default&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patric.f  say:</h3>
<h2>            SPF check disabled by default&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have a costumer whose mail is on Office 365. I just noticed that mail that got sent from an unauthorized IP (not in the SPF record for specific comain) got accepted in Office 365.</p>
<p>I noticed this because the sender tried to send it to me first and it got rejected because their IT-department forgot to put the new IP in the SPF record. When they tried to send it to my costumer it got deliver with no problem. I checked the "Message Trace"
 and saw that it came from the same IP so it should get rejected.</p>
<p>The IP is still not in their SPF record.</p>
<p>I looked through the "Spam Filter" options in Office 365 and noticed under "Protection -&gt; Spam Filter -&gt; Default -&gt; Advanced Options" that "SPF record: hard fail" was set to Off as standard. Shouldn't this be on? Why doesn't O365 check for SPF failure?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Patric</p>

<p>Hi Patric,</p>
<p>The default setting of “SPF record: hard fail” is Off, so, some emails sent from an unauthorized IP (not allowed in SPF records) might be accepted in Office 365.<br />
However, Office 365 will increase Spam Score for an email from an unauthorized IP.<br />
If you set “SPF record: hard fail” to on, Office 365 will mark the email sent from an unauthorized IP as Spam.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Copy &#38; Pasting ink in Right to Left pages spreads and garbles the ink</h2>
                    <p>This bug exists currently in both OneNote 2013, OneNote 2016 and the UWP app and is easy to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ink anything on the page</li><li>Make sure the page is set as "Right to Left"</li><li>Select the ink and copy it</li><li>Paste it</li></ol>
<p>The resulting paste will be a spread out and garbled version of what you copied.</p>
<p>So for example this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6ffa056-f95b-45c2-97e9-a9bd7aef8b82" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6ffa056-f95b-45c2-97e9-a9bd7aef8b82" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When copy &amp; pasted, becomes this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efd26406-61b0-4249-9a47-f1f559d74817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efd26406-61b0-4249-9a47-f1f559d74817" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tested this bug a bit, and it seems that what matters is when you copy - not when you paste.</p>
<p>Meaning, if you copy the text while the page is LTR, then change to RTL and paste - it'll be fine.</p>
<p>It only happens if you copy the ink while the page is in RTL mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's also a video demonstrating the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93aDIg9pFR8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93aDIg9pFR8</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/93aDIg9pFR8?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/93aDIg9pFR8?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is workaroundable by temporary changing page alignment when copy&amp;pasting (which is a hassle) or pasting the copied ink as an image (which then pastes it fine for some reason, but it becomes an image so non-editable).<br />
</p>
<p>I'd appreciate an acknowledgement of this bug and of course perhaps a future fix. :-)<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>-Elad</p>

</p><p>It's a pity Word 2015 on OS X fails to show "Match Destination Formatting" in the

Try this formula: <br />
<br />
=SUMIFS($C$2:$C$7,$A$2:$A$7,"Red",$B$2:$B$7,"&gt;"&amp;DATE(2011,1,1))/COUNTIFS($A$2:$A$7,"Red",$B$2:$B$7,"&gt;"&amp;DATE(2011,1,1))<br />

            Well, since most of the UI is excluded from the screen shot it's hard to tell what is where :-) My first instinct: Have you looked on the
<strong>Formulas</strong> tab of the Ribbon to see whether <strong>Show Formulas</strong> is activated?<br />

<h2>            E51 Bug &#91;high&#93; - Battery temperature critically high in wlan operation</h2>
                    Severity: high<br />
Software: 200.34.36 / 24-04-2008 / RM-244<br />
<br />
At home, I have my E51 constantly booked in my wlan and the SIP client connected to my asterisk pbx. Besides the battery life is only 5 to 6 hours in this condition (without talking - only standby), the battery gets very hot. I measured up to 65°C at the metal
 battery cover. I seriously doubt that this is very healthy for the battery and 65°C CAN cause injury in little children if they accidently get a hold of the phone.

            So finally, I got a new phone and guess what, battery lived about 12 hours. After reducing the txpower in WLAN settings, it now holds 48 - 60 hours.<br />
So the problem had two parts. Battery heat - was solved by phone replacement. Short battery live was partially solved by phone replacement but mainly by changing the txpower of WLAN.

<h2>            Microsoft support to Hebrew in Windows Phone</h2>
                    <p>When does Microsoft will add the support to Hebrew? </p>
<p>I don't need the menus in Hebrew just the keyboard and the right to left option</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the only thing preventing me from buy a Windows mobile Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also will accept the option to install it as an hot-fix mode or even as a beta tester.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me solving this because I'm going to buy a new phone and i would like it to be Windows Phone type.</p>

                    I can't believe what a piece of **** Microsoft is. I bought Office with an older laptop. There should be no reason I can't get the key from my product I bought by going into office on the old laptop so I can find the key. You make it so difficult to find
 just&nbsp; so someone has to repurchase and buy it again. Shame on you Microsoft. I am posting this everywhere I can. Just because it's an older version you won't except it on my new laptop. I am posting this everywhere I can. You SUCK.

            <p>With a little luck, it is not as bad as you think (this time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as you didn't buy Office installed and activated at the factory or via a "Product Key Card" you will be able to transfer the key to the new computer.
</p>
<p>
Do you still have the old computer?
</p><p>
</p><p>You can use one of the tools to extract the key from the old machine. Of course MS "fixed" 2013 so we can no longer do that ...</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>You can use any of the following tools to extract the Product Key from you computer. These tools report on many installed programs on your computer, not just Office.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>PS</span></strong><span>: you should keep a copy (printed and/or file copies on external storage devices) of the report(s) generated by these tools so you have all of your product keys / registration

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>FYI</span></strong><span>: I (Rohn) have not tested these tools in Windows 8 (just haven’t had an excuse to make/waste the time), but I don’t expect any problem. The underlying mechanics of Windows
 8 are essentially the same as Windows 7 if you ignore the Metro User Interface. Think of metro as “lipstick on a pig”. The pig is not changed by adding a little paint on the surface.</span></p>

<p>After you extract the Product Key, make sure to write it down and keep it in a safe place. Burning a copy of the installation file to a CD would also be a good idea if you don’t have the installation disk.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong>NOTE</strong>: OEM (factory install and activated) licenses use a different key than the one reported.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only the factory can use the PK from the original factory activation. You would have been provided with a separate piece of paper with a Product key for reactivation.</p>

<p>Debra, your ire is misplaced. When you purchase a software product you are given a key to activate it. It is YOUR responsibility to keep that key if you ever need to transfer your license to a new PC. So if you no longer have the key, how is that Microsoft's
 fault? This is not just Microsoft. Most software vendors make it difficult to impossible to get the license key from an installed product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason Microsoft does not make it very easy (but not impossible as Rohn showed you) to get the key is because someone could steal your key and use it to validate their own installation, which could cause problems for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your spamming this only serves to make you look foolish, not put Microsoft to shame.</p>

            Scottgem, Obviously you have not read all the complaints about Microsoft making it difficult to recover a key. Office was downloaded on the laptop when I got it, smart guy. Before you call someone a fool, I would read all the complaints about this problem.

            <p>The vast majority of those complaints come from people who did not keep their keys, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is your License Key is what you need validate your software. If you lose it, it is the tantamount to losing the key to your car. Would you attack Ford because you lost the key to your Focus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, but as a software developer I understand that it should not be easy to recover a license key from an installation. This is protection for both you and the developer. To attack Microsoft over this, as you did, was misplaced and unnecessary. A single
 post in the proper forum (this one is for questions about Microsoft Access the database, not access to Microsoft products) politely worded would have gotten you an answer similar to what Rohn posted. So I stand by my opinion that your tirade reflects badly
 against you not Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Scottgem, I don't really care what you think. I have the key but Microsoft says the version is an older version and won't take it. I need to go to another site for the older version. Try finding that site. As I said, Microsoft makes it very inconvenient.
 I didn't lose my key. So bite me!!!</p>

<p>Sorry, but I doubt if you would taste very good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit confused however. You say you have your key, but when you try to use it, it says the key is for an older version. That wasn't clear from your earlier posts. Why would you need to "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">get
 the key from my product" if you already had it? If you are not installing the same version that you have the key for, then it just stands to reason it is not going to work. If you are trying to use a key for an earlier version on a newer version then it won't
 work, You have to pay for a new key to an upgraded version. Where do you get free upgrades forever?</span></p>

            <p>So what exact version of Office did you buy?</p>
<p>And how exactly are you trying to install Office on your new PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Office 2007 or 2010, a full retail version, you first uninstall any other version of Office, including trial on the new PC,</p>
<p>then reinstall using your original installation media, or the backup install file available from MS, once your key is validated

https://products.office.com/en-us/download-back-up-restore-microsoft-office-products</a></p>
<p>If your key isn't validated it means its an OEM key, or version of office not available to download from MS, eg Office Pro Plus</p>
