    <title>Can&#39;t print to Brother Printer after Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agnesc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t print to Brother Printer after Windows Update</h2>
                    
<p>We are sharing the same brother MFC-8660DN on a network (Win XP x4 &amp; Win 2008 Server x1) Everything was fine until yesterday (9/16/10). 2 of the XP computers can't print (status: error-printing) right after installing the recent windows update (auto windows
 update was set for every week). When we tried to print thru the brother printer, it would stuck in queue for about a minute and a bubble pop up "document failed to print". The 2 computers work fine otherwise. Everything else functions normoally and can print
 to other printer like Canon. (PS: I tried to uninstall and re-install the brother printer driver, but no luck fixing the issue)</p>
<p>On the other hand, the other 2 XP didn't do any update, and so they can still print to the Brother printer. Also, the Win 2008 Server did an auto windows update but print fine as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe the windows update for XP must have something to do with the printing error. Is there any patch or update available? Or, could we uninstall the recent windows update&nbsp;(which one?)&nbsp;to fix this problem? I'm not OS savvy, not sure what could
 be uninstalled. Please help!!!</p>

<div>
<div>I got a call from a client 2010-Sep-16 that they could no longer print<br />
to either network printer from any workstation.<br />
<br />
Workstations have Vista Business 32 and were updated morning of Sep 16.<br />
<br />
Server is Server2003 &amp; printing still worked from it fine.<br />
<br />
Printers were using IP ports fine for over 2 years.<br />
<strong>Fix was to create ports with full share name &amp; use that instead of IP.<br />
</strong><br />
The IP address of printer had not changed AND<br />
I could still browse with IE8&nbsp; (using IP address)<br />
to printer to see config data of printer<br />
<br />
Workstations are in Server2003 domain<br />
<br />
This full share name trick was how I previously had to set up<br />
Vista Home Premium workstations<br />
to use network printers in home networks.<br />
<br />
Why would Vista Business be "updated" to Home Premium settings?<br />
Is this a permanent "update"?<br />
<br />
Why does any version of VISTA do this?<br />
Does Windows 7 have same issue?<br />
<br />
<strong>With Vista Business 32 the (short term?) solution was to change the port to a local port with the full share name of the printer</strong></div>

    <title>Bright Red Light on Halo Reach Xbox Slim - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bright Red Light on Halo Reach Xbox Slim</h2>
                    
<p>Was playing Halo last night, with no problems whatsoever, turned the xbox off, and went to bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, when I woke up this morning I noticed that the power button on my Halo Reach Xbox Slim was bright red. &nbsp;No corners or anything, just a light coming from the center. &nbsp;Out of curiosity, I turned it on, launched a game, and even loaded a map, just to see
 if the harddrive and everything was working, and I don' thave any problems... yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this something that I should be worried about, or could it just be something small? &nbsp;Is it odd that the light came on while the xbox was off? (It didn't turn on when I powered down my xbox the previous night.) &nbsp;I didn't mess with any cables either before
 or after this problem, and honestly haven't played it since (besides booting and loading), but I'm just asking if I should go ahead and get a repair. &nbsp;It is less than a year old (Halo Reach, obviously) so I assume I'm under warranty, so I'm &nbsp;not too worried
 about the financial state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really appreciate it if a support personel could give me some advice. &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Just to be on the safe side i would call MS and ask. Cause that is weird when there is a red light its like the RROD hardware failure soon. So get it checked out.

<p>Well, I know that the RROD doesn't technically exist for the new xbox slim, of course it can still fail, though. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not ready to jump to a conclusion that all red lights are bad (or, at least, destructively bad)</p>
<p>The thing is that I can't find hardly information on it online, and sources contradict.</p>
<p>I don't see why mircosoft doesn't list the meanings (or possible meanings) of indications like that. &nbsp;There would be a whole lot less speculation, and people would be better informed.</p>
<p>That's why I'm hoping a support person will respond. &nbsp;If it means replacement, so be it. But I want to know before it explodes on me, you know? &nbsp;Or at least have an idea of what it means, even if it is a "this or that" scenario.

<p>I would get it checked out if they don't respond on here I would call support on the phone. I have the same Halo edition console and it started freezing and taking 5-10 minutes to load any screen even the Xbox logo screen. So I figured I need to clear my
 caches on my harddrive so I did. After I did that and restarted the system back up it had formatted my harddrive I lost everything on the harddrive. I then tried to recover my gamertag and it told me that the contant was to large for the storage device and
 froze. I powered down and turn it back on and it gave me a system error screen saying contact support E84 and the center light on the power button was red like a evil eye. It does it everytime I turn it on so I have to get it replace but all the progress I
 made in the games I had on the Harddrive is gone forever no replacing that. I say this to tell you don't wait til it wipes you out like me sure you can retrieve you gamertag and gamerscore but how do you get back the saved game data that you worked so hard
 to get. You don't unless you do it all over which can be fun I guess if you like to back track. Sometimes the quick fix that they have on here to solve problems like freezing screens can do more harm then good sometimes not always. I say that because not all
 situtions are the same there could be other things going on at the same time as the freezing screen I learn the hard way. Don't read me wrong I not saying that it is the advice that is on here that caused what happen to me because I choose to look for a quick
 fix to the freezing screens on here and do the things that have lead me to this point. Just cover all base before you act unlike me.Good luck!</p>

<p><font><font>Hi,</font></font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font>All Microsoft wireless keyboards have their own specific transceivers. So, it is always recommended to use them with the transceiver that comes within their package. When
 you purchase a Microsoft Wireless Arc Keyboard, it will also have a Stowable Nano Transceiver which can be stowed underneath the keyboard.</font></font></p>

            <p>Hi Balaji,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I'm definitely going to try using the transceiver for both devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure Rajesh is recommending the official policy on using these devices but I had a hunch that maybe one transceiver might work for both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all the replies though.</p>

            Hello RBellinOR,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Disable Windows Spotlight feature in Settings app, i.e. select Picture/Slideshow option for Lock Screen background.
<br />
<br />2. Press Windows + E keys to open File Explorer and click View. Then check Hidden items option. Now navigate to following location:
<br />
<br />C:\Users\&lt;USERNAME&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_&lt;Package ID&gt;\LocalState\Assets
<br />
<br />Note: Substitute C: with your system root drive and &lt;USERNAME&gt; with your user account name. Here, Package ID may be arbitrary value like cw5n1h2txyewy.
<br />
<br />3. In the Assets folder, delete everything and make the folder empty.
<br />
<br />Reboot and check if the issue Windows Spotlight is resolved now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>I'm sorry to say that your suggestion failed to resolve my Windows Spotlight issue. Now, when I select Windows Spotlight for my Background in the Lock Screen window I get a grey Preview window. When I press the windows + L keys it takes me to a blank lock

<h2>            Windows 10 latest update Version 1607 Build 14393.693 automatically reinstalling disabled drivers.</h2>
                    <p>This post refers to my son's HP envy and its biometric driver for the fingerprint reader. From the outset we have had issues with this and it appears everyone wants to walkaway from the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software provided never worked properly because no fingerprint has ever been entered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially we removed the software and disabled the driver and the machine functioned like a computer with i7 quad core and a 1TB ssd.</p>
<p>Each time windows updated the OS the computer would take 10 minutes to start up but by disabling the driver it would then function until the next&nbsp;update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recent update has however thrown a spanner in the works as no matter what we want each time the computer restarts, full or just from the shut down, windows reinstalls the driver and the computer becomes a paperweight taking exactly 10 minutes to
 start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before my son murders me, as&nbsp;I did recommend Windows 10 to him, can someone advise how to prevent the reinstallation of the biometric driver.</p>

            <p>Hi Rhen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I covered the clean boot, perhaps not in those words, and by the way the link you posted is broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still looking for a solution and my son is still accusing me of misguiding him as he always favoured a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am beginning to think the platform is no longer worth the support, sad isn't it, we cheapen the work force to such a point that an almost essential tool of this day becomes useless. Who has 10 minutes spare in a day to wait for a boot up. I am retired,
 so to speak, and I don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks at least for posting an attempt to solve this, Microsoft haven't looked at any of my posts and they are still problems.</p>

            Thanks but the clean boot didn't do it either however if anyone is still having problems with the fingerprint reader on a HP envy I found a way around it that works for the present. Post here and I will pass on the way around it. I won't make a general
 post because there are so many configurations out there and so many different versions of Windows 10 my work around may not work for you.

Microsoft support article.</a><br />
Basically you first roll back or uninstall the driver and then when Windows tries to update the driver you use the show/hide tool to hide the update for that driver. Should work until the next major OS update (Creators/ redstone2) in the spring.

            <p>Thanks for your interest. For some reason, in the abovementioned version of windows 10 and the HP envy, you are not advised in any way that the driver is about to be reinstalled. The straight out delete the driver receives no immediate response until shutdown.
 Boot up&nbsp;is greeted with a 10 minute penalty in boot time with your screen left blank for the greater part of the boot time with the cursor visible in the middle and that's it. When boot has taken place you can go to device manager and discover the driver has
 been reinstalled.</p>
<p>Since I have found a work around that works really well and requires just an escape key and enter there is no need to go through the pain of trying something else, that involves downloads and install,&nbsp;just in case it doesn't work and who knows where to after
 that.</p>
<p>I will keep it in mind next update if my work around doesn't work any more or if we get lucky and HP rewrite the driver and it&nbsp;works with windows 10 without the need to have your fingerprint on your computer.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the help and information hopefully will not need it but good to know.</p>

<p>This ia &nbsp;A Gigabyte motherboard i7 OEM, the symptom has always been there since initially supplied. I believe this is a configuration issue and the clean boot procedure in the above email applies to win 7/8/8.1 not 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The usb device is typically a usb hard drive and it works just fine and if I click on the icon in bottom left of the screen to do a safe removal it does so an a small icon shows with a tick in it but on my laptop the same procedure shows a sliding black
 window with an exclamation mark in a blue circle and a messaage saying The USB Mass storage device can now be safetly removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know how to configure this sliding black box to on or off?</p>

            <p>The default for win 10 as I understand it is for quick removal and indeed this is what is set on both computers, this is not an issue with the drives but a windows 10 configuration issue why does one system display the sliding box and another not? As I said
 before it does not affect functionality of the drives but the box just appears on one system but not the other WHY? &nbsp;This BTW is the same box that appeared asking for feedback on win 10 after I updatd from win 7 on my laptop so it is a core win 10 action.</p>

            <p>Further work suggests that I can turn this off by using - settings - notifications - then switch off app settings BUT this only works on win 10 home &nbsp;the exact same settings does not display the box on win 10 pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In pro you just get a little green tick in the icon on the task bar to tell you that the drive is removed. So I infer that this is a coded deliberate "user friendly" item in win 10 home......</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2017 Bluetooth Connectivity Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goatmayo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2017 Bluetooth Connectivity Problems</h2>
                    <p>I seem to be having a problem that I've seen around a lot, but haven't seen any definitive answers for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For starters, my Surface Pro is the i5/4gb/128gb 2017 version</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot up my Surface Pro from sleep or shut down, my Razer Atheris mouse won't reconnect via bluetooth. I also have this problem with my surface pen (newest version). I have to go and remove them, then re-add both devices every single time. To clarify,
 the devices will add as a new device perfectly and work with no problems. Then when I am done with my Surface, I'll either put it to sleep or shut it down. When I wake it up or start back up from shut down, the devices won't REconnect. This has been a problem
 since I got my surface about 3 months ago, I've just been trying to find a fix online in my free time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated the firmware and drivers on the mouse and worked with Razer support to ensure that it is not a mouse issue. The mouse works fine with any other device I've paired it to, just not my Surface Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I've tried:</p>
<p>Ensuring Windows is up to date</p>
<p>Removing and reinstalling the Marvell Avastar Bluetooth Radio Adapter</p>
<p>Ensuring the Marvell Adapter has the most up to date driver (15.68.9120.47)</p>
<p>Trying the built in Bluetooth Troubleshooter</p>
<p>Completely removing the drivers for the mouse and doing a clean install to fix any problems with the mouse pathway for bluetooth connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help that any one can give me!</p>

<p>I also have the same problems with my surface pro 4. Every single Bluetooth devices with LE Bluetooth 4.0 function working well with surface pro such as keyboard, speakers, headphones...except the Razer Atheris mouse. I borrowed another new Razer Atheris
 mouse from store but It remains the same issue. It can not automatically connected every time I turn on and off device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I re-installed win 10 pro, re-run Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. But still no hope. I also tried another Bluetooth Mice. Those are working fine!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the same issue, I have done all of the same steps and even requested a new Atheris to ensure it is not a hardware issue. The Atheris should be compatible given the specifications. No idea what is going on. I have tried the Surface Diagnostic
 Toolkit with no avail. I hope we hear a solution from Microsoft soon!</p>

<p>I've worked with a Microsoft tech support person through chat as well as discussing this problem with my local Microsoft store and no one has found a solution or even has any idea what could be causing the problem. I ended up giving up on the guy with Microsoft
 tech support chat because I had to repeatedly ask him what else I could try because several times in our conversation he just suggested "Buying a Microsoft brand mouse" because that would definitely work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I've given up on Microsoft being able to resolve the problem. I chatted and worked with a support person at Razer and he was extremely helpful and went above and beyond what I would have expected. My Atheris works with every single other device
 I've tried it on except my Surface, but the Microsoft support guy was insistent that it was just because I wasn't using a Microsoft brand product. Extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can find the solution for us because otherwise I really love the mouse!</p>

            It did not solve my problem Kenneth. I have even gone as far as doing a complete reset which caused a whole other host of problems which my local Microsoft store resolved, but I am still having the same issue as the others posted here.

<p>Really disappointed when heard that. This is not the case when using Microsoft devices to solve the problem. Another brand name such as logitech, lenovo...are working fine with surface except Razer (I tested with my Logitech MX Master). Why? Why surface
 pro 4, surface pro 02017 not working with Razer's products?</p>

Sigh. I've tried reaching out myself, but neither of them have been able to fix it. Its 100% only a driver related problem which even raises the chances of it getting fixed higher (since its not hardware related).<br />
<br />
I've tweeted to both of them here. Feel free to chime in! Lets see:<br />

<p>I traced the same issue to a app. I have a HP laptop and it has HP wireless assistant running. This was not an issue when I was running Windows 7. After I updated to win 10 I was able to see a much higher use of the CPU. I stopped different services until
 I stopped HP wireless assistant . The CPU cycles dropped from 50% to 0. I have now uninstalled this app. It worked for me<br />

 One printer is a brother mfc 8660dn and its scan function works fine. </p>

            It seems to be quite common to have to re-install your printer(s) after the Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; Have you tried that?

            Update for printer problems: Brother MFC 8660DN, removed it from devices in Control Panel, plugged into USB port, it auto redefines printer, status of printer says "Driver unavailable". Turned off and on the printer, this changed status to normal OK status,
 then could print to the printer! Hallelujah!! However, from Microsoft Edge, attempt print shows new dialog for printing. print fcn not able to access printer. From Tbird Firefox can do print fcn. Apparently Microsoft added functionality to Edge that broke
 or at least damages print functionality. Waiting for Microsoft to fix Edge print function.<br />

            <p>In Edge, the print from a web page brings up a black Edge Printer dialog box. When I select the printer to print to and select Print, The error says "We couldn't reach the printer."...</p>
<p>However I can bring up the web page in Firefox, select to print, open the print dialog, select the same printer and it will print.</p>

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I use a Canon MX377 printer with all the correct drivers but yet could not print any PDF files that were opened by Windows 10 Edge browser. I over came the problem by downloading Adobe's free PDF reader. The Adobe program regained control of the PDF files
 that were saved and I could print again. Hope it solves the Issue on PDF files.</p>

<p>Hello magmaticlion678!</p>
<p>As&nbsp;a first trouble shooting step&nbsp;I would recommend safely powering down your Xbox One Console and your router/modem and then unplugging them from their power source. Once unplugged let them rest for about 5 minutes before plugging the network equipment back
 in first. Once the router or modem has booted back up all the way go ahead and plug the Xbox One back in and give it another try. Let us know with a reply how it goes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My Acer Aspire with Windows 10 Professional 64 is still registered on my Microsoft Account but I cannot reinstall using a USB drive that was created through the Windows MediaCreationTool.exe; it only ever attempts to install Windows 10 Home Premium 64bit
 and falls over in the process,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please tell me what I need to do to get back to&nbsp;Windows Pro 10 64bit?</p>

    <title>Xbox Disc Tray Wobbles When Ejecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r3dh3r0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Disc Tray Wobbles When Ejecting</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought a new Original White Xbox because it was a lot cheaper than buying a slim, and it was the Final Fantasy XIII Bundle (Jasper chip). Anyhow, I notice that the disc tray on this unit wobbles more when ejecting the tray than my other Xbox.
 It's not bad where it throws the disc off or scratches it. But you can kinda hear the disc shake slightly when ejecting. Is this normal?</p>

<p>Actually I just checked my other Xbox, and my friends Xbox (at his house right now), and his does it as well. Just seems my new one is barely more noticeable so I think it's alright. I mean it's not scratching discs or anything. Just OCD haha.</p>

<p>My disc tray has done this since day one. Nothing to really worry about unless it does scratch the discs. My console is now about 3 years old and in active use.</p>

<p>Yeah, I appreciate the input. Now that I recall my PS2 wobbled a lot more than this 360 and it worked fine. Don't think my original Xbox did as much, can't remember, lol.</p>

<h2>            Blank Screen after starting Asus Transformer T100TAF</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: Black screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an asus transformer ( T100TAF) and when I turn it on I get past the asus welcoming screen, but then I get to what is supposed to be the log in screen. But all I am presented with is a black screen. And all I can see is my mouse cursor. I have already
 done the " hold down your power button for thirty seconds thing" and I have already don the " press F8 thing" as well. I have also already tried to wipe my system clean. I have already went into command prompt and done the "sfcscannow" as well it gives me
 an error that I cannot fix. I have also tried to reimage my computer, dosent work. I cannot boot into safe mode. And I cannot reinstall Windows using a cd because it does not have a CD player because the thing is just a tablet. The "refresh" your computer
 option will not work either. The reset option does not work. And whenever I try to diagnose &nbsp;it says " start up repair could not repair your pc" so I know there might be no way to fix this **** tablet thing, but this is my last resort. So if there are any
 other suggestions can you please give them to me. It would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            How to configure windows 8 to scan to email.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hello. I have recently got a New Dell Desktop PC with windows 8. Its taken a while to get used to all the new screens. But I requires assistance in configuring the email/scanner settings. In windows XP I could&nbsp;press the scan to email button on my printer/scanner
 and it used to bring outlook up with the attachment. But now it just saves the image. Where do I configure it so that it uses Outlook?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know there is the easy other way of simply attaching it, but I would perfer it if I could scan directly to outlook?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>

Here are links that will help you work on the issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>check these links as well.</p>

            The display adapter for Surface is different and Lenovo one is different. All computer makers use different display adapters with their different models.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option for Lenovo-
<br />
<br />1. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Display Driver
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer

            Do it for your Wireless card. Go to Device Manager &gt; Under Network Adpaters, you will find your Wireless driver.
<br />
<br />Download Wireless driver from Lenovo's site and install that.

            You will have to do this manually. System update many not bring in the latest driver. 
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com</a> and put in your model number. Download the wireless driver manually and then install that.

            My apologies. I have run out of all options. I am not in a position to work with you on this issue further. I would request you to work with another volunteer expert or reach out to Microsoft Support to see whether you can be helped.

<p>I went to Lenovo website and manually downloaded all drivers and updated any that were out of date. This did not resolve the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking in both my Surface Book 2 and Lenovo laptops I see the following in Device Manager:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;Miracast display devices</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MSDisplayAdapter_3F</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSDisplayAdapter_3F is the name of my wireless adapter, so I assume the driver was installed properly in both laptops.&nbsp; However, when I go to the connect screen and select this device name on my Lenovo laptop I get an error message saying "Couldn't Connect".&nbsp;
 On my Surface Book 2 it works fine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We greatly appreciate your feedback. We will raise your concern with our developers.

<p>
