<h2>            Windows 10 Search can&#39;t find my local files &#40;mp3 etc.&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Search can't find my local files. For example whenever I search for an mp3 on my hard disc, it shows the message "No results found". I have to click more and then select "Music" and then Windows finds some of the files I've been looking for, while
 showing the "These results may be incomplete..." message. I have Windows 10 installed on my workstation and the problem doesn't exist there. It's really annoying and I'm asking for help in solving this issue.</p>

                    I printed something from Gimp to my HP laserjet printer. I did not save a file. I just printed to my printer. I no longer have the printout with me. How can I review a copy of the Gimp file that I printed out. On my Windows 8 computer, are the most recently
 printed stuff saved somewhere? Or is there a hidden cache of stuff I've done on Gimp, even if I haven't saved to Gimp?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that if you have not saved the file, then it is not on your computer.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So there is nothing to recover. GIMP has no autosave function.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sometimes, backups are kept in the .gimp-2.6/tmp folder.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can go through the File menu to find the document history,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can also follow article:<br />

<h2>            Windows 8&#47;8.1 Task Manager Says 100&#37; Disk and CPU Usage-A Fix that MAY work for you</h2>
                    I have noticed that many people with Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 have a problem where the task manager (after clicking more details) displays 100% usage for their disk and CPU. &nbsp;For me, this caused my normally tip-top, well oiled machine (computer) to suddenly
 experience slow downs (the mouse dragged as I moved it across the screen) and freezes, with the only possible way to get out of these freezes was to do a manual reboot (Ctrl+Alt+Delete didn't do a thing; my keyboard was unresponsive). &nbsp;Not only that, but my
 hard drive was making weird noises; it would squeak quietly and sound like it was constantly writing and reading. &nbsp;Even worse, I experienced the horrifying "blue screen of DEATH" twice during the month-long entire fiasco. &nbsp;I looked at the task manager and
 searched through it to see which program(s) was/were hogging my resources. &nbsp;It turned out that the "Communications Service" aka "livecomm.exe" program was constantly running and using up a lot of the CPU

            Thank you for posting this! &nbsp;I was almost to the point of completely wiping my computer clean thinking it was a virus because when I tried to delete the communications service from windows explorer, it said only the "system" could delete it. &nbsp;But after
 reading this, I just went into the main windows screen and right clicked over the mail program and uninstalled it from there and now my computer works great. &nbsp;Again, thank you for posting this and yes Microsoft needs to fix this bug. &nbsp;:)

            <p>Yeah, you should never try to delete stuff from the task manager. &nbsp;That can cause serious issues (Ex: delete "System").<br />
<br />
I'm glad that this post has helped you. &nbsp;It has been months since I posted this, and before you responded, I assumed that this issue was exclusive to me, and that this post was completely pointless overall. &nbsp;But now that I know you had the same problem as I
 did, I am aware that this has affected at least one other person. &nbsp;Interesting. &nbsp;Anyways, glad I could help. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I can confirm once again that this is indeed the fix for this situation: it's been quite a long time since I deleted the Mail app from my computer, and I've never had a freeze, crash, blue screen, etc. since I fixed the issue. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
It amazes me that little things like this can make someone think that their computer should be ditched altogether, when in reality the fix is simple.<br />
<br />
I would advise that you don't re-download the mail app. &nbsp;Ever. &nbsp;Just check your email on your browser. &nbsp;I miss the convenience of the mail app, but I am not going to risk the well-being of my computer just so I can access my email quickly.<br />
<br />
If only Microsoft was better than this. &nbsp;It amazes me how it is the CUSTOMERS who have to fix their computer, and not the COMPANY. &nbsp;In my opinion, the entire company started going downhill ever since Gates left. &nbsp;Since then, they've made Vista, which was terrible,
 7, which was pretty good, and of course, the infamous 8. &nbsp;Of course, after Gates left, a lot of their best employees left too. &nbsp;Hopefully Windows 9 will be an improvement.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you. &nbsp;I hope you don't have to endure any more Windows 8 fiascoes!!!</p>

            I am having the same problem.&nbsp; I uninstalled the mail app, but I am still having a problem with the Disk going to 100% and freezing up.&nbsp; It is not happening as much; however it is still a problem.&nbsp; What is frustrating is that at times it goes to 100% when
 processes are showing 0 MB/s.&nbsp; <br />

            Make sure you scroll down in the task manager, to ensure that you're seeing all of the programs. &nbsp;Double and triple check to make sure you can't identify the program that's hogging your resources.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help, try googling your issue. &nbsp;That may not help you much, but it's worth the try.<br />
<br />
If all else fails, call microsoft or you computer's manufacturer, and see if they'll help.<br />
<br />
Sorry I'm not much help!!! &nbsp;Good luck too you!!!

            <p>Thanks for the lead. I have been faithful to Microsoft because, on the whole, they provide a great solution set. However sometimes being all things to all men is not the right approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been frustrated and perplexed by the 100% disk usage - and the limited information available as to what the issue is. Since I don't use the 8.1 apps at all on my PC, I'm happy to uninstall them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is early to give conclusive results, but it looks like this solved my problem.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks.</p>

            <p>I had found a similar issue also with windows 8.1 I noticed all my devices would lose internet connection every 30 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assumed it was the router as all devices wired and wireless could not connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a week of no internet and over 4 hours on the phone to my ISP I started playing around and noticed everything worked if I disconnected my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check task manager and there is "Communications Service" eating up every bit of my bandwidth and crippling the router.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unbelievably bad, I can't believe how much time I've lost to this. </p>

            I logged in just to say thanks to you. I had tried everything from disabling superfetch, windows search to disabling BITS and ultimately reinstalling windows. None of these fixes helped and my hard disk usage stayed constantly at 100%. I was about to give
 up and take my pc to a service center when I read this post. I had uninstalled these 3 apps and I saw the results instantly. The usage dropped from 100% to straight 2-5%. The usage still reaches 100% at times but it lasts there for less than a second. Most
 of the time it varies between 0 to 10%. Thanks for sharing the solution. Hope it works out for other people too. &nbsp;

            <p>I have been using windows 8 ever since I got my laptop. Then, finally, I decided to upgrade to 8.1 and although I received the message that the installation failed, the machine immediately slowed down and the C disk is always at 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to do what you suggest, but I am not a technician so would you please give me some line by line directions?</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm not a technician either, nor am I a Microsoft employee. &nbsp;I'm just a normal Windows 8.1 user who found a computer-damaging glitch in 8.1. &nbsp;It's funny how Microsoft's CUSTOMERS are the ones who have to fix their computers' problems, and not the EMPLOYEES.
 &nbsp;Anyway, to the issue at hand.<br />
<br />
Well, first you need to determine what's causing the 100% disk usage, whether it's a Windows Start Menu App or a normal desktop program, or possibly a background process.<br />
<br />
How did you find out that your computer is constantly at 100% disk usage if you don't know how to use the task manager? &nbsp;Where did you see that your computer is constantly at 100% disk usage? &nbsp;You might actually know how to get to the task manager, as that
 is the only way to see your computer's disk usage, but didn't know you were actually using the task manager...<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, to get to the task manager, press and hold the following keys simultaneously: Ctrl + Alt + Delete. &nbsp;Upon doing this, your computer screen will change to one solid color with a list of choices on screen ("Lock", "Switch User", "Sign Out", "Change
 a password", and "Task Manager"). &nbsp;Click on "Task Manager". &nbsp;You will return to your desktop screen with whatever you were doing previously still on screen, except the task manager will open. &nbsp;In the task manager, click "More Details". &nbsp;Also, before you proceed,
 I would suggest you "pin" the task manager to your task bar (the bar on the bottom of your desktop screen where you can click on programs you have minimized to have them appear on screen). &nbsp;To "pin" the task manager to the task bar, right click on the task
 manager icon in the task bar (it looks like a desktop computer with a line graph on its screen), and click "Pin this program to the taskbar". &nbsp;Now you can just click on the task manager icon on your task bar even when it's not open so you can easily access
 the task manager (no more "Ctrl + Alt + Delete"). &nbsp;Now, back to the issue. &nbsp;You should have the task manager on screen, and you should have clicked "More details" in the task manager to view ALL of the processes taking place on your computer. &nbsp;There should
 be four columns in your task manager, one titled "CPU", the next "Memory", the next "Disk", and the last column "Network". &nbsp;Put your mouse over the word "Disk", and left click. &nbsp;If you've done this right, a little arrow pointing downwards will appear to the
 right of the "Disk" column resource percentage. &nbsp;What you've done is arranged the "Disk" column so that the process using the most resources is at the top of the column, while the processes using less resources are at the bottom. &nbsp;If the "Disk" column has
 99% or 100% usage (WHICH SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN, EVER, except when your computer is booting up), then there's a program, application, or background process hogging all of the disk usage. &nbsp;Look at the disk column, and watch to see which process is at the top of
 the list and is consistently using the most resources (example: System, 50 MB/s). &nbsp;If you notice that one process is hogging a lot of disk resources, look over to the left of the task manager window, under the "Name" column, and look at the name of the resource-hogging
 process. &nbsp;If the process is "livecomm.exe", then you need to delete the "Mail App" (how to do that later). &nbsp;If the resource hogging process is not "livecomm.exe", but something else, I can't help you, and I suggest you google the process' name to make sure
 it's not a virus (if you don't have an anti-virus software, by the way, then I HIGHLY suggest "Kaspersky Internet Security"), and figure out how to uninstall that process, if you can.<br />
<br />
Now, if the resource hogging process is "livecomm.exe", you're in luck; you simply need to delete the "Mail App" from your computer. &nbsp;If you use the "Calendar App" or "People App", be ready to say goodbye to these apps too; you cannot delete the "Mail App"
 without deleting the "Calendar App" and "People App" too. &nbsp;So, to delete the "Mail App", go to the Windows 8.1 Start Menu (if you're at the desktop, click on the Windows button, which is exactly at the left hand bottom corner of the desktop). &nbsp;Now that you're
 at the Start Menu, click the arrow in the circle pointing down (located near left hand bottom corner of the Start Menu). &nbsp;Now you'll see a big list of all the Windows 8.1 apps on your computer categorized in alphabetical ordered. &nbsp;Find the app called "Mail,
 Calendar, and People". &nbsp;Right click on this app and click "Unistall". &nbsp;The "Mail, Calendar, and People" app should disappear, and your problem should be fixed!!<br />
<br />
However, I would recommend that you still check the task manager...if it still reads 100% disk usage days after you uninstalled the "Mail, Calendar, and People" app, then you still have a problem.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you!!<br />
<br />

 "Sound, video &amp; game controller". When I&nbsp;am uninstalling&nbsp;&amp; reinstalling it, it is saying "failed" to install. I tried every way to reinstall this (by auto update driver, Microsoft fix, Microsoft troubleshooter, etc) but every time it failed to&nbsp;install. Can
 somebody help me on this. I have windows 7, professional.

            Hi TAYLOR 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

    <title>Boot manager missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> travis chilcutt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Boot manager missing</h2>
                    I have two identical Dell Precision 3430 desktop units with a 500GB RAID 1 array and Windows 10 on them. I set one up and created an image of it to load onto the other with a third party imaging program, Acronis True Image. In the Acronis software the
 image restored successfully but when I reboot the machine it says there is no boot device and now in the UEFI settings under the "boot sequence" tab there is nothing. On the other unit that I made the image from there is one option, "Windows boot manager",
 that is checked. I suspect that this is my problem. How can I get the boot manager back, or lacking that, manually set the hard drive with the fresh image on it as the boot device? I have tested the image on another machine and confirmed that it works.

<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't actually know... It was not on your Acronis Image ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something I have been successful with lately is simply copying boot files from one OS to another, although I was going from a UEFI setup to Legacy...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The UEFI setup does not look for boot files in the OS partition, so what is needed is not there...</p>
<p>I copied the Boot files from another Legacy Image to what had been the UEFI OS partition, and it booted right up...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same may also work for your issue, but I don't actually know...</p>
<p>You might try manually creating a EFI partition in the same location as the one on the original machine, and copy the contents of the original EFI to the new machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that repairing the boot on a UEFI can be problematic... I have more than once had to do a clean install of windows just to create the needed partitions, then load a saved image of the OS..</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be necessary to use a bootable 3rd party disk management tool to create the EFI partition, which must be FAT32, and then copy the files...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not 100% sure how the EFI redirects to the OS... whether is goes by the partition order\number, or something else...</p>

    <title>Windows 10 issue with MP4, games no 5.1 surround via Nvidia HDMI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikebelcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 issue with MP4, games no 5.1 surround via Nvidia HDMI</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
If I used Netflix APP I get 5.1 surround, so far, that is the only way I can get full 5.1 surround sound with windows 10. Games, MP4's or anything like that is only doing 2.1 sound.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have my HDMI cable coming out of my&nbsp;<span>Nvidia card to the input on my receiver. If I used an app like Netflix app it works fine in full surround but anything else from the PC using WMP or VLC is just stereo so this is a
 Windows 10 problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
If I google this issue it seems to fill the page with tons of people having the issue but what is the solution?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</span>

            Forgot to mention, to test things further, I copied some of my blue-ray MP4 movies that only play in 2.1 on my PC onto a thumb drive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I then plugged the thumb drive into my receiver, and they played in full 5.1 without issue so this is a Windows 10 problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            Hi Rick, it is possible Windows Update was updating a driver in the background when this happened, if so, it is nothing to worry about
<br />
<br />However, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Update: Has now happened several times. Have been working with windows support and they have been looking at the minidump files. Forgive my unfamiliarity with these terms, may not be presenting them correctly. There's been something called "dxggms2.sys"
 and "nvlddmkm". This has drawn there attention to my GTX 1060 GPU in the surface book 2 to be the cause, so they have updated the driver, as well as reset it back to an earlier driver, neither of which worked.

<br />Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />2. Your nVidia driver is very new. The driver date is 15-Nov-18. If BSOD started happening after 15-Nov-18, you have two optins
<br />Roll back nVidia driver
<br />Go to computer manufacturer's website and see if any driver is released after 15-Nov-18.

            I will try something like this again, but I think this is similar to what online support did the other day to no avail. I am currently using the computer detached from the keyboard and it has not crashed yet, so I am thinking that you are right about the
 nvidia being the problem. Do you have any other thoughts if this does not work?

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Crackling Sound</h2>
                    I've had my MS Pro 4 for a few days now. Updates are installed and it's working fine. I hear a crackling or arcing sound every once in a while. It even happens when in sleep mode. Should I be concerned or is there an explanation for this?

            Hello,<br />
<br />
There are many factors which cause the crackling sound on the Surface. Let's sort this out. However, to be able to understand the issue better, can you provide more details by answering these following questions:<br />
<br />
• Can you tell us when and where did you purchase the device?<br />
• Did you check if the crackling sound is recognizable with or without the power supply plugged in? Were there any differences?<br />
• What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?<br />
<br />
Let us know so we can help you further.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There might be certain apps/programs that cause the crackling sound. Were you able to determine the area where the noise comes from? Also, you might want to run the
<strong>Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</strong>, see if it helps. The diagnosis may take 15 minutes or less, but can take an hour or longer and depending on your internet connection speed and the repairs that the tool needs to do to fix the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're in the US, we recommend that you go to the nearest physical retail Microsoft Store and have your Surface device checked by our technician. It's the best way we can hear the crack/pop sound, and ensure that the replacement unit doesn't have the
 same issue. You might still be under the 90 day refurb replacement warranty so you might want to consider getting another replacement. You can also contact our
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Typically its restricted by your network speed and dependent on it you may not have enough bandwidth</p>
<p>You can run a speedtest on your xbox</p>
<p>You gotta.remember that just because you think you got a fast connection&nbsp; doesnt mean you have it</p>
<p>The internet works like this your connection to the internet is only one part of it</p>
<p>You have to connect to your local xboz access point lets say east coast usa</p>
<p>(Im guessing here. )</p>
<p>Meanwhile you (random locatiom) you ae in kansas</p>
<p>Your connection could be at chicago then new york then maine then pensylvania meanwhile.you could.have abbottle neck somewhere in any of those connections like 100mbs&nbsp;</p>
<p>That would restrict your speed</p>
<p>Remember..the internet is a series of networks. Not.all of.them.are fast or give you priority</p>
<p>Plus you have to connect to the amazon servers which could.be in california and the proccess repeats itself</p>
<p>Netflix recommendatio for 4k is 48mbs which is on the low end I suggest at least 100mbs</p>

            Honestly you should probably use the app off you're television for the best 4k quality.Vudu is probably the best place for 4k movies.Vudu also on xbox.

            I guess this issue is a problem of the location of the user. Maybe you are too far away from the next xbox servers. I personally not have an issue with 4k playback on netflix or prime on my xbox one x. But to be honest the most time i use the services
 i use the app build in my panasonic tv.&nbsp;

<p>Yeah that's what I have been doing, just unfortunate that we have to do this. I prefer using the atmos headphones I have. They are only compatible with my xbox or PC. My tv (Sony Bravia 900) doesn't recognize the adapter as a headphone peripheral.</p>

            I live just outside of D.C., I would figure the server would not to be too far from us. Although I never really checked to see, but I am getting DL speeds in the 200 plus an UpL in the 100 plus range.

<h2>            Installation of Windows Vista SP2 fails with error 80070246</h2>
                    Installation of Windows Vista SP2 fails with error code 80070246, but GlobalInstallOrder.xml is not corrupted. I have done a compare of the GlobalInstallOrder.xml file with the one taken from a PC where SP2 installation was successful, and there were no
 differences.<br />
However, the WindowsUpdate.log file reports quite some information that might point to the reason why the update could have failed. I just don't understand the details.<br />
<br />
I am running Vista Business, German, x86, pre-installed on a hp Compaq 6710b.<br />
<br />
The following is an excerpt from the WindowsUpdate.log file:<br />

======================<br />
Also, if I run sfc /scannow as administrator, is stops at 65% reporting that the Windows resource protection could not execute the required process (in German: "Der Windows-Ressourcenschutz konnte den angeforderten Vorgang nicht ausführen."), and an error message
 window pops up saying that the Windows Modules Installer was terminated and closed.<br />
<br />
I have successfully installed all Windows updates in the past 15 months (since I bought the notebook), but Vista SP2 fails.<br />
<br />
Any idea??

            Thanks, TaurArian, but I have already run the System Update Readiness Tool - that failed with the first two attempts on 13th and 14th July, but was successful at another attempt on 27th July. This is also confirmed by an entry in the&nbsp;Windows updates history.<br />
After this successful run of KB947821, I have done (among other, successful updates), four attempts to install the Vista Service Pack 2, but the all failed, still with the same error message. After the latest failed SP2 attempt, I printed the above part of
 the WindowsUpdate.log.<br />
<br />
The latest update today was a new version of KB915597, and just after this has been completed, the automatic update now proposes again to install Vista SP2. I'll give it another try...<br />
<br />
Any further idea?<br />
        </p>

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire collection not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Been having an issue with Store, Microsoft Solitaire collection and Mahjong not working.<br />&nbsp;When I click on the icons, nothing <br />happens.&nbsp; I have tried to reset the Store with wsreset command, remove <br />the store cache and reinstall all default<br /> apps, uninstall/install Microsoft solitaire collection and Mahjong to no avail. I can't reinstall as can't get "store" to work.<br /></p><p>&nbsp;All the other games Jigsaw, Minesweeper, &amp; Sudoku that I<br /> have download from the store works fine, just<br /> the actual Store, Solitaire Collection and Microsoft Mahjong does not.&nbsp; Just wondering if anyone knows a fix<br /> or solution that will get these games and "Store" back to working.</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t I install this app&#63; Error code&#58; 0x80080207 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I install this app&#63; Error code&#58; 0x80080207</h2>
                    I've been trying to download ilomilo plus, and I keep on getting the error message: "Something happened and this app couldn't be installed. Please try again." &nbsp;&nbsp;Error code: 0x80080207
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This started after I lost a connection to the net via my hotspot out in the boonies (it's the only way I can get Internet there). I may have gotten cut off at the very end of downloading ilomilo plus. Inside the tile, in the bottom right corner, it shows
 a red square, with a white circle, containing a black X. So since my connection speed hasn't been very fast out there, I decided to just delete the app and try again when I got home (20mbps connection there...)...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Even after getting to a fast and stable Internet connection, I still get the error every time when downloading this game. I've downloaded several other apps from the Windows Store and haven't received this error once. Only for ilomilo plus.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So if anyone has a good answer to this one (like maybe deleting some cache file somewhere? A registry edit???), that would be fantastic. I really hope that refreshing my PC isn't the only answer.</div>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this inquiry. I understand you're Xbox Live Gold subscription has expired and you're wondering why you are unable to play Fortnite multiplayer online. The reason for that is that the Xbox Live Gold subscription
 is what gives you access to play online multiplayer from your Xbox One. You would have to renew you're subscription to access the online features of the game. Hope this information helps

<p>For all of you having this issue, I was having the same as well, till I was messing around with TV integration, even thou I didn't have my cable hooked up to the Xbox I ran the set up, with that set up it came the option of the xbox enabling to control your
 tv with kinect. After that the kinect turns on my tv and xbox at once :)</p>

<p>That's what I figured &nbsp;has something to do with that TV integration, which I don't like cause sometimes I'll have my TV on already before the xbox (I tried to watch TV with the xbox, not a fan as of right now of it)</p>

<p>I will try that I thought I did that already but let me see for sure. Its turning on my TV when I do turn the XBOX on I just have to do it manually because the command XBOX ON doesnt turn my XBOX on at all.</p>

<p>VulkanX I think there is an option in the setup to turn off where the kinect wont mess with your TV at all and you can still use the XBOX on command to turn it on.</p>

<p>Well my wasn't turning on as well, I ran the TV Integration (even though I don't have TV hooked up to xbox) and the set up made it so both my TV and Xbox turn on at once.</p>
<p>It works great, other than that, I don't know what it could be.</p>

                    <p>I'm using Windows 8.1. &nbsp;When I check if my computer could run Windows 10, the message read, "It doesn't meet the system requirements. &nbsp;Here's why Windows 10 can't be installed on this PC. &nbsp;The CPU isn't supported."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the Windows updated installed. &nbsp;My computer meets all the requirements. &nbsp;I do question the graphic card. &nbsp;Windows 10 requirement is for Direct X9 or later w/WDDM 1.0 driver. &nbsp;My computer has&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Friends can&#39;t see any of my captures. Captures won&#39;t upload - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Friends can&#39;t see any of my captures. Captures won&#39;t upload</h2>
                    <p>I've had this problem before and&nbsp;fixed it, but now it's back. No one used to be able to see any of my captures, but then I realized it was a setting in my privacy settings that was the problem. So I set it to "everyone on the&nbsp;internet" to be able to see my captures, and it fixed my problem. But now after some time passed it's doing it again. If my friend tries to look on my profile at my captures it tells them that I haven't taken any. But when I look my captures uploaded to Xbox live are all there. My privacy settings are still set to everyone on the internet can see. I heard appearing offline can make it so your captures won't show to other people, but I am not appearing offline. And my cloud space for captures uploaded to xbox live is high but not 100%, only 95% right now, so that's not the problem either. I can't find any other possible reason why it would suddenly not let anyone see them again. Any advice???</p>
