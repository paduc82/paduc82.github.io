<h2>            Publisher help feature</h2>
                    I am using Office 365 so I think I have the latest version of everything. &nbsp;I'm working in Publisher but when I click on the "?" for help, I get a message that says it isn't available but I can go to Office.com. &nbsp;I don't find any Help download there. &nbsp;What
 happened to the help function or did I just neglect to install something?

            <p>MS has moved much if not all the Help content online. The days of reviewing a Table of content or Index of Help content that is installed with Publisher is over. And the online help is also limited.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to File &gt; Help. I haven't installed the newest version of Publisher yet but Pub 2010 shows a Getting Started option and Microsoft Office Help. If you click that you can type in your subject and search for content. There probably won't be a lot of content
 for Pub 2016 but as of Pub 2010 MS switched to the Ribbon Menu so the help content will be at least similar.</p>

            I don't object to help being online. &nbsp;But when you click on the question mark should it not go to the online help rather than just give a message that it's unavailable and telling me to go to Office.com? &nbsp;Seems like it ought to do that much.

<p>I agree. Each version of Publisher since Pub 2003 has had less and less Help content...built in or online. MS just doesn't seem to care about providing Help Content or instructions on how to use Publisher anymore.</p>

<h2>            Word file disappeared, replaced by &#34;Word Work File&#34; I can&#39;t open</h2>
                    I'm using Word 2004 on a Mac PowerBook G4. I had been working on a Word file and saving regularly to my flash drive. I believe I had also saved a version to My Documents on the hard drive. The file was originally created on a PC, but I had run the convert
 and it appeared to be working just fine.<br />
<br />
When I was finished with the file, I saved it again, and then clicked on the icon to create a .pdf.<br />
<br />
At that point, the Word doc disappeared, no .pdf appeared, and instead I got a window with the name "Word Work File D_109293954"<br />
<br />
Here's what I tried:<br />
<br />
*Looked for Word file on flash and My Documents menus. Result: Nothing.<br />
<br />
*Looked for .pdf in Acrobat and Reader. Result: Nothing.<br />
<br />
*Double-clicked on Work File icon in flash menu. Result: icon flashed for an instant.<br />
<br />
*Looked for Work File from within Word and Acrobat and Reader. Result: Nothing.<br />
<br />
*Tried to attach to a Gmail message in Firefox. Result: would not open/attach.<br />
<br />
*Tried to upload to AceProject online. Result: would not open/upload.<br />
<br />
*Looked for Word file in Recent Documents. Result: Word file did not show up.<br />
<br />
*Looked for Work File in Recent Documents. Result: Either wouldn't open or opened window with nothing there. (Can't remember which after all the troubleshooting.)<br />
<br />
*Closed Word/Office and looked for Word files again using Finder. Result: Could not open from flash.<br />
<br />
*Closed all windows/applications and looked again using Finder. Result: Could not open from flash.<br />
<br />
*Logged out and looked again, Restarted and looked again, Shut down and looked again. Result: Nada.<br />
<br />
<br />
Today: <br />
<br />
*Looked again for the Word file on the hard drive/My Documents. Result: Nada.<br />
<br />
*Looked on flash drive: Word document exists again! Double-clicked on it, and Word started, and it opened up. It isn't the final version, but it has some of the changes I made yesterday.<br />
<br />
The Word Work File is still showing up on the flash drive, and I am terrified to go anywhere near it!<br />
<br />
So, immediate crisis averted, but I need to know what to do now:<br />
<br />
1) What the heck do I do to keep this from happening again?<br />
2) What should I do if it DOES happen again?<br />
3) What should I do with the Word Work File that is still showing up in my flash drive document list?<br />
<br />
In case it's relevant, I had downloaded the latest Office 2004 update and XML Converter a few days before. Everything had been working fine, including conversions of Word and Excel files.<br />
<br />
THANK YOU to anyone who can help me with this bizarreness! I'm new to Macs and this computer was given to me by a friend after she got a new one, so maybe it's a simple fix?<br />
<br />

            The most important thing you can do to prevent this happening again is to NEVER save or edit documents to a removable drive. &nbsp;Just don't do it!
<div><br />
<div>The reason is that removable drives sometimes suffer read-write errors, or may run out of space. &nbsp;If they do that while you have a document open, this is what happens. &nbsp;Chances are, when you want to create the PDF, Word attempted to latch a space twice
 the size of the document on the flash drive, couldn't get it, and this is the result.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you try "File&gt;Open" from inside Word, using the Word File Menu, that Word File MAY open up. &nbsp;A work file is like the scribbled notes on my desk at work: some of them are complete documents, some of them are empty, or anything in between.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now you have your document back, you can delete that work file. &nbsp;These things are temporary files: if Word had not crashed, it would have deleted it for you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In future, NEVER work on a flash drive. &nbsp;Work on the local drive, save and close the document, then use the Finder to copy the result to the flash drive. &nbsp;You don't want this to happen again :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

            if you enabled the GROUP MESSAGING option, this will attempt to send them as multi media messages (MMS). it is likely that you either don't have the phone set up to send that type of messages or have no credit for them. disabling the Group Messaging option
 will allow you to send a message to multiple numbers at once as simple SMS.

            If you want to break those names into 3 columns, Excel can do that automatically for you . . .

Click the header on that column to select the whole column
On the Data Tab, in the Data Tools section, click Text to Columns

If that is not what you want, please let me know . . .

            I've just started learning about Pivot tables. Pivot table features and the tools used to setup your data to be used by pivot tables can do what you want

Take a look at the second, "Data cleaning" webinar at this page

MyExcelOnline 2 Pivot table webinars - https://www.myexcelonline.com/free-excel-webinars   

It will explain how you can use the 2016 "get and transform" feature to split up the names

MyOnlineTrainingHub 3 Pivot table webinars - https://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/excel-dashboard-webinar-reg.htm
MyOnlineTrainingHub 1 Power BI Dashboard webinar - https://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/excel-dashboard-webinar-reg.htm#pbi_anchor 


While you are at it, take a look at these other PivotTable Webinars (ie download them now, view later). They will be taken down any day now.  They are great learning materials.

<p>Hi Dave, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response! I'm not necessarily looking for columns, but more so for it to be translated into rows. So for Row 1, I have Karl, Grace and Patti. I want those names to appear on their own individual&nbsp;rows, while keeping the other&nbsp;information
 from the other columns the same. So Row 1 would have1/4/2017 KARL Members. Row 2 would then have the same date and descriptor ("Member"), but have a different name in column B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            This can be done only through Macro. The solution has also been uploaded to

https://1drv.ms/u/s!Akd5y6ruJhvhiWSM7HPXoT67kHTs

1. Make a backup of your workbook. 
2. Open your workbook and ALT+F11
3. Locate your Workbook name in Project Explorer Window
4. Right click on your workbook name &gt; Insert &gt; Module 
5. Copy paste the Macro code given and change "Sheet1" as per your requirement.
6. Go back to your Workbook and ALT+F8 to display Macro Window
7. Run your Macro from here
8. Delete you Macro if the Macro was needed to be run only once.
9. Otherwise save your file as .xlsm if you intend to reuse Macro again.

Sub Parser()
    Dim Ws As Worksheet
    Dim LastRow As Long, i As Long, j As Long, k As Long
    Dim Arr
    Set Ws = Worksheets("Sheet1")
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    LastRow = Ws.Range("A" &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row
    For i = LastRow To 2 Step -1
        Arr = Split(Ws.Cells(i, 2), Chr(10))
        k = i
        For j = LBound(Arr) To UBound(Arr)
            Ws

<p>We are using Outlook 2007/2010 and&nbsp;OWA for email access.&nbsp; One user is reporting that some email messages sent through webmail and which were received by the recipients several weeks ago are being resent when the user logons into their Outlook client.&nbsp; Any
 ideas?&nbsp; Since the recipients already received the mail it couldn't have been stuck in their Outbox, right?&nbsp; Any suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Kathy</p>

<h2>            Unable to close MS Word Document</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 2011 for MAC on a 365 Subscription. &nbsp;I am using Yosemite Beta. &nbsp;I am unable to close a certain word document. &nbsp;When I close the window, I get an error message "Microsoft Word has encountered a Problem and needs to close." &nbsp;I then have to option
 to "Recover my Work and Restart Microsoft Word." &nbsp;I also have the option to "tell microsoft about this problem." &nbsp;When I go to open word again, regardless as to whether or not I chose to recover my work, the same document opens again at startup. &nbsp;If I make
 changes to the document, the changes stick the next time I open the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deactivated my copy of Office, did a clean install, and it does the exact same thing with the same document, as if I never did the clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me with this please? &nbsp;Thanks</p>

            Well I'm at the Apple Store and the Genius figured out a better fix - exit full screen and close the document. &nbsp;It worked perfectly. &nbsp;He said that sometimes apps work different in full screen mode. &nbsp;I'm not sure why, but it works, and its better than my
 system of emailing myself the document and then deleting the original.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for creating another thread for your issue and for including the links of the previous thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have rechecked your domain account and I found out that it doesn't have a valid MX record. For us to check and isolate the issue, please try to configure the MX record of your domain first to have&nbsp;a valid MX record&nbsp;then try to reset the password of&nbsp;the
 account you are trying to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instructions on how to configure your MX record, please go to the article I posted below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/admin-wlsettings/handling-issues-with-mx-record-or-pending-dns/b722ed21-b20e-40e2-8dbb-26fa12003c32"><strong>Handling issues with MX Record</strong></a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results you may have after configuring your MX record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for looking at this again. I chose to create a&nbsp;TXT record instead of an MX record because I am not using&nbsp;MSFT for our mail server.&nbsp;The TXT record was accepted and the live domain was verified and set to "Active".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use a TXT Record to Prove Domain Ownership: <a href="http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/3d1e9f66-2f79-4f76-ba4e-9943ad206cac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://help.outlook.com/en-us/140/3d1e9f66-2f79-4f76-ba4e-9943ad206cac</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is an MX record needed for resetting passwords? My understanding is that the TXT and MX are simply for domain ownership validation (which I've done with TXT record), or if&nbsp;using MSFT as the mail server the MX would also point to their servers.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting back. To answer your query (<em><strong>Is an MX record needed for resetting passwords?</strong></em>), Yes. If the MX record is not properly configured, you will encounter an error message when resetting the password option for the
 accounts. Please refer to the post of Alden D on how to properly configure your domain's MX record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have other questions or any other concerns, please reply to this thread and we will be happy to further assist you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for checking Melanie although I'm not sure why it's showing as invalid. The admin center says to create and MX record with&nbsp;value&nbsp;"<span><u>379862a46eed41bbbe2108a07d16b0.msv1.invalid</u>", which I've done. I've also confirmed this with
 nslookup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>C:\&gt;nslookup<br />

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. </p>

<p>I have checked your account and it shows that your domain service status is already
<strong>Active</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your issue&nbsp;with the account&nbsp;that you cannot reset&nbsp;the password, investigation shows&nbsp;that you need to contact Microsoft account support&nbsp;team to fix this issue. You can submit&nbsp;it using this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/id-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The affected account was registered first before you have registered your domain in Windows Live Admin Center. Their support will be able to give you the necessary help on how to resolve the password reset issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the Microsoft Account Community forum has already been retired, I will now lock this thread for other customers who are encountering the same&nbsp;issue&nbsp;can also submit their private support request using the link above.

<p>Thank you for the info.</p>
<p>I didn't active Skype for Business intentionally as I only use normal Skype app on desktop.</p>
<p>I have however now gone into Office 365 and removed Skype for Business in my product license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched on my Mac and cannot find any other place to remove it so I assume O365 is the only place it was set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I removed Skype for Business from O365 I have restarted Outlook 2016 for Mac and the "O";s are still there.</p>
<p>Is there something else I need to change in Outlook or on my PC to remove these "O"'s?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it takes a little time after removing in the admin center of O365 to take affect on my Outlook on Mac.</p>
<p>

<p>Miguel,</p>
<p>I have removed Skype for Business from my Office 365. I have also removed all the files I could find on my MacBook.</p>
<p>However I still have the circles or "O"s as status of my email recipients in Outlook.</p>
<p>I have rebooted the Mac, restarted Outlook 2016 a few times and nothing gets rid of these "O".</p>
<p>Any advice to help me get rid of these in Outlook?</p>
<p>Thank you </p>

            Did you Uninstall Skype for Business Client from your Mac?
<br />
<br />Please try to generate a new Outlook Profile:

<br />
<br />If the issue persists check in the Outlook Options some add-ins related with Skype for Business or an option like: "Display online status next to name"
<br />
<br />If there is nothing like that, try to reinstall Office for Mac

    <title>How do I do a wildcard search for a string that includes brackets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ldmartin1959  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I do a wildcard search for a string that includes brackets &#34;&#91;&#34; and &#34;&#93;&#34;</h2>
                    I need to replace a bunch of "page numbers" which were manually inserted with spaces since they fall in the middle of text. They are in the format of "[###]" where ### is the actual page number. Obviously, the simplest way is to search for a string which
 begins with "[" , ends with" ]" , uses a wildcard in place of the actual page number value, and replaces the entire search string with a space.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is the brackets, of course. I can do a standard, non-wildcard search for a bracket (left or right) but when I try to combine that with a wildcard I of course have a problem since the brackets are reserved characters to separate the wildcards
 from the literals. I tried enclosing the bracket characters in brackets to no avail. Anyone got an idea how I could do this?</div>

            Use \[ and \] instead of [ and ]
<div>?</div>
<div>(i.e. backslash followed by "[" etc.)<br />
<div><br />
<div>However, I would avoid using * as the wildcard for "any character string" as you may find that it matches more than you expect. Probably better to use something like</div>

<p>\[[0-9]{1,10}\]</p>

<h2>            move text from cell A1 to one of 31 cells based on date in adjacent cell</h2>
                    <div>I posted this question below yesterday and recieved the following code</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>*****************************************************</div>
<div>Question</div>
<div>*****************************************************</div>
<div>I want to use VBA code with a cmd button to move a large amount of text from one cell to another based on the date in the adjacent cell. (See the spreadsheet located at&nbsp;http://sdrv.ms/11dY1vh). Cell A1 contains text data that I would like to move to one
 cell in a range of 31 cells. Cells D16:D47 are the destination range. Each cell in the&nbsp;D16:D47&nbsp;range has a date in the adjacent A16:A47&nbsp;range. I would like to move the data in cell A1 to the cell in the&nbsp;D16:D47&nbsp;range with the date in the adjacent cell that
 matches today's date. But, need a Msgbox to confirm overwrite if the cell already contains data. If no matches found in A16:A47&nbsp;for current date, then MsgBox indicating "no matches found", Thanks&nbsp;</div>
<div>*****************************************************</div>
<div>Answer</div>
<div>*****************************************************</div>
<div>Sub Button1_Click()<br />
&nbsp; Dim c As Range<br />
&nbsp; For Each c In Range("A16:A47")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If c.Value = Date Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If c.Offset(0, 3) &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not MsgBox("Destination contains: " &amp; c.Offset(0, 3) &amp; ". Confirm to overwrite with: " &amp; Cells(1, "A"), vbYesNo, "Destination cell not empty!") = vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.Offset(0, 3) = Cells(1, "A")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(1, "A") = ""<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; Next c<br />
&nbsp; MsgBox "No matches found!", vbOKOnly + vbInformation<br />
End Sub</div>
<div>*****************************************************</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This code works good, however I need to expand on the needed parameters. I requested code to move string data from cell A1 to one of 31 cells in the D16:D47 range based on the date in the same adjacent A range. But, all together, I need to move data from
 cells A1, I1, J1, K1, L1, M1, N1, O1 into the respective D, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W ranges. Please see the updated spreadsheet at this link http://sdrv.ms/11dY1vh</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>also for some reason, when there is not a matching date found (as in, a previous month) the code produces an error</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for all your help</div>

 Thank so much for all your help. </blockquote>
<br />
So, what is the trouble? Do the correct or wrong date appear in the correct or wrong places?
<br />
If you change the cells for your source data, just change the array "from_cells".<br />
If you change the columns for your destination, just change the array "to_columns".<br />
Make sure that <b>the sizes of the two arrays match.</b><br />
<br />
from_cells = Array("Y4","Y13","AA13","AC13","AE13", "AG13","AI13")<br />
to_columns = Array("D","R","S","T","U","V","W")<br />

    <title>How to deal with the extremely big &#42;.ost files in a Terminal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theothersiempre  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to deal with the extremely big &#42;.ost files in a Terminal Server environment which is running out of space</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our Terminal Server is running out of hard disk space, and the major files which occupy most of the space are *.ost files of the Outook, which come form the users which use the Terminal Server all the time through remote desktop. The Outlook is installed
 on the Terminal Server and various users can use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would be a solution in this case. Is there a way to limit the size of the *.ost files? I read in forums that having the Outlook 2010 set up in Cached Exchange Mode isn't the best practice for an environment where the hdd space is a major constraint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you suggest? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Dear Danial, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that the question is closer to the office side, rather than exchange side. As it has to deal with the space which is occupied by office, namely outlook ost files. I chose not to post to the exchange forum because our email servers are handled by
 another company. Do you think they can do something which can help us reduce the amount of disk space occupied by the ost files, or somehow mitigate the problem completely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
*.OST file is the Outlook data file which is created when Outlook&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;Microsoft Exchange Server.<br />
<br />
Please refer to the following article to learn more about Offline Outlook Data File (.ost):<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/outlook-help/introduction-to-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-HA010354876.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/outlook-help/introduction-to-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-HA010354876.aspx</a> (Offline Outlook Data
 File (.ost).<br />
<br />
As specified in my previous, this queries related to Exchange Server email account in Outlook&nbsp;would be better addressed in TechNet forum.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            <p>Power BI for graphing? How / where can I access this. I have exported the table / query to excel that I want to do a pivot table for. &nbsp;However, the dates are now not showing months and years, in addition to that - will I have to export the part of access
 that I want to do a pivot for, or is there a quick process that I will be able to do, so it is always set up, so when new information/data is being put into Access database that I will be able to update the pivots/charts within the excel software programme.</p>

            <p>I can't say I really understand what Microsoft is doing so maybe you can explain. I try to use charts in Access and find they are way too simplistic and minimalized so, unless I'm&nbsp;doing something very basic, they really don't work. I start to attempt to
 think outside the box and think maybe through pivot tables I might get something out of the charts. Oops! No pivot tables in Access 2016.</p>

</p><p>They are pulling the features out of Access and telling you to use Excel for your BI development. So, as a good soldier, I comply and build the appropriate queries in Access. Then when I attempt to connect to the database via Excel, I can't connect to these
 queries because "something" about them is not liked by Excel. Bottom line, the queries are semi-complex queries to get the data in a form that I should be able to chart with. But I find confirmation through other lists that&nbsp;formulas and multi-table/query joins
 will cause the query to be unavailable to Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I see that I should go out and take a look at PowerBI.&nbsp;What I'm hearing is that&nbsp;I'm suppose to purchase more 3rd party products and put my data at further risk by putting it on another site&nbsp;on-line because Excel and Access no longer work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really not doing anything complex. These queries and charts would be considered basic in SQL Server and SSRS. I've intentionally kept things pretty simple! I'm really confused. Should we no longer be using Access and start looking for a different tool?</p>

            <p>We inherited a spreadsheet that provides decent results. Unfortunately, data entry is a bit of a pain and maintaining master lists is troublesome compared to a code table. I figured I'd move everything to Access. But now I want to put in similar reporting,&nbsp;some
 of which are charts looking at several months of data. The chart below would be an example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find that Access limits the capabilities of its charts to 3 sets of data. So I figured I would just use Excel and built the appropriate queries to be able to pull the data into excel. To do this chart in Excel, it has two worksheets of data which are translated
 twice based on months and summations of columns and accumulation of&nbsp;$ throughout the month. With the final worksheet, you can then simply create the chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of all these cross tabs and data calculations looking for workday (i.e. WorkDay.Intl), this is simply done with a couple queries in Access. That's when I hit the snag of the charts being too simplistic in Access. Every video and demo I have found
 states you can only have 3 data sets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shrugged and figured I'd use Excel since I use to do that in a different environment with SQL Server.
</p>
<p>None of my queries are visible! After a couple hours of reading lots of blogs, help lists, etc., everyone is saying the same thing: It's a known issue that Excel can't see Access queries when they contain certain functions or multi-table/query joins. This
 pretty much kills 90% of the reporting which kills the whole concept of using an Access database. It's no good putting the data in if I can't get it back out.</p>

<p>Hi Mr. Pool,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wwe don't have an official article that describes how to create smart link for Office 365 services including Microsoft Forms. Regarding the method is providing in a third-party website, I'd suggest

    <title>Outlook.com calendars not showing up on windows phone 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook.com calendars not showing up on windows phone 8</h2>
                    I am using a windows phone 8, HTC 8x, GDR3. &nbsp;Before today I had only 2 outlook.com calendars and both sync fine with my phone. &nbsp;I just created another outlook.com calendar using my PC and internet browser. &nbsp;But that calendar is
<u>not</u> showing up on my windows phone 8. &nbsp;To make sure there was good connectivity between the phone and outlook.com I created a calendar event with the PC on one of the two calendars actually showing up on the phone. &nbsp;That event was displayed on the phone
 very quickly. &nbsp;I edited that even with phone and the change was reflected on the outlook.com calender on my PC. &nbsp;So there is definately two way communication between the phone and outlook.com calendar. &nbsp;So why won't the newly created calendar show up on my
 windows phone 8? &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also - I have rebooted the phone twice. &nbsp;Once with connected to wifi, once using data only.</div>

<p>Without diagnosis that may be never.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that you don't see the symptom using MUF IE suggests (as was indicated) that the symptom is being caused by an incompatible add-on.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, try doing some tests to help identify a cause.&nbsp; E.g. start IE Desktop
 this way (an extreme method of getting into No Add-ons mode and avoiding the user's Home page):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run... (e.g. press Win-R and enter:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>iexplore.exe&nbsp; -nohome&nbsp; -extoff</p>
<p>
</p><p>To proceed from there you may need to use Stop (e.g. press Alt-V p) to get out of the No Home state.&nbsp; Then see if you can avoid your problem symptom while testing the problem scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013&#62; Navigation Pane&#58;  Horizontal Scroll Bar Missing in Win 8.1</h2>
                    <p>PRIOR CONFIG: &nbsp;Windows 7, Outlook 2013</p>
<p>NEW CONFIG: &nbsp;Windows 8.1, Outlook 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>I retired my Win 7 PC and replaced it with a new Win 8.1 PC. &nbsp;I installed Office 2013 per my valid license on the new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 100+ folders and some of the folder names are long. &nbsp;On the Win 7 PC, the navigation pane has a horizontal scroll bar, so when I want to read a wider folder name, I simply scroll to the right. &nbsp;On the Win 8.1 PC, the horizontal scroll bar is missing
 and I cannot find a way to restore it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a way to get this feature back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;I'm aware that I can also hover the mouse pointer over the folder name to see its extended name.</p>

            That is actually normal behavior. There is no&nbsp;horizontal scrollbar in the Navigation Pane.&nbsp;The folder name will be truncated with ... instead.

<p>
</p><p>There were so many changes in the June 1st release that we felt it wouldnt make sense to publish a wiki, essentially saying.. "Try it all and let us know"..</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just published an updated android app with an updated change log and iOS will follow in due course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My messages to you is essentially - "Watch this space"</p>

            <p>I noticed since this new IOS release, you can no longer see the "STATUS" of the users. &nbsp;For example on my PC i can see status as GREEN, ORGANGE, or RED .... &nbsp;i can also set my status on PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the new iOS release, i cant do any of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will this remain like this or are you going to fix it ?</p>

<div>There were no Themes as such in Word 2000. You probably created templates. These will should work fine in newer version of Word but you need to install them in the Templates folder for Word.</div>

<p><br />
Just for conversation sake, do you remember Format/Themes and the Style Gallery?&nbsp;I think it's more like Style Sets but it would also add a page background color if there was one added in the template (I think - I'm going on memory). So maybe a combination of
 the new Themes feature in Office 2007 and Style Sets?? Actually, it looks like the old Style gallery is still available.</p>
<p>Of course, I suspect that's not what "mplatt55" is referring to but there was a theme-type feature. &lt;grin&gt;</p>

<h2>            Error while creating document set in SharePoint library</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have functionality where i need to create multiple document sets using custom content type and then upload documents to that particular document sets, in this process i am seeing an issue while creating document sets using REST api code, check the screen
 shot below and the error is "<strong>content type that are available to this document set have been added or removed</strong>"</p>
<p>and this issue is not happening for all the document sets its happening randomly, could you please let me know what could be the issue, do i need to do some code changes?</p>
<p>

<h2>            The Move To button no longer works in Hotmail</h2>
                    The Move To button no longer works reliably since Hotmail was changed to Outlook&nbsp; This is an essential feature... I agree new Hotmail is hopeless&nbsp;

            <p>Hi darmad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me assist you resolve your concern about the "Move" button that is not working since you were upgraded to Outlook. It is possibe that your browser is causing this problem. I suggest that you
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache#Firefox_4.0_.2F_5.0_.2F_6.0_.2B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
optimize your browser</a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>, clear browser's cache and temporary internet files. It is also important to use an
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/supported-browsers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
updated browser</a>.&nbsp; If you’re not using an updated browser, some parts of <span>
Outlook</span> might not work and display properly. </font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
