            <p>Hi Sarita,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that&nbsp;MSE is blocking parts of the game for some reason.&nbsp; This should show if you open History and check detected items.&nbsp; Those would be the items you need to exclude (as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you see nothing listed, check the icon that starts the game to see the location and name of the file.&nbsp; Do this for each game giving you troubles.&nbsp; These are the most likely culprits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know the process name and location it is going to run (it should show in Task Manager along with the path when the program runs) or the program's filename or the active file it uses for the program (you would need to get this from&nbsp;Bigfish or it might
 be available as the target for the game's shortcut icon&nbsp;as I assume you needed or need to download some file or files before you could play the game and possibly while playing the game and it may be that MSE will detect them as "false positives" and block
 them) or know the filetype it is sending to your computer if unique&nbsp;(or the location it is sending it/them to if it is a specific folder), then all you need to do is to open MSE and go to Settings and exclude the files/processes/filetypes/locations (at the
 smallest level possible) that are causing the problem,&nbsp; Remember, each item you exclude leaves a tiny hole in your security, so keep what you are excluding to a minimum.&nbsp; Once you find a combination where the games work again, try removing exclusions while
 playing the game (if the game still works, that exclusion isn't needed, if the game stops that exclusion is needed) until you get down to the bare minimum required.&nbsp; If this doesn't work or you can't figure it out, try submitting a free&nbsp;MSE email support case
 to Microsoft Support starting here: <span>
<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If MSE is the cause, then that should solve it.&nbsp; Actually if you want to take a quick but minimal risk to see if it is MSE causing the problem, then shut down anything using the internet.&nbsp; If the games do not use the internet, disconnect from the internet
 but if they use the internet then just be on the game site in one tab in one window and have no other windows or tabs (or your email) open to minimize the risk.&nbsp; Then open MSE and go to Settings and click Real Time Protection and uncheck the box at the top
 and save settings.&nbsp; This will disable MSE from real-time protection.&nbsp; Try the game.&nbsp; If it works, then MSE is likely the cause and you need to proceed as indicated above.&nbsp; If the game doesn't work, then MSE is not the cause because the game wouldn't work when
 MSE wasn't working and you need to find another solution - I'd contact Bigfish fechnical support for help.&nbsp; Turn MSE Real-Time Protection back on ASAP after the test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, t<span>ry a clean boot (Vista and W7)
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;(but with MSE&nbsp;running since we either fixed it or ruled it out above). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down
 the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode
 then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a> and
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Bing vs Google - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bing vs Google</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does your team feel about the fact that one of the most popular search on Bing is...."Google" ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, I work for international firms since years, and I've never ever seen anyone considering Bing as a valuable search engine. We're "suffering" Bing because it's the default search engine we're delivered with our Windows computers, but no one is willing
 to use it and one even comes to wonder how do Bing brains work to come to such inconsistent search results. Would be funny to understand ^^</p>
<p>
</p><p>So much that my current firm is definitely abandoning any MS feature - even MS Office - to switch to some other solution. We cannot afford to wait for Microsoft to bounce back in question, which will apparently never happen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p />

<p>Probably you are waiting the answer from MS team but your topic is very theoretical. How does Renault feels about Mercedes? And why people use DuckDuckGo search if even Bing has poor places with the people feedbacks? Does it mean that all search services
 after Bing need to be closed completely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only one correct answer - people will use the search service which will be relevant to their needs. I suppose Bing is interesting with the results because can give good places for website that couldn't be in top of Google because the top is already
 collected with trusted, old and full of backlinking sites. Good if you need it but if not?</p>

<h2>            Onenote &#34;New Section&#34; constantly greyed out</h2>
                    I have recently upgraded to OneNote 2016 on Windows 10. &nbsp;The "New Section" and "New Section Group" options become greyed out constantly. &nbsp;<strong>I have taken advice and cleared the cache</strong>, but it happens every time I close my computer that I have
 to do this. &nbsp;The notebooks I am using are on a local drive (not on OneDrive). &nbsp;I can add pages, but the new section option almost never works until I clear the cache. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi MathForDragons,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an engineer from the OneNote team. I would like to help you figure out why your "New Section" and "New Section Group" buttons are disabled. There are a few reasons that we may intentionally disable (grey out) these buttons:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You're currently navigated to the notebook's recycle bin. If this is the case, you'll see some text containing "RecycleBin" under the notebook name.</li><li>The notebook was created with&nbsp;an&nbsp;old version of OneNote, and hasn't been converted to the new format.</li><li>OneNote received an access denied error when trying to perform some operation on the notebook. This doesn't persist across sessions, so if it was a one-time error, restarting onenote should enable section creation again.
</li><li>The notebook you're trying to create sections in is a "virtual notebook". There are a few scenarios where you can get a virtual notebook, like if you copy+paste a .one file outside of its original location, and then open it using OneNote. Another way is
 if you're in "unfiled notes" or "misplaced sections".</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think any of these could be the&nbsp;problem?&nbsp;If not, we can try some other things to figure out exactly why these buttons are disabled for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Kit Hymel</p>

            Hello.&nbsp; I am working with an end-user who is having the same problem: the +Section button is grayed out in onenote.com.&nbsp; And when she clicks "Edit in OneNote", the file opens in OneNote but instead of seeing the file name to the left of the tabs, she sees
 "Open sections".&nbsp; She can add a new section here in OneNote by clicking the "+" to the right of the tabs, those sections don't sync, and end up in "Misplaced sections".&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated!

            <p>I have not solved this problem yet. &nbsp;My issue is only occurring on the desktop version (not using onenote.com). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have narrowed it down to one solution and one unsolved problem</p>
<p>Solution: remove the "cache 16.0" folder under AppData/local/Microsoft/OneNote &nbsp;You must have Onenote closed to make it work</p>
<p>Problem: Some sort of permission problem at the folder level is setting the permissions to the directory to this section as read only. &nbsp;I can still save notes but can not create a new section in that folder.</p>
<p>Notice the images below for the issue I am having.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To be able to add new section you need to be in a notebook. Not in a single note file.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t add URL to ie 11 compatability mode view</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting messages that IE 11 can't open certain sites. So I'm trying to use compatibility mode view. Here's the procedure I'm using: open the desired web page and get the message, copy the URL from the address line (I know the URL is correct since
 it opens in other browsers), open compatibility mode view, paste the URl in the space allotted and then click the add button. Nothing happens. Am I doing something wrong or is there a fix?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>when you select Tools&gt;Compatibility View settings menu it should display the current website DOMAIN (not full address) in the text area and the Add Site button is enabled....<br />
<br />
you can add DOMAINS, but not web page addresses.<br />
<br />
eg. <a href="http://somesite.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://somesite.com</a> not <a href="http://somesite.com/homepage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://somesite.com/homepage.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally there should be no reason to add sites to your personal compatibility lists, especially with IE11.....<br />
<br />
1. ensure you have checked "Include updated website lists from Microsoft" on the Compatibility View settings dialog.<br />
2. If possible include links to any websites you are having problems with your questions... that way we can visit them to investigate possible reasons for problems.<br />
3. Some third-party browser addons add markup (computer code) to web pages.... this can alter the display of certain webpages... including the address of problem web pages allows us to diagnose what addons may be causing the problem.
<br />
<br />
On Windows 8.x IE11 you can select the File&gt;View in Immersive browser menu option to open and display the currect website page in the noAddons/noPlugins IE version.... If it displays fine in that version then you know its one of your IE Addons....</p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable Toolbar and Browser Helper addons in IE desktop go<br />
Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced tab, uncheck "Enable third-party browser extensions".... (close and restart any open IE desktop windows for the full changes to take affect).<br />
<br />

            Hello. To clarify your question, are you unable to see the Win CE interface? It sounds like your device already has Win CE installed as the operating system. The GPS&nbsp;manufacturer may have placed a user interface on top of Win CE to facilitate the&nbsp;GPS functionality.
 If you are having problems with the device, you can probably&nbsp;reset it back to factory conditions if you read the manual. The mobile&nbsp;versions of Windows (CE, Mobile, Phone) are not for sale to&nbsp;the consumer. They are licensed to manufacturers to modify and fit
 their devices. &nbsp;

    <title>Updating Chart titles with links to a cell in a worksheet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Updating Chart titles with links to a cell in a worksheet</h2>
                    <p>I've been able to dynamically update chart titles with links from the Chart Title to a cell in a worksheet.&nbsp;&nbsp; This consistently works when the charts are embedded in the worksheet, but the link seems to be lost for titles on Chart Sheets.&nbsp; Has anyone had
 this issue, and how have you resolved it?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just did a quick test in 2016, and when I convert a chart from an embedded&nbsp;sheet chart to standalone 'chart sheet', the link to a cell&nbsp;was retained, and changes to the source cell were reflected on the chart sheet title. I didn't test extensively because
 I wasn't sure under what conditions you are seeing the problem (and I'm on a different version)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this happen when you are converting charts, creating new standalone chart sheets, or both?</p>
<p>Do the links originally work and then get "lost" when you save the file or take some other action?</p>
<p>Are you using any VBA code that touches the chart(s)?</p>

<p>These charts have been stand alone chart sheets the whole time and have never been embedded.&nbsp; The title was linked to a cell on a worksheet at one time and then went away.&nbsp; I can relink them, but the link&nbsp;goes away again.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I do touch the charts with VBA
 and don't think I do anything that would affect the title, but I'll have to look at that a bit further, just in case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div>
<div>Here's a quote from the&nbsp;<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/Documents/UseTerms/Office%20for%20Mac_2011_English_fc8a2912-2708-44e0-ba04-14d72d2957ba.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office
 2011 Home and Student EULA</a>:</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>"<b>License Rights:</b>&nbsp;For software marked “Home and Student Family Pack”, you may install one copy of the software on up to three licensed devices in your household for use by people for whom that is their primary residence. The software may not be
 used for commercial, non-profit, or revenue-generating activities.</i></div>
<div><i><br />

<div><i><b>&nbsp;REASSIGN TO ANOTHER DEVICE.</b>&nbsp;You may reassign the license to a different device any number of times, but not more than one time every 90 days. If you reassign, that other device becomes the “licensed device.” If you retire the licensed device

<div>That second paragraph should answer your question. Since you removed the software, you have freed that license and can now reassign it to another device. You can look up the EULA yourself using the link below:</div>

    <title>Need help getting a hotmail.co.uk account back - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Need help getting a hotmail.co.uk account back</h2>
                    I seriously need some help. I'm using my new outlook email address now but I need to access my old hotmail.co.uk email but I can't as Microsoft have deleted it because I didn't use it for a period of time. I use it for my PlayStation log in but have now
 forgotten my password on my PlayStation log in. I can't change the password as they send the password change email to my regiestered email which is the hotmail.co.uk one. I thought maybe I could try create the hotmail.co.uk account with the same name again
 but they don't give you the option anymore. I don't know what to do now?

<p>You are correct, that option<strong> no</strong> longer exists...you can <strong>
only</strong> create @outlook.com and @Hotmail.com addresses when creating new accounts.</p>

    <title>Lock screen doesn&#39;t update with Bing background - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick214  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lock screen doesn&#39;t update with Bing background</h2>
                    I recently discovered that you can select the Bing backgrounds for your lock screen. &nbsp;Unfortunately&nbsp;I also discovered a bug. &nbsp;Even though the&nbsp;Bing&nbsp;background updates daily, the lock screen doesn't. &nbsp;Unless you go back into your settings, and re-select
 Bing for your lock screen.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This of course is a minor bug, but a little annoying to have to do daily.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm sorry, not to be a jerk, but a response saying "this is simply not a feature we currently offer" is a little unacceptable. &nbsp;Windows 8 phones boasts about the live tiles and apps. &nbsp;This seems like an obviously live feature since it is a pure microsoft
 app/feature.</div>

<div><br />
<div>This has only happened to me once and I went into the settings and changed the lock screen from Bing to Facebook, let that download and then changed it back to Bing again and that was a month ago and it has been going strong this whole time.</div>

<p>Here is a User Defined Function (UDF) that assumes the entries might<br />
be more complex than what you have presented.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; If there are initial titles, they will be terminated with a<br />
period.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The last name will be terminated by a comma, or it will be the<br />
last word in the string.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; If there is not title or trailing descriptor, you only want the<br />
last name returned.</p>
<p>To enter this User Defined Function (UDF), &lt;alt-F11&gt; opens<br />
the Visual Basic Editor. Ensure your project is highlighted<br />
in the Project Explorer window. Then, from the top menu,<br />
select Insert/Module and paste the code below into the<br />
window that opens. <br />
To use this User Defined Function (UDF), enter a formula<br />
like</p>
<p>:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =TitleLastName(A1)</p>
<p>in some cell.</p>
<p>============================<br />
Option Explicit<br />
Function TitleLastName(s As String) As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim re As Object<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Const sPat As String = "^(([^.]*\.)+\s)?.*?(\w+)(,.+|$)"<br />
Set re = CreateObject("vbscript.regexp")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With re<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Pattern = sPat<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Global = True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .MultiLine = False<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End With<br />
TitleLastName = re.Replace(s, "$1$3")<br />
End Function<br />

    <title>Dynamic Crosstab report - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> questionboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dynamic Crosstab report</h2>
                    <p>I created a crosstab report where the user select which groups should appear. This then causes Access to **** (seriously c*r*a*p is a word that get block by MS, wow!)&nbsp;out errors because the number of columns varies and it apparently cannot adapt.
</p>
<p>I went looking and found an example by Duane Hookom, http://www.rogersaccesslibrary.com/forum/cross-tab_topic11SID=a1e7c9cb-2fc9-a8ce2929-1ab7a125-zd3zb9b1.html, but can't seem to figure out how it work? I think it does what I need, but I am lost. Anyone
 can explain or provide another alternative? </p>
<p>MS: This should be addressed in future version of Access, as there are countless posts on the subject. This would be a valuable feature/improvement! QuestionBoy</p>
<p>PS: MS, you have a problem with your forum (yet another).&nbsp; When it edits words that it finds offensive, it remove all the formatting in the entire&nbsp;post.&nbsp; As it did with this post until I edited it again.</p>

<br />
I don't normally reference a control by means of a fully qualified reference in this sort of situation, but I do reference it by means of the Form property rather than the control name alone e.g.<br />
<br />
WHERE CategoryID = Form!CategoryID<br />
<br />
when correlating combo boxes etc.&nbsp; This should avoid any possible ambiguity.<br />

<h3> ayush ojha  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I manage a lot of skype accounts I own&#63;</h2>
                    It all started when I reset my skype password via primary email. This and that and now, apparently I have 3 different skype profiles: based on a username, email and phone number. Since it boggles my mind whenever I have to login, is there a way to merge
 them in some way or at least delete 2 of them? Thanks in advance!&nbsp; &nbsp;

</p><p><strong>Question: </strong><em>Since it boggles my mind whenever I have to login, is there a way to merge them in some way or at least delete 2 of them?
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>We cannot merge two or more Skype accounts together. What possible is to merge a Skype account to a Microsoft account. On the other hand, yes, you can delete your other Skype accounts by following the steps provided in this link:

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Please be advised that deleting your Skype account will also result in deleting the Microsoft account associated with it.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for update and reply.</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could have occurred due to these reasons:<br />
1. Conflict between external devices.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Conflict between antivirus software.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>3. Missing Updates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span> </span>
<p><span>Try the steps listed here:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I suggest you to disconnect all the external devices and check if that helps.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you to make sure you have installed all the available Windows Updates including Optional&nbsp;Updates. You may also install all the latest device drivers from the computer manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3:</strong>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you to temporarily disable antivirus or security software. Check if it helps.<br />
</span><strong><br />
<span>Warning</span></strong><span>: <br />
1. Please make sure to re-enable Antivirus software after troubleshooting steps.<br />
2. Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as
 you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>

    <title>Contacts does not show when calling - double contacts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Contacts does not show when calling - double contacts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have - for the first time - a problem with my phone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem is that when a Contact CALLS only the number shows up. SMS, email and MMS and others shows the Contact NAME and info and so on, but when they are Calling, only the number shows up on the screen. I have the Contacts in my Contact list and when
 I look at them on my computer (via Outlook.com / Contacts) I can see that they are added twice, not on the list, but when I choose a Contact I see that the Icon and text Outlook is twice.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, when I try to link concats they still show as double or some times Three times on my phone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What is wrong here? </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sorry for my bad English, it is not my primary language.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi&nbsp;Sachie10,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know whether you are an Office 365 user which you mentioned it gives the error "<span>We couldn't find a mailbox for this recipient. Either they don't have a mailbox or don't have a license assigned"?
 If so, you can refer to&nbsp;</span><span>Leonard's reply to check whether the user has been soft deleted or check if it can be restored. Please be noted that you may need to contact your admin for help as the
 detailed performance needs to be done by an admin. Also, a screenshot about the error is also appreciated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Alan</span></p>

<h2>            Start menu taking full screen</h2>
                    When I upgraded to the last build, the small start menu went a way.&nbsp; It was replaced by a full screen of tiles and the hamburger button in the upper left corner.&nbsp; Is there a way to get the normal start menu back?&nbsp; Windows 10 is&nbsp;running on a desktop with
 build 10130.&nbsp; Thanks.

            I don't remember specifically about Build 10030 but, starting a few builds ago (I'm on Build 10162), the Start screen size is set by going to Settings&gt;&gt;Personalization&gt;&gt;Start&gt;&gt;Use Start Full Screen&gt;&gt;Select "No" if you want the reduced size.<br />
