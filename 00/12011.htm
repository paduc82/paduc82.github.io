    <title>Upgrade from Office 2013 to 2016 - Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrade from Office 2013 to 2016 - Outlook</h2>
                    Microsoft did the upgrade, didn't tell me and a week later I could no longer use Outlook like in the beginning with a drop down menu&nbsp;showing my&nbsp;three email accounts and passwords (never would remember the fourth one).&nbsp; Went online for help but after much
 ado (I don't think the tech understood my question) the individual said that was part of the upgrade...no more drop-down menus with addresses and passwords.&nbsp; Not only is this frustrating but why can't Microsoft let you know when an upgrade is scheduled/performed
 and what is affected?

            <p>Presumably you have a 365 subscription license as that is the only type of license that upgrades Office/Outlook.</p>
<p>You are referring to MS Outlook and not outlook.com accessed via your browser?</p>
<p>I really dont know what you refer to by 'drop down menus and passwords' </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>When you start MS Outlook if you get a Profile prompt it means you have set up multiple outlook Profiles, which is not the norm</p>
<p>Do you have this when you start Outlook?</p>

            I don't have 365...this was Office 2013 that was purchased with the machine a year or so ago.&nbsp; I do use outlook.com via my browser.&nbsp; The tech showed me on my computer (I gave them access) that it had indeed been upgraded; I didn't do this.&nbsp; A few days
 after the upgrade took place when I logged in to outlook.com I could no longer just start typing my email address and have a drop down menu&nbsp;that allowed me to choose which of my 3 accounts I wished to use.&nbsp; My password was automatically filled in.&nbsp; It never
 would remember my 4th account or password.&nbsp; Now I must type in each email address and password when I want to access any of my 4 email accounts.&nbsp; Not a big deal, just was very spoiled by having fewer key strokes to enter.&nbsp; Again, with no notification that
 this all took place and then not finding what was upgraded, or not, was frustrating.&nbsp; The tech was of no help with that info; just said that the auto info that I was accustomed to seeing was no

            Actually it was Home &amp; Student 2013 with our new computers a year or so ago.&nbsp; The tech indicated that Outlook was no longer offered with the recent upgrade Microsoft put on my computer.&nbsp; I used Outlook.com from the web, not as an app.&nbsp; It's not a big deal
 to type in each of my 4 email addresses and passwords but before all I had to do was click on the email address box and a drop down menu appeared with the email addresses in it (except it would only ever remember 3 of the 4).&nbsp; The password automatically popped
 up when I tabbed to the box.&nbsp;

            <p>If you purchased the lifetime Office 2013 version that doesn't upgrade to Office 2016 unless the user physically purchases Office 2016.</p>
<p>An outlook.com mail account can be accessed via your web browser, or it can be added to MS Outlook as a mail account</p>
<p>So is the problem when accessing outlook.com via your web browser or when starting MS Outlook, as per the pic uploaded?</p>
<p>Having seen your latest post 2013 H&amp;S did not include MS Outlook or any mail program, neither would it have been upgraded unless you physically purchased the 2016 version</p>
<p>Win 10 has the mail app, to which you can add your outlook.com mail account</p>

    <title>Pivot Chart Value displayed as percentages not working correctly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sherry1067  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot Chart Value displayed as percentages not working correctly</h2>
                    I have created a pivot chart off of my pivot table. I have used the same category twice (overall rating)...I want it displayed once as a straight count number and in the second row as a percentage. It appears perfectly correct in my pivot table, however,
 in my chart it continues to display the percentage as a decimal point number...i.e., the actual value is 0.058823529 but I have formatted the cell and the value to appear as a straight percentage...in this case should be 6%. Any ideas on how I can correct
 this or what I am doing wrong? Thanks.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8294b2dd-8525-48ef-96ce-728aca59acd3" />

</p><p>Skype and Microsoft have really made things really difficult when it comes to managing Skype and Microsoft account. With all the technology in the world, is unexplainable how Microsoft a giant tech company has made something so simple as linking and unlicking
 a Skype account brain surgery.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>VLOOKUP for multiple rows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theboylon  say:</h3>
<h2>            VLOOKUP for multiple rows</h2>
                    <p>I have a worksheet which relate to electrical outlets. To display the details of a single circuit a simple VLOOKUP of a circuit number will display all the details of said circuit. I want to be able to do a search of a panel which will have multiple circuits
 on it. A VLOOKUP won't work because it only sows 1 row at a time. How do I create a formula similar to VLOOKUP that does the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I input a panel number into a cell</p>
<p>2. The results can be up to 25 circuits and i need all of these to be shown below the cell I just enter the panel number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Hi Theboylon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like to use a formula to find and return all matching values in Excel, I would like to suggest you use the INDEX array function to achieve it. You can refer to the example below: =IF(ISERROR(SMALL(IF(IF(ISERROR(SEARCH($A$9,$A$1:$A$7)),FALSE,TRUE),ROW($A$1:$A$7)),ROW($C$1:$C$7))),"",INDEX($A$1:$C$7,SMALL(IF(IF(ISERROR(SEARCH($A$9,$A$1:$A$7)),FALSE,TRUE),ROW($A$1:$A$7)),ROW($C$1:$C$7)),3))</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04643d08-a858-430d-951b-4fa4765c096d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04643d08-a858-430d-951b-4fa4765c096d?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note press the keys to enter an array formula (CTRL+Shift+ENTER on PC or Command+Shift+Enter on Mac). For more details:

    <title>No option to accept&#47;decline a meeting using context menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clevsparrow  say:</h3>
<h2>            No option to accept&#47;decline a meeting using context menu &#40;right click&#41; for a shared moderated room calendar in Outlook 2011</h2>
                    We have set up a shared room resource that is moderated such that anyone could schedule a meeting in the room but it would be set to tentative and an email would be sent to the admin of the room to accept/decline the meeting invitation. &nbsp;This is normally
 done using the buttons in the email message that allow the admin to accept/decline/tentative the meeting. &nbsp;However, in OWA and Outlook 2010 for Windows, the admin user can right click on the tentative meeting placed on the room calendar and select options
 to accept/decline/tentative. &nbsp;Outlook 2011 for Mac does not have these options. &nbsp;This is an Exchange 2010 environment. &nbsp;Is this a limitation of Outlook 2011 for Mac (again)?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Another university documents the connection to the shared room resource at:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>http://helpdesk.illinoisstate.edu/kb/1277/Managing_moderated_rooms_and_equipment_in_Exchange_using_Outlook_and_OWA/</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>They give no hint of the Outlook 2011 for Mac limitation.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This seems a bit strange since using OWA (web interface to an Exchange account), the user can access the shared room calendar and right click to accept/decline/tentative the meeting.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Once again this is a shared room resource calendar that is moderated on Exchange 2010.</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>I guess most Mac users are OK with accepting/declining the meeting using the options in the email message. Although for the person's calendar, right click on the tentative event works but do for shared calendars. &nbsp;There must also not be too many Mac users
 who are moderators for Exchange room resources...

<p>
</p><p>The form I am manually populating has a Parent Form and a Tab with 3 subforms:</p>
<p>Parent + Subform Required Documents,</p>

<p>The Part number is a combo box that allows you to select the part number you have received.</p>
<p>Once the part number is slected the form should auto populate:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d3264bc-b033-48c2-93f7-e75c52440780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d3264bc-b033-48c2-93f7-e75c52440780" /></a></p>

</p><p>As you can see non of my subforms are auto populating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Form should populate has follows:</p>

            Having inserted a row into tblPartNumbers, to start the inspection process you will need to insert rows into the tables which model the three binary relationship types.&nbsp; This can either be done manually in the three subforms, or if each row in tblPartNumbers
 is to be related to each row in the three referenced tables, TableDocQAClauses, TableInspReq and TablePOQAClauses via the tables which model the relationship types, you can automate it by executing three separate INSERT INTO statements in the AfterUpdate event
 procedure of the PartNumberID combo box control in the parent form. <br />
<br />
Each INSERT INTO statement&nbsp; should insert values into the two foreign key columns which make up the candidate key of the table, so that to insert rows into the table which model the ret with TableDocQAClauses for instance would be:<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO jtblPNDocClauses(PartNumberID, DocQAClauseID) <br />
SELECT Forms!YourParentFormName!YourPartNumberIDControl, DocQAClauseID<br />
FROM TableDocQAClauses;<br />
<br />
Substitute the actual form and control names of course.<br />
<br />
You can either create this as an <em>'append'</em> query and execute the query by name, or you can build the SQL statement as a string expression in code and execute the statement by calling the Execute method of the CurrentDb object.&nbsp; If you do the latter
 you should concatenate the value of the Forms!YourParentFormName!YourPartNumberIDControl into the string expression, rather than referencing the control.<br />
<br />
In the code do the same for each of the three tables, and call the Requery method of each subform control to reload each subform's recordset and show the inserted rows.<br />

</p><p>The combo box in the subform should be bound to the InspReqID column in jtblPNInspReq, and should have as its RowSource a query&nbsp; which returns the InspReqID column from TableInspReq along with whatever column you want to show in the combo box, and any other

            I think you might have columns in TableInspReq which model attributes of the relationship type and therefore should be in jtblPNInspReq.<br />
<br />
We are assuming the relationship type between parts and inspection requirements is many-to-many of course.&nbsp; Is this the case?&nbsp; I'm not in a position to say what real world attributes in the columns in TableInspReq represent, only you can say, but it's possible
 that TableInspReq might itself represent a many-to-many relationship type between part numbers and one or more other entity types which should be modelled by further tables, each referenced by a foreign key in TableInspReq.&nbsp; You'd need to describe in detail
 what attributes each column in TableInspReq is intended to represent before I am in a position to advise further.<br />
<br />
Posting screenshots doesn't really help us a lot.&nbsp; What we need from you is a clear and unambiguous written description of the reality being modelled in relation to parts and inspections.<br />

<h2>            Adding Images automatically into an excel sheet using excel 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, I have an excel sheet with over 400 rows, each month I have to manually insert images against the product number.&nbsp; Is there a way to&nbsp;create a button to automatically insert the images if i label all the images against the product number?&nbsp; I can store
 the images in a folder which would never change.</p>
<p>This would be amazing if this is possible,</p>

<p>I do not see why that would not be possible. Record a mocro embedding an image and see what you get. We can help you with doing the directory search for the images. One thing to note is that you will want to be able to flag which products have images attached.
 Probably just store the product number on the worksheet under the embedded image or in a hidden column.</p>

<p>hi guys, thanks for that..&nbsp; Jim - I have set up a folder on a shared drive called images.&nbsp; Within that folder I have labelled all my images to the poduct ID number in my excel sheet.&nbsp; I want to create a button to automatically insert images in the same row
 for example:</p>
<p>Row 1: product ID number 23454 with the image of that ID</p>
<p>Row 2: Product ID Number 23234 with the image of that ID and so on.</p>
<p>Frank - this code works just how you said it would, I just need to adapt it and hopefully get it to work exactly the way I want too.</p>
<p>Guys - thanks very much for your help!!</p>
<p>Neil.</p>

<p>Assuming that everything is in one directory then you really do not need to do a search. You should however try to confrim that the file exists before adding it. Code like this will do it</p>
<p>Sub test()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox FileExists("C:=Whatever.jpg")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Public Function FileExists(ByVal strFileName As String) As Boolean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FileExists = CBool(Len(Dir(strFileName)))<br />
End Function</p>
<p>You will need to know if the product already has a picture associated with it. To that end based on your description I might be inclined to just name the picture using the product ID then you just need to search for a shape with that name. If no name exists
 then add the picture. Did you want help with that?</p>

<p><span>Hi webbrewers3,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest you try improving the SharePoint Online performance by the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.Use different browsers and the F12 tool bar to check the change of</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">SPRequestDuration.</span></p>
<p><span>2.Switch the network environment.</span></p>
<p><span>3.Create a new site collection in SharePoint based on the team site template.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Add more Server Resource Quota to a SharePoint site collection referring to this</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-SharePoint-Online-server-resource-quotas-for-sandboxed-solutions-90e4eaaa-899a-48d6-b850-f272366bf8cc?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>link</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>5.

            This is not related to the network, browser or anything in the sites. Nothing has changed on my end so it's definitely a SPO problem. If you don't know what it might be, I'll go ahead and submit a ticket.

<h2>            W10M is still cutting games off screen</h2>
                    <p>I am running the latest insider build on my Lumia 535 and when i try playing games the part where the home button is pops up and when i swipe up tp put it back i goes away but leaves something black behind it that wont go down with it and it is reall hard
 to play a racing game when the pedal is on that side and you cant press it, i have made a post about it when i i started with build 105 but i see it is still there and is really frustrating me, is there a way to fix it manually or must i wait for microsoft
 to fix it?</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Not possible to collapse group in search result - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Not possible to collapse group in search result</h2>
                    
<p>in outlook 2016 when performing a search there is no ability to collapse group results unless you use the search sorted by date. with by date you have ability to collapse all groups. but for instance if you choose "by from" all the group headers disappear
 and this means you cannot right click and collapse the group. likewise using the menu view +- expand/collapse does not work as there are no headers. revert back to date and the headers appear again and it all works. the only other groups that works is flag:
 start due or flag due date. none of the other order by options provide headers.</p>
<p>as you see sort by date has headers but when you go sort by from the headers disappear.</p>
<p>this all worked on office 2013</p>
<p>thanks for your help.</p>

<p>i have found the issue to be resolved when the “include older results” option is selected after the initial search result is returned. though i would still think this step shouldn't be necessary in order to group results.</p>

<p>I just tried to reply but system would not take it. Anyway repeat is that I moved to the community forum and still waiting for solution although I did find more interesting behaviour. See Outlook 2016 Not possible to collapse group in search result</p>
<p>Thus this post is closed and move to the community for a fix!</p>

<h2>            N95 Default Map at startup&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
I'm new to the forums and this is my 1st post here :):)<br />
<br />
I live in Bahrain and when I start the Maps program the globe goes to bahrain automatically and loads the map.<br />
<br />
I Have downloaded some maps successfully to my N95 using Nokia Map loader.<br />
<br />
How do I set one of the new maps that I downloaded to be loaded automatically whenever I start the maps program??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Best Regards.

            No you have the wrong end of the stick<br />
It doesnt work like that<br />
It loads all the maps at once like a Globe map of the world<br />
Then you can zoom in or out with the bottom 2 corner keys * and #<br />
<br />
You need to take your N95 outside with a good view of the sky slide open press maps and Wait --WAIT--WAIT--WAIT -be patient--Wait<br />
eventually It will get a satelite lock you can do options and view sattelite to see when it gets a lock<br />
When it gets a lock the globe will SPIN to where you are and zoom in once it has a sat lock it will not take as long next time unless you drasticaly change location<br />
<br />
next time you select maps it will then come up with the last place you got a satelite lock be it home work or else where untill it gets a lock then it will zoom in again<br />
its not like a tomtom where you chose maps If there isnt a map loaded of where you are it will just spin the globe to the vacant position and zoom in it will be correct just no detail

            To see some where else you have to ZOOM out up down left right to get where you want then zoom back in<br />
The idea behind it is a GPS sytem so it always trys to find your current postion<br />
Even if you delete the map of where you live barhain it will still zoom in to that GPS postion Just there will be no detail there as there would be no map

</p><p>There is an OK button and a Restart Office365ServiceV2 link, but the mouse and keyboard are no longer active. &nbsp;It looks like the error reporter has received a shutdown notification but not acted on it because it is waiting for the dialog box to return. &nbsp;And
 the dialog box cannot return because I cannot click any of its buttons. &nbsp;There is a spinning rotor indicating that something is waiting. &nbsp;Shutdown, I presume, waiting for the Error Reporting app to exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been on the screen for 15 minutes now, so it is not timing out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The inconvenience of a failed shutdown is way worse than the inconvenience of a failed Office365ServiceV2 connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from doing a forced shutdown, is there a known work-around for this? &nbsp;Such as to autostart the service if it fails, or not even run it at all?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

            <p>Do you get the error while working with office apps or it just pops up on the screen. Office365ServiceV2 auto starts when you reopen any office application. Shutting down the progress may stop office apps to work. To start off start the system in

            <p>Arched,</p>
<p>I had been working with Office. &nbsp;There were no open documents, but the Word app might still have been running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Permissions had been repaired recently (within the last week) by SuperDuper, so I doubt that is the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise that doing an forced shutdown can risk document loss. &nbsp;I waited 20 minutes for something to time out, but it did not. &nbsp;So the forced shutdown was the only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that the dialog box did not appear until the shutdown was under way. &nbsp;I don't think I had a chance to intercept it.</p>

            <p>I've come across that error message (last night, in fact). &nbsp;In my case there was a Cancel button and that allowed my system to shut down. Last night was the first time I encountered the dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you've discovered by now, if you turn your Mac off while a document is open, Word will recover that document when you restart your Mac and open Word. That's pretty reliable, but not fool proof.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no permissions to repair in El Capitan. Mac OS repairs permissions constantly, on the fly in El Capitan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep my eyes open for other reports of that dialog box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you happen to come upon steps to reproduce the dialog at shut down, please report it to Microsoft using the Smile button in Word, and also reply here. Otherwise, let's chalk it up to a freak occurrence.</p>

    <title>Word 2010. Document opens in two columns. I want it in the standard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e.rossi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010. Document opens in two columns. I want it in the standard one page regular format</h2>
                    <p>I am not advanced. I just open a blank doc and type. It is always the same and have a regular one page document where I insert my page number and at the most do basic footers and headers. I don't know how to do much else as it seems to complicated.</p>
<p>Anyway, I use it to write short story. Now I started to write a booklet (very important for me as it is my first attempt at a possible publication) and suddenly I have two columns in one page. Only in web view I am able to look and type so that I can actually
 see it as one page (I have vision problems too). However nothing I tried and nothing I read by going on microsoft.com has helped. I do not understand difficult language and I would hate to rewrite the whole thing.</p>
<p>I also tried to add for the first time ever a blank cover page as well as to try and find a nice cover page, but did not have access to any cover pages and the blank cover page did not work. that is not so important now, but PLEASE help me to reset the whole
 thing so I can work with 1 page document and later perhaps learn how to make it into a booklet if I so choose. HELP</p>
<p>Even when I click on one page, I get a view of one long column going down the entire length of the document with the other half page being blank.</p>
<p>I know that in the past I kept getting prompts to upgrade for free to windows 10 and though I kept downloading it never ever worked, so now I have a mix of everything, with some updates that don't belong to my system, windows 7 Home Premium and the annoying
 ones that partially are for windows 10, but it never affected me before.</p>
<p>Thank you kindly.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Install and comments</h2>
                    <p>A suggestion.</p>
<p>Under Windows 10.&nbsp; The control panel is under the APPS menu</p>
<p>Would be nice if it was moved direct on to the start menu from under apps sub menu</p>
<p>Also installation (None Upgrade), took 2 x attempts.</p>
<p>First attempt hung before system completed setup.</p>
<p>Blanked the Hard disk. Ran install again and ran partition (new option), of 3tb disk and this time formatted partitions</p>
<p>Install worked this time</p>
<p>Looking Very nice and stable. Now to test various items like Steam, Serif software, and backup software from Acronis etc</p>
