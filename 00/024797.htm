<h2>            Calender difficulties</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got a Microsoft Lumia 640 as a work phone (NHS).&nbsp; I have synced the e-mail and calendar to my work outlook.&nbsp; E-mail is working perfectly, but calendar only half working.&nbsp; If I put something in the calendar on my phone it copies over to the calendar
 on my laptop, but if I add something on my laptop it is not coming up on my phone calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joe</p>

            <p>So I need to get a better understanding of what you are using and the setup Joe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my first question is what is the OS on your laptop and are you using Outlook on it? Are you using the same Live account on your laptop that you use on your device? In other words, is your Live account the<strong> primary
</strong>account on both?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many accounts are on your PC calendar? I have two on mine (a Hotmail account and an outlook account). When you create an event on your PC, are you picking the live account on your device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screenshot from my PC of Outlook. You can see I can pick the account I want it to appear in.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am assuming that the OS on the laptop&nbsp;is either 7, 8 or 10. With any of those it should be working. Which OS is it btw?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>...and yes I am using outlook on it. And yes I am using outlook as primary email and calendar on both laptop and computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Well I was sort of hoping that you would say that you were not using the same Live ID as the primary but since you are then you are doing exactly what I am doing with my devices, a Samsung Series 7 Slate, a Surface Pro 4 and two desktop PCs. Of course the
 difference being that if I create an appointment on one PC it appears on the others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so the first thing I would check is to create an appointment on the laptop in Outlook. After it syncs close outlook and open IE. Go to Outlook.com, open the calendar and see it if it is showing in the web version of Outlook. Is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming that you will say no, it is not appearing. If that is the case, then open IE, go to Outlook.com, open the calendar and create a 2nd test appointment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now sync your outlook on your phone AND on your laptop. Does it now appear on both? or just your Phone?</p>

    <title>Slow 5300 with original nokia mem card. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidbb---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow 5300 with original nokia mem card.</h2>
                    I've read a few posts where people are having trouble with the 5300 taking a while to load tracklists. It seems it is the phone not the memory card to me.<br />
<br />
Using the 256mb card that came with the phone and only 2 albums it takes 25 seconds to switch between tracklists, if i have 4 or more albums it takes 40+ seconds, SO it is definetly a software problem within the phone, my question is will this be fixed with
 a software update soon, If not then I may well be returning my phone and exchanging it for a walkman phone as it seems the 5300 is unfit for the purpose of playing music.<br />
<br />
Come on nokia sort this out asap, as it is unnacceptable, and will lose you loyal customers.

            hi david,<br />
<br />
I started the thread that was linked above by '6280', but your experience is even more dreadful, amazing :(<br />
<br />
I tested the other day with my original Nokia 256mb that is about 220mb music (must be around 100 songs, I think). Playing a tracklist (or set of songs) via the library, results in a delay of around 10 seconds for me.<br />
<br />
I wonder if anything else can be impacting the delay that occurs. Because it's so weird after all that Nokia would release a phone with such an obvious flaw... Maybe their test scenarios were just model cases, and we are doing something different.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me more about the music on your card.<br />
<br />
- What format is the music?<br />
- How did the music get on the card (did you transfer with "NOkia Music Manager" from PC Suite, or did you transfer in data mode using Windows Explorer drag 'n drop, or any other method?)<br />
- How are the files organised: many subfolders, one large folder for all files, ... ?<br />
- What else is on the card?<br />
<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
My answers<br />
- music is eAAC+ (created with Nokia Music Manager) and some WMA<br />
- files were put on the card with Windows Explorer and some with Sync Toy from Microsoft (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/prophoto/synctoy.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/prophoto/synctoy.mspx</a>)<br />
- all song files are in subfolders : artist/album/song<br />
- other content: not much, a few photos taken.

            I have now tried a number of things, eaac files, mp3, wma. Copy files directly as well as trying nokia music manager, all seem to give the same poor performance. I've restored my phone to factory settings, thinking that there is a cacheing issue but that
 did not help. I will be on the phone to t-mobile tomorrow for a replacement and if i am not satisfied with that then I will be exchanging it for a sony w850i. I bought a 2gb card also, just a generic one, and the access speeds are about the same when i copy
 the files from my official nokia one, so it is definetly not a memory card issue.

<p>This dissapointing change by MS affects all versions of Publisher in regards to being able to find clip art on-line. With Publisher 2000 I still have a local store of clipart installed that I can search and use. I don't remember if you have this option with
 Pub 2002 or not and I don't have Pub 2002 installed any more. It appears to be gone by Publisher 2003. You might try doing a 'repair' or 'change' to the installation of Pub 2002, drill down in the options of what to install and see if there is the option to
 install a collection of clip art locally like there is with Pub 2000. </p>

<p>hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had a nokia 2760 phone for a few months and recently it has begun to only work when on loudspeaker. If I ring someone and don't press the button for loudspeaker, the person on the other end can hear me but I hear nothing. This also happens when someone
 rings me. They can hear me but I can't hear them...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a solution to this problem?&nbsp;</p>

            Your phone has a faulty earpiece. Take it to your nearest Nokia Care Point for repairs. If you've only had the phone for a few months then it should be covered by the warranty unless the damage was caused by water ingress or some other kind of user-caused
 damage.

<h2>            Apps don&#39;t work after upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I've been having a problem with my last few preview builds where when I upgrade, everything works fine for a little, then one by one some apps stop working. Both my computers do this. The apps that stop working are&nbsp; Mail &amp; Calendar, People, Xbox, Music,
 Movies &amp; Tv, and Store. No always all of them but usually most. Over time with updates they will sometimes start working again but usually i'll just end up doing a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I updated to 10240 from 10166 and it did it again but now i can't do a clean install. Also, this time Store is broken so i can't try to repair the apps.

<h2>            Outlook Folders Missing After Latest Update &#40;December 2017&#41;</h2>
                    I just updated to the latest version of Outlook (15.41) and my folders vanished from the left pane. I've been googling around trying to find a solution but every one alludes to former versions out Outlook and mine doesn't have the same functionalities.
 Can anyone please assist? Thanks.

<h2>            No Longer a Word Icon, just DOCX shows</h2>
                    Hello all.<br />
All my Word files no longer have the familiar looking "W" icon showing.&nbsp; All of them now just have a blank looking piece of paper icon which states "DOCX" (all caps).&nbsp; How do I get my Word files back to the familiar "W"icon?&nbsp; They're all saved as a docx file
 type, instead of a Word Document type.&nbsp; When I resave as a Word Document, it still has no "W" icon.<br />
Thanks<br />

            Try re-registering Word as follows (which will "reclaim" the file assocations): Exit the application. Hold the Windows logo key as you press R; in the Run dialog box, type winword /r and press Enter (note the space before the slash). See if icons display
 correctly and you can double-click them to open the documents. If it still fails, take a look at

    <title>PC Suite and Latest Widcomm Software - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PC Suite and Latest Widcomm Software</h2>
                    I have a nice new Dell Inspiron Mini 9 with the lastest Widcomm Bluetooth software on it. When I try and run the PC Suite Bluetooth paring, the widcomm stuff leaps in trying to make the paring easy, which it does, but then PC Suite gets upset and says
 it cant pair, even though the phone has paired. PC Suite wants to see the response to its pairing code, but widcomm gets there first. Is there any way I can tell PC Suite that the phone is paired, and to just get on with it?<br />

            I guess I could have a similar problem.<br />
I have widcomm drivers 5.5.0.3500 and PC Suite 7.0.8.2 on Win Xp SP2.<br />
Phone is correctly paired, I can see that in "My BT places", but PC suite does not see it. When I try "Make new connection", PC suite finds the phone (E51) and recognises it is paired, but claims "Phone needs to be authorised".<br />
When I click "Next", it hangs for a while and then answers "Cannot authenticate the phone".<br />
<br />
Everything works fine on another PC with same OS and PC Suite version, but different BlueTooth software. I'm wondering if there can be some compatibility problem with Widcomm drivers 5.5.0.3500...<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!<br />

            I believe the below to have more to do with the latest incarnation of PC Suite.<br />
<br />
I too recently upgraded to PC Suite 7.0.8.2 on Win Xp SP2. However, my laptop is an older Dell running WIDCOMM drivers version 3.0.1.804.<br />
<br />
What I have noticed is that the phone (6120 for me) MUST have Bluetooth visibility switched on "Shown to All" in order for the new version of PC Suite to see it. EVEN after it has been paired with both laptop and PC Suite. Otherwise it produces the same issues
 you mention below.<br />
<br />
In the previous version, once the phone had been paired I could switch off bluetooth discoverability and it would just continue to work.<br />
<br />
I haven't checked yet whether or not it has to do with whether the laptop has gone into hibernation in the meantime or not.<br />
<br />
How do we complain to Nokia about this.<br />

            I experienced recently the same problem on my labtop with a Belkin bluetooth key.<br />
Finally, I found the solution on the web at this forum <a href="http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?id=38533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?id=38533</a><br />
<br />
There is a conflict between the widcomm tools coming with the widcomm driver and PC Suite.<br />
The solution is to use the Microsoft Driver instead of the Widcomm driver.<br />
<br />
To do so, you need add a line into the C:\Windows\inf\bth.inf.<br />
First, call Device Manager" (execute Devmgmt.msc).<br />
Edit properties of your bluetooth key.<br />
Find the manufacturer and find the identifier like USB\Vid_xxxx&amp;Pid_xxxx<br />
<br />
Then, edit with notepad C:\Windows\inf\bth.inf<br />
<br />
In the bluetooth section of your manufacturer, add this line :<br />
[MyManufacturer.5.1]<br />
MyBlueTooth Key= BthUsb,USB\Vid_xxxx&amp;Pid_xxxx<br />
<br />
Save your file with same name.<br />
<br />
Remove your bluetooth key.<br />
Uninstall Widcomm driver.<br />
<br />
Then, plug your key.<br />
Go to your device manager and ask to change the driver.<br />
Choose the option to select manually your driver.<br />
Choose the one you declare into bth.inf.<br />
<br />
It will be ok.

            Nay, it won't. The MS driver doesn't seem to work with the new Dell 370 mini-card. At least it complains after a few seconds and - oops - the old Broadcom driver is back on again. **bleep**.

            If you double-click the installer and click through its screens you will eventually come to a screen with a

            The problem might be that you select a) more then one cell or b) not all cells that should be sorted.
<br />
<br />If you select one cell Excel detects all contiguous cells automatically.
<br />
<br />Does that solve the issue?

</p><p>Same problem. When I click on Outlook's 'view' menu, the only option is 'full screen'. There is no 'view sidebar' option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, to get to preferences the only option is to click on 'outlook' and then on Services/Service preferences. That shows the preferences for Mac and not for Outlook, so it doesn't help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, there is no 'folder pane' next to the 'reading pane', so that also doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's time that Microsoft fixed this problem.</p>

<p>Thanks Carlos</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did eventually solve the problem. There being no sidebar option under the view menu, I went instead to 'Tools' in the ribbon and clicked on Accounts/Show all/General. The box for 'show all accounts' was already ticked. I ticked and un-ticked it three or
 four times, and also tried changing the 'Office theme' to colourful, with no effect, but at some point the missing full menus did appear at the top of the screen, giving me the required 'View' options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that on the fifth attempt to change the status of the 'show all accounts' box, I closed and restarted Outlook, something not mentioned in any of the guides to how to fix the problem. The 'show all accounts' pane does not have an 'apply' button,
 so it's hard to know if ticking the box makes any difference.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>No, you cannot apply animation to just a word or a group of words within a text box. You will need to move the text into it's own textbox and then position it to make it appear as a part of the other text box so that you can apply animation to that text.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't know if they will use a Canary build on Mobile. They probably hope that users switch entirely to Edge browser, so they might want to keep that experience more stable.</p>

    <title>6680 restore backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gigatexel  say:</h3>
<h2>            6680 restore backup</h2>
                    my 6680 started to act funny<br />
i decided to take a full backup with the nokia content copier, which resulted in a backup file on my pc<br />
<br />
i restored the factory settings and rebooted the phone<br />
<br />
now, when i choose to restore the backup, the transfer completes, the phone reboots (i get a warning that the phone is disconnected)<br />
the content copier just stays active (i can only click cancel, i dont know if that is normal)<br />
<br />
when i browse the phone, NOTHING is restored!<br />
i tried rebooting the phone several times and installed the latest pc suite<br />
<br />
the nokia site suggests to minimize the scope of the backup (eg. only choose contacts) but i cannot deselect the other options like text messages, calendar etc<br />
<br />
could someone help? i've lost 100+ contacts now :(

            you cant select what you want to restore from a backup file, only a contents file. did you ever sync or use the sim card to store contacts?

    <title>outlook 2010 calendar and contact file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deb cook  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook 2010 calendar and contact file</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create appointment reminders for clients. I need their appointment that's in the calendar and print that with their addresses in the outlook contacts. I have been exporting the files and linking them by name (that's the only link I can find)
 to create the reminder postcards. So I wrote a Dbase program many years ago to do this.&nbsp; It's a pain and was trying to find an easier way.
</p>
<p>Any Suggestions? Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>If you are using Outlook 2010 and wanted to create an appointment you can follow these steps:</p>
<p>
For appointments or meetings
</p><p>In an open item, on the <strong>Appointment</strong> or <strong>Meeting</strong> tab, in the
<strong>Options</strong> group, in the <strong>Reminder</strong> drop-down list, select the amount of time before the appointment or meeting when you want the reminder to appear. To turn a reminder off, select
<strong>None</strong>.</p>
For e-mail messages, contacts, and tasks
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Home</strong> tab, in the <strong>Tags</strong> group, click <strong>
Follow Up</strong>, and then click <strong>Add Reminder</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f2ff73fac-495c-41db-b44e-7efdff5bfe5f.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp; You can quickly flag e-mail messages as to-do items by using reminders. Right-click the Flag Status column in the message list. Or if you have the message open, on the
<strong>Message</strong> tab, in the <strong>Tracking</strong> group, click <strong>
Follow Up</strong>, and then click <strong>Add Reminder</strong>.</p>
</li></ul>

<br />I have read a bunch of instructions on how to do this, in older versions. Screens have changed in 2016 and I cannot follow those instructions.
<br />1. I cannot create a new account (Imap default) with the same email address
<br />2. Does Remove make my old account inactive or does it remove it entirely? Does it matter assuming I've saved the .pst?
<br />3. Change with manual setup does not show the old detailed screens.
<br />4. Are there any new instructions for 2016 version?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Re: #1 - You can't configure the same email account using a different protocol in Outlook '2016 
<br />
<br />Re: #2 - Removing the email account from Outlook does just - it removes it from Outlook. However, if you're asking if it otherwise impacts the actual email account being accessible etc - answer is: No. Also, removing a POP account from the Outlook profile doesn't remove the associated PST file from the profile - that remains unless/until you explicitly you remove it which you don't want to do for reasons mentioned later
<br />
<br />Re: #3 - To change email account settings - do the following
<br />a) Press CTRL+Alt+S to get the &lt;Send/Receive&gt; window
<br />b) Assuming you only have one S/R group - click on &lt;Edit&gt;
<br />c) Select the email account you want to change --&gt; click on &lt;Account Properties&gt;
<br />(*** not something you're going to need for the purposes of this exercise)
<br />
<br />Re: #4 - Can't speak about anyone else having already created new articles but something that's on my to-do list 
<br />
<br />Now for what you need to do
<br />
<br />#1 - With Outlook closed, open the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app --&gt; click on &lt;Show Profiles&gt; --&gt; click on &lt;Copy&gt; --&gt; Give it a name. ***this is done purely as a precaution so that you have a copy of the original profile
<br />#2 -  Select the original profile --&gt; click on &lt;Properties&gt; --&gt; &lt;Email Accounts&gt;
<br />#3 - Remove the POP account
<br />#4 - Add the account by entering your email address/password which defaults to configuring the account using IMAP
<br />#5 - Switch to the Data Files tab. You'll see that the PST file is set as the default data file for the profile which is where your default contact/calendar folders are stored. You want to maintain this instead of set the IMAP OST file as the default data file to prevent potential loss of data in folders (contact/calendar etc) that will have the added words "This Computer Only" in the folder description.
<br />
<br />If Outlook cannot find the OST file for the account for any reason, it will recreate the OST file and re-sync the email data with the server. The "This Computer Only" folders will be empty and therefore that data will be lost. Also, if you ever remove the IMAP account, the ost file also gets automatically deleted. An OST file can only be opened/used by the original Outlook profile/email account used to create it.

            I too have the same issue. In fact i even went ahead and did a hard reset, it started working but then from past few days this issue came back. Come on MS you can not keep on asking people to provide their email address and do nothing about this issue.
 And most importantly hard rest is not the solution and please do not suggest this to anyone as I had to re-install everything, i know one would say i could have taken a back up but then people who went through the process of restoring from back know the exact
 experience. I feel MS is expecting windows users to be a very patient for long time where as other ecosystem have moved further ahead, some time i really feel, did i made a mistake moving from Apple to WP :(<br />
