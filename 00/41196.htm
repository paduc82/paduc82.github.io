<h2>            My new GamerProfile isnt showing up on this homepage &#40;only old one&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I ve had three Gamerprofiles up to now, since I joined the Xbox-Live community. The first one was created on my old console and I havent recovered it.</p>
<p>The other ones (Jascha Peace and S4y Gn8) are on my new 360 Console. They were all created with the same email-adress, but they are not linked on this homepage! (I m still using the same emailadress for both profiles)</p>
<p>So what can i do to set the "Jascha Peace" as the Main-Profile! I wont use the others in future.</p>
<p>I only want to use the "Jascha Peace" Profile! (only Jascha Peace has Xbox Live GOLD-membership)</p>

<p>[The problem is, when I m using Xbox Smartglass(app) for Iphone, only the old Profile is shown, like on this homepage!</p>
<p>I also have troubles with the verification-process: (it shows up again and again on my console) I ve already tiped my phone number and two diferent emailadresses in. but the verification message is still showing up.]</p>

    <title>Windows 10 November Update Continual Reboot loop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 November Update Continual Reboot loop</h2>
                    While Windows 10 November update was in progress, I accidentally turned off my computer. I thought it was done. The screen was blue and it said that all my files will be exactly the same. However, it was not responding at all. After I turned the computer
 off and on, it keeps rebooting in a loop. It will allow me to get to the password screen, but then will reboot when it gets to the Windows screen. An error message appears and says it will have to reboot. I can't even do anything in Windows before the error
 message appears and it reboots again.

<h2>            WordPad Settings</h2>
                    I use WordPad extensively and somewhere along the line WordPad changed drastically. I used to be able open a new WordPad, set the adjustments like spacing and font and&nbsp;Word wrap etc &nbsp;and then name the&nbsp; new WordPad file and then close the new WordPad file.
 When I opened said WordPad file all my settings were exactly as I left them. And when I opened a&nbsp;second WordPad file and&nbsp;used different settings and then closed it and then opened it again all the&nbsp;settings were exactly as I&nbsp;left them. So in other words, I
 had two WordPad files&nbsp;both with entirely different settings that stayed that way. But now&nbsp;things are wrong. When I create a&nbsp;new WordPad file and then create a second WordPad file the settings that I&nbsp;made in the second WordPad file will&nbsp;change the settings
 of the first&nbsp;WordPad file. When I change the settings in any WordPad file all of my WordPad files will adapt the changes. It never used to be that way before. Before I

            <p>Mmmm. Thank you for responding. Let me explain again just to be certain that you understand what I am saying. I create a WordPad file with the .rtf extension. I select "no word wrap". I use the "print screen" key on my keyboard to make a screen capture and
 I place the screen capture on the WordPad field, save it with a file name and close the WordPad file. I open another WordPad .rtf file and I select "wrap to ruler" and I write a letter, close it and save it with a file name. When I go back to the first WordPad
 file I created and open it I find the screen capture I copied and placed on the WordPad field distorted because the "no wrap" has been changed to "wrap to ruler". It never used to be this way. I'm wondering why it is now. When I change the "word wrap" on one
 WordPad file it changes the "word wrap" on all the WordPad files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It stopped working a long time ago maybe, and I stress maybe, around the time of Windows XP.</p>

<p>I just got done saving my files from a harddrive that suddenly would not boot so I'm not clicking on any link ever again. SHAWN!!! What I need from you are two answers: 1.) WHY is my WordPad file changing all the other WordPad files? 2.) How can I stop it
 from happening?</p>

    <title>Surface Book touchpad tapping problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> artiroller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book touchpad tapping problem</h2>
                    Hi, this issue has been discussed in other threads already. Is there a solution for the tapping problem now? I still have the problem when delay is enabled (now known as sensitivity: settings--&gt;touchpad-&gt;sensitivity) that the right part of the touchpad
 becomes unresponsive every now and then. When sensitivity is set to medium for example, the touchpad becomes unresponsive on the right area. It is not possible to use tap-to-click then in that area reliably. It's working fine on the left area of the pad. It
 also works fine when you switch to higher sensitivity.

<p>Hi, this issue persists since I took my SB out of the box. Since then, several major updates have been published by MS. I am always up to date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what kind of troubleshooting steps you are referring to. The only way I discovered to solve the issue is to set "delay" to off (now it's sensitivity settings under "touchpad").</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the provided MS updates solved the issue so far. </p>

            Thx for your support. Aside from the unresponsive trackpad and the highly unreliable bluetooth adapter, I have several system crashes a week now. I am starting to get disappointed, so I guess it's time to send my device back. I am not sure whether I can
 visit the local MS store in Berlin as I've bought it but from another internet retailer. Do you know whether I can still visit the local MS store with my receipt from the other retailer?<br />

<h2>            Sound &#43; video in slow motion after update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My sound and video keeps stuffing up, and plays in slow motion. It doesn't happen when I turn my PC on, it takes a while to actually happen. Itunes doesn't work properly. Facebook and YouTube videos don't work properly. Constantly restarting is a temporary
 fix, but that's a pain. Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer/scanner&nbsp;and <br />
their&nbsp;supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and&nbsp;<br />
drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

</p><p>I have a couple of issues with my laptop but the way it hangs and stalls is getting really bad. It also takes about 5 minutes to shut down also. I am no expert but maybe it the corrupt files that is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you take the precaution of creating a system restore point before running ADWCleaner, to guard against unforeseen consequences. Select Start, Control Panel,
 System, System Protection, and click the <strong>Create</strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To identify what loads when you boot use Autoruns (freeware from Microsoft).<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you uncheck you can recheck to re-enable
 the item. It is a <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 204, 1)">much safer approach than editing the Registry and better than using msconfig.</span>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have used the microphone level meter on Skype many times. The last time I used it was after after a recent windows update, where that update changed my microphone selection setting, causing me not to be heard by the person I was trying to Skype with.
 The meter &nbsp;made for some quick troubleshooting. I also have used it to adjust my microphone level.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tried the new "Skype For Windows 10" and I cannot find that meter. I went back to the regular version. Anyone know if they have that meter buried in there somewhere? I am not interested in "Skype for Windows 10" for lack of that feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span><span>Skype for Windows 10 (Preview) does not have the audio and video settings. There are other features and options of Skype for Desktop that still not available
 on the new Skype app on Windows. It adapts the audio and video settings of the device on Skype for Windows 10.

<h2>            The &#34;Hey Contana&#34; feature doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>This is the last of a series of replies I sent to one of the Microsoft discussions groups but never got a reply. Anyone having this same problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>"</p>
<p>Hi Janet&nbsp;&nbsp; I went through the learn my voice feature when I first turned on Cortana and went through it 2 more times after your reply. Still does not work when I say Hey Cortana. Again, when I click on the microphone button, and talk from about 2 feet from
 my computer, Cortana understands everything I say and talks back to me (some pretty good jokes when I ask her) and also will open up email and send a message. She definitely does not have a speech recognition issue. Also the microphone has plenty of sensitivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also right click on speaker symbol on lower right of task bar and press on recording device to show microphone. The level is bouncing around to the top of the scale when I talk.&nbsp; I don't think the problem of waking up Cortana is related to either voice
 training or microphone levels.&nbsp; Lets keep trying to solve this issue because others are going to have this same issue. Do you need and details on my Acer timeline computer model 5830T-6862?&nbsp; Is there possible a privacy setting that keeps my microphone off?
 I have used Skype in the past without problems but have not tried it with Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Dave</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Have you tried another mic?<br />
<br />
Could be your sound drivers - check with Acer Support, their on-line <br />
documentation and drivers. and ask in their forums about any known <br />
issues. Update the <strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>chipset drivers</strong>, and <strong>
major drivers </strong>(especially <br />
sound) there and then check the individual device maker (such as <br />
Realtek, IDT, Intel, and others) for even newer sound drivers.<br />
<br />
Sound drivers are extremely complex.<br />

<h2>            How to configure ICS in Windows XP&#47;7 using command-line&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I spent half of hour but didn't find right command sintax.</p>
<p>The problem is how to configure certain network interface to enable Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)' for another interface of the host.</p>
<p>Please don't advise me NAT-based solution such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(58, 77, 91, 1)">netsh routing ip nat install&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(58, 77, 91, 1)">netsh routing ip nat add interface "Local area network" Full</span></p>
<p>I can easily start/stop ICS service from command-line but
 how to configure it?</p>

<h2>            How do I delete my Microsoft account.</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please help me? I don't want it. When I brought my laptop it asked me for all my info. I freaked out when it wanted my password, and changed to using this stupid pin that it had asked me to setup. Now Microsoft knows all about me. My name, DOB,
 phone, email, location, like a serious invasion of my privacy. I'm like going in circles trying to find something as simple as,<em> 'delete account</em>
<em>- my name and all my contact details.'</em> Please click here. All I want to do is sign into Windows 10 using my original password
<em>(which I will have to change now because Microsoft knows it)</em> and remove my name/details showing up on the login screen when it starts on my brand-new laptop seeing just my computers name/enter password.</p>

            Hi Alfie, you can switch from a Microsoft Account for login to a local account
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password, then enter a new Password or leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />That's It!

<h2>            Hebrew vowel points Final Tsade Pey Office 365&#47;2016</h2>
                    Bought new laptop with Windows 10. With Windows 8 was able to install Hebrew vs. Hebrew Standard which allowed use of vowel points when in Caps shift...no such luck so far in Windows 10. Am taking Academic Hebrew while attending college and see need for
 use of vowel points and final Stade and Kaf which I do not have with Windows 10. Any solutions? Be nice to have language functionality with Windows 10 for academic success! Other than that am loving Windows 10!

            <p>Actually...this is what I was looking for as the answer so I put it here for others looking for similar answer. You have to change the input method from Hebrew standard to Hebrew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To set up Windows 10 to use Hebrew vowel points, the letter Tav, Final Tsad, and Final Pey</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you have installed Hebrew Language Pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Hebrew Options and select</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add an input method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hebrew Standard is grayed out because it is already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Hebrew and then click add.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then remove Hebrew Standard and press save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should be good to go.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 DPC Watchdog Violation Blue Screen After Streaming Video Games For A Few Hours</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enjoy streaming video games, and this only started last month where I've been getting DPC Watchdog Violation errors after streaming for a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the basic troubleshooting, updating all drivers, making sure Windows is updated, making sure there are no viruses or malware, running chk dsk. I have some more troubleshooting steps to try. I have a system file and Memory.DMP i can't open
 because it's too large. Currently not on my home computer that's affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a memory.dmp at&nbsp;&nbsp;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gUHnbSRaGxE1WNSQMmeDrbj6qtVe9ofq/view -- can someone please open it for me and look to see what the error or fatal is so I can isolate the problem and fix it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p><span>Hi Scrima Games,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To have a better clarity on the issue, respond to the questions listed below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile you may&nbsp; try the steps listed below and check if it works:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Update Chipset driver</strong>:</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right click on the Windows icon on the taskbar and open ‘Device Manager’.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

            Dell Alienware Area 51 R2. Installed programs and drivers have been updated since then. A rep here is suggesting helping me increase the virtual memory. Will give that a try. I also followed your SATA suggestion.

<p>That did not fix it. I have a ticket number if it helps:&nbsp;<span>1443946513</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can you guys please assist and help me get to the root of the problem? We've just been going through standard troubleshooting that has not been helping. Can you guys view the memory.dmp or can we try something else to fix it? I feel like the
 only way to get this resolved is a factory reset which I don't really want to do but i'm willing.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            RSAT-NLB windows feature not available in server 2016</h2>
                    <p>G'day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the Standard version (Core) of server 2016 I have no ability to install the RSAT-NLB cmdlets. I was able to in the technical and previous 2012 R2 environments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I install Network Load Balancing from the Standard&nbsp;version GUI server 2016 version all of the cmdlets are available.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a colleague test this and they get the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The command I previously ran successfully from my automated delivery was:</p>
<p>Install-WindowsFeature NLB,RSAT-NLB -IncludeManagementTools</p>
<p>
</p><p>In server 2016 (core)</p>
<p>Works: Install-WindowsFeature NLB -IncludeManagementTools</p>
<p>Doesn't Work: Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-NLB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this been disabled for any reason? Or is there a new way of delivering it which I don't know of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

                    <p>Can Someone Help Me Interpret My CBS Log? - We may need to share email addresses or Skype to do the transaction. Im trying to find out What the violations are &amp; fix them. So far, I haven't been doing very well. My PC is running Windows 10 64 bit OS</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) I tried running sfc /scannow - violations were found. I don't know how to fix them unless someone here is able to read &amp; interpret a CBS log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) I tried running - dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</p>
<p>I got this message: "The component store is repairable" - "The operation completed successfully"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) Now, I will enter this: dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I got this message: "The source file could not be found use the source option to specify the location of the files that are required to restore the feature"
</p>
<p>Ok folks, What do I do? How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Side Question:</strong> Can anyone (in layman's terms) tell me What DISM does to my PC when I run</p>
<p>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth - (or) When I run dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how many times I can run&nbsp;DISM or what circumstances require me to run it. Please folks, offer me some rules of thumb. Thanks</p>

            <p>Would you be so kind as to answer some additional questions for me? </p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) I still need to know exactly What DISM will do to my PC? What changes will it make to my PC? How will I know that it fixed my problems?</p>
<p>2.) How does DISM differ from sfc /scannow? </p>
<p>3.) Will DISM fix sfc violations &amp; give me a clean sfc scan? </p>
<p>4.) Does DISM fix anything? </p>
<p>5.) How often can DISM be ran on my PC? </p>
<p>6.) Can DISM be ran for maintenance even when nothing is wrong or should DISM only be deployed when sfc scannow is unsuccessful in fixing violations?</p>
<p>7.) Ok, I entered: <strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</strong></p>
<p>DISM completed scan at 100% - "The component store is repairable - The operation completed successfully"</p>
<p>8.) Now, I will enter this: <strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I got this message: "The source file could not be found use the source option to specify the location of the files that are required to restore the feature.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps the need to do all of this will be "N/A"&nbsp; &amp; will be fixed after I run the Automatic Repair&nbsp;from the Windows 10 installation disc??</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you agree &amp; approve that I do the following, (please let me know) -&nbsp;I will run sfc /scannow&nbsp;scan to determine If the Automatic Repair&nbsp;feature from the Windows 10 installation disc fixed my sfc scan violations. It should, right?</p>

            The automatic repair feature should only replace corrupt files in the OS. It doesn't over write you current install or effect your personal files.&nbsp;That being said, I strongly encourage you to back up your important files just in case.

<h2>            .aae corrupted pictures</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few years back I saved a number of edited pictures off my iPhone to a hard-drive before transferring these files to my PC. During the process all pictures (jpeg) were converted to aae files meaning I couldn't view the original pictures or the edited versions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for me to recover the original images as these are now showing as damaged or corrupted when I try and open on windows gallery?</p>

<p>Actually *.aae files are not the images.&nbsp; They are edits to images.&nbsp; See <a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/aae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://fileinfo.com/extension/aae</a>&nbsp; It's my understanding that *.aae files are just XML, so you should be able to open them using Notepad, but you won't be able to use the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should have files that have the same names as the *.aae files but with *.jpg extensions.&nbsp; If you don't, it seems as if you saved the wrong thing.</p>
