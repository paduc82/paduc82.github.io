<h2>            Windows Hello has been blocked due to too many sign in attempts. To unblock Hello sign in with your pin.&#39;</h2>
                    I set up Hello to recognize my face. I remember my pin. A child tried signing in too many times. I get this message but there is no way to actually enter anything. I have tried shutting it down and restarting. I have typed the pin on the keyboard. Swiping
 in every direction gives me nothing. Ctrl-Alt-Del does nothing. It accepts no entry at all. How do I get to a screen that I can enter the pin into?

            <p>I had this problem too, and managed to solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My situation was the same. The Surface Pro 4 was showing a plain text message in white text on a black&nbsp;screen. There were no icons and no input fields visible, just the error message. I swiped in all directions but there was no obvious method of interacting
 with the Surface at all. This is a program error that needs to be corrected by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have a keyboard with me; I was using the Surface just as a tablet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I pressed the power button and held it down until the screen went black; approximately 15 seconds. (After about five seconds, I first&nbsp;got a screen saying that I was going to lose data if I shut down the Surface. If I wanted to do so, I was supposed to swipe.
 It didn't say in what direction, and neither direction worked, so this screen was useless too, so I held down the power button again, this time for 15 seconds until the screen went black.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then pressed the Power button again, and this time&nbsp;I ended up at&nbsp;a new screen, with the same error message, but this time with an image background. This screen&nbsp;I could indeed swipe away, and&nbsp;I got&nbsp;to a new screen that had the text link to&nbsp;"Sign in options".
 I clicked on this link and then I got to the three icons where the right-most one that looked like a keypad took me to PIN sign in. My PIN worked and I am now signed in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note to Microsoft: Please try to recreate&nbsp;this problem and solve it. It&nbsp;is very annoying and it may affect new users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note to all: in your responses to questions about the Surface Pro, please don't assume it (ever) has a keyboard. It is a wonderful tablet and it should never, ever&nbsp;require a keyboard to do anything.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;chintu,<br />
<br />
While there is no 'Movie Trailer' option, if you select a movie, you can view the trailer in the 'Overview' section just to the right of the purchase options.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope that clears things up, but let us know if you have anymore questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No!! &nbsp;Are movie trailers gone from Xbox love for good?? It's obvious we are not asking what you answered. Movies that are up and coming into theaters!!! &nbsp;Where is the option to watch them?? &nbsp;Are they gone? Was this feature stupidly removed?? Yes or no.

<p>Bad decision. I assumed it was just being covered up to encourage us to buy halloween movies, but no an inside look of Thor 2 which I already saw is taking the spot now.</p>
<p>I loved watching trailers for upcoming movies in HD on my television rather than trying to find them online, it was a nice comprehensive list that let me know what to look out for. When there are so many other useless options on the Xbox Video tiles I feel
 like this should have stayed.</p>

<p>I hope you bring back the movie trailer section to Xbox Video. Some people only have their Xbox to watch movies and tv shows and having those trailers helped us keep up to date with the up and coming movies and such. I could literally sit for an hour watching
 all the new trailers!</p>

<p>I agree. It was a great feature and there is a ton of stuff I have no use for or simply do not understand. I used to check this out all the time to find new upcoming movies that I wanted to see. &nbsp;That is a shame.

<h2>            Repairing Windows Boot Files</h2>
                    <p>The last two weeks or so after the last critical windows update I have been unable to boot properly into windows and cannot get to the login screen. I would rather avoid resetting the hard drive in the hopes of saving my data. When booted I have a windows
 logo followed by spinning dots and then a black screen accompanied by more spinning dots and then a blank screen with nothing loading.</p>
<p>I can guarantee it has nothing to do with any hardware because I am able to boot and run a friend's hard drive with no issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After burning a recovery from a pre existing working windows 10 computer the "refresh" option only presents an option to reset the hard drive instead of repairing the corrupted windows boot files.</p>
<p>When I am able to run system repairs options, restore is unavailable, going back to a previous build fails, no system image is available, and Id prefer not to flash the drive back to factory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a recovery option I'm missing or a command prompt command I haven't tried?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would rather avoid resetting the hard drive in the hopes of saving my data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wince when I read statements like these. They confirm that there is only one really effective incentive to get people to back up their data regularly (e.g. weekly) to an external disk: The catastrophic loss of all data, or the threat of such a loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case you are half-lucky: It's only the threat of a loss. Saving your data is tedious but it's your only option. Here is how to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a 500 GByte hard disk in a USB case. It costs less than $50.00.</li><li>Ask a friend to create a bootable Windows Repair flash disk on his Windows 10 machine. The command
<em>RecoveryDrive.exe</em> will do it. Do NOT copy the system files.<br />
</li><li>Boot your PC with this disk.</li><li>Select advanced options, then open a Command Prompt.</li><li>Connect the USB hard disk.</li><li>Type this command to save your data to the USB disk:<br />
<em>robocopy /s &nbsp;c:\Users\Epicness\Documents &nbsp;E:\Documents</em><br />
(assuming that the USB disk is visible on drive E:)</li><li>Repeat the process for your Music and Pictures folder.</li><li>Do a few spot checks on a different PC to ensure that you can read the backed up files.</li><li>Continue with your repair or restore efforts.</li></ol>
<p>If you use a local E-Mail application such as Outlook then you might want to save its files too. Locating them is a little more demanding. The same goes for your browser favorites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on the description provided, it looks like you want to resume the download that you have rented using the Xbox video app.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check&nbsp;if the download appears in the Videos library. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it's not there, try downloading the video again. See the link to know more about the document for video rental information.

<h2>            Herstellen einer Internetverbindung &#40;Studentenwohnheim mit VPN-Client&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>ich wohne seit kurzem in einem Studentenwohnheim und weiß nun nicht wie ich meine Xbox ans Netz bekomme?</p>
<p>Bei meinem Laptop funktioniert das so: Ich stecke mein Lan-Kabel in die Buchse (in der Wand) und logge mich dann über meinen VPN-Client (Cisco AnyConnect) auf dem Laptop ins Netz ein (mit Nutzername und Passwort).</p>
<p>Nun würde ich gerne wissen wie ich mit meiner Xbox online gehen kann?</p>
<p>Danke schonmal im Vorraus :)</p>

<p>Spontan würde mir da einfallen, das Du Dir eine zweite Netzwerkkarte für Dein Notebook besorgst (gibt es für 15 Euro.... Einfach mal nach USB-Netzwerkadapter googeln) und dort die Xbox anschließt.</p>
<p>Dann baust Du ganz normal mit Deinem VPN-Client eine Verbindung auf und gibst diese dann für die XBox frei (Einfach mal nach "ICS" googeln).
</p>
<p>Das ganze nennt sich "Internet Connection Sharing" und funktioniert ganz prima.</p>

<p>Das Internet-Sharing hatte ich schonmal probiert, aber dann kann sich der Client irgendwie nichtmehr verbinden</p>

            <p>VPN entschlüsseln ist eher doof ... ich befürchte du wirst dir entweder einen UMTS Router zulegen müssen (inkl. Datentarif) oder überzeugst dein Studentenwohnheim, dass sie dir die Xbox irgendwie freischalten (vlt. per Mac Adresse oder so).</p>

<p>[quote user="Jack of Elonas"]</p>
<p>Ich stecke mein Lan-Kabel in die Buchse (in der Wand) und logge mich dann über meinen VPN-Client (Cisco AnyConnect) auf dem Laptop ins Netz ein (mit Nutzername und Passwort).</p>
<p>Nun würde ich gerne wissen wie ich mit meiner Xbox online gehen kann?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Bevor Du anfängst, gleich eine Warnung! Wie Weidhas schon erwähnt hat, ist es über den Cisco Client möglich, alle anderen lokalen Netzwerkverbindungen abzuschalten. Es gibt zwar in dem Programm einen Haken, bei dem Du einstellen
 kannst, ob lokales Netzwerkeln möglich sein darf oder nicht, aber wenn die VPN Gegenstelle des Campus dem Client mitteilt "Egal was der User anhakt oder nicht: LAN bleibt deaktiviert!" wirst Du die Xbox niemals über das Campus Netzwerk online bringen können.</p>
<p>Ist das Aktivieren der LAN Schnittstellen möglich, kannst Du aber dennoch nur eingeschränkt Multiplayer Partien spielen, je nachdem wie Dein Campus das Studentenwohnheim Routet und NATed.</p>
<p>Am Ende gibts noch eine "unkonventionelle" Lösung, wenn alle Stricke reißen.</p>
<p>Erstmal die "Hilf Dir selbst so hilft Dir Gott" Lösung:</p>
<p>Wie weiter oben schon erwähnt, brauchst Du eine zweite Netzwerkkarte. Entweder einen USB LAN Adapter kaufen, oder wenn die Xbox WLAN-Fähig ist, und Du Windows 7 oder höher verwendest, kannst Du den Virtuellen Accesspoint verwenden.</p>
<p>Auf Deinem Laptop sollte in der Eigenschaftenseite für Netzwerkadapter (Windowstaste + R, dann "ncpa.cpl" eingeben und OK klicken) eine virtuelle Netzwerkkarte für den Cisco Client vorhanden sein. Rechtsklicke darauf und in den
 Eigenschaften sollte ein Freigabe Karteireiter existieren.</p>
<p>Erlaube die Freigabe der Netzwerkverbindung für andere Geräte im Netzwerk. Falls Du mehrere Netzwerke im Laptop hast, wähle das Netzwerk aus, an das Du die Xbox anschließt. Sei es nun eine zweite LAN Netzwerkkarte, oder WLAN.</p>
<p>Um das WLAN nutzen zu können, musst Du bei Windows 7/8 erst Virtual WiFi aktivieren:</p>
<p>Öffne <strong>als Administrator </strong>eine Eingabeaufforderung (Startbutton klicken, "cmd" eingeben, und bei der Eingabeaufforderung rechtsklicken und "als Administrator" ausführen). Gib dann folgenden Befehl ein:</p>
<p><strong>netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid="<span>WLAN NAME</span>" key="<span>SCHLÜSSELWORT</span>" keyUsage=persistent</strong></p>
<p>Ersetze "WLAN NAME" durch Deinen gewünschten Namen für das WLAN, und "SCHLÜSSELWORT" ist der Netzwerkschlüssel.</p>
<p>Bedenke, dass nicht jede WLAN Karte den Virtual WiFi Modus unterstützt. In dem Falle wieder eine neue (USB-)LAN Karte für den Laptop kaufen.</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>Lösung 2: Es ist nicht möglich, sich selbst zu helfen. Sei es nun weil Cisco die LAN Schnittstelle abschaltet, oder weil das mit dem Freigeben nicht funktioniert. In dem Falle ist die Lösung etwas unorthodox, hat mir aber damals
 geholfen am Campus meine Dreamcast online zu bringen.</p>
<p>Schritt 1:Finde heraus, wann die IT-Abteilung des Campus Frühstücks-/Kaffeepause macht (und wieviele Kollegen dort arbeiten).</p>
<p>Schritt 2: Gehe zu einem (guten) Bäcker und kaufe eine große Tüte mit
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=teilchen&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=iEG&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de:official&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wYl3UciXG-e64ASsjYH4DA&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=631#client=firefox-a&amp;hs=kEG&amp;rls=org.mozilla:de:official&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=s%C3%BC%C3%9Fe+teilchen&amp;revid=979712781&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w4l3Ucb_MeeE4ASakIDoDQ&amp;ved=0CE8QgxY&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45580626,d.bGE&amp;fp=1&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
süßen Teilchen</a>. (Faustregel: Mindestens 2 Teilchen pro Mitarbeiter)</p>
<p>Schritt 3. Liefere die Tüte mit Teilchen bei der IT Abteilung ab, und erwähne nebenher, dass Du Probleme hast, Deine Xbox durch das VPN online zu bekommen, und ob es da nicht eine Lösung für gäbe.</p>
<p>Je nachdem wie stark "von oben" die IT Abteilung reglementiert wird, ist die Xbox Nachmittags online, oder aber Du hast bei der IT Abteilung einen SIB (Stein im Brett), der in Zukunft anderweitig nützlich sein kann.</p>

<p>Also ich hab das mit dem Internetsharing jetzt mal ausprobiert und es scheint theoretisch zu klappen, allerdings bekommt meine xbox keine Verbindung zum Netzerk aufgebaut und auch beim "Hotspot" seht im Status "kein Netzwerkzugriff" ??</p>

            <p>Siehe ersten Absatz im Beitrag von ArminatorX ... wenn am System eingestellt ist, dass alle Verbindungen "beendet" werden, dann geht das Sharing leider nicht. In 99% der Fälle ist diese Option aktiv und wird auch erzwungen bei Cisco AnyConnect.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail - can&#39;t download emails - &#34;Unable to lock maildrop&#58; Mailbox is locked by POP server&#34;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first post....!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have hit&nbsp;a problem, seemingly out of the blue,&nbsp;downloading emails onto my laptop. I am using Live Mail 2012 on Win 7. My broadband provider is Orange and I have a Freeserve email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click Send / Receive, I can send messages OK, and this message appears at the bottom right of the screen -
</p>
<p>"Connecting" </p>
<p>"Authenticating"</p>
<p>"Checking for email messages"</p>
<p>"No new email messages"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also received an error message (extract below):</p>
<p>
</p><p><font color="#000000">Server Error: 0x800CCC90</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Server Response: -ERR [IN-USE] Unable to lock maildrop: Mailbox is locked by POP server</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC92</font><font color="#000000">:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><font color="#000000">My email provider does not support IMAP, so I can't reconfigure my account.</font></div>
</li><li>
<div><font color="#000000">I have uninstalled and re-installed Windows Live Mail to no avail.</font></div>
</li><li>
<div><font color="#000000">From my research, it seems the problem may coincide with my purchase of a new iPad Mini, with Live Mail and&nbsp;the same email&nbsp;account setup as my laptop,&nbsp;and
 have been recently&nbsp;downloading emails onto that device. I have tried switching my iPad off (and iPhone as well) and then tried to download emails onto the laptop, but still no success. Emails still download OK onto my phone and tablet.</font></div>
</li></ul>
<p><font color="#000000">Can anyone suggest any possible solutions I could try in order to get emails downloading again onto the laptop?
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Many thanks....</font></p>
<p>

<br />
Yes, this is caused by your accessing the same mailbox from a phone-type device. If you configure the device&nbsp;for push mail, it will monopolize the POP server, and there can only be one POP3 connection at once.&nbsp;The account may also be provisioned for push mail
 at the server, which will effectively rule out any access from a humble POP3 client like Windows Live Mail.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can suggest is disabling push mail everywhere you can, then set up the accounts on your mobile devices to use POP3, polling for new messages at different intervals from Windows Live Mail. It might take a day or two for the server to realize
 that you're not pushing mail any more; if it doesn't come right, talk to your mail service provider's tech support and ask them to reset the account for POP3 access.&nbsp;<br />

Seems PC type or brand doesn't matter... won't do it on my machine, either.<br />
<br />
It did not work&nbsp;when was&nbsp;the Insider Build, either, btw.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I don't know where y'all live, but there's something I found while searching:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://mspoweruser.com/heres-new-emoji-picker-windows-10-might-not-work/</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess it isn't a bug, but the Emoji panel is only available in the USA for now.</p>
<p>(P.S. I can't open it, too, I'm in France)</p>

            Launch Twitter, Word, Outlook or any other application that supports emoji symbols and the panel will show up. It won't show if you just attempt to launch it by itself.&nbsp; 😁👏👌&nbsp; It even works when replying online.

<p>Right, that <strong>is</strong> the idea. But, currently, as stated, in the USA, only.&nbsp; Still,&nbsp;the added info is cool.<br />

            The Emoji panel (accessed by holding the Windows key then tapping ; or . ) is only supported for English American keyboard.
<br />
<br />
This needs to be fixed so it can be used in all languages.<br />

If you need the emoji panel add the American Keyboard 👿 <br />

<p>Correction:<br />

<p>
</p><p>The keyboard can be set to English (US), BUT, the <strong>Region</strong> must be USA.&nbsp; It is not currently available in other countries regardless of the K/B language used. It's a location issue (right now) not, a language issue.<br />

<p>Wow! Thank you so much. It worked for me. I just changed my keyboard's language from English(Philippines) to English(United States) and the Win+. shortcut worked 👍😊<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5b7f770-1eff-435c-8850-d7baf4260609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5b7f770-1eff-435c-8850-d7baf4260609" /></a></p>

<br />To post a screenshot, click the second last button on the toolbar above your post . . .
<br />
<br />Alternatively, just post which Processor type and Operating System type is listed there are both 64bit, are both 32bit, is one 32bit . . ..

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>One reason for this concern is a hardware malfunction. We suggest running <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong> to boot your PC with limited set of files and drivers. Then you can scan your hard drive by running CHKDSK.
 This will repair errors, locate bad sectors, and recover readable information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform CHKDSK, at the command prompt, type <strong>chkdsk/r</strong>, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if need further assistance.</p>

            Hi, StunningPhotographer,
<br />
<br />I am an Independent Advisor and will assist you.
<br />
<br />Currently submissions are not being accepted. You might keep an eye on Microsoft Rewards Facebook page. They at random times have Photo Contests for members where you may submit photos for the Bing.com Home Page.

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to answer your question. 
<br />
<br />Sadly, according to several posts, such as from another Independent Advisor named Ethan B. of last year, the program was ended and Microsoft is no longer accepting direct submissions. 
<br />
<br />For reference: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start-win_desk/how-do-i-submit-a-desktop-wallpaper/92579241-6f71-443a-b367-26e15959f020">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />However, there are several companies with communities on which you can share your photography. For example, "Stardock" products support a wallpaper community that is still accepting submissions and so on. 
<br />
<br />Also, as unusual as the next suggestion may sound Reddit also has a community thread for photography would allow you to gain some real-time exposure, but that is just a suggestion. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if this answers your question!

<br />
<br />Name the key DisableAntiSpyware 
<br />
<br />Double-click the newly created key, and set the value to 0

            Hello PrajwalMalvi,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />To fix Windows Defender issue, try these suggestions:
<br />
<br />Run services.msc to open Services Manager. Ensure that the Windows Defender service is started and set to Automatic.
<br />
<br />You may need to re-register the following dll files and see if it helps you. Run each command in an elevated command prompt one after the other and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />regsvr32 wuaueng.dll
<br />regsvr32 wucltui.dll
<br />regsvr32 softpub.dll
<br />regsvr32 wintrust.dll
<br />regsvr32 initpki.dll
<br />regsvr32 wups.dll
<br />regsvr32 wuweb.dll
<br />regsvr32 atl.dll
<br />regsvr32 mssip32.dll
<br /> 
<br />Also run regedit command and navigate to the following key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender
<br />
<br />Here ensure that the value of these DWORDS is 0 : DisableAntiSpyware and DisableAntiVirus.
<br />
<br />To fix issue with apps, try these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Close all apps first.
<br />
<br />2. Open administrative Windows PowerShell by right click on Start Button and select Windows PowerShell (Admin).
<br />
<br />3. Type/paste following and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />4. Let the command complete so that all apps are re-registered.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. 
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A. 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD 
<br />Right click CMD 
<br />Click Run as administrator 
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter 
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times) 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download 
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work.. 
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD 
<br />Right click CMD 
<br />Click Run as administrator 
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter 
<br />
<br />Run these codes: 
<br />Net Stop bits 
<br />Net Stop wuauserv 
<br />Net Stop appidsvc 
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc 
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak 
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak 
<br />Net Start bits 
<br />Net Start wuauserv 
<br />Net Start appidsvc 
<br />Net Start cryptsvc 
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

 but like I said, when I click on default apps, it doesn't open. I am getting beyond frustrated. Can anyone give me any tips? I forgot to mention that if I try and download anything, it freezes my computer and it quits responding.

            Hi Pamela.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This could go to the install's overall integrity, or just be a glitch in the Settings app.  Let's start by re-registering the Settings app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Restart the PC then try again.  If that doesn't fix it then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Microsoft .NET Framework error</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a MSI GT72VR with the shortcut keys on the left hand side of the keyboard. &nbsp;When i press the screen off shortcut key or the shortcut key that launches a specified program, I keep getting the following error message below. I have tried updating everything,

<p>I had the same problem MSI SCM utility - (System Control Manager - SCM.exe).</p>
<p>Got exactly the same unhandled exception.</p>
<p>After an extensive investigation, I managed to resolve it by deleting the MSI directory and its content which is located in the following&nbsp;path: &nbsp;"<strong>c:\Users\</strong><em>&lt;Your User&gt;</em><strong>\AppData\Local\</strong>MSI<strong>\</strong>"</p>
<p>At your PC the directory content might be similar to the following:</p>
<p><em>SCM.exe_Url_zv0ikcohnhzptbjtykvepncdk0ijftla\13.16.7276.0\user.config</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the root cause of this error is that the user.config gets corrupted every now and then for unclear reasons.</p>
<p>I think MSI are keeping it open while the SCM.exe is running, thus if Windows crashes, the XML in user.config file gets corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can remove this directory if this happens once again, no need to uninstall and reinstall SCM once more. just&nbsp;delete the MSI directory, logout and relogin</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enjoy :-)</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Fowzi</p>

                    My xbox one is turning on from the console, but isn't connecting with the controller. Just getting a black screen. I've tried resetting, rebooting, and reconnecting the controller wirelessly and wired. Nothing is working. Anything I've missed?

<p>Try syncing the controller and the console by pressing the button on the front of the controller and the button on the left side of the console at roughly the same time. The console's button is kinda hard to find, but it should be in front of the USB port
 on the side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason my console has been staying on a black/grey screen when I start it up but pressing the home button and A usually fixes it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, you may need to check your cables connecting your console to your TV. Sometimes HDMI cables can go bad, and for some reason controllers won't connect if the TV isn't showing the Xbox stuff, or if the TV is just off.</p>

            <pre>Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.

Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            I don't believe it does, you can check the event viewer to see if there was an error and what that error was related to. On it's own DEP does not log as far as I know.<br />

    <title>Problems with Skype on windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gillpk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Skype on windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I recently upgraded to 8.1 but seem to have a unique problem (at least I can't find anything about it on the web).</div>
<div>I can find skype in store through my start menu. &nbsp;It says I "own the app and can install it". &nbsp;When I click to install</div>
<div>it does install it and appears in top right hand corner as installed. &nbsp;Clicking there gets me into skype and it works</div>
<div>perfectly. &nbsp;However, once I leave skype I can't get back into it without going through the same process again.</div>
<div>No tile appears in the start menu, and nothing appears in apps either. &nbsp;In fact, if I search apps it shows up as</div>
<div>not installed and allows me to install it again, and again.</div>
<div>I have successfully downloaded skype for desktops, but would prefer the windows version.</div>
<div>Any advice greatly appreciated.</div>
<div>Gillian</div>
                </div>

            There is no such functionality right now on Skype (or even Skype for Business) - however, if the people in the group chat are not friends with each other, and each of your students turn on their videos, their videos will not automatically show. Each of
 them will receive a prompt to accept video from each other student, which they will have to authorize one by one.
