<h2>            Amazon Prime Music and Windows Lumia 640 LTE mobile.</h2>
                    <p>I am happily using the Amazon Prime streaming for music on a Windows 10 desktop. Why can't I get Amazon Prime on my Windows phone? Is it going to be available soon. If not, is there a way I can work around this?</p>

    <title>Spam emails that refuse to be blocked by Rules - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Spam emails that refuse to be blocked by Rules</h2>
                    <p>This started about a week ago.&nbsp; I am being flooded, more than ever before, with emails using the address "newsletter@~~".&nbsp; I have been able to successfully block most junk emails by setting up Rules, so I'm familiar with how that works.&nbsp; But with newsletter
 emails, the result is different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the condition "User address includes" and enter either 'newsletter' or 'newsletter@'.&nbsp; I specify "Delete" as the action.&nbsp; I have saved the Rule with "Stop processing more rules" checked and an identical Rule with "Stop processing more rules" unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not blocking anything.&nbsp; I continue to be flooded with newsletter emails.&nbsp; Which are likely not newsletters at all.&nbsp; I can see by mousing over the sender address that the domain has nothing to do with the sender name (Lifeline Screening of America Partner
 was sent from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; Yum)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what's going on?&nbsp; And what can I do to block these emails?</p>

            Dear Ben,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users.
<br />
<br />Nowadays some scammers have learned how to mask their emails addresses that you can see in the emails. However, in the message source you will find the real one (and the real domain) In order to view message source please check this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiving-email-from-blocked-senders-in-outlook-com-265923a0-b52c-4157-92c8-370385215da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiv...</a>
<br />
<br />Please note that Postmaster ( <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a> ) is actually blocking lots of spammers ( and I quote ):
<br />For example, we've implemented a number of mechanisms to reduce the burden of junk email which currently prevents nearly 4.5 billion email messages from reaching Outlook.com users every day!
<br />
<br />There are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails and improve how your anty filter will work (I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender (those that were actually used to send emails - see #5) list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> and add conditions, that are common for those emails, for example additional keywords, recipient address includes etc.
<br />5. You can also use the option at the bottom <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/junkEmail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/junk...</a> to receive only trust email from addresses in my Safe senders and domains list and Safe mailing lists

<p>I'm sorry to say that a "boilerplate" response is rarely helpful.&nbsp; In my message I stated that I know how to use Rules and have successfully used them in the past.&nbsp; I'm also aware of how to determine the actual sender.&nbsp; Once again, that was stated in the
 original message.&nbsp; I don't think you read my message, you were just alerted to a couple of key words and sent your automated reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody here have actual, practical advice on stopping the phony newsletter emails?&nbsp; As I said, I'm able to block most emails using Rules.&nbsp; Newsletter emails are just ignored and allowed to clutter my junk folder.</p>

            Dear Ben, 
<br />
<br />This is the method that I have used on my account and it is working. I was receiving over 200 spam emails a day ( did it on purpose ) and now I get hardly 5 a day, all other go to junk. 
<br />
<br />And disabling stop processing more rules is not too good in those situations when you are trying to get rid of the spam. If you have multiple rules that apply to the same message something may not work correctly.
<br />
<br />Also you edited your original post and now it contains some other information.

            Dear Ben, 
<br />
<br />If you have added email address to block sender and you are still receiving them ( not to inbox ) but to Junk folder, than everything works fine, as designed. Emails from block senders are still received, only to the Junk folder.
<br />
<br />There is no need to set up rule that will delete emails after moving to Junk. All emails from Junk are deleted automatically within 30 days of being moved to Junk. Those emails cannot be recovered. 
<br />
<br />As for Stop processing more rules: All messages that are being received are checked against all the rules that you have configured. This checking begins with the first rule in the list and ends with the last rule. If a rule applies to a message and this rule has the "stop processing more rules" action enabled, then that message will not be checked against any other rules and Outlook will skip to the next received message that will be checked against all rules again starting with the first rule.
<br />
<br />Also I believe this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/stop-processing-more-rules-in-outlook-com-10dca09a-24c7-4c0d-abf3-9fa29fdc3230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/stop-p...</a> explains this process of Stop processing more rules really well.

<p>No it does not.</p>

    <title>Online Buffering Video Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sallyplus4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Online Buffering Video Problem</h2>
                    I purchased a HP dv7-3065dx with Windows 7. This is suppose to be an entertainment notebook, but I cannot watch a online video without it starting and stopping all the way through.&nbsp; There is a problem with buffering and I have not been able to find out
 how to adjust the buffering. Does anyone know where to go to adjust the buffering?

<p>Hi Sallyplus4,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!!!</p>
<p>Buffering or Streaming media are multimedia that are constantly received by, and normally presented to, an end-user while being delivered by a streaming provider (the term "presented" is used in this article in a general sense that includes audio or video
 playback.</p>
<p>A media stream can be streamed either by live or on demand. Live streams are generally provided by a means called true streaming. True streaming sends the information straight to the computer or device without saving the file to a hard disk.</p>
<p>There is no option within the Operating system to increase the speed of buffering. Only way to increase the buffering speed to certain extend is to get a connection with greater network bandwidth. But note, this also does not give you a continuous play option
 as in CD or DVD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another work around that I personally do is to pause the video to complete buffering and watch the video once the buffering is completed.</p>
<p>Regards<br />

<br />
<br />Are you explicitly mapping the fields when importing from the CSV file which is done by clicking on the &lt;Map Custom Fields&gt; button when presented during the import process.
<br />
<br />Just to confirm one other thing - by "People" folder, you are referring to a "Contact" folder in the Outlook '2016 folder tree - just asking since there is no such as a "People" folder.

<br />A common mistake. Explicitly map the fields and I'm fairly confident that you're problem will disappear. Will wait to hear back from you.

<h2>            Cannot get links to open new pages after upgrading to Internet Explorer 9</h2>
                    Original title: I have IE 8 by BT and Windows 7 and been upgraded to Windows 9 I cannot get links to open new pages.&nbsp; Each time I click on a link it opens a new page but that page is blank.<br />
Each time I click on a link it opens a new page but that page is blank.&nbsp; I can copy shortcut and past to a new window and that works.&nbsp; I have installed Firefox and that works perfectly.&nbsp; I have spent nearly 3 hours with Microsoft and BT taking over my computer
 and have looked at all the forums but come to the conclusion that I need to delete and re-load the whole program.<br />
<br />
Microsoft took over my computer for nearly an hour but would not delete IE, BT spent about an hour and again would not delete and re-load.&nbsp; They also wanted to charge me £25 per 15 mins&nbsp; to sort out and, as I had not had much luck with others declined....<br />
Have re-set IE and cleared all accelerators and add on's and deleted as much as I could of accessible to delete programs but still have this.<br />
Can't even sign in to here on IE!&nbsp; Doing this on Firefox. <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you should not save the age in a table field. Obviously it changes every year and you would have to always update it. Instead you should calculate the current age whenever and wherever it is needed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here you find some methods: http://access.mvps.org/access/datetime/date0001.htm</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can e.g. use the first solution, i.e.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DateDiff("yyyy", [Bdate], Now())+&nbsp;Int( Format(now(), "mmdd") &lt; Format( [Bdate], "mmdd") )</p>
<p>
</p><p>in a calculated column of a query or </p>
<p>
</p><p>=DateDiff("yyyy", [Bdate], Now())+&nbsp;Int( Format(now(), "mmdd") &lt; Format( [Bdate], "mmdd") )</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the property&nbsp;"Control source" of a text control in a form or report.</p>

            <p>Karl is correct, as a general rule you should not be storing calculated values. You can display the age in an unbound control using an expression like Karl gave you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in Access 2010, there is a Calculated field &nbsp;datatype. My blog has an article about using them. You could try using the expression Karl gave you with a calculated field and see how that works.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> 港香  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2007 home and student 啟動問題</h2>
                    <p>客戶有一臺電腦，除了硬盤保留著之外【硬盤里有安裝著Office 2007 HS（盒裝購買，有安裝光碟）沒換硬件之前是處於啟用的狀態】，其他的硬件已經更換，例如底板、RAM，然後打開Office 2007&nbsp;home&nbsp;and&nbsp;student時有啟用精靈提示需要重新啟用這個產品，但是：</p>
<p>1.客戶做不了線上啟用，提示”檢測到硬件已經更換“，錯誤提示為（You are copy of microsoft office 2007 home and student cannot ba activated ，because the stedified product key had already been activated the maximun number of time permitted for you software had st in the Microsoft license
 terms.For detail，about the maximum allowed number of product activation ， click help and then search read the Microsoft software license time，if you believe，then you are getting this message in error ，click back，and choose the telephone option ，the telephone
 activate option will provider the opportunity，to speak to a support retresent about activation isuue .）</p>
<p>2.客戶不能透過電話啟用，按下電話啟用后沒有反應，也沒有顯示電話啟用的9組安裝識別碼.</p>
<p>3.沒有試過重新安裝Office 2007 HS.</p>
<p>所以現在客戶是既不能透過顯示啟用，又不能透過電話啟用，請問有什麼辦法能解決這個問題呢？</p>
<p>另外有一點需要注意，客戶現在只想用線上激活的這個方式去啟用Office 2007&nbsp;home&nbsp;and&nbsp;student，不想透過電話啟用，請協助下，謝謝！</p>

            <p>因為你原本使用的硬體環境已經變更了，相關的驗證紀錄已經與原本的都不一樣，因此無法直接使用及啟動</p>
<p>建議你把office重新安裝一次，然後再透過線上的方式啟動產品金鑰，假若該組金鑰已經啟動太多次了，就必須要以電話的方式啟動</p>
<p>另外，你目前遇到的問題建議你查詢產品金鑰啟動中心，相關的啟動程序並無法在論壇上提供你協助</p>

<p>Skype relies on your device's connection, whether you're using data or Wi-Fi. You can change your connection from your device settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or are you referring to your Skype credits? In order for you to call mobile numbers or landline numbers using your Skype account, you will need Skype credits or subscription, without any of those, you will not be able to make a call to numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if you want a&nbsp;<strong>regular Skype to Skype call</strong>, make sure to view your contact's profile to see if it's a phone number or a Skype account from your contacts list.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;- Thanks for your reply ; but it's still not what I mean ; let me try to re-phrase. I made an international call with SKYPE. Apparently when or after the caller turned out to be unreachable SKYPE THEN&nbsp; use my<strong> phone app
</strong>for making this call. Hence the cost came on my normal phone bill ,which I don't want. How can I avoid this ?</p>

<p>Hello M., </p>

</p><p>We do not have any settings that transfer an unsuccessful Skype call to a phone app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only possible way that this may happen is if you have dialed the number using your phone app's dial pad instead of your Skype client's.

</p><p>It makes no sense to stop using IE because of this message on one webpage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember the message says "Your browser is not officially supported" That does not say that your version of Internet Explorer is not secure. It implies that it's not supported on this one website.</p>

 I think you can just use the website and ignore the incorrect message....</p>

                    1. Blink light showing missed calls, unread messages.<br />
2. The HOLD slider on the remote doesn't lock the CALL button there - you can still hold it and give a voice command.

            The N81 is about to be made obsolete by some of the new N-series models, so it is unlikely to see any significant changes now.

            Yeah, if NOKIA brings all these improvements into reality, I think all guys will buy it and ignore other models, lol.<br />
<br />
So a successful business man never makes perfect product, the same as NOKIA. Every product will have disadvantages -- and of course advantages. The art is, how to gain the balance of these two. You got a phone and found there were disadvantages, but still decided
 to use it 'coz of other goodness, in this case, when new phone come out, you may more possibly throw old one away and rush to get the new one. If someone is perfect, OK, everybody get it, and useing for 2 years, 3 years, or even 5 years -- and then our lovely
 NOKIA will say goodbye to us.<br />
<br />
BTW: I think the best disadvantages seller is Apple, isn't it?

            While I agree with all you say, fineday, you must see that, especially number 2 (he,he) is not a disadvantage but a plain bug. How can HOLD slider NOT lock all keys? What's the purpose of leaving this one unlocked?<br />
Blink light doesn't seem to be difficult to improve witha firmware update, but I doubt it will be, as it would require a lot of good will on the part of Nokia, just to please a few users.<br />
But, why is it N95 has had so many updates, while N81 not?

<h2>            Create list of subsites on company home page</h2>
                    
<p>when I go to mycompany.sharepoint.com, I'm taken to the company home page.&nbsp; I'd like to have a listing of all subsites on this page</p>
<p>On the left panel where the site navigation links are located (is this the quick launch?), "Site Contents" is one option.&nbsp; If I click that, I'm taken to that page and there is the exact Subsite list I am looking for.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>How do I put this list on the main page?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>hi bradley,</p>
<p>thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>then, you may consider adding a<b> content search </b>web part to the home page to list all sub sites out. please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. go to the site home page, click <b>edit </b>on the right upper corner.</p>
<p>2. click <b>insert</b>-&gt;<b>web part-</b>&gt;<b>content rollup-</b>&gt;<b>content search</b>-&gt;<b>add</b>-&gt;then click
<b>edit web part. </b></p>
<p>3. then click <b>change query</b>-&gt;<b>switch to <span>
qiuck</span> advanced mode</b>.</p>
<p>4. in the <strong>query <span>test</span> text</strong> box, put in the following syntax.</p>
<p><b>path:"https://tenant.sharepoint.com"contentclass:sts_web site&lt;&gt;{site.url} urldepth&lt;3</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=47136d8e-f9c0-4dd3-89bb-03adbeab424d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d47136d8e-f9c0-4dd3-89bb-03adbeab424d" /></a><br />
</b></p>
<p>5. then, we click <b>test query, </b>then we can see all our sub sites are listed out. click ok-&gt;apply.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=135e762b-02c6-4f7b-be5c-eeaa49b9630e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d135e762b-02c6-4f7b-be5c-eeaa49b9630e" /></a></p>
<p>6. by default, it only show three sub sites. but we can change the number of items to show.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=42dc5508-0a43-4ea0-8cd9-dd244835aef4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d42dc5508-0a43-4ea0-8cd9-dd244835aef4" /></a></p>
<p>7. if you want to let all sub sites’ logo and description show up, expand <strong>
property mappings</strong> section, tick <strong>change the mapping of managed…</strong> option, then under<strong> picture url</strong> drop down list, choose<strong> sitelogo</strong>, under
<strong>line 2</strong> dropdown list, choose <strong>description</strong>. see:</p>

<p>hi bradley,</p>
<p>we cannot directly filter developing sub sites out. but you may consider renaming all developing sub sites’ title to contain and start with “project” to filter them out. for example, i filtered out all my sub site whose title are starts with “access”.</p>

    <title>what is epp.msi&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            what is epp.msi&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I ran into a problem with Microsoft Security Essential. It could not update. I decided to uninstall it and I could not. I was given an error that epp.msi was not found and asked me to show where it is. I found and then selected epp.msi and it said that the
 file was invalid. Now the next step may have been a mistake, but I used the "fix it" to remove MSE. It removed at least part of MSE, because it will no longer run. On restart, i am given an error 0x80070002 - security client failed to install. If i try to
 re-install MSE, I get prompted for epp.msi's location again. And still it is called invalid. What do I do to fix this and what is epp.msi?</p>

<p><br />
Epp.msi is part of the Microsoft Security Client Package.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Howe long have you been using MSE?&nbsp; If a recent install, was your computer infected?&nbsp; Did you remove all previously installed antimalware programs including running the appropriate software removal tools?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've been using MSE a while be advised we're seeing unexplained incidents such as you describe (particularly on Windows XP SP3 which I'm using right now by the way) that
<strong>may</strong> be malware related.&nbsp; How about try a couple of these online scanners just in case that's what happened to MSE initially?</p>
<p><span>You might need to run them in Safe Mode or Safe Mode With Networking:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>www.malwarebytes.org</span></span></a><span> and download, install, update and run the free version – just follow the prompts.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span>The prompt<span>&nbsp; </span>asks if you want to <em><span>Start&nbsp;trial</span></em> or
<em><span>Decline</span></em>.&nbsp; To get the free version (without real-time scanning or web site blocking features) you need to choose
<em><span>Decline.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></em><span>You may need to rename the installation file to 123.exe or something similar to prevent the malware from disabling/blocking the installation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Or you might want to download the installation file to a flash drive or CD and then install Malwarebytes on the infected computer.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>And/or</span></b></p>
<p>Try Hitman Pro Trial Version: <a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
This program may be run from a flash drive.</p>
<p><b>And/or</b></p>
<p><span>Try TDSS Killer: <span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-tdss-tdl3-alureon-rootkit-using-tdsskiller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com<span>/<span>virus-removal/remove-tdss-tdl3-alureon-rootkit-usi<span>ng-tdsskiller</span></span></span></span></span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span>TDSS Killer may be run from a flash drive.</span></p>
<p><b>And/or</b></p>
<p>Try the Eset Online Scanner: <a href="http://go.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>http://go.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></span></a></p>
<p><b>And/or</b></p>
<p>Try this MS scanner: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then try Revo to remove any remaining traces of your prior install of MSE: <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try again to install MSE </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's go through the generic fix for&nbsp;install/update issues:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sometimes remnants of prior security software will suddenly cause issues with your current antimalware program.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>A <b>possible</b> reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Be sure you have removed <span>&nbsp;</span>all other security software from the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you’re not sure which security apps may have been on your computer try a scan with this security application detection/removal tool:

<p><br />
Assuming that there is one record per recipient, use a Directory type mail merge main document in which you just set up one set of the merge fields with an empty paragraph after them.</p>
<p>I am not sure why you would not however just use an Access Report.</p>
<p>If there are multiple records for the one recipient, you could used the Many to One facilitiy on the&nbsp;<span>MergeTools – 20120225 Add-in that I created that you can download from the following page of my Windows Live SkyDrive:</span></p>
