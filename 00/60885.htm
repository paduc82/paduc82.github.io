<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in refresh loop on home page</h2>
                    After three tries over a 24-hr period I managed to load and install Windows 10; however, upon reboot and sign on the computer loads the home page and launches into refresh loop. &nbsp;When I do the CTRL-ALT-DEL command for Task Manager it shows no apps running.
 &nbsp;When I switch to the All Processes window, I am not certain which process may be the issue as two of everything appears to be running. &nbsp;Anyone have this problem and found a solution. &nbsp;I rebooted at least three times. &nbsp;I have a Lenovo ThinkPad. &nbsp;

    <title>Controllers, Arghhhhhhhhh...... Not the best first impression. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> editfmah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controllers, Arghhhhhhhhh......  Not the best first impression.</h2>
                    
<p>I'll keep it brief as this has been covered many...many times on this support forum.</p>
<p>Unpacked brand new XBox One, couldn't get past the configuration screen as I couldn't get the wireless controller to pair. &nbsp;Plugged it in via USB to get the console setup. &nbsp;I then managed to get it paired finally, but it disconnects all the time.</p>
<p>Also my Thrustmaster 458 Spider steering wheel only works with F1 2015 when all other controllers are turned off and I reboot the console (more of an aside, FYI)</p>
<p>Anyhow, controller disconnects every 5 mins or so. &nbsp;I've just been out and bought another one (the newer one with the 3.5mm jack in the bottom), and it does exactly the same thing. &nbsp;The controller even disconnects when connected with no batteries via USB.</p>

<p>I would be grateful for any advice on things I can try, below is a list of the things I have done, in order:</p>

<p><em>Connected Via USB, still disconnects/becomes unresponsive</em></p>
<p><em>New Batteries, Duracell, Energiser &amp; Supermarket Own</em></p>
<p><em>Wireless &amp; Wired Netwrok Connection</em></p>
<p><em>Updated all games, no system update available.</em></p>
<p><em>Updated firmware on the controllers.</em></p>
<p><em>Pulled the XBox out of the entertainment centre, placed it on the floor. &nbsp;Only about 4ft away now. &nbsp;Was 6ft.</em></p>
<p><em>Disabled 2.4ghz wireless, and then 5ghz wireless.</em></p>
<p><em>Unplugged DECT cordless phone and turned off handset.</em></p>
<p><em>No microwaves active in area.</em></p>
<p><em>Shutdown all laptops/computers</em></p>
<p><em>Tuned off all mobile phones and bluetooth devices in house.</em></p>
<p><em>Turned the xbox off many times, does work for a few mins and then dies.</em></p>
<p><em>Factory Reset XBox and set it up again, although it is stuck on the controller pairing screen and just won't pair at all.</em></p>

<p>Is there anything else I could possibly try before getting all princess at the store I bought it from and demand a new one?</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>That does sound frustrating, and also seems like you've done your research and tried all the trouble shooting steps available. I honestly have nothing to suggest as you have covered it all.</p>
<p>I was going to suggest hard reseting your xbox, which you do by having the xbox one, then holding down the power button on the front until the xbox switches off. Then unplug the power from the console and power outlet, and let it sit for 5minutes. Plug it
 all back in then try again.</p>
<p>If you have done a restore to factory settings though, that should do the same as a hard reset that I suggested. I'd try the hard reset anyway, as its very simple to do, and if that fails then I'd take it back and have it replaced, as that will definitely
 fix the issue.</p>
<p>Good luck anyway mate, I really hope you get it sorted</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Denaz</p>

<p>I think we should consider the possibility that software isn't the source of the problem - this is actually a manufacturing flaw.</p>
<p>For two years now since the console's launch, millions of Xbox One Wireless Controllers have been plagued with being preventing them from pairing, being connected via a USB cable or even staying on, with multiple updates released to try and solve it.&nbsp; In
 most cases, nothing has worked besides purchasing a new one, but with little or no guarantee it won't have the same issue, sometimes within a month of use...</p>
<p>I think Microsoft should perform an analysis of their production line to determine if a specific component incorporated into the controllers are the cause of all these woes.</p>

    <title>ASUS Windows 10 laptop &#34;No Audio Output Device is installed&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> needhelp66  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASUS Windows 10 laptop &#34;No Audio Output Device is installed&#34; and weird Bios screen on startup</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
For a few months now, my laptop's audio has not been working showing a red cross next to the audio symbol stating "No Audio Output device is installed". It all started when upon plugging in my mic to earjack, I heard static noise which at first didn't bug me
 until my audio stopped working altogether. Now for quite a while I've searched numerous suggestion/solutions to the problem and upon uninstalling reinstalling audio drivers, reinstalling my soc chipset and getting the same repeated problem with my audio drivers
 (realtek, code 10 this device cannot start) I have no idea how to recover my audio. I also feel there has been a decline in my laptop's functions as recently upon startup after my asus logo pops up, sometimes the bios utility screen pops up causing a loop
 in staring up my laptop. Only after strong perseverance can my laptop actually startup getting past it (this is quite tedious to do).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure my audio card isn't completely stuffed up as occasionally (very very rarely) my audio sign doesn't show the cross and audio plays normally for a little bit, before the static comes back and my audio is gone (last time this happened was about
 a month ago although). Also I don't think it's my laptop becoming to old as I've only had it for a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is an ASUS a555ua.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I haven't really reached out for help with this issue as I've kind of gotten used to no audio, but if there any other possible suggestions to fix it, I would greatly appreciate them.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>

                    When I got back home i got my laptop out of my laptop bag and when i went on it i tried watching a youtube video but i couldn't hear anything, i tried another video but nothing. I've checked around my settings but found nothing, is it because i had it
 turned on in the bag or did it just stop working? P.S I've had this laptop for less that 6 months

<p>Is this the right thread for me?</p>
<p>I am having these issues too and have tried every trick anyone could offer.</p>
<p>New to posting threads. &nbsp;Had a 360 for years with little issue, got an XBOX One last week and problems, problems, annoying problems. &nbsp;It will not connect to wifi at all.</p>
<p>Spoke to Microsoft for hours, and my ISP, between them they have not resolved these issues.</p>
<p>MS told me to get ISP to open a series of new ports on the router: Did not work</p>
<p>Asked me to make sure the router is not filtering MAC address, done: Did not work</p>
<p>Asked me to have a guest network set up from router and get XBOX to connect to that: Impossible, apparently, so did not work.</p>
<p>I have given up for the time being and connected to router via Ethernet cable. &nbsp;Seriously considering ditching my allegiance to MS, take it back and get a PS4.</p>
<p>MS have been very little help, my ISP is scratching its head with no ideas.</p>
<p>Does anyone have the slightest clue as to why this is happening? &nbsp;There is very little meaningful support, and I get the sense that MS would rather me get a refund than fix the issue.</p>
<p>I have ipad, iphone, laptop and so does my wife, we have no problems with anything else. &nbsp;Speed test on mobile reveals 15-20mb/s download speeds over wifi.</p>
<p>I do not have external hard drives or Kinect connected to the system. &nbsp;It has been unreliable and not a good experience so far.</p>
<p>I have a basic Netgear Router and the ISP is Virgin media. &nbsp;Spoke to MS three or four times, being told something different each time!</p>
<p>Any ideas? &nbsp;Or shall I kick this into touch?</p>
<p>Help would be helpful</p>

<p>Oh, meant to add, have power cycled xbox lots of times, likewise with router. &nbsp;"Turn it off and on again" has not even slightly worked!</p>
<p>It's connected via Ethernet and everything works fine. &nbsp;This makes no sense. &nbsp;the 360 is happy as can be, Xbox One, totally the opposite. &nbsp;And since you can do virtually nothing with an XBOX One which isn't online... &nbsp;Seriously considering ditching this,
 getting my money back and waving bye bye to Microsoft for good. &nbsp;Want to stay, but want to play!</p>
<p>Looking forward to any responses from peoples in the know (which evidently is not Microsoft's call centre support people) &nbsp;who said "Well it should be working by now..."!</p>

<p>Still not a new thread but who cares ;)</p>
<p>Well ok, let's try to sort this out:</p>
<p>So you are trying to connect your new Xbox One to the Internet. As far as I understand you at the moment, if you use a wired connection everything works fine and you are able to connect to xbl. As soon as you change to a wireless connection, you cannot even
 connect to the router or is at least this working? If you cannot even connect to the router please try at first to check if your Xbox uses an alternative MAC adress and if so please delete it.</p>

<p>Thanks BobMcFly247,</p>
<p>When I'm hardwired everything is fine, but when on wireless (as when I tried to set it up straight out of the box) I get:</p>
<p>Cannot connect to your DHCP server; or</p>
<p>Cannot connect to Internet</p>
<p>I check network connection, sometimes I get cannot connect to internet please try later (or power cycle router etc), or most of the time, "You're connected/everything is fine". &nbsp;But then back at my homescreen, I sign in, it welcomes me, then offers me help
 logging in to xbox live (in a big side panel and to the left 'to get pins' bit, which it evidently can't do, for some reason. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'help with XBL' just takes me back to the check connection menu where it says NAT: Open, all is well sort of thing. &nbsp;Then try to open, say, Fifa 15 or Forza 5 and it says cannot connect to servers please check network connection. &nbsp;I check network connection,
 everything is fine, and the circus continues.</p>
<p>I've tried everything Microsoft's support people told me, spoken to people over and over. &nbsp;The ISP is Virgin media, with netgear DGN 1000 over ADSL, which I'm aware is old school, but the 360 works perfectly on it as do all other wireless devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So it seems the box is seeing the network, connecting to the router, but for some reason, not getting any further than that. &nbsp;Yet when I plug in Ethernet, all is well with the world? &nbsp;I've read that some Virgin users have had the same problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and this is my second brand new XBOX One after MS support on the phone said it must be hardware, get a replacement. &nbsp;So I doubt it is hardware.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, I am not the most technical of gamers. &nbsp;Currently don't know whether to persevere with XBOX, get refunded and go to the enemy, or ditch my ISP. &nbsp;Decisions, but something clearly aint right.</p>
<p>Thanks for the handholding, by the way. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hmm, that's quite a bit of disgusting I guess. But you're sure welcome, that's why we ambassadors are here ;)
</p>
<p>Heard of that issue with some users having troubles with dhcp, too, but unfortunately I do not remember if there is a solution on this yet. I do not think it's an ISP issue, more maybe some kind of router problem. If it was a problem with the ISP the wired
 solution would not work as well.</p>
<p>So let's get back to some troubleshooting: Have you checked for the alternate MAC adress? This often causes problems with WiFi. In such cases you are connected to xbl, are able to use apps like Netflix etc but are not able to connect to game servers. So
 I'd suggest to check for this entry and, if present, to delete it. </p>
<p>Further questions on this: </p>
<p>I guess your console is configured to obtain it's ip address from the router. What happens if you configure it manually? Any difference?
</p>
<p>Are you having any option to maybe try a different router to check if this works wirelessly?</p>
<p>Have you configured any portforwardings or DMZ settings for the One yet? As the wired and the wireless connection use different ips and macs this may cause problems when switching between the connection types.
</p>
<p>Pse do a multiplayer connection test. In the result screen please hold LT, LB, RT and RB to start the extended test. Wait until the detailed NAT status is displayed and post the results here.
</p>
<p>And just one final question for now, are you able to connect to live at all? If so, are you able to open any website with the Internet Explorer?

<p>Many thanks for these options, I'll try to give them all a go over the next day or so and get back to you here.</p>
<p>The configuration of the console is all factory default, I've not touched any of it (not entirely sure how to) &nbsp;and the MAC address, I think I asked my ISP to make sure that the router was not filtering the XBOX - they say they have done that (I wouldn't
 know in truth!). &nbsp;I checked the XBOX settings (as instructed) and there is a Wired MAC address and a Wireless MAC address which are different by two characters or so. &nbsp;I didn't realise that they were editable. &nbsp;Now when you say 'alternate MAC address' is that
 what you mean? &nbsp;Should those two addresses be the same, and the same as the wired one because that works?</p>
<p>I don't have access to any different routers. &nbsp;I might be able to take it round to a friend's house to check, but that might take a while to set up as we're all busy people.</p>
<p>The portforwardings I think have been done, the guy at MS gave me a detailed list of various ports which I asked the ISP to open on the router, the ISP people said this would fix it, they tried to do that twice, swear to me that these ports are open and
 correct, and still doesn't work.</p>
<p>On wireless connection, I don't even get the option to connect to Internet Explorer to check if that works, I can try that out on the wired connection, and will try all other things you suggest. &nbsp;On wireless I do not see the icon for any pins or apps at
 all, just the 'help logging into xbox live' panels.</p>
<p>I saw one suggestion on Virgin thread which said that the router settings had to be changed from 150meg to 'G&amp;B' which I might also try. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincere thanks for the help, the guys on the support phone line didn't seem to know what was going on, and seemed to be reading off sheets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's me thinking that if the XBOX 360 is happy, the One should work fine!</p>
<p>Anyways, I'll get back to you and thanks again.</p>

<p>I'll be here :)</p>
<p>Just two thoughts:</p>
<p>If the portforwardings are configured for the wired connection, the wireless connection will have massive problems, as it cannot use the already forwarded ports then. So this may be a major part of your problem.</p>
<p>The second on its again on the alternate MAC adress to give you some more understanding on this. Of course the MAC addresses of both network adapters have to be different. That's normal. But there is the possibility to alter the used Mac address at settings
 / network / advanced settings. Please do not try to configure a different address but at least hit delete once to have this cleared for sure.</p>
<p>Hope you get this sorted out, I'll be here for further assistance.</p>

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I tried a couple of things last night and I am very sad to report that it is still not working. &nbsp;I:</p>
<p>Went into the alternate MAC address bit and clicked clear. &nbsp;There was nothing in there anyway, but did just to make sure.</p>
<p>Added the XBOX wireless MAC address to the router's directory as a safe wifi device. &nbsp;Following a how to guide online specific to my router model.</p>
<p>Did the hold down all triggers and shoulder buttons after the multiplayer test (which, by the way said 'everything is fine') and got Detailed NAT Information: 'Your network is behind a cone NAT'</p>
<p>Status code 0x4000200004C.</p>
<p>Wireless strength: 77%</p>
<p>latency: 295ms</p>
<p>Download speed: 2.78 Mbps</p>
<p>Up: 0.76mbps</p>
<p>Packet loss: 1%</p>
<p>MTU: 1458</p>
<p>I followed advice from the Virgin forum from a user with exactly these symptoms with this router, and changed router wireless settings from '150meg' to 'g&amp;b'.</p>
<p>Power cycled XBOX, tried to connect to wireless.</p>
<p>Got "Everything is fine" you are connected. &nbsp;With renewed optimism, I tried to go back to homepage expecting to see XBL logos and pins. &nbsp;NADA.</p>
<p>And now the XBL error messages on the homepage say "Having trouble connecting? It may be a problem on our side. We are working on it"</p>
<p>Pins panel now says: 'Your pins are not available. Sorry about that. They should be back soon.'</p>
<p>Plugged the Ethernet cable back in. &nbsp;Power cycled XBOX again.</p>
<p>Full access to everything again, all well. &nbsp;Internet Explorer was actually pretty impressive, and Netflix booted up and worked first time, but this is with the hard wire.</p>
<p>Again, I don't think the problem was with Microsoft servers, as the panels say, because when I hard wired, it was perfect.</p>
<p>Are we swiftly running out of options here? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I could try the internet explorer over wireless, but I didn't last night because I was getting all the XBL error messages. &nbsp;Should I try that?</p>
<p>Rather frustrating situation.</p>
<p>Any further XBOX Ninja ideas?</p>
<p>Grateful again for your help.</p>

    <title>Selecting apps to open files while using Open with on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Selecting apps to open files while using Open with on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: selecting apps to open files</p>
<p>As is well-known, when right-clicking on a file in Explorer and selecting 'Open with', one is offered various apps to use.</p>
<br />
<p>By default, I open .jpg files with a viewer but sometimes wish to open them with an editor.&nbsp; On right-clicking such a file, the options given are IE, Paint or my default viewer.&nbsp; However, for editing I use PhotoScape which (as I expect is well-known) is
 a highly-functional free image editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like PhotoScape to appear as an option when I right-click on an image file and choose 'open with'.&nbsp; How can I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the 'look for another app' feature, but that is effective for the one time only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't suggest that I use any of the Windows Store apps - owing to an issue which Microsoft has been unable to resolve, I can't access Windows store, Photo viewer or any such app.&nbsp; I use a 3rd-party viewer for this reason, as well as to get more functionality
 than the basic Windows apps give.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We realize your requirement in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me confirm that the apps or application that appears in the list of Open with depends on the selection and there usage. Sadly, we don't
 have any manual option for forcing this change that makes that app appears in the Open with list.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Suggest you to try using the app for multiple time, when you make selection with the Open with to see if it automatically appears for the next
 time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep posted if you require further assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            Hello my name is Yohandi
<br />
<br />It is a pleasure to have your participation in the Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear that you are having problems after installing the operating system updates, my recommendation is to uninstall the latest updates installed on your computer today.
<br />
<br />How to uninstall the updates?
<br />1- In Cortana write&gt; "Updates" and select the entry "View installed updates".
<br />
<br />2- The "Installed Updates" window will open, where you can see each and every installed update
<br />
<br />3- Here, the next thing you should do is look for the latest installed updates and click on each of these with the right button. In the context menu we will see the option "Uninstall".
<br />
<br />4- Click on it and, after a few seconds, the update will be uninstalled from the system.
<br />
<br />5- Restart the computer and, when restarting, the problems should have disappeared.
<br />
<br />When detecting that the patch is not installed, Windows will try to download and install it again, so we must pay attention to prevent this from happening, at least until Microsoft solves the problems, something that may take a few days.
<br />
<br />To prevent Windows from installing updates again it is recommended to disable automatic updates.
<br />
<br />Any other additional thing, you can create a new question.
<br />
<br />I wish you an excellent day! ;)
<br />
<br />Hope this can help you       
        </p>

XAVC, as the newest HD recording format announced by Sony, employs MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 level 5.2, the highest picture
 resolution and frame rate video compression codec based on industry standards. XAVC can support 4K resolution (4096 × 2160 and 3840 × 2160) at up to 60 frames per second (fps), which provides stunning visual treat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, quite a few camcorders adapt 4K technology
 to shoot videos, such as Sony PMW-F55, PMW-F5, PMW-F5, etc. But if you want to edit 4k recordings in FCP, iMovie, Premiere, you maybe need help to cross the barrier.</span><br />
<br />
<span>"I'm working on a documentary with a lot of different cameras. One of those include the Sony z100, shooting in 4k XAVC. We are editing FCP 7, 23.98 Apple ProRes HQ, looking to finish in 2K.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it easier if I make new 4K ProRes 444 master and then transcode

            I looked around on the Internet to see what I could find out about that and it seems to have something to do with internal modems and stuff and might be some software installed with some company called Agere System which was a spin off of Lucent (I did
 not work on tracking it down too much).&nbsp; It may have been included with your system of unspecified make and model if your system has an internal modem.<br />
<br />
What is the issue you have with the software or is it just some annoying startup item you are not sure about?<br />
<br />
Anywho, if you are not sure what it is or if you need it or not, disable it and run your system for some days or weeks and if all your connectivity stuff works fine (Internet, Faxing, emails, etc.) then you can permanently remove it from your configuration
 so you don't have some unnecessary startup item cluttering up your configuration.&nbsp; A tidy system is a a happy system.<br />
<br />
If things don't work with it disabled, enable it again and do more research.<br />
<br />
You can read more about it here:<br />

<p>LTMSG.exe 7 is the Lucent (Agere) LT Data/Fax Modem driver for the PCI modem in some older HP Desktops</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not using the modem for anything you can set this to disabled in Services.msc</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply to my cry for help. &nbsp;I successfully completed all of the steps in your article. &nbsp;I also reloaded both Windows 10 and Incredimail, and ran SFC and DISM again. All good. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I still get the same error message when I try
 to run Incredimail, so I will learn to live without it until Windows XX or Incredimail XX is released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to add a comment to your Wiki article, but was told that it is locked for comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

<br />
The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.<br />
<br />
15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.<br />
<br />
So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.<br />

    <title>Using an SD card as a library in WMP 12 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jess_01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using an SD card as a library in WMP 12</h2>
                    <p>I have an SD card I use in my basic phone for music.&nbsp; I added it to my WMP12 in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I can now see the songs on it as duplicates of everything in my WMP library, but I cannot play them, drag them to a playlist, or anything.&nbsp; I really wanted to create
 playlists in WMP rather than tediously do it on the phone, but can't figure out how.&nbsp;&nbsp; My goal would be&nbsp;to organize playlists in WMP then reinsert the microSD in my phone and play from there.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did manage to save a playlist in M3U format, and it shows once
 the chip is inserted in my phone, but none of the songs show.&nbsp; The playlist looks empty.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to play a song off the microSD card I get this error code:&nbsp; Windows Media Player cannot find the file. If you are trying to play, burn, or sync an item that is in your library, the item might point to a file that has been moved, renamed, or deleted.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, somehow the player is reading the card, because the songs and their info show in the library.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; I am open to trying something new like the MUSIC app as well, but don't see how to save playlists to any certain location with it.&nbsp; Thank you for any help.</p>

<p>I was having the same problem, and i have just figured out how to get rid of it. basically you just delete all its files.</p>
<p>First step is to go to task manager (Alt+Ctrl+Delete), select the "processes" tab, and search that for Veoh, when you find it, end process. This will allow you to delete it.</p>
<p>Next, open a search window and search your computer for "Veoh", the main folder to delete should be in your programs folder, however using the search means you find all the menu items and stuff. Delete anything that is found that has the word "Veoh" (sometimes
 the search will bring up files that has veoh as part of the name i.e asdfklh<strong>veoh</strong> asdf.txt or something, you probably dont want to deleted these in case they are necessary for another program).</p>
<p>And your done! no more veoh.</p>
<p>Hope this works for you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry for the inconvenience.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand, the issue is “You are unable to install KB2756872 update ". Am I correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the issue specific to the mentioned update?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:
</strong>Run <strong>“Windows Update troubleshooter”</strong> to diagnose the exact issue.
</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press “Windows key + w” from the keyboard.</p>
<p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “Troubleshooting” without quotes in the search box.</p>
<p>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select “View all” option from the left panel.</p>
<p>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Then select “Windows Update” option from the list and follow the onscreen instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:
</strong>Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.
</p>
<p>Follow the steps:</p>
<p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press “Windows Key + Q” to open Charms Bar.</p>
<p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “cmd” without quotes in the search box.</p>
<p>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select “Run as Administrator”.</p>
<p>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “sfc /scannow” without quotes and hit enter.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:
</b>It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:
</span></b><span>Manually download and install the update from here:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34908</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information helps. If you need further assistance, please reply. We will be happy to help you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for that but unfortunately it didn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue is only specifically to the update KB2756872.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just upgraded from windows 7 and I have made no changes to my computer other than upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried all the solutions you outlined but still the updated failed with the same error code 8E5E0147</p>

                    <p>On my Windows 7, after installation of version 8, skype can't be launched at all.&nbsp; No problem was found with dxdiag or sfc/scannow</p>
<p>I found my IE 11 lacked an update and removed IE 11.&nbsp; Afterwards, skype login windows appeared. After I reinstall IE 11 and all the Windows 7 updates, skype could not be launched again. This time even after uninstallation of IE 11, it still could not be
 launched.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
