<h2>            Win10 dont let get to bios settings and boot any other OS even Win8</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>Yesterday I tried to reset Win10 pc and meet a problem. There was a 10240 build which updated from 10166. Windows 10 SDK doesn't work properly on this system so I try make s system reset. My system has a problem - it cant install windows while second hdd
 is plugged in. I forget yo unplug second drive while Windows reset so installation is failed without any included in system restoration abilities. So, I supposed that if I had to be an insider, I can somehow restore my activation. I create a bootable usb with
 Win10 and perform clean install.</p>
<p>After that, I found I cant restore my insider activation. Little sad but a have an Win8. I tried install it but all my attempts are failed.</p>
<p>Looks like win10 take control over booting pc. Now I cant get to bios settings or use any bootable drive, if there other system than win10.</p>
<p>Situation with bios look like this: screen "hello from pc, press f2 to enter bios setup". You press f2, there is label that settings are loading. After that screen blinks and win10 begin to booting. If remove primary hdd - system cant even start - black
 screen abd working cooler. Other hdd - same situation. No hdd + insert flash drive with win10 - setup begin to booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like I cant format primary hdd and cant install win8 to get activation. What should or can I do in this situation (except bying a new copy, I was an insider + has activated copy of Win8 previously to insider build)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, after reinstalling of win10, "boot from usb" option disappear from advanced troubleshooting blue menu. Win10 catch me like a hostage and make me buy new copy of it</p>

            <p>Hi PoMa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to create a bootable USB using the media creation tool from a different PC and then restart the PC with the bootable USB and check if you are able to access the recovery option. You can download the media creation tool from the following
 link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose the option to create a bootable USB drive and then insert the USB in the PC with the issue. Restart the PC and then check if you get an option to boot from the USB when you restart. Try these steps and let us know the results.</p>

            after a day somehow usb with win8 booted, so I could format primary drive and install win8. Unfortunately, bios settings are still unavailable. I updated win8 to win10 with media creation app. In win 10 recovery menu item "boot from usb" is missing. I
 suppose the problem is happen when win10 during install try flash its own code in my bios - I somewhere read this happens on efi systems

<h2>            Upgrade Keep Nothing activation Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a PC currently running Windows 8.1 pro activated and would like upgrade it to Windows 10 pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the setup from the Windows Media Creation tool and I was given 3 choices before installing:</p>
<p>- Keep all personal files, apps, and settings</p>
<p>- Keep personal files only</p>
<p>- Keep nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I choose "Keep nothing", will Windows 10 be automatically activated after the installation?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have tried the "keep all personal files, apps, and settings" and "keep files only" options, but they both failed to install (blue screen on the first reboot with an error and reverted back to windows 8.1).</p>

                    <p>I installed an Oracle VirtualBox on my Windows laptop and then installed Ubuntu on the VirtualBox for a project I am working on. The VirtualBox screen said&nbsp; 'FATAL: No bootable medium found - system halted'. I uninstalled the VirtualBox and re-installed.
 I got the same FATAL statement. I uninstalled the VirtualBox and decided to delete all the remaining VirtualBox and Ubuntu folders so do the installation on a clean slate. Somehow I am unable to delete 'ubuntu-16.04.4-desktop-amd64' from my download folder.
 I keep getting a box with the following messages:</p>
<p>'File in Use'</p>
<p>'The action can't be completed because the file is open in System'</p>
<p>'Close the file and try again'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed a search for ubuntu on my windows explorer, so I can delete the files and folders individually. It won't allow me to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Why can't I remove 'ubuntu-16.04.4-desktop-amd64' from my download folder?</p>

<h2>            Assassins Creed Syndicate Achievment not unlocking&#63; Royal Correspondance Letters</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so yesterday i had to play Assassins Creed Syndicate offline due to an area outage of sky internet which is who i am with. I was going around collecting the last few Letters of the Royal Correspondence. It came up in the game that i had collected all
 of them and i&nbsp;was awarded the Emerald Isle Cape. When i was able to get back online and connect to Xbox Live, i started the game but the achievement&nbsp;did not pop.Ive even tried equipping the cape to see if that would make the game recognize have collected all
 the letters. I dont&nbsp;know if its glitched or what but because of this its broke my achievement streak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to do. I hate that the achievements cant pop while you play offline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you cant move the files. To isolate the issue, we would like you to answer the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you closed or turn off the application before copying the files? </li><li>What device are you using? </li><li>Is this happening only on a specific file?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response. </p>

            Thank you for the response, but how would I turn off this application? I am using a pc specialist optimus 8 running windows 10. And yes this is happening to other files but I have been able to work around that.

<h2>            How to upgrade Windows10 from 32 bit to 64bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have Dell Inspiron 15 3542 laptop. I have now upgraded the OS from Windows 7 32 bit to Windows 10 pro. Now my touch pad is not working in it. When I checked in Dell sites they recommended me to upgrade my OS to 64 bit as it is proven to work. Could
 anyone let me know how to convert my 32 bit Windows 10 to 64 bit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I understand the inconvenience you are facing. I will certainly help you with this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also update the touchpad driver from Device Manager manually and check if this helps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press (Windows key + X) and click on ‚ÄúDevice Manager‚Äù.</span></li><li><span>Expand ‚ÄúTouchpad Driver‚Äù or&nbsp;‚ÄúSynaptic Touchpad Driver‚Äù.</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Right click on the drivers and select ‚ÄúUpdate Driver Software‚Äù. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>If issue persist, I suggest you to try installing it in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows. Follow these steps to install the drivers
 in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Download the touchpad or&nbsp;Synaptic Touch pad drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Right-click on the driver setup file and click on <strong>‚ÄòProperties‚Äô</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong>‚ÄòCompatibility‚Äô</strong> tab and check the box <strong>
‚ÄòRun this program in compatibility mode for‚Äô</strong> and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>To migrate from 32 bit OS to 64 bit; if you have max 3 GBs of RAM, then 32 bit should be sufficient for your needs. If you happen to have 4 to 8 GBs or more RAM, then 64 bit would be suitable.
<span>&nbsp;</span>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more information, I suggest you to refer to the below given Wiki article by Andre Da Costa and check if it helps:</span></p>

<h3> jason brown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Email account disappears after reboot using roaming profiles</h2>
                    <p>After setting up an email account in live email and testing it works, after a reboot of the PC and logging in as same user, windows live has lost the account. &nbsp;We are using folder redirection on most things such as documents, pictures, desktop etc. the users
 have roaming profiles. &nbsp;In order to keep things tidy, roaming profiles are set to delete on log off via gpo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that WLM creates files in the local folder which is getting deleted due to roaming profile cleanup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is is their a way to use WLM with roaming profiles or is this not possible ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows 7 PCs and windows server 2012 essentials are the OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in anticipation.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Windows Live Mail forum. From what I understand, your PC&nbsp;is configured using Roaming profiles where every time you log off your PC, downloaded files were deleted. If I get this right, Windows Live Mail downloaded emails from your account server
 and saved it locally. Since Windows Live Mail files were deleted when you log off, what you can do is to contact your IT and you can ask them to make an exemption&nbsp;on Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Helene C.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's what I'm saying in my post - the GPO deletes roaming profiles on logoff. &nbsp;We don't want to change this. &nbsp;Looking into it further, mail and account settings are stored in the user\username\local folder and when that user logs off, the local, locallow
 and roaming are deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fear that web based mail may be the only option !</p>

<p>Some people have multiple accounts that they may or may not be aware of. Logging in with your Skype name vs. your email address may sign you into completely different accounts. The reactivate banner is located in your Skype account when checking&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My
 account</a>&nbsp;from Skype.com. Usually you will receive an e-mail telling you exactly what name or email address has the deactivated credit. If you do not sign into the same exact account that has the credit deactivated, you will not see the banner. Be sure to
 sign out of the current/wrong account then sign into the correct one. The banner is similar to the below:<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not see this, you are probably not signed into the correct account or your credit has not expired yet. If you click the image above, it will get you to the Reactivate Skype credit page. If the account you are currently signed into has
 no deactivated credit, it will just display your current balance with expiration (if there is a balance). If you are still unable to locate your credit, I suggest you&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact

<p>1. I only have one Skype name and one account. One computer, one person, one landline, no cell phone. No social networking. Don't do anything online which can be done offline. Use Skype only offline (from my PC).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When Skype merged with MS, my Desktop icon would no longer open my Desktop Skype. It insisted I go log in to MICROSOFT online. I spent HOURS on the phone with both Skype and MS getting rid of anything that could be considered additional Skype accounts,
 which I am told are <em>automatically created any time you sign in with an email</em>!!! At that time, one could ONLY log in to Skype with an email, so there was no way to sign in with a skype name.....:-(....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Since the time they swore to me that I now had only one Skype account, I have never signed in with my email. I just stopped using Skype for anything which required going online and logging in via email (did not allow for logging in with Skype name--required
 "valid email").&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. In answer to your question, I simply clicked on the email link. It took me straight to 'My Account' without asking me to log in. According to the profile, the skype name listed is "<span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">live:647ec568bc6c87d8"!&nbsp;</span>I
 never used Skype online except when I had to in order to put money in my skype account (janetb11).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I logged out of that account just now and this time was able to log in with my Skype name and activate the credit. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Questions:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>a. What is that "<span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">live:647ec568bc6c87d8"&nbsp;</span>account???</p>
<p>b. Why did the email link go straight to that account (without requiring me to log in) if the credit was not there but rather in the janetb11 account?</p>
<p>c. Which account is my Desktop PC account linked to?? Both? If I get rid of "<span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">live:647ec568bc6c87d8</span>"
 will I lose contacts and other data?</p>
<p>d. When logging in, why does it not show me the choice of two accounts? The login dropdown used to list all accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<h2>            How to Add a .jnlp &#40;java&#41; App to Windows 10 Start Menu&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a brokerage trading platform (Merrill Lynch Edge's MarketPro) that was just upgraded to a desktop product (as opposed to launching from my IE11 browser) -- so I no longer have to have Java enabled in my browser (that's good). &nbsp;I have created a desktop
 shortcut for it, so I can now launch it from the desktop without my browser being involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the App still needs Java and for some reason, the extension on the upgraded App is .jnlp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not figure out how to get this App shortcut into my Windows 10 Start Menu. &nbsp;I have a couple of other trading platforms in my start menu, but they are .exe files and I think I read that you can only add .exe Apps to the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know how I can add the .jnlp App to my Start Menu.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the latest java installed -- that is not the problem -- it loads and runs properly when I log in and launch it within my Merrill Lynch account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually have two problems (I just discovered):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When I launch it afte logging in to my Merrill Lynch account, I am given the option Run or Save. &nbsp;Run Works and Save works -- except after I Save it and then Send an icon to my desktop, the program will not run. &nbsp;This is the secondary problem I just discovered.
 &nbsp;I had not tried that before I posted this note (i.e. Merrill Lynch just offered this new App on Monday). &nbsp;When launched from the shortcut (or double clicking), it fails to run with some sort of "Your session parameters are invalid" error. &nbsp;Since this is a
 new (in the sense it is intended to be a desktop launch), it may be Merrill Lynch problem unless Windows has some sort of a problem with a .jnlp file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) &nbsp;However, my original post was about getting the App, the Shortcut, whatever into my Windows 10 Start menu -- "just right-clicking on the program" does not work -- there is no "Pin to Start" offering in the drop-down list. &nbsp;I think the problem is as I
 mentioned in my original post -- like it is a problem BECAUSE it is not an .exe file. &nbsp;When I right-click on other file types (i.e. &nbsp;.pdf, .docx, etc.) the Pin to Start is not offered there either -- the ONLY file type that offers me a Pin to Start are the
 .exe file types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So do you have additional advice on either of these problems, particularly #2.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have already contacted Merrill Lynch about this problem (unable to launch their MarketPro product from my desktop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this still does not answer my original post -- which is essentially, how do I get a shortcut to appear in my Windows 10 Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is what is in the Start Menu, isn't it, essentiallty shortcuts. &nbsp;What is so special about the Start Menu that prevents or restricts what can be placed there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know, it is a small point, but the reason I want the MarketPro shortcut in my Start Menu is that often the shortcut on my desktop is often covered up by running Apps whereas icons in the Start Menu are always available without disturbing my desktop display.</p>

                    <p>Hello out there. I am in dire need of expert help.<br />
<br />
I have two desktops running Windows 8.1 Pro x64. In one of them, Windows Update <br />
KB2973201 is failing to install. (I have installed at least two other&nbsp; updates after this,
</p>
<p>so the problem is not related to Windows Update not working.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>The KB2973201 update can be initially installed, either when I use </p>
<p>Control Panel/Windows Update/Select Updateor when I<br />
install it manually, using the file downloaded from Microsoft -- I have <br />
verified this using Control Panel/Windows Update/View Update History:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>KB2973201 appears as installed "pending restart". <br />
<br />
After&nbsp;rebooting the system, however, Control Panel/Windows Update/View Update <br />
History shows "status failed" for KB2973201. Details for the failure are like this
</p>
<p>(I have tried to install KB2973201 many, many times):</p>

</p><p>After running the Windows Update Troubleshooter, I rebooted and tried to <br />
reinstall KB2973201, with same results -- installed pending restart and,<br />
after rebooting, installation failed. It seems that something corrupt <br />

<p>was preventing the installation of KB2973201 during reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resorting to Microsoft forums and Eight Forums, I found a suggestion </p>
<p>to <strong>runsfc /scannow</strong> on an elevated command prompt to solve problems</p>
<p>with Windows Update. I did it and the result was:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <strong>Dism /online /cleanup-Image /CheckHealth</strong><br />

<ul>
<li><strong>sfc /scannow</strong> still fails at 23% with the same error message in the log;</li><li><strong>DISM </strong>does not report any corruption in the component store;</li><li><strong>KB2973201 </strong>still fails to install upon rebooting.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I am totally baffled and cannot find any other suggestions in any forum. I would greatly appreciate if

            I've also had this issue for a while now and have been unable to tether despite attempting your suggested fixes.
<div><br />
<div>Could you clarify what the error code 5aa refers to exactly? Not only do I receive this error code when getting the "Insufficient resources" error when trying to install/update my Motorola Networking Interface driver but the same error code appeared recently
 when I tried installing the most recent version of my tether app which gave me the exact same error code although instead of "Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service" it was in response to&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>"</span>UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices err=5aa".</div>
<div><br />
<div>I could only resolve this by installing an older version. I believe that understanding this error code would best identify the source of this problem.</div>

            None of those Microsoft Support Engineer suggestions will help you, but they will consume large amounts of your time.<br />
<br />
Please post a link to this answer <span>from Marilyn Microsoft Answers Support Engineer</span> that involved some maybe registry changes to I can see that too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Older versions of PowerDesk Pro 7.x&nbsp; are known to cause Explorer to crash, so that sounds about right.<br />
<br />
The current version of PowerDesk Pro is 8.5.<br />
<br />
You <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> be able to get the old version to behave by disabling the PowerDesk shell extensions one at a time until when you right click, Explorer no longer crashes.&nbsp; This will leave you with some limited PowerDesk functionality
 since those afflicted extensions will be disabled, but you may not need those extensions to do whatever it is you need PowerDesk to do.<br />
<br />
I would start with the <span style="font-style: italic">PowerDesk ZIP</span> shell extension (I already know about that one).<br />
<br />
This is a shortened and edited version from my notes about using ShellExView (since you already suspect PowerDesk):<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView, under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move the Microsoft column closer
 to the top so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header for Microsoft to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.<br />
<br />
The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
For example, you might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; XP explorer crashing&nbsp; (you have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the suspicious non Microsoft extensions one at a time keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your failure condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to behave, you will know which extension is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.<br />
<br />
Remember - disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled so you can always enable it again.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again.&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.&nbsp; You can then start to reenable other extensions to zero in on the extension(s) that are
 causing your crash<br />
<br />
If the cause of your crash is a third party application or program, their may be a later version of the program available that corrects the issue.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list.<br />
<br />

            <p>Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp;(this includes plug pulling, power buttons and battery removal).</p>
<p>These can cause corruption in the file system which must be fixed before you do anything&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>If any of those events have occurred (or even if they have not occurred), you should verify&nbsp;the integrity of your file system before doing anything else (especially "trying" things).</p>
<p>It makes zero sense to start trying to start trying to edit or copy files around on a hard disk that has a corrupted&nbsp;file system so this must be fixed first using the XP chkdsk program, and running chkdsk on your&nbsp;drives may resolve your issue entirely. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be all you need to do. &nbsp;Or, you are welcome to&nbsp;just start trying things that might work.</p>
<p>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>

<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

    <title>Cannot install and set up Media Center Extender on Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drake1132  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install and set up Media Center Extender on Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but it seemed the most relevant and likely spot given the limited options among the community support forum titles and descriptions.</p>
<p>My problem is this:&nbsp; I recently reset my computer to factory default settings, which removed my media center extender for the Xbox 360 along with everything else.&nbsp; I've gotten my system back up and programs installed and configured, and I'm trying to connect
 my Xbox 360 to the system via Windows Media Center Extender for Xbox 360 so that I can watch videos and listen to music from my PC on the Xbox and the TV connected to it.&nbsp; This all worked perfectly when I had it set up before the computer reset/restore to
 factory defaults, and when I had set it up the last time I had no problems.&nbsp; This time, I cannot get it to work at all.</p>
<p>When I run the Media Center program to add an extender, I type in the setup key as displayed on the Xbox, and click next.&nbsp; It either fails to find the extender that should be configured, even though all of my security software is temporarily and completely
 disabled, or it finds it and attempts to configure it but gives me an error that it failed.&nbsp; It does not give any information as to why it failed, or what it was trying to do (other than the fact that the section on configuring the extender had not received
 a check mark).&nbsp; It does offer me the option of viewing online help, which I've done, and I've done everything listed there to no avail.</p>
<p>On 2 or 3 attempts I received a message from windows that it detected new hardware and it was trying to install drivers for the Windows Media Center Extender, but driver installation fails, I have found no place on the internet to manually download new copies
 of the drivers to try and place a fresh copy in my system drivers folders.&nbsp; Most of the time it does not appear to even attempt to install the drivers.&nbsp; Device manager does not display any unknown or unworking devices, nor does it display any Xbox Extender
 or Windows Media Center Extender entries.</p>
<p>Other posts around the internet have suggested connecting directly to the Xbox itself with an Ethernet cable (I was connecting via WiFi), which I tried, and still the exact same results.</p>
<p><br />
I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium on an HP Pavilion dv7 laptop.&nbsp; I'm running Comodo Internet Security as both antivirus and Firewall.&nbsp; As I mentioned, my security software is disabled, and I have double-checked that Windows Firewall and Windows Defender are
 both also disabled.&nbsp; I have also added the various allowances and exceptions manually to Comodo anyway (as per the online help section regarding possible connection problems), as I plan to have it re-enabled while running the media center extender (if I can
 ever get it working).&nbsp; The Xbox 360 itself is fully updated.</p>
<p>I really need some help here.&nbsp; I can't understand why it was working so perfectly prior to resetting my system, but now is not working at all.&nbsp; I'd appreciate any intelligent suggestions on what else I can try.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>Drake</p>

<h2>            wifi won&#39;t turn on  windows 10</h2>
                    <p>hey everybody</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have issues with my new HP pavilion (upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10). When i put my computer back on from sleeping mode, it's wifi is turned off and i can't put it back on. Also when i go to network settings: if i wan't to put it on with the button,
 it automaticly puts itself back off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried &nbsp;to type the code 'reg delete HKCR\CLSID......../f' &nbsp;in the prompt but that didn't help, also the code ' netcfg -v -u dni_dne ' did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i would like to keep working with windows 10, so i don't really like to go back to windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>does anyone know what i need to do?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            BSOD in Win 10 - SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has been crashing when I boot to safe mode (only when in safe mode, normal boot is completely OK) after I use Acronic to recover my Partition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cause by snapman.sys</p>
<p>The following file necessary for Windows startup was corrupt: c:\boot\efi\winsipolicy.p7b</p>

            As you said you have completed the recovery, uninstall Acronis temporarily to check if the crashes persist. The reason being, snapman is a part of Acronis.

            That Blue Screen is caused by snapman.sys, which is part of Acronis Snapshots Manager.
<br />
<br />Therefore uninstalling Acronis will resolve the problem.
<br />
<br />If you still need to use Acronis, try downloading the newest version from their website!

<p>Press the sync button on the front of the controller and the sync button on the console to see if it will reconnect.</p>

</p><p>Not sure why but I am no longer getting an error message.&nbsp; Now no action is occurring at all.&nbsp; Whether I right click on a file and request to send it via email or go to Share in file explorer and click on email,&nbsp; no error messages nor any action occurs.&nbsp;
 I executed the app trouble shooter to see if this would fix the issue but no change. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Are you able to use the Mail app and File Explorer without problems otherwise? The issue might be related to the app itself although at this point, we are unsure as to which app is faulty. To help us out, we suggest that you reset the Mail and Calendar app
 through Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Apps</strong>, and then <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.</li><li>Scroll down and locate <strong>Mail and Calendar</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Mail and Calendar</strong>, and then select <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Storage usage and app reset</strong>, click on <strong>Reset</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Additional troubleshooting that you can try is to perform a clean boot, and to create another user account to check if the issue exists specifically on the current account that you're using. Below are support articles for your reference:</p>
<p>

            Have you performed a clean boot and created a new user as suggested in our previous reply? If you haven't, kindly do so. It will help us to further isolate the issue. If you have already done so, did the issue persist?
