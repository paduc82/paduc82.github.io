<h2>            Import contacts from Outlook 2007 &#40;csv file&#41; to Outlook.com - multiple contacts created</h2>
                    I just got started using Outlook Web App as part of Office 365 Preview. I exported my contacts from Outlook 2007 to a csv file, and let Outlook.com "import" them. What I ended up with is HORRENDOUS - there seems to be several "contacts" for each record
 - one has "Name Not Available", another has the email address for the name, another has the phone number - I can't tell who anybody is. How do I delete ALL of the "contacts" from Outlook.com so I can start over?

            Thanks Diane - but I have NO idea what you're referring to. To the best of my knowledge, there is no "Outlook connector" in connection with Office 365. It is not mentioned anywhere in the setup instructions (I'm the account admin - you'd think they would
 mention it if it was relevant...). The very basic link says "Import your contacts" and provides little guidance - just the usual "Export a csv file" from Outlook - no mapping of fields, no filtering of contacts, no preview. So I figured it was smart enough
 to actually import a contact - but NOT - it created this horrible gobbledygook in my online account. Now I need to know how to get rid of all that junk from Outlook.com - I refuse to delete 1 "contact" at a time from 2500+ rows.
<div><br />
<div>It's taken me a while to actually get started with Office 365 - I had a beta account a couple of years ago, but couldn't really see the value. I'm using it with a family domain/e-mail accounts in order to get a bit more control on my e-mail than your usual
 ISP - but I'm not sure it's worth it so far.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know if you have any suggestions I can apply to my situation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <p>Are you using Outlook.com or Office 365 hosted Exchange email? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming outlook.com (formerly Hotmail) - Do you still have Outlook 2007 installed?&nbsp;(It's not uninstalled when you install the trial of Office 2013 click to run).&nbsp;You can use the connector in Outlook 2007 to upload the contacts - no importing/exporting -
 just copy from one folder to another. You can use it to delete the&nbsp;contacts already on outlook.com too. &nbsp;</p>

            Diane,
<div><br />
<div>Is there another choice? Actually, I'm using Office 365 but in POP3 mode, not Exchange (although I assume there's an Exchange server running it all). It's pretty hard to tell the difference between Office 365 and Outlook.com online. However, I guess I
 have an Outlook.com address for Outlook.com, but use my own domain for Office 365, which is where I have the problem. So, that said, any suggestions for how I clean up my Contacts list on Office 365, now that it's been clobbered by the mishandled import from
 Outlook 2007? I'd like to be able to use the web app when I'm not on my desktop, and also to use the contacts list for spam filtering (although Office 365 is doing way better than my old e-mail service provider).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

            <p>If you are paying $4 or more monthly&nbsp;for email account with Office 365, then you have any exchange account.&nbsp; Log in address is
<a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.microsoftonline.com/</a> and the web app address is something like
<a href="https://pod51042.outlook.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pod51042.outlook.com/owa</a>&nbsp;(the POD part varies)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why aren't you using Exchange mode? You'll have fewer problems and a better experience.&nbsp; You won't need to import contacts into the web app - add the account to Outlook 2007, drag or copy the contacts from the POP3 folder set to the Exchange folders. When
 you use Exchange, changes you make in Outlook sync up to the server and are almost instantly available in web access, smartphones, and other devices.

            Thanks, Diane. Just to confirm, I do have an Exchange Account as you describe it. My rationale for not using Exchange mode is that I have multiple e-mail accounts, most of which are served by conventional POP3 servers. Using POP3 mode lets me manage my
 Office 365 e-mail in the same way as the other accounts, and applies my sorting rules on receipt, etc. For some reason, when I first connected in Exchange mode, ALL of my sorting rules were erased - I have been unable to retrieve them. I suppose I should have
 exported them in advance of adding the Exchange account, but who knew? Then I realized that the Exchange account would operate quite differently from my existing POP3 accounts with respect to sorting rules, which I really depend on to prioritize my e-mail
 flow. So, I switched back to POP3 mode, and it's working very well (as I rebuild each of my rules).
<div><br />
<div>None of which addresses the issue at hand, which is that following MS recommendation to export Outlook contacts to a csv file and import them to Exchange has created a mess of my online contacts folder, and I don't see any way to clean it out other than
 deleting the bad records one at a time. I suppose I could connect in Exchange mode from a different PC and see if the Outlook client could do a mass delete - but there really should be a way to manage contacts online in some sort of batch mode.</div>

            <p>The old rules were in the pst file used by the pop account - when you added exchange, it was set as the default data file, so no rules,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do this: Create a second profile with just the exchange account and the pst file that has the contacts. Copy the contacts to the exchange contact folder (and calendar if needed). Close Outlook, restart using your normal profile.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know why the import from a CSV didn't work, but it's really not a good way to move Outlook data between outlook and exchange. The native Outlook format is much better.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exchange would give you a better experience and if setup right, will be almost what you are used to.&nbsp; The "almost" is if you are using one pst file for all accounts - with exchange you either need 2 data file (exchange and a pst) or deliver all mail to the
 exchange box. </p>

<p>Thank You for the reply.</p>
<p>The formula works fine. it returns the miles between the two points.</p>
<p>No issues there.</p>
<p>Not sure what a UDF is?</p>
<p>The miles program is PC Miler</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always just copy and paste the values right on top of the existing cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used this program and method for a few years, even worked fine yesterday, just not his morning.</p>

 Get Data/From File/From Workbook. Then in the pop up window, I select the first worksheet (tab) that the data is on, then click "Load To" button. On the next pop up window, I select "Only Create Connection" and check "Add this data to the Data Model".&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then I am going to the Power Pivot Window where I add the second workbook by clicking on "From Other Data" in the "Get External
 Data" section, selecting "Excel Files" at the bottom and going through the steps to select the correct table. However, I am never sure that Excel is adding that second file to the data model. Then in Power Pivot, I am adding columns, measures, and relationships
 between the files. Next, I click out of Power Pivot, and I never feel confident that my changes are being saved or added to the model since there is no message or dialogue to indicate that.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After that, I go back to my worksheet where I am creating the data model and bring up Queries and Connections. There I only see
 the first worksheet I imported listed under queries. Under Connections, I see listed ThisWorkBookDataModel and the second worksheet that I imported. I right click on ThisWorkBookDataModel, Properties, Definition, Export Connection File. When the Explorer windows
 pops up, I change the file name to "TestNewModel" and hit save.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After that, I create the new workbook where I want to use the saved datamodel, and I go to Get and Transform Data. From there,
 I click on "Get Data Using Existing Connections". In the pop up screen, I see "ThisWorkBookDataModel" under Connections on this Computer, but nothing with the name of TestNewModel, I saved earlier. (After repeating the test three times, I saw three "ThisWorkBookDataModel"
 datamodels listed with identical names.) After I click on that, I always get the same error message:</span><br />
<div style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<em>Unable to open or read this connection file. Either the file has been damaged or the format is not valid.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</em></div>

<p>Thank you, but strictly speaking, my goal is not to use it as a template. My goal is to create a data model and use it in multiple workbooks that might not look anything like the original except to use the same data model.</p>

<h2>            files lost when editing in photo gallery</h2>
                    <p>files lost when editing in photo gallery</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a windows 7 PC, a windows 8.1 PC and a Windows 10 PC. ...<br />
...&nbsp;&nbsp; Log in on the same account on all three PC's <br />
Create a folder in onedrive on one machine.<br />
Put 12 pictures in it<br />
Open explorer on all three and view/monitor the folder with the 12 pictures.<br />
!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; DON'T TOUCH THE WINDOWS 10 PC, just watch it !!!!!<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><br />
On the windows 7 PC run photo Gallery and one at a time, crop each picture and exit the picture&nbsp; editor. It will automaticly save each picture (jpg)
<br />
Watch to verify it gets synced. <br />
------------------------<br />
By the time you have edited all 12 pictures, several of them will have dissapeared.<br />
Some will dissapear 3 or four minutes after you have done absolutely nothing for 5 minutes.<br />
----------------------<br />
The files simply vanish. FROM EVERY MACHINE!</p>
<p>Now go to the windows 10 machine.<br />
Open the trash bin,<br />
&nbsp;!!! THERE ARE ALL THE PICTURES !!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without touching the win 10&nbsp;PC it&nbsp;eats files. Note: I simply open the trash can on the 10 machine and select all the files and restore them, After a few minutes the edited (cropped) files show up on all three machines, compliments of OneDrive. I must have
 cropped some pictures 3 or four time, only to have them vanish, It was just luck that I happened to find them in the trash on the 10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this happen?</p>

            <p>I should add, I am not running McAfee or ANY non MS provided software..</p>
<p>The 8 and 10 machines have only the built in protection. The 7 machine is using MS security essentials and the windows defender and firewall.</p>
<p>All three machines are up to date.</p>
<p>All three use the latest OneDrive for it's OS.</p>
<p>Files do not disappear if&nbsp;edited in a local folder that is not synced by OneDrive.</p>
<p>If I turn off the windows 10 PC, the problem does not show up until I bring the 10 machine back up. Then some, but not all files disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have hidden files set to show them, so advice found on other threads did not apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not on any machine if I search for them. They are not in the trash can of the 7 or 8.1 machine, They are only in the trash can of the 10 machine.</p>

<h2>            3 finger reset- how to get back my store and maps&#63;</h2>
                    I did a 3 finger reset to get rid of the problem with social and Nokia maps check in app. As a result I lost Nokia store and Nokia maps (along with several other apps which I can easily install again) altogether. Several of my attempts to re download store
 have fallen flat.I downloaded the Nokia store qml from bela labs. It tries to install upto almost the end and then says "unable to install". Seems something is missing. How shall I get my store back?

<h3> emma_atrium  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does the freeze pane funtion lock the view I have of the spreadsheet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need to lock Rows 1-5 and Columns A-O in order to have one large 'pinned' row of titles, in order to see all of these titles I have to scroll across the screen.&nbsp; However when I select the cell&nbsp;M6 and the 'freeze panes' section although the correct rows
 are now selected&nbsp;the window/view of the spread sheet become locked&nbsp;so that I can no longer scroll back to Column A.&nbsp; If I zoom out before apply the freeze pane function so that I can see the full title row I seem to be able to override this function and see
 the whole title...however I need to be able to view the document at 75/100% in order to edit it so this is pointless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the help sections I have looked through in Excel do not mention or offer solution to this 'quirk' in the upgrade so I would be grateful for any advice...thank you.</p>

            Unfortunately, that behavior is 'by design' as the phrase&nbsp;<em>Freeze Panes</em> would indicate. If you cannot see enough of the worksheet at your desired zoom level you might want to experiment with the&nbsp;<em>Data, Outline, Group</em> command in order to
 quickly hide one or more columns from A:O or perhaps simply freeze the top 5 rows, not the top 5 rows and 15 columns.<br />
<br />
Please accept this in the spirit that it is offered but this 'short-coming' does not seem to be Excel or your workbook design so much as the limitations offered by your screen and screen orientation. While a larger wide-screen would temporarily resolve your
 current issue, that 'fix' would only last until more columns were added to the 'frozen' set.

            <p>Answers to above questions:<br />
<br />
#1&nbsp;I've been&nbsp;using Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; Was using Windows 7 with IE 11, and it worked fine then.&nbsp; Using IE at work, with windows 7, and it works fine there.<br />
<br />
#2 I have all the boxes checked (except Feeds)&nbsp;in the AutoComplete section in settings.<br />
<br />
I reloaded IE and everything has now&nbsp;returned to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll continue to check Microsoft Edge from time to time, to see if the AutoComplete is working, but for now, I think I'll stick with IE11.</p>

            The autocomplete feature of Microsoft Edge still isn't working, but&nbsp;I've reinstalled Internet Explorer 11 and that is working well.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are&nbsp;several things about Edge that I don't like, so I'll continue to use IE11 for as long as I can.&nbsp; Hopefully that
 will be a long time!

<h2>            how do I stop daily viagra emails&#63;</h2>
                    I keep getting Viagra emails etc every single day and have added them to blocked senders, but this has only stopped the ones already received, they use hundreds of email addresses. I tried to use the "Reporting junk email" feature only there isn't one!
 Any ideas?

Create a rule such that when the email contains "viagra" move it to the deleted folder.<br />
<br />
To get to rules go to the gear on the right more mail settings&gt;customizing outlook&gt;creating rules.<br />

<h2>            Annoying pop up message after successful renewal of Office 365 subscription</h2>
                    I just renewed my subscription to Office 365 Home. I followed the instructions and the necessary files were successfully installed on my laptop.&nbsp;The problem is that now, whenever I open an Office application (Word, Excel...), I get a pop up message that
 says" Renew your subscription: to keep using your office applications without interruption, please renew by January 25, 2016". It is very annoying. Thanks for your help. Omario

            Assuming you want to put a line continuation character within a cell's text to create a structured, multi-line entry,<br />
ALT+ENTER still works in XL2007.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Select cell A1<br />
Type the following:<br />
This is line one&nbsp;ALT+ENTER this is line two<br />
Press ENTER<br />
<br />
Row_1 will increase in height to accommodate the wrapped text.<br />
If you expand the column width enough the cell will display like this:<br />
<br />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<span>This is line one <br />
this is line two</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<br />
Are you experiencing something different?

<p>Thanks Dana, I know you have some idea what I am doing but let me explain this portion and why I am asking.&nbsp; Long story short I was hacked bad several months ago and find mistakes from time to time.&nbsp; Some have been major and caused me to lose a bunch.&nbsp; Anyways
 enough of the bad vibrations lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one book that counts to 51 rows and 101 rows and I am counting how many times a number is drawn on an even or odd game number.&nbsp; That being said I am comparing what is drawn say in row 3 with the other rows and adjusting them to only shoI have one
 book that counts to 51 rows and 101 rows and I am counting how many times a number is drawn on an even or odd game number. That being said I am comparing what is drawn say in row 22 there is a 1 showing that 17 has been drawn 1 time. Now in row 16 the number
 17 is drawn again so it goes to 2 since it has been drawn twice. When I do a reset on my games it may drop a 17 off and then go back to 1 Does any of this make sense to you in comparison to my formulas. See the attached pic. I am trying to make sure my logic
 is correct</p>

</p><p>That's true, but thru the insider app and selecting release preview ring, it is still possible to run Windows 10 insider builds on the 1020.</p>
<p>Still have one in use and that's on 10.0.10586.456</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it will never get the anniversary release (Redstone branche) </p>

<h2>            Reply Center Defined - N85</h2>
                    I'm not able to reply messages when ever I receive a new message from somebody who has turned this feature ON, on my old Nokia 6630, I could easily go to Sending Options in every message &amp; change reply center to my own but I can't find it in N85 &amp; it's
 really confusing! Is this option removed? And if it is, is there any other way to fix it &amp; change the reply center?<br />
P.S. Nokia developers, please bring this feature back in new Firmwares!!!

            you can try one of two things<br />
<br />
go to: menu-tools-utilities- sett. wizard and attempt to have those settings set automatically via wizard<br />
<br />
or you can go to :<br />
<br />
messaging - press on left hand button options, go to settings by scrolling down, select text message and you might be able to define the message center number there.

            huh that is very curious do you have it set to reply center number different, when it asks send from the same center or not? sorry i am not sure what way to go i simply have never encountered this issue.

            go to messages&gt; options &gt; settings &gt; text message &gt;reply via same centre &gt; NO<br />
and it helps sending an sms to your friend telling him to do the same, or you won't reply to his messages. :) i did so.<br />
also, some times when you're stuck with this " reply centre defined" problem, it helps to move the failed sent sms to the draft folder and resend it from there.<br />

            My problem is that the phone won't ask whether to use my own sms center or the sender's one &amp; also there is no option to change it like old phones!! I even sent it to draft &amp; tried to resend it but it failed again, it seems that it saves the message center
 in draft too!

<p>There is no solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call the original sender, and ask them to change the setting in their phone, so that future messages from them will be sent without forcing everybody to try to use the sender's operator's SMS centre. Only people on that operator's network will be able to
 do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, for existing message you wish to reply to. Don't. Send a new message (use copy &amp; paste or forward to get the original text, or sender's number if you wish).</p>

            I didn't find any solution! You don't get the point! Not being able to change a particular SMS' message center is a bug &amp; it's a drawback since it was available in old Symbian Nokia phones, Nokia has to fix this problem! It's like a protocol! Just imagine
 that internet didn't have DNS &amp; they told people to call the companies &amp; ask their IP address every minute! Come on, gimme a break!

<h2>            Cannot activate my Office 2010 copy due to too many activation due to laptop changes what do I do&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I cannot activate my Office 2010 copy due to too many activation due to laptop changes what do I do?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have installed it on about 5 different laptops over the last 18 months or so (may 1 or 2 more) as I change laptops alot and it will not let me activate the product on my new laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The activation wizard tells me to use the phone option which I have done however it always takes me to a dead end option and changes up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cannot find a way to remove/deactivate the old installations or to get this working.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Come anyone shed some light on this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Phil</div>
                </div>

            <p>The HUP license is just like the FPP license, it allows two concurrent activations of the product, one on your main computer and one more on your&nbsp;portable computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, as best you can, ensure that no other computers besides the&nbsp;one other permitted have your Office installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, rerun the activation wizard, choose Telephone Activation and call the phone number displayed.&nbsp; When the automated system answers, do NOT say anything or enter anything into the system.&nbsp; Eventually you'll be offered an option to speak with a live activation
 representative, or will eventually be connected with a live activation representative.&nbsp; Explain your circumstances and answer their questions, and assuming they are satisfied that you are using the software in accordance with the licensing terms, they will
 give you an activation code to enter into your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post back to let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Getting billed twice for Office subscription - Microsoft unwilling to help</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After three failed attempts trying to resolve this issue with the official Microsoft helpdesk, I am going to try here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting billed twice for a subscription to Microsoft's Office service. This has been going on for almost a year. When I bring this up with Microsoft they say that they only see one account and I am therefore billed correctly. I offered to show screenshots
 of my banking statements which clearly show the double billing but they weren't interested. They are refusing to acknowledge the issue I have which is enfuriating to say the least!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/330fa01f-c2f1-4d76-ab49-970f142d0dfb" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft is also refusing to check with their billing office to see what's going on. (This is what I would do if I was trying to troubleshoot this issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate to think that I will just have to accept the fact that I'm paying twice, but for Microsoft that seems a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bas</p>

<p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess you can focus on what<em> I </em>could have done, but I'd rather focus on what
<em>Microsoft isn't doing</em>, which is take their responsibility and assist a customer with a valid, and really not that complicated issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Direct debits are so irratic that I wouldn't know which one to cancel. I'd be worried cancelling my current subscription and would hate to think of the ramifications, even though data is stored for one month. There is no destinctive information in the direct
 debits as well, they all look the same and are debited at random dates. I just know that there are too many!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather have them check from their end so my service remains uninterrupted. Shouldn't be too much to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're right, they need to escalate the matter and have them enquire with their billing office here in Australia. I suggested that, but they won't, which frankly I find absurd for a company of Microsoft's standing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone from Microsoft ever read these forums?</p>

<h2>            ssl.translatoruser.net&#47;officetrans&#47;httpquery.aspx Online Translator Concern</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;There is a case where one of company user used the outlook translator on a sensitive document. The company network detected but the user said he never used the translation function. By default the outlook will prompt the user that the document data will
 be sent outside the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is there is any possibility that the online&nbsp;translation will run at background, or automatically when using outlook with specific configuration? Perhaps trust center?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your question about Microsoft Translator. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The user would only see the "Do you want to proceed?" question when the user initiates the translation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 18, 1)">The Translator API which is used in Outlook creates no record of the translation. The translated content is never written to persistent storage. We also have
 a webpage: </span><span><span><a href="http://www.aka.ms/TranslatorConfidentiality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Translator Confidentiality</a></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 18, 1)">
 that provides further data privacy clarification for our products. </span></p>
<p><span>Please let us know if this resolves the issue and if you have any further questions.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t the Visio charts in my Word document print to PDF&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have created some flowcharts in Visio 2007 and want to bring them into my Word&nbsp; 2007 document.</p>
<p>I used <strong>Insert &gt; Object</strong> and browsed to the Visio file to import the flowchart.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can see the flowchart and it prints fine to my printer.&nbsp; </li><li>When I print to PDF, the flowchart disappears entirely. </li><li>The flowchart also disappears&nbsp;if I insert the Visio drawing into PowerPoint and try to create a PDF from there.
</li><li>If I create a PDF directly from the Visio file, it works fine (but this doesn't help since I need all the text in my Word document).</li></ul>
<p>As a workaround I could export the Visio to jpg and insert that way, but I'd like to avoid the extra steps.

            <p>This same document has some older Visio flowcharts in it, and they print to PDF fine.&nbsp; They were created in Visio 2003 I believe, but I can't discern any real difference between the old ones and the new ones.

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Yes.&nbsp; They are stored as&nbsp;pairs, so to delete a pair you just delete the username in the usual way, e.g. from its drop down list.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just want to change the saved password you can change it and you will be asked if you want that change to be saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to stop saving a password for an account and not be prompted about saving it each time you use it you&nbsp;may have to delete the pair and resave just its username.</p>
