<h2>            outlook.com on Samsung S4 mini no longer available - can&#39;t access Contacts</h2>
                    I have a Samsung S4 mini, and by using PlayStore was able to download the outlook.com app to give access to my Contacts from my Telstra Bigpond account (a "Microsoft account").&nbsp; My phone was damaged but I was able to buy exactly the same phone, and I am
 now trying to set it up again.&nbsp; However, the outlook.com app is no longer available, seemingly replaced by "Microsoft Outlook Preview".&nbsp; This does not allow an Outlook account to be added into Contacts in the phone.&nbsp; I can't see a solution, and OWA does not
 appear relevant to the problem.&nbsp; How can I now access my contacts?

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand, you are unable to add Outlook&nbsp;account to contacts on the smartphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">outlook.com</span> for Android app</em> has been delisted from the Google store and is no longer available to download.&nbsp;
<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span>This is a different app from the Microsoft Outlook for Android preview app.
</p>
<p>So I suggest you to install the Microsoft Outlook app on the Google Play store.</p>
<p>Set up an email app with Outlook.com: </p>

            <p>When I search the Google Play store I don't find Microsoft Outlook - only MS Outlook Preview and OWA &nbsp;for Android. &nbsp;I've searched using the phone and also a Samsung Note, in case it was a device dependent problem. No luck. &nbsp;I had found your links listed

            <p>I have already installed MS Outlook Preview, and that was the point of my original query.&nbsp;&nbsp; MS Outlook Preview does not provide the same functionality that outlook.com did.</p>
<p>
I am able to correctly set up a MAIL with MS Outlook Preview, and am able to access Contacts ("People") within that app.&nbsp; However these "People" do not appear in the phone&nbsp;Contacts.&nbsp; To overcome this, I am attempting to set up an account via the Contacts /
 Accounts / Add account option - which seems to be the only way that I can (or have done in the past) gained access to Outlook contacts from within the phone Contacts area.&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, within phone Contacts, I was able to add an account by&nbsp;selecting outlook.com as an account type (all the other options are ... Samsung account, ChatON, Google, LDAP, Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, Server, Skype, Viber).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outlook.com option is no longer available from that list.&nbsp; Despite having a correct MAIL account, Outlook contacts are not automatically added in to the phone list of Contacts able to be displayed.</p>

            <p>The resolution to this problem was as follows ...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Outlook.com "magically" reappeared on Play Store, and I installed it and got back the functionality that is missing from Microsoft Outlook.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't know whether my contact with&nbsp;Microsoft has resulted in this, and if so I would have liked to have been contacted to advise that outlook.com was available again, rather than "stumbling upon" outlook.com in the Play Store weeks later.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, I'm happy that the problem has been resolved.</p>

            Use the built-in Android Email app instead. No need to use the Outlook for Android app. In my opinion, it doesn't offer much more in the way of features.

            I think you've missed the point.&nbsp; The Outlook contacts weren't appearing in the Android Contacts list when using the Microsoft Outlook app.&nbsp;&nbsp; Outlook.com restores that functionality.&nbsp; If I wasn't committed to using the Microsoft app, why would I be on
 the Microsoft website looking for a solution?

            Perhaps I have missed the point. I thought the point was to connect your Outlook.com mailbox to your Samsung device. Since it's an Outlook.com mailbox, this is the proper spot to discuss any issues regardless of which app you use to make the connection.
 I'm of the strong opinion that if two tools are supposed to do the same thing and one doesn't work, one should try the other to see if it will. I'm also of the opinion that native is better than add-on. Why would you be committed to an app that you say doesn't
 work?&nbsp;

                    <p>I'm trying to setup my Rice University email on both phones, &nbsp;On the Windows 10 phone,</p>
<p>someone (Microsoft) set up the account on the phone, but when I tried to Sinc it I received</p>
<p>an error 0x80072af9 trying to connect to the server.</p>
<p>On the Windows 8 phone the email account was working until I tried to link it with my 2 other</p>
<p>email accounts (Gmail &amp; AT&amp;T). I tried several times delete the account and reset it up. I tried</p>
<p>making the rice, rice1 and rice2, each time it failed, complaining of the settings. &nbsp;Each time</p>
<p>I tried to look at the settings to correct it, I was asked the password, if I wasn't quick enough to</p>
<p>get to display the settings, I was asked the password again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears I asked the question on the wrong forum and was directed to post it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One phone is Nokia (Windows 10) &nbsp;the other is BLU WIN HD LTE (8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Gmail &amp; AT&amp;T accounts are working on both phones.</p>
<p>To set up the RIce account:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
The setup shows &nbsp;Security Settings: &nbsp;Connection Security SSL/TLS &nbsp;, Authentication Method is set to Normal Password. &nbsp;There are other options to choose in the Authentication method, but Normal Password works. Port for incoming is 993 and port for outgoing is
 465. &nbsp;I'm getting this information from FossaMail settings, since it's &nbsp;available on this computer. &nbsp;On the phones I don't find the option of entering the port number nor to I see SSL/TLS, only</p>

<h2>            Run Office 2013 from External Hard Drive which was once a Internal Hard Drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everybody,</p>
<p>I have a 250 GB hard drive, and It was, for 7 years, the internal hard drive of my computer, and I had installed Office 2013 on it. Recently, the hard drive ran out of memory, and I bought a new HDD to put into the computer, and I unregistered Windows 8.1
 on the old hard drive and reinstalled it on the new hard drive. Since then, I bought a new computer, and was wondering if I could use the old hard drive on my new computer as an external (only use it on the new computer) to load the Microsoft Office that was
 on it on the new computer.</p>
<p>Thanks, Vlasp01</p>

            <p>Yes, you can install programs to any drive that is seen by Windows as a permanent drive. During installation, you are shown an option for the installation location. Here is a step-by-step walk through of installation:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techieshelp.com/office-2013-step-by-step-install-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office
 2013 Step by Step Install</a>&nbsp;The 4th or 5th screen shot down shows the dialog where you can set it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can occasionally create problems down the road with installing poorly-written add-ins and auxiliary programs that may expect to find Office in the default location, but it's not frequent.</p>

            <p>It sounds like Vlasp01 expects to just plug in the old drive as an external drive and start the already-installed Office programs that are on that drive. I don't believe that will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A large part of the installation of Office is the creation of many (certainly hundreds, maybe a few thousand) registry entries that tell Windows where the programs are and what to do when they're invoked via shortcuts or by "starting" existing documents.
 Since Office has not been installed since Windows was reinstalled on the new computer, none of those entries will be in its registry. You'll just get "not found" errors when the programs try to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming the original disk and product key are still available, you can certainly do a reinstallation onto the external drive if you wish. That will create the necessary registry entries. You might be better served to install to the new C: drive, though,
 because its access time and transfer rate will probably be far better than what you'll see with a USB-connected external drive (an eSATA-connected drive might be OK).</p>

<p>The problem is, I don't have either of those available. I guess I will have to buy another copy of Office, because I tried using the old, full hard drive as an internal drive in my new computer with the unregistered windows, and Office gave me a message
 that office has recognized new hardware and I have to register again. When I do register again on the telephone, it says sorry this key is not valid.</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to save the Notes View as a pdf file&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to save the Notes View as a pdf, but even if I'm sitting in the Notes, it still saves the Slides only.&nbsp; Any way to force it to save Notes only?<br />
<br />
And failing that, there used to be a facility in an older (Windows) version, for converting the slides to a word document - 2 columns, picture of slide on the left, and a blank cell on the right for adding notes. That would solve the problem, since I could
 save the Word doc as a pdf.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 won&#39;t get past loading screen &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've already got Office 365 installed on two desktop PCs and running fine, one has my email address set up and the other is my wifes (Both using windows 10 also) however the other day&nbsp;I got a new laptop so that I can have a mobile office when we travel away.
 The email account is IMAP so I downloaded and installed Office and all programs work fine except Outlook. When I opened up the program it took me through the set up where I popped in all of my email server settings etc for IMAP, then when I clicked 'next'
 (I think it then normally tests the settings before moving on) and it completely crashed. Every time I open the program now it just hangs at 'loading profile'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried opening in safe mode (It asks me which profile, if I select the one I tried to create it gets stuck, if I make a new one it crashes when I click next just like it did the first time around)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling word. I've tried waiting hours after clicking next to see if it will recover from the crash. I've&nbsp;performed an sfc /scannow command prompt.&nbsp;I just can't think what I'm missing here! Each time I've uninstalled and
 reinstalled I've made sure all of the old files and PSTs etc have gone and it's still crashing each time I try to complete the process of adding an email. The laptops brand new, it's nothing insane but it's a new generation i5 Lenovo laptop so I can't imagine
 it's a problem with the hardware. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions much appreciated! </p>

            <p>I had this issue as well with Outlook 2016 and Windows 10. &nbsp;I had an exchange account and a gmail account linked up to Outlook. &nbsp;I did end up fixing it by removing the app data files and letting it redownload/recreate them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps:</p>
<p>1. Close Outlook. &nbsp;Go to your user profile folder. &nbsp;'C:/Users/[profilename]'</p>
<p>2. Show hidden files. Go to the 'View' tab and check 'Hidden Items'</p>
<p>3. Navigate to AppData/Local/Microsoft/. &nbsp;Full path of 'C:\Users\[profilename]\AppData\Local\Microsoft'</p>
<p>4. Delete the folder 'Outlook'</p>
<p>5. Reopen Outlook and let it recreate all these files. Outlook should load up once complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me, can't promise it will work for everyone but thought I'd share.</p>

<p><span>Hello RusRogers,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As far as I know, the read receipt is not available in Microsoft Teams yet. However, due to the desire of users, our related team is working on this right now.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, we would be very grateful if you could vote for this idea in Teams UserVoice via

<p>Thank you for your answer. In the deleted folder was nothing. I did not have a backup "pst" (I learned this, and I will make a copy once a week!). I managed to find (the 80%) of my calendar items from a few days ago
 backup of the Sprite backup application, and I am happy.</p>

<h3> curlywarrior440  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Audio Recording</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using OneNote for my lectures, especially the audio recording feature.&nbsp; I typically press record in OneNote, but take notes on PowerPoint (and then I eventually combine the two).&nbsp; Today I started the recording in OneNote and the took notes in
 PowerPoint, like normal.&nbsp; I did however remove my keyboard for a majority of the lecture and use my Surface Pro as a tablet.&nbsp; I am not convinced that would be the reason for the error.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I have gone back to my recording in OneNote, there is an area that says when the recording was started and then an icon with a little red X.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this mean that the recording did not work?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, is there a way to recover the recording?</p>
<p>Either way, is there a way to make sure this never happens again?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Curly, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's further isolate your concern. To get started, I'd like to clarify what version of OneNote are you using? To check, please click this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Also, can you provide us the screenshot of the recorder with the
 error message and the little red X icon? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've mentioned that you've removed the keyboard, can you please try playing the OneNote recording without removing the keyboard and check if you will encounter the similar behavior. Also, please try playing the recording through onenote.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's possible, you can also send us a copy of a sample file with the OneNote Audio Recording. In this way, we can replicate the issue here on our end. You can share the file by uploading it on OneDrive. Then,&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-onedrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07#bkmk_getalink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">get

<h2>            Microsoft SQL Server Compact 4.0 not installing</h2>
                    <p>I have Visual Studio 2015 and I accidentally uninstalled the SQL server compact from my computer. So now the Intellisense on VS won't work anymore and when I download the package from the Microsoft website the exe just unpacks and that's it. No installation
 or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is actually the same problem as this person, but the fix he had doesn't work for me.</p>

 I send it to someone down the hall they can open it just fine. I have reloaded Office on to my machine.

Is that a statement, or a question? If you want to delete a Favorite from the Favorites Bar, just Right Click | Delete.</p>

<p><span>Yes, after <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Switch-the-default-experience-for-lists-or-document-libraries-from-new-or-classic-66dac24b-4177-4775-bf50-3d267318caa9?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
updating the new experience from the classic view</a>, some updates were done on the document library like the columns you mentioned. Currently, we do not have the articles describe or explain these columns.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my research, the below columns are Read Only and are used by SharePoint Online internally for security and compliance purpose. And these columns cannot be modified by end users. Also, these are not site columns and are present
 only at the document library level.</span></p>
<p><em><span>ID of the User who has the Set the Protection Tag</span></em></p>

<p><em><span>Protection Tag Modified</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Record </span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These columns are related to the compliance tag we used before. The compliance tag got renamed to protection tag, the compliance tag modifier was modified to protection tag modifier. The compliance flag was removed completely.</span></p>
<p><em><span>_ComplianceFlags --&gt; was removed</span></em></p>

            Hello JJ81_496, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having an issue with Outlook 2010 as you are unable to make outgoing emails send you are returned with the following error:
<strong>550 5.7.1 [RBL] Sender blocked &lt;IP or domain&gt;</strong>. I know how important it is for you to be able to make outgoing emails, and I will try my best to help you with this issue.
<br />
<br />
I am an Independent Advisor for MS Community and I am sorry to inform you that you have posted this thread in the wrong forum. The correct forum is
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum"><em><strong>Office</strong></em></a><strong><em>&gt;
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook">Outlook</a>.</em></strong>
<em>(You don't have to create a new thread, simply edit the thread!)</em> <br />
<br />
It is important for you to post your thread in the correct forum so that users equipped with the right expertise can better serve you. Nonetheless, I can still try my best to help you with this issue.
<br />
<br />
Based on the error code, the reason why your e-mail could not be delivered because the IP address of the SMTP server of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) is
<strong>blacklisted by global reputable blacklist database.</strong> Please reach with your ISP and request them to assign you a new SMTP server IP to resolve this issue.
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile to remedy your needs, you can use the <strong>web version</strong> of your email account. It should work as expected. The Microsoft Outlook application uses your ISP's SMTP servers to send e-mails, so it may also be subjected to restrictions imposed
 by the ISP. <br />
<br />
I am sorry that I cannot resolve your issue, but I hope I have pointed you the right direction.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
Sutharsan

<h2>            What triggers OneNote to notify users for any activity in their shared Notebooks&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It seems like OneNote was doing fine for me last year to email me of any new activity in my shared Notebooks, but this year seems be sparse if none at all. Our firm is utilizing OneNote 2016 this year, and we're noticing there haven't been emails for any
 changes. I got one notification in June for new activity in one of my shared Notebooks, but haven't since for any other Notebook as others have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've all gone to <span><a href="https://www.onenote.com/sharenotificationsettings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.onenote.com/sharenotificationsettings</a></span> and the settings are always checked on by default. So it's not like we're turning
 them off. My searches haven't been really helping as it seems the 365 users are also wanting to get notifications too. I hope this isn't to speak OneNote Team is doing away with notifications of changes.</p>

<p>Hi Tommy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you with your concern regarding your OneNote not able to send notifications, we'd like to ask some information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did you make any changes on OneNote prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried asking your colleagues to make changes on OneNote and try to wait for the notifications just to make sure notifications is working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, we suggest that you update your Office applications just to make sure your programs are up to date.</p>
<p>You may refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for guidelines on updating your OneNote 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If after updating and the issue still persist, kindly perform a repair of your Office application.</p>
<p>Kindly refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>To answer the first and second questions, yes there have been plenty of changes since we have meetings ranging from every week to every other week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do have the latest Office updates and latest Windows update to boot. I repaired my Office and had another staff change something in a Shared Notebook. I have yet to receive that email about new activity, but I can clearly see it's synced with the new
 changes on my desktop OneNote and from OneNote.com</p>

<p>Thank you for the additional information that you've provided.</p>
<p>To further isolate the issue, we suggest that you turn off all the notification in your OneNote then turn it back on and let see if it will fix the issue.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I turned off the notifications and saved. I go back to the link and check all the boxes of shared notebooks and click on save again. I had another staff edit something in the share Notebook, but I'm still awaiting the email. I'm
 unsure how responsive OneNote is to send out those emails at this point, but I assume a notification email should shoot within the hour at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is our domain also just being blocked from getting notifications since I imagine all these Notebook activities within our firm would warrant too many notifications? Just a thought. I checked "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" since that's the email address for new
 activity notifications but it's not being held up from our spam service as far as I know and I've also whitelisted that address a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>It seems that we've already done all the troubleshooting to fix the issue but still the issue persist.</p>
<p>What we suggest right now is to uninstall OneNote and reinstall it back.</p>

<p>I really don't see how it's our Office installation that may be the issue here considering it's all on your end I'd imagine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We could edit from OneNote.com and that still would not shoot us a notification email about any new activity. Is there a log you can check on what emails should have sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** for example?</p>

    <title>Groove Music Blurry Album&#47;Artwork - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oslan aceros  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove Music Blurry Album&#47;Artwork</h2>
                    <p>So I have A LOT of songs with their Albums &amp; Artwork in my Computer and I like to listen to music while I play games, I got 2 displays and I'm having this issue where I can't see the Album/Artwork from my songs. I set up a link to imgur with the picture
 since it wasn't letting me upload the image. I've checked my options and it says "Don't show artist art" &amp; "Show artist art" but that doesn't do any type of effect on my background, I've also checked in the options menu of Groove Music and nothing has worked
 for me, it's very annoying because I HAVE seen people that have their background working perfectly but mine isn't. What can I do to fix that? Regardless if the image isn't the right resolution or not, I just want to see the background art.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Office 365 PowerPoint, Can&#39;t Insert 3D Model</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've upgraded to Office 365 University but can't find the option to insert a 3D model on the insert tab in PowerPoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have other 365 exclusive options like Morph and the file...account in PowerPoint shows my 365&nbsp; subscription is active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am i missing something obvious (eminently possible!) or am I just not eligible for this feature? I'm running Windows 10 Creator edition (i.e. I have 3D Paint).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>John .</p>
