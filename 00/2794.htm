<h2>            Is it possible to charge the e90 batery using the USB connector &#40;solar charger&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    Dear Nokia,<br />
<br />
I was wondering if it is possible to charge my e90 using the USB connector as it would make it more easy to charge the phone when on the road (as an USB port is available almost everywhere and solar chargers often have a PDA mini USB connector).<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

            No, the USB port on this model does not support charging.<br />
<br />
You can get solar chargers that connect to the phones charger socket.

            Ok, thanks for the information!<br />
<br />
It would be nice if it would accept USB charging dough, an 0.5 meter usb cable is much easyer to carry then an adapter + 1.5 meter cord and as more products are using it it will also help to reduce the cable mess in any working environment.<br />

            You can purchase a power cable for the Nokia E90 that plugs into a USB port--such as
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-276959-CA-100-USB-Charger/dp/B000QGF8OQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-276959-CA-100-USB-Charger/dp/B000QGF8OQ</a> -- but you can find them cheaper.<br />
<br />
Then you can buy a Mini-A to Standard-B adapter too such as <a href="http://www.contractorsav.com/sima-SUO-100-product" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.contractorsav.com/sima-SUO-100-product</a> ...<br />
<br />
to use a solar charger that has a mini-A on it, you plug it into the USB adapter, then plug the USB charger into the B port of the adapter.<br />
<br />
For me, this is too many cables to carry. I'm happier with just the USB charging cable and a 12V to USB cigarette lighter adapter.

            Thanks for the replies!<br />
<br />
I have found an alternative solution using the Nokia standard 2mm to 3.5mm Nokia charge plug conversion cable as my e-Go Professional Solar charger does offer a 3.5 Nokia connector.<br />
<br />
Still it would be nice if the phone could be charged using the widely used USB cable in the future. It will make charging a lot more easy, cheaper, saves time and it will possibly also reduce the weight/size of the phone.<br />

<h2>            Deleting contacts from Access</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, i use Access Database regularly in my work.&nbsp; I have backed up the database to an external hardrive and now need to delete old contacts on the original db on my PC.&nbsp; However, just noticed that when i checked my external backup the contact
 had also been deleted from there which i dont need to happen.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a way to delete contacts from db on my PC without it effecting the backed up copy on my external hardrive?</p>

<p>You're doing something very dangerous: working with Access without being in complete control of its configuration.</p>
<p>You appear to have some linked tables pointing to your external hard drive. You MUST be aware of such configuration. The linked table manager will show you, and allow you to re-link to another BE. In more sophisticated applications there can be code in the
 startup code to handle re-linking, so check that as well.</p>

            They won't be 'flagged', by which I assume you mean selected in the check box to the left of the&nbsp; table name.&nbsp; You check that when you want to refresh the links to a table.<br />
<br />
In the Linked Table Manager, to the right of each table name will be the path to the file containing the tables.&nbsp; The tables you see in the navigation pane in the current database are merely links to those tables.<br />
<br />
What I think you have done is back-up your front end database file, i.e. the one you open when you use the database, not the back end file, i.e. the one containing the tables.&nbsp; Consequently both your current front end and its back-up are linked to the same
 back-end tables.&nbsp; When you amend data in the current front end therefore, you are changing data in the back-end.&nbsp; Consequently the back-up of the front end will also show the amended data, as it is linked to the same tables.<br />
<br />
In addition to backing up the front end, as you have done, you also need to back-up the back end file containing the tables.&nbsp; So that you don't overwrite a back-up containing old data with new data, you can create a new dated back-up each time you back-up the
 back end file.&nbsp; You can do this manually, or you can build the functionality to do so into your front end file.&nbsp; You'll find an example of how to do this in Backup.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file includes methods for making a single back-up, overwriting the current back-up each time, or for making dated back-ups.&nbsp; To do this in your database, you would need to import all of the objects from my demo, apart from the forms, with the
 exception of frmBackUp, which you'll need, and apart from the linked sample tables (but including the two local tables BackEndLocation and FileLocations, which you also need) into your front end file.&nbsp; When you want to make a back-up of the data, which you
 should do very regularly, you'd open the frmBackUp form, browse to the location of your back end file, and to that of the file to which you wish to back-up the data.&nbsp; The first time you do this you'll need to enter the new file name in the dialogue.&nbsp; When
 you make a dated back up it will then use this file name and add the date in the format YYYYMMDD.<br />

<h2>            Refund Policy Office 365 Personal</h2>
                    I upgraded from Personal to Business today. I paid upfront for the year for Office Personal in Nov 2015. The product did not meet my needs so I went for the upgrade. I asked for a credit in the form of a refund or payment toward the upgrade. I am pretty
 dissapointed that I am not eligible for a refund or credit. I can only speak with people in the Phillapines who are reading from a script. Very frustrating. Anyone out there ever get a refund or credit in the same situtation?

</p><p>Thanks for the query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

Thanks for your assistance Tina but you seem to have a problem understanding English, the macros are written already by espen haug and attached to a disk with his book in an 97 xls file, I am not trying to write anything at al merely copy and convert to the
 latest excel 365 format. You are very confused first telling me to use the macro recorder, why I am not writing macros. then you suggest put it on the programming page, Why , I am not writing macros. To reiterate , as simply as I can, I am merely copying existing
 macros from a 97 xls file to a office 365 excel xlsm file, it does not seem to want to happen.<br />

<h2>            Cannot install Office 2013 or 2016 after removal of click to run apps.</h2>
                    <p>I have an odd issue. I understand all the incompatibilities with O365 &amp; VLSC versions of Office, &amp; have tried everything I can find regarding my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new Lenocvo X1 Carbon that I re-imaged with a Windows 10 image &amp; then installed click to run Apps from my company's Office subscription. Turns out i ended up needing Visio &amp; we are not subscribed to it, so I figured to remove the Click to run apps
 &amp; do a clean install of Office 2016 from a VLSC copy. Once the install starts it almost immediately stops &amp; give a generic error "Microsoft office encountered an error , Installation could not continue". I then tried running the install of my 2013 Pro Plus
 MSDN License &amp; got the same error :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did all of my research &amp; ran the Office removal tool to completely clean office from my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-Office-2013-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked my Registry to verify no Office 15 items were tucked away. I Tried a restore to when I first turned the PC on &amp; there was the Factory install of the click to run apps you finds on most new PCs Removed that did all of the above &amp; same result.
 rolled back my restore &amp; ran an SFC scan that returned no resource violations, so the system is clean &amp; fully patched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabled Windows &nbsp;Firewall completely, Shut off Windows Defender, &amp; Stopped Print Spooler.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite admittedly embarrassed about this considering I'm a senior level engineer &amp; have NEVER had Office &nbsp;whip my tail like this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have no Office installed on the system so Hopefully I get some sort of answer by the morning, I really need to get this sorted.</p>

    <title>Outlook states it nees the Exchange password &#40;in the status - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nusaram  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook states it nees the Exchange password &#40;in the status bar&#41; but does not prompt for it</h2>
                    <p>For the past couple of weeks now, when I launch Outlook to connect to my company's Exchange server, intermittently it will just have the "Need Password" message in the lower-right area of the status bar, but it will not popup the dialog box asking for the
 User ID and password.&nbsp; Eventually, that status message will then change to "Disconnected".</p>
<p>Let me state that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the Exchange server when this problem happens and that it is fully up and running.&nbsp; That is, I am able to send an read emails via OWA and my phone.</p>
<p>The very first time the problem occurred, I had no idea, so I just kept on waiting and trying and finallly what I did was restore my system to when I knew I didn't have this problem.&nbsp; But then the problem happened again and the restore process is slow, so
 lately what I have been doing is clearing all tempoarily files and rebooting.</p>
<p>Most of the time this works, but sometimes I've had to reboot more than once.&nbsp; If at 2 reboots the problem is still there, my latest resolution is to boot into safe mode with networking, launch Oulook to confirm that the dialog box for the User ID and Password
 appears and as soon as it does, just reboot again.</p>
<p>So far I've been really lucky and the Safe Mode reboot process has always worked.</p>
<p>But what could be the problem?&nbsp; I'm thinking that since a reboot of some sort fixes the problem, perhaps I can avoid all that by editing/cleaning some registry entries and/or files somewhere instead of rebooting?</p>
<p>I'm running Office 2010 on Win 7 Ultimate x64.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions, please drop me a message.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            You don't need to go to the factory of Nokia, it should be enough going at a care point.<br />
<br />
You can find your nearest care point here: <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/repair-and-recycle/repair/care-points" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://europe.nokia.com/support/repair-and-recycle/repair/care-points</a><br />
<br />
The shop you bought it from should be helpful to send it for repair if you will have to send it away.<br />
<br />
But one thing, have you exposed the screen to pressure??

<p>What!? Did you mean note, or are you making a fool of me? LOL :P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okey, If it has been exposed to pressure, it could mean getting in trouble when it comes to getting this covered by warranty, but on the other hand - you never know. - And it's hard for me to know what has caused this for sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully you get it repaired for free!</p>

But one thing, have you exposed the screen to pressure??

            <p>Hi Sushma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file&nbsp;I'm trying to recover&nbsp;is the same file, but from before it auto-saved. &nbsp;I had just modified the file (deleted most of the 'old' data) to begin making a new spreadsheet when it auto-saved. &nbsp;The auto-saved copy of the file basically just saved the
 workspace. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the info in the link you sent it looks like there are no older copies/versions of a file once it is saved, whether by me or by auto-save. &nbsp;It looks like I will have to recreate the older version of the file I need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes this was the article.</p>
<p>there was two problems with the button. First I am not creating a print button, the button serves another purpose, but I do not want it to be visible when the document is printed. The macro listed in the article calls to print the page, but when it printed
 the buttons were still visible anyways.</p>

            OK, that's a different situation than the article assumes. You'll need to make some changes...<br />
<br />
First, if the button (or you said several buttons) aren't for causing the document to print, then you don't want to use the Click procedure of the button (e.g., Sub CommandButton1_Click). Instead, you need to create a macro (in a regular module in the document,
 not in the ThisDocument module) with the special name FilePrint. A macro with that name will run instead of the built-in Print command. Inside that macro, you can make all of the command buttons invisible, call the .PrintOut method to do the printing, and
 then make all of the buttons visible again.<br />
<br />
Second, the macro in the article assumes that there are no other text boxes or drawn shapes in the document (or if there are, then the text box containing the command button is the first shape). My guess is that this isn't true in your document, so the code
 made some other shape invisible --&nbsp; whatever is .Shapes(1).<br />
<br />
So... <br />
<br />
In the document, put each command button into its own text box. You'll have to find out the index number of the text box (shape) for each one. There's no easy way to do this, but here's a way: In the document, click the Â¶ button so you can see the paragraph
 marks. In the VBA editor, press Ctrl+G to open the Immediate window. Paste in this line and press Enter:<br />
<br />
ActiveDocument.Shapes(1).TextFrame.TextRange.Font.Color=wdColorRed<br />
<br />
Look at the document to see whether the paragraph mark in any of the text boxes has turned red. If so, you know that's .Shapes(1). Change it back to black by changing wdColorRed to wdColorAutomatic and pressing Enter. Then change the 1 to 2, change to wdColor
 Red again, and repeat. Keep going until you've found the index numbers of all the text boxes.<br />
<br />
In the VBA editor, delete the Sub CommandButton1_Click procedure. Click Insert and click Module. Then add code like this:<br />
<br />
Sub FilePrint()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Shapes(1).Visible = msoFalse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Shapes(2).Visible = msoFalse<br />
'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue this list until all the text box indexes are included<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .PrintOut Background:=False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Shapes(1).Visible = msoTrue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Shapes(2).Visible = msoTrue<br />
'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue this list until all the text box indexes are included<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>So this is the macro I put into the new module under my specific project, and and when I push print it brings up the error at the bottom...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub FilePrint()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Shapes(Textbox19).Visible = msoFalse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Shapes(Textbox26).Visible = msoFalse<br />
'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue this list until all the text box indexes are included</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .PrintOut Background:=False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Shapes(Textbox19).Visible = msoTrue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Shapes(Textbox26).Visible = msoTrue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue this list until all the text box indexes are included<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error Message: "The index into the specified collection is out of bounds"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It highlights the first line of code ".Shapes(Textbox19).Visible = msoFalse"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a side note the way that I discovered the name of the textbox (which maybe is the problem....) was I did record macro and then from the home tab i pushed the select button (looks like a mouse pointer) and did select object.&nbsp; Then I selected the textbox
 I pasted the button into. I finished recording and just looked at what textbox was selected. If this method is wrong and gives me&nbsp; a different name then let me know and I can go back and figure out the names the way you said, but I think I have the correct
 names.<br />

<div>I'm aware of the tag search view on the right, it would fit the need I stated if you could list tags by page (or current page) but you can't do that so you can't see a list of all tags for the current page. &nbsp;You have to hover over or decipher all the icons.

</p><p>The groups is actually sorted by your activity. The ones you visit more frequently will go to the top and the least visited ones will go to the bottom.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can I ask, is there any feature in the pipeline to sort these groups by the number of unread posts in each? &nbsp; I follow a large number of groups that over a period of a couple of days all have activity in then, it would be very helpful to have the groups
 sorted this way so at a glance I can see which groups have posts to read.</p>

            Hi Lauren,
<br />
<br />Office purchases, as indicated by the product keys, are region-specific. As Palcouk indicated, you'll need to talk with support on this. No one here has access to your account records. Here is the best way to contact the people who do:
<br />
<br />By chat:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/</a>
<br />Tell the virtual agent you want to talk to a real person. You may have to do this several times.
<br />
<br />By phone:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/13948/...</a>
<br />I do not believe they are available on Saturday or Sunday.
<br />
<br />This forum is a user-to-user support forum. I am a fellow user. 
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help. 
<br />
<br />You can ask for more help by replying to this post (Reply button below).

<h2>            pop up manager</h2>
                    <ul>
<li>Every time INTERNET explorer opens the pop up manager opens it does not wait for you to click on&nbsp; tools for it to open ,it is the most annoying thing it works just fine when you click the tools&nbsp; icon&nbsp; like it should , the problem is&nbsp; that&nbsp; it also comes
 on just opening explorer&nbsp; or clicking on anything in the home page.&nbsp; It&nbsp; only does it on one computer in my house ,I&nbsp; have 5 .&nbsp; The one it does it on is a HP /Compaq -NC8230 -running XPpro&nbsp; service pak 3&nbsp;. No other issues .&nbsp; Cant open anything until you close
 it.</li></ul>

 youtube video in memory card. Now the problem is that i can't open these dowloaded video in .FLV and .MP4 format. I tried to install many media players but nobody is able to open these videos. Open video only in .3GP format. Does anyone know a good media player
 that reads these formats and we solve the problem ?</font></p>

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
i believe that certain older Series40 devices do not indeed support playback of online / YouTube videos, and do not support video streaming at all. there is nothing that can be done about this unfortunately.

<h2>            marketplace and apps problem</h2>
                    
<p>I have WiFi connection at home. When i try to connect to internet explorer i have no problems. When i touch the Marketplace button i get the message "can't connect. marketplace is not available in your country/region". I live in The Netherlands, not an undeveloped
 country as I believe :smileyfrustrated:</p>
<p>Besides that i am not able to download Apps. I get the error message that the file type is not recognized. What? Then why putting it in the Apps db?</p>
<p>So, i can't use marketplace, not on my mobile and not on my pc. And i cannot download Apps.</p>
<p>I am quite dissappointed at the moment. I thought I bought a very new special sophisticated device with the Nokia Lumia 710.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Is your country-region setting in your live ID correct? Check it out at <a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.live.com</a> . Check also the Country settings at your windows phone. maybe you have a wrong marketplace. if the settings are correct, you should try a reset.

<p>I have a Samsung S9 and so does my wife. I know Microsoft told me they are getting out of the fitness band market all together, but it would be helpful if the app actually would open.</p>
<p>So far it seems worthless to even try. Is there an alternate app on the market that can work with the Microsoft fitness band?</p>

            Same here.. I have not used my band 2 for a while because the end of windows phone but wanted to use it again now I own the S9+. Very disappointed that the Microsoft Band app crashes every time it opens. I know Microsoft did end the health vault support
 but have not read anywhere that they completely stopped support for the band app on android.. If this is the case then I can throw away 3 Band 2 watches Microsoft???

<h2>            PC&#47;Device Needs To Be Repaired</h2>
                    <p>I had windows 10 preview installed, and everything was running pretty good, until I tried to update my computer using Sony's "Vaio Update" application. The updates were downloading, then while they were installing, my computer immediately brought this screen
 up. The only resort was to complete a factory reset on the device. I've installed those programs before prior on Windows 8.1 without any issue, so I'm not sure if there was just an issue with Windows 10 or not, but I figured it may be important to post.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It's possible that the Vaio Update application is not yet compatible with Win10. &nbsp;Perhaps you should either wait until Sony releases a version for Win10, or contact Sony support about the issue you've faced.</p>

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt that this will happen, since the new Start Menu and the original Start Screen provide the same functionality. It will likely remain a user choice, depending on which type of PC is being used.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi Paul</p>
<p>
</p><p>The component that will enable the switching between Tablet and Laptop mode (<strong>Continuum</strong>) will have options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you <strong>detach</strong> the Screen, a popup will ask if you want to <strong>
Enter Tablet Mode</strong>. You can select <strong>Yes</strong>, <strong>No</strong>, or
<strong>Don't ask me again</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you Attach the screen you will see a popup asking <strong>Exit Tablet Mode?</strong> with the same options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both cases, you can select the <strong>Don't ask me again</strong> option and&nbsp;your settings&nbsp;will not&nbsp;change when you detach or attach the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will not require a logoff / logon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the following demonstration video.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt that this will happen, since the new Start Menu and the original Start Screen provide the same functionality. It will likely remain a user choice, depending on which type of PC is being used.</p>

<p>I disagree that they provide the same functionality, and find this disappointing. The tiles on the new Start Button are useless. Live Tiles need to be seen, not hidden in the Start button menu. The Start Screen is great for a touch screen but a pain on a
 PC with a keyboard and mouse. The combination of the Start Screen with the Live Tiles and the functionality of the Start Button would be perfect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I disagree. They share some functionality, to be sure, but the Start Menu and the Start Screen are different in obvious ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like the new start menu, with the incorporation of some live tiles, but the full Start Screen is still very useful in its own way, with enhanced organization functionality that doesn't appear in the Start Menu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's a shame that by choosing to have a Start Menu, I am forced to give up the Start Screen, and vice-versa. The code for both is still there... It should be trivial to include an option somewhere on the Start Menu to launch the full Start Screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reconsider providing access to both, and not either/or.</p>

            <p>I just want to chime in here.&nbsp; The Start Menu and the Start Screen are both useful in their own ways, and I would like to have both available at all times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "All Apps" section of the Start Menu is virtually useless unless it can be organized in something better than alphabetically.</p>

            So make it the users choice. &nbsp;Choice to use both at the same time. &nbsp;It's Insanely simple.

<h2>            Lock Screen Picture</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;installed insider preview version 16215.&nbsp; No problems with installation.&nbsp; I went to change the picture on the lock screen.&nbsp; It has the drop down for a picture but no browse function to select another picture.&nbsp; It has my old picture as a spotlight and there
 appears no way to change from spotlight to picture and install a different picture.&nbsp; Does anyone else have this issue or maybe a fix???</p>
