<h2>            Right Click MENU NOT WORKING</h2>
                    I have Office 2007.&nbsp; This morning I wnt to outlook calendar as I am trying to fix an archive problem I had.&nbsp; I started to move items from the archive calendar to my current calendar.&nbsp; After I would move them, to keep track of what I had already done I
 was right clicking the item to delete it from my archive calendar.&nbsp; It was working fine... then all of a sudden the right click would no longer bring up the menu so I could delete.&nbsp; I have shut down and reopened Outlook.&nbsp; I have shut down and restarted my
 computer.&nbsp; So far nothing works.&nbsp; It happened the other night also, but I just considered it a fluke... but now that it happened again... it seems to be a problem.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp;

<p>Ruchi,</p>
<p>I followed your instructions and opened Outlook in Safe mode, but had the same problem, SORT OF.&nbsp; Upon further checking it seems that this problem is&nbsp;Hit or Miss.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;went to my current calendar for the month of July 2010.&nbsp; Out of the approximately 27 items
 I have listed for July, only about 1/2 if them will open up the menu when I Right Click on them, the other 1/2 do nothing when I Right Click on them.&nbsp; It does seem to matter if it is an&nbsp;All Day event, a Reoccuring event, or a Timed event; some of each of these
 work and some do not.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true whether I am in Safe Mode or not.&nbsp; I WISH I could give you some type of pattern to&nbsp;this problem, but I can't seem to find one.&nbsp; It is not that this problem changes for one particular event.&nbsp; What I'm trying to say is if
 the menu pops up for one particular event, it always pops up; but then it could be the event right after that, that the menu will never pop up.</p>
<p>Again, any&nbsp;ideas?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Animating text within a paragraph - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjohnson0327  say:</h3>
<h2>            Animating text within a paragraph</h2>
                    I have a quiz question/answer for a presentation I'm doing on PP.&nbsp; I want the answer to fly in after the audience sees the question.&nbsp; Problem is that when I highlight the answer text only to set up the animation for the answer, PP seems to think I'm trying
 to animate the whole paragraph (question and answer flies in at the same time).&nbsp; I realize I can set up the answer on a whole new line (separate paragraph), and it will work, but it doesn't have the look I want (answer displays immediately after the question
 on the same line).&nbsp; Basically can I set up animation only on specific text within a paragraph?

<p>The short answer is no. You cannot animate part of a paragraph. However, you can fake it. Leave a blank space where the answer is supposed to go. Instead of putting the answer on a separate line, put it in a separate text box (give the text box no line color
 and no background color) and animate the separate text box. If you line things up properly, your users won't know the difference.</p>

<h3> pwhelan81  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMP 12 Advanced Search</h2>
                    <p>On the support site there used to be an article that described how to perform advanced searches, however Microsoft seems to have destroyed all the knowledge management systems they used to have. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What I nedto know is "How do I used advanced search to search on star ratings" &nbsp;e.g. something like RATING=4 OR RATING=5 &nbsp;would cause the current list of songs in the library display to be filtered to only those with a rating of 4 or 5. &nbsp;I
 had found an article a year ago and used this capability on WMP 11 and it was always there in my search box since it remembered my previous searches. &nbsp;After upgrading to WMP 12, the remembered searches are gone and I can't recall the syntax. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please advise on how to accomplish this and if possible on where info on doing this and other advanced search options can be found.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi - I don't use star ratings myself so this doesn't ring any bells with me... Technically you are in the correct forum but I think you may be more likely to get an answer if you re-post in the Music Photo Video section and title your Q 'About Star Ratings...'
 or something similar because that forum has a wider readership&nbsp;(and maybe delete your other post on that old thread to avoid duplication - that old link would be out of date btw)... Hope you get an answer!</p>

            <p>The answer was given as part of another post I made about this and is shown below. &nbsp;Sure enough Microsoft has removed the knowledge they used to publish about this feature. &nbsp;WHY? &nbsp;Why has Microsoft destroyed their knowledge base and deleted this? &nbsp; I guess
 their ultimate goal is to kill WMP as they have been trying to do that since the ill-fated zune fiasco.</p>

            Thanks for taking the time to update this. MS seem to be pushing Groove even though it has limited capabilities (or did when I checked it out on buying this PC one year ago - I immediately sidelined it!) - WMP's days may indeed be numbered and with the
 availability of so many free online options (Google Music -YouTube etc.) for streaming music my guess is MS are really not&nbsp;that bothered. - R.

                    <p>I have a DT903 and a lumia 950XL. The plate pulses on and off. Interupting the charging cycle. Consequently it takes forever to charge the phone. This is a new problem. The plate used to work flawlessly. the plate also keeps asking to pair, even if Bluetooth
 is turned off on the phone. Very disconcerting. I cannot find any support of operating manuals for the plate.</p>
<p>Any help at all is appreciated. I love wireless charging.</p>

            <p>Well, I did all that previously. Now the Charger is kinda working. I say Kinda becuase last night my phone was at 23%. I set up the plate and set the phone on it. The plate lit up like it was charging. I checked to see at what rate. 30%. I went to dinner
 and left the phone on the plate. After getting back 1.5 hrs. later. the phone was at 6%. and the app said it was still charging at 30%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thing is very unreliable.</p>

            If you haven't sorted this out yet, you'll need to ensure the USB charger you're powering your DT-903 with is at least 2 Amps for maximum reliability - certain chargers may not work correctly, especially if they initially sense there's minimal current
 draw and wont power up fully. I've found my DT-904 and Lumia 950 combo to have some problems associated with the Gadget software that this charging plate uses on the phone but that's a different matter altogether.

            The feature appears to be broken. 
<br />
<br />I inserted an excel object
<br />Selected a cell
<br />Exited the excl object
<br />used paste special with link Excel Object - didn't work
<br />Used paste special hyperlink - didn't work
<br />
<br />Both cases it could not find the file the link was pointing to.
<br />
<br />However, when the excel file was created and saved externally, then I could use paste special with link, and the link worked both ways.  I could update the data and use the cell in the ppt to access the spreadsheet.

            <p>Hi Patricia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Salesforce for Outlook add-in installed in your Outlook 2016 client? If yes, to work around this problem, it is recommended you take some actions to the Salesforce for Outlook add-in, like updating, disabling or uninstalling this add-in. To do this,
 please refer to the Workaround section in this KB:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>To further investigate the issue, please try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the issue persist under <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a>? This will help us identify if the issue is related to any software conflict in the affected PCs.</li><li>If possible, try another network environment and see if the issue persists to help us identify if the issue is related to the network environment.</li><li>I have done a lot of test about the issue and notice this error may be caused by the older version of Salesforce. So I want to confirm whether you have installed the Salesforce in your computer. If yes, please upgrade it to check if the issue persist.</li></ol>

    <title>OLE server problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justineroberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            OLE server problem</h2>
                    I created an Access database in Access2000 on a Windows XP computer and transferred it to a new computer running Access 2010 on a Windows 7 Home Premium computer. It initially opened OK and created new records without any trouble. However, a problem with
 inserting scanned images (designated as bmp)into records from Paint began to occur intermittently: I would get the message "A problem occurred while [the database] was communicating with the OLE server or ActiveX control"<i> after</i> return to the table where
 the bitmap image was supposed to have been inserted. The same message said to "close the OLE server and restart it outside of Stamps". I do not have a separate server of any kind, and do not know how to do that. However, sometimes the picture insertion would
 occur okay if I simply repeated the "insert object" sequence. <br />
<br />
The intermittent nature of the problem has now turned permanent, and I'm unable to insert any picture into a record by use of the Paint/insert object interface. Sometimes I can
<i>paste</i> a copy of the scanned image into a form and the resulting record will be fine. Other times it will not display correctly and I've been unable to find a way to fix it.<br />
<br />
Help and clues will be appreciated!

<h2>            Windws Media Player Does Not Open</h2>
                    I own a HP iPaq rx1955. I've had it for about a year now... Just as a background to my situation it's running WM5 and has WMP10. Today I tried to open up Windows Media Player... It wouldn't open and the device didn't react to me tapping on the icon (although
 it knew that the icon had been selected, it wouldn't open). I tried a soft and hard reset and neither had any effect. The device is able to open any of my other programs easily and has no other problems. I also tried to play some of the included sounds in
 the \Windows directory (just the default .wav files like the "start menu" one, etc.) and media player did not open. Is there some sort of fix to this?<br />

            I have two other media players on the device - GSPlayer and the CORE/TCPMP player. The hard reset was done by taking the battery out for one minute and then putting it back into the device.<br />

<p>You had to reinstall GSPlayer and TCPM P afterwards, right? I suspect one of these players is at fault here. you might want to uninstall them and see if that resolves the issue.</p>

<p>Hard reset your device</p>
<p>To hard reset your device, press and hold&nbsp;the power button and then insert the stylus in the reset hole. Release the power button and the reset hole.</p>

<p>In fact, what you did was a soft reset.&nbsp; Linley has given you the process for a hard reset above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you follow Linley's guide for performing a Hard Reset, you will know it is complete and actually did hard reset because anything you had installed will be gone.&nbsp; It is like getting a brand new device...</p>

    <title>Microsoft Exchange account won&#39;t sync on home WiFi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dude without subtitles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Exchange account won&#39;t sync on home WiFi</h2>
                    <p>OS: Windows Phone 8.1</p>
<p>Phone: HTC One M8 for Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Detailed description:</p>
<p>My office uses Microsoft Exchange for corporate email. I have the account working on my phone. It syncs email, calendar and contacts. However, when connected to my home WiFi it is very slow to sync. If I open the email app for that account and hit the sync
 button it will just say "Syncing..." at the very top for a few minutes before finally getting my new email. If an email has a small attachment (300 KB) it will take several minutes to download it. If I turn off WiFi on the phone, it will sync over cellular
 data instantly and download attachments of that size instantly. Similarly, when I'm at work it will sync on the office WiFi instantly and download attachments of that size instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary:</p>
<p>Altogether, it is just at home and just my Microsoft Exchange account that will not sync over home WiFi. All other apps and services on my phone work fine on my home WiFi. This includes data heavy services like Skype, streaming video (e.g. Netflix, Hulu)
 and other email accounts including Microsoft consumer accounts like outlook.com. In other words, the speed of my home WiFi is not the issue and the capability of the phone is not the issue (since it works fine with my work's WiFi)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible cause?</p>
<p>I vaguely recall there being discussion on this forum about IPv4 vs. IPv6 support required in the Exchange server and/or Windows Phone and/or WiFi router. Perhaps the sync is trying to use IPv6 and then being forced to downgrade to IPv4 causing a delay before
 fetching data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can point me to some documentation regarding the possible cause I've described or any another explanation for this issue it would be appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Thank you to cooperate with our Windows Phone community.</span></p>

<p><span>I see that you are having issue in your Windows Phone using your Home network. I would like to ask you if you have tried to unplug your router
 from the sock and plug it back. Doing so you will&nbsp; simply refresh your home Wi-Fi network and this could solve your issue.</span></p>

            <p>I have this same issue at home on 2 Windows 8 phones. Won't sync Exchange account via wifi. Turn wifi off on phone and they sync fine via cell network. One phone a Nokia and one an HTC. Two different Exchange servers (my wife's employer and my employer,
 both Exchange). Other type&nbsp;mail accounts sync fine on the home wifi. </p>
<p>Agree with dude, not a very helpful reply from Karolina. Seems pretty likely based on two different phones and two different Exchange servers the issue is in a wifi setting on home router. Might we get more info on possible causes?</p>

            Like Jenniwh2, this problem started in the past week or so. On my home computer (via the same router) I don't have a problem. It is just through my Samsung Galaxy s7 using the Outlook App where I have a problem. If i turn off wifi on my phone and connect
 to cell data it syncs fine and immediately.&nbsp;

<h2>            Finicky Endnotes Placement on Page</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Hi, so I'm publishing a small academic journal through my university. I've pretty much gotten the articles into their basic editing shape, however one annoyance that has cropped up for every article has to
 do with the placement of the endnotes section at the end of each paper. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Basically, I want there to be about three lines of space after the last sentence of the main body. Then it should have the heading of "Notes",
 follow immediately by the endnotes. However, most often the endnotes list does not want to sit right under the heading. It automatically goes to the next page, leaving a large amount of space blank. To fix it, what I've had to do is either increase the amount
 of lines before the Notes heading, or I'll just increase the font size of one of the blank lines. When it gets to a certain point, the footnotes list will pop up right below the Notes heading like I want it to be, but it's finicky. For instance, increasing
 the line spacing to say, 12 pt might do the trick of getting the footnotes onto the correct page, but increasing it to 13 (or decreasing it to 11) will just make the footnotes go to the wrong page like before.

<p>
</p><p><span>Does anyone know what is going on? The only thing I can think is it has something to do with me deleting the endnote line separator and continuous
 separator in draft view, but I can't have these lines show up in the final product, so I'm at a loss. I'm prepared to swallow my annoyance since the articles look great otherwise, but I'd really like to get this figured out. If anyone can help I'd be so appreciative
 and I can send you one of the problematic articles through direct message so you can fool around for yourself. Thanks.</span></p>

<p>Instead of deleting the Endnote Separator, replace the Line with the word Notes then apply the space before formatting to that paragraph so that you get the desired separation between the word Notes and the text in the main body of the document.</p>

<div style="text-align: left">Hey! Thanks for this reply. This worked perfectly for me on the first article, but when I went on to the second article, I still had trouble. The notes section only is stuck to a new page. As in, the previous page before it still
 has 3/4 of the page blank and the notes section insists on starting on a new page. Also, it only lists the first endnote, and then it lists the second endnote on the next page and continues the list from there. Very wonky. This is how it looks. 2nd footnote
 is on next page.<br />

            Make sure none of the endnotes is formatted as "Keep with next" or "Page break before." You can apply a heading style to the endnote separator if desired (it won't show up in the TOC even if you'd like it to), or you can modify the Endnote Separator style
 to have Spacing Before/After and the "Keep with next" property.

            New question. Know why this footnote feel likes it must continue onto the next page when there is plenty of space on the current page? It is the only page that rolls over at that height.<br />

            Check the paragraph formatting of the endnotes.&nbsp; It appears that it may be formatted so that they are being Kept with Next, and as a result, one of the endnotes is being split across a page break.

<h2>            Installing Office 365</h2>
                    Tried installing Microsoft 365 subscription&nbsp;on PC Windows 10 with Edge browser. Installation failed because of a problem with streaming: Error message 30016-25. Restarted computer etc. but still getting same error. I already have MS Office 2013 fully installed
 on the computer but gather from forums etc. that the two can be on the computer at the same time. Anyway, I'm glad I didn't uninstall Office 2013 in light of this problem!

            <p>Surprisingly Eugene's advise may be useful.&nbsp; I found this other question:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_install-mso_windows8/error-code-30016-25/f0b2204f-bf13-4491-9dfc-ca2dfd5b4eba</p>
<p>
</p><p>with the same error code. They indicated that uninstall helped by cleaning up corrupted installed files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hill, make sure you download and run the "Fix It" specific for Office 365/2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hill, I/we really could use the FULL and EXACT error message text (screen cap would be good) for this error. It is a "new" on that I have not encountered and have not been able to find much/any documentation for.&nbsp; I hope to add it to my collection of error
 codes and fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eugene, you are an insider. Could you use that to get hold of internal MS documentation for this error code. Error documentation should not be a secret!</p>

                    Here and there I like to edit an icon to make it more visible or more appropriate (to my view). This used to be easy: you could use the customize menu to select alternatives from a list of options or edit in an icon editor. Now this facility seems to have
 disappeared. &nbsp;Or perhaps it has just moved?

    <title>Spam on Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roamingabroad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spam on Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Why is Outlook mail plagued with Spam? Can it be that Microsoft is incapable of stopping droves of emails offering "military flashlights," "Simple blood sugar fix," "insurance online," "Russian women," "Prostrate 911," and on and on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How difficult can it be to stop a spammer as the blast thousands of emails across the Outlook platform?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing like this ever comes to my other email accounts on major email providers (will go unnamed here).<br />

<p>I am "welcome to use the other platforms"? Thank you, kindly, for this advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to my question: I pay an annual subscription to use Outlook. I get 100+ spam on Outlook for every one spam on "the other platforms."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought this was a forum to search for answers and not platform to lecture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am simply curious: Why does Microsoft not take measures to stop spammers abusing their platform and abusing us with spam, a god percentage of being lewd?</p>

<p>Microsoft blocks billions of spam messages a day. There's bound to be some that get through.</p>
<p>Microsoft isn't going to tell us any specifics of what they do to fight the scourge of spam as if they did then the spammers would just figure out new methods of getting around them.</p>
<p>

<h3> techguy379  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to home wifi network with WPA2 AES</h2>
                    My Lumina 920 phone won't connect to my home wifi network which uses WPA2 preshared key with AES encryption. It says cannot connect to wifi network. I even copied the WPA2 password from my router's setup screen to a text file and uploaded this file to
 my Skydrive. I opened the file on my phone and copied and pasted the password into the password field in the Wifi settings. My phone still won't connect. On my desktop PC if I copy and paste this password from the same text file I have no trouble connecting
 to my wifi network. HOW DO I GET WINDOWS PHONE 8 TO CONNECT?!

            I struggled all day doing various Internet searches and contacting both Verizon and HTC, but just stumbled on the solution accidentally.&nbsp; Here's what I did:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Plug the phone into a laptop using the USB Mini Cable</li><li>Go to Settings on the phone and turn Wi-Fi "Off"</li><li>Power down the phone.</li><li>Wait, because within minutes the phone will turn back on (perhaps because it is connected to the computer?)</li><li>Go&nbsp; to Settings on the phone and turn Wi-Fi "On"</li><li>Input your router password.</li></ul>
Hope that helps.&nbsp; Don't know why, but it worked for me.

    <title>Office Mobile doc and xls files are read only&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office Mobile doc and xls files are read only&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Today purchased RCA windows 10, 2 in 1 tablet/laptop, since my laptop crashed... thinking I could create, edit and print docs in excel and word on this new device. Salesman assured me Microsoft Mobile was compatible with MS Office and I should be able to
 create docs and forward them to my coworkers without problems. Of course nothing was said about the document would be a "Read only" version. I&nbsp;set up my first Excel Mobile doc to learn I must PURCHASE office 365 to be able to edit my doc?? Box should read
 this is a read only version. Feel I have been taken for a ride. Any suggestions for getting around this, or do I return the product and report the mislabeling/misrepresentation?</p>
