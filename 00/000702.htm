<h2>            Issues With XBox Music On WP8 - WP8 Sync App</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; This is&nbsp;in response to feedback about the Windows Phone 8 App compiled by dmmontal in the
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpmusic/master-list-of-issues-with-xbox-music-on-wp8/b1c64834-de43-4af6-8069-4626090289a3">
Master List Of Issues With XBox Music On WP8 thread</a>.&nbsp; We'll be continue to update this thread with news as we work towards a resolution to these items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
- "Syncing" functions are very basic - virtually non-existent compared to the rich sync experience in Zune or even iTunes.
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
- No icon indicating if media is currently on device or not. Have to navigate all the way back to the home screen of the app and click on a whole different subset of folders to see what media is on your device.
<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>- No manual syncing or management of Playlists. Cannot generate auto-playlists, like in Zune.
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
- No visible folder hierarchy in navigation. <br />
&nbsp; <br />
- Very few options to actually manage media library. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Greg</p>

            I agree with all those points 1000%. I would also add that you can no longer sync a single song, only the whole cd... really!? You can't update a playlist and have it automatically sync. I know, it will via the cloud, but what about for songs I've ripped
 from a CD that aren't magically "matched". It seems crazy that so many features are missing that were present in Zune.
<br />
<br />
I would also add, the Xbox music "metro" app for windows 8 is terrible for a desktop class machine. It stinks having to use a full screen app with a keyboard and mouse... so much wasted space. The xbox music "desktop" app is the only alternative for a desktop
 environment and it is missing so many features, its useless.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am really surprised that there is no longer a Microsoft alternative to ITunes. And no, media player is not even close. Zune was it, and it was much better than the competition in many ways. Its such a shame that MS did not build on the core Zune software.
<br />
<br />
As software engineer, I find it strange that a SW company would completely abandon a well received product(even if the zune hw wasn't), and replace it with a inferior replacement lacking much of the functionality of the original. I currently own windows 7.5
 and windows phone 8 handsets. I love the 920, and my titan is not bad either. I have a hard time recommending anyone who listens to music buy a windows phone 8 handset, even though the Nokia hardware is excellent. I also have a Zune pass subscription with
 the 10 "free" songs per month. I really won't continue with the subscription, why bother, it is so hard to integrate the zune pass content with your own music. I also would not recommend it to anyone who is interested in a new phone.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this is remedied soon, I really want to like wp8, but Xbox music so terrible I'm not sure I can continue to support it.<br />

            I think another thing to add is wireless sync.&nbsp; With Win 8 tablets now I think it's even more important to have the capability to sync wirelessly since they don't come with a lot of USB ports.&nbsp; I think you can sync music to wp8 from the cloud, but that
 doesn't help if music doesn't match stuff to the cloud or if you have video pictures you want on your phone.&nbsp; And if you sync from the cloud it's going to be slower and use data.&nbsp; If you are on the same network you should be able to sync via the network and
 a much faster speed.

            <p>I don't know if this quite the right thread to add this to, but it seems to be the closest of those listed from the original master list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The matching of songs for my Cloud Collection is just hopeless.&nbsp; Many, many songs are matched twice - it seems that if a song is available in Microsoft's library on two different albums, I get both albums in my Cloud Collection with that song.&nbsp; This leads
 to the silly situation where I have things like Miles Davies' 'Kind of Blue' listed twice - 'Kind of Blue' and 'Kind of Blue (Remastered)'.&nbsp; They're identical albums, really.&nbsp; Why can't XBOX Music just pick one to match with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sillier still, I frequently have the situation I've just described made even worse by the fact that one of the albums matched in Microsoft's library will be available for online streaming and the other won't.&nbsp; So I have the Sigur Ros album '√Åg√¶tis Byrjun'
 appearing twice in my Collection (seemingly identically - the album names are identical so I don't know why there's a duplication).&nbsp; If I look at the first one, tracks 1-10 all show as 'Unavailable' - I can't play them online.&nbsp; But if I go into the other instance
 of the albums, tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 are all available to be played.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE get this sorted out - the principle of the Cloud Collection is excellent, and if it all works properly I'll happily subscribe to an XBOX Music Pass.&nbsp; As it is, I feel like it'd be money spent each month on pure frustration.</p>

            <p>everybody should go to the latest blog on the Xbox Music and let them know what you think.&nbsp; For some reason, it's titled, "Right from the Start:&nbsp; Xbox Music"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty sure it's not right from the start, and I'm pretty sure it's not going to be with 8.1...</p>

            Thanks for the heads up, bguy. I did respond as you suggested. Text below:
<div><br />
<div>
<p>
Right from the start? Are you kidding me? Speaking as a guy who really has been there from the start (I bought a Zune 30 and a Zune Pass to go with it at launch), this is a sick joke. The TL;DR for this post is simple: The Xbox Music experience is horribly,
 horribly broken.</p>
<p>
We're almost a year in from the launch of WP8, and I STILL have the following major problems:</p>
<p>
1.) I can't sync my music from my Zune Pass to my Lumia 920. Well, I can sync it, but it won't play. I get a message saying "We are unable to confirm the media usage rights for this content". Really? I don't have the rights to play it on my WP8 device, but
 it plays fine on my PC, old Zune and my WP7 device? And if I download it all over again directly to the phone using the *exact same* music subscription service (renamed Xbox Music, of course) I magically do have the rights again? Really, Microsoft?</p>
<p>
2.) The Desktop app for Windows 7 is terrible. I can't even sync individual songs. It's whole albums or nothing. The UI is awful. This is the most damning indictment of the software I can think of: I get better functionality using Windows Media Player, software
 that is so old that MS has all but abandoned it. Yet it's the best way of managing my media in the latest iteration of Windows Phone. And no, I can't update to Windows 8, because my workplace won't allow me to use anything but Windows 7 on their network. Many
 people are stuck with Win7 for the long haul - we need a decent app for WP/XBM.</p>
<p>
3.) Metadata management (if you can call it that) still stinks. We still don't have the option of telling Xbox Music to only add metadata that is missing (a feature that was present and beloved in Zune). So I can't use the much-touted cloud features of WP8/Xbox
 Music, because if I do it will overwrite all my metadata with new INCORRECT metadata. Related to this problem is the fact that I get duplicates of songs in albums, missing songs, albums that are split into two because of different naming conventions (using
 an ampersand instead of the word "and" in band/album names on some tracks, but not all, so the software thinks that it's two differently named albums. Genius).</p>
<p>
The issues go on and on. I evangelized Zune when it came out, despite most people wanting nothing but an iPod. I defended Windows Phone 7 because I saw the amazing potential, even though iOS and Android were both streets ahead in terms of features. And now
 I'm stuck with WP8 - easily the best mobile OS Microsoft has ever produced - and I can't use key features that I PAY $15 A MONTH FOR!</p>
<p>
At least this blog post tells me why these issues still haven't been fixed almost a year after launch - you've been spending all your development time and dollars coding apps for iOS and Android. I understand why you're doing this from a business perspective,
 but as a customer who has supported Zune/Xbox Music from the start (for real, not starting at Win8.1), I can tell you that I am bitterly, bitterly unhappy.</p>
<p>
Please, please fix this for the loyal Zune/WP/XBM customer base that has stuck with you through almost a decade of you building this service. We at least deserve something that works.</p>

            Like the poster above, I have been on board nearly as long and proselytize WP as often as I can.
<div><br />
<div>I had lunch with three IT friends of mine a week ago, and they made my Lumia 900 a topic of discussion for 10 minutes. They'd never seen a WP in person before (says something, doesn't it?). &nbsp;I'm not an app-heavy user, so WP7 is fine for me as far as that
 goes. Music is #1. Period. I bought the 900 knowing it was a past-gen device but it was Zune I was after, integrated with a phone. It was a beautiful experience, unboxed and working in 3 minutes, synced and playing with Zune sw on my W7 desktop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then the cracks started to show. The only fubar with the setup described above is that video content will "sync" but will not play. I've spent $10+ in MS points only to realize the failure. The effort involved to discover the issue was ridiculous, fruitless.
 Ultimately I was refunded but no exlpanation was given. This is the one thing that makes me keep an eye on the future for WP - I want a solution for movies on my phone in the current environment that works so well for me - W7, WP7, old school Zune software
 and subscription. If this would be true with W7 desktop - WP8, I'd be a happy man. So...</div>
<div><br />
<div>When it came time for my daughter to get a new phone, I got the 521 from TMO. I knew there were issues going in, but I had hopes that music on her phone, ease of use and the library available from Xbox Music would somehow mirror what I enjoyed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The experience with that was so bad, so horrible, I felt like I had given her a product, a promise so broken out of the box...Wasted $120 and made her ever more dependent on other sources for music.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please, please resuscitate Zune. Bring it back. Relaunch it in the form it had when it was new. It's still fresh. It worked. The Apple backlash needs a champion, and your champion will be WP with Zune as it's lance. It's sword. It's bow. Music and videos
 will be it's arrows. The look of it, the feel of it are very important. Give user options within the scope of it all - cloud, subscription, stream, all that junk I don't care to understand. I am a simple man with simple needs and money to spend. I will gladly
 spend it with you, MS, but not if the future goes the way you've taken us over the last 24 months. I'll go back to ripping vinyl and CDs. I'll buy every last Zune capable device and if that also goes away, I'll just have to examine my options then.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope you all realize how important this is.</div>

            <p>Count me as another who misses the Zune software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a Zune 120 GB shortly before the Zune HD was announced and have been loving the Zune software ever since. Because Windows Media Player will actually sort my music library folders, I still used that for organizing my collection, but I used Zune as
 my primary media player on the computer and for syncing with devices. I have been a Windows Phone user since the beginning of 2011. The only real issue I had with using my phone as my music device was the limited storage capabilities, meaning I&nbsp;could only
 sync about half of my&nbsp;music to the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest concern&nbsp;I had with the software is that a few of&nbsp;the albums in my collection were not matched to the correct artist in the Zune store. One album named "Back &amp;&nbsp;Forth" by a more obscure artist&nbsp;caused that artist to be matched with The Verve because
 they had an album called "Forth."&nbsp;Strangely, that album in question was available from the Zune store. I then discovered a third party app "Zune Social Tagger" which I could use to manually match albums to the correct album in the Zune store. This issue affected
 only a few albums out of my fairly large collection, but this third party app was a useful tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I switched to WP8&nbsp;when I purchased&nbsp;my Lumia 920 in about 4 months ago. I have added some music to my collection since then, but didn't notice this issue until recently. I had pretty much stopped using the Zune software since it wasn't compatible with my
 new phone. In the past month, I added CD's from 3 artists that I previously did not have in my collection. When I synced those albums to my phone, I noticed that there was no available suggestions to purchase music by those artists in the Xbox Music Store.
 After playing around with the Xbox Music app on my Windows 8.1 computer as well as various other media player software, I finally discovered that the Zune software was still useful in associating the music I have ripped from my CD collection with the music&nbsp;in
 the store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I would like to see is an updated version of the Zune software that provides the following functionality</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to manage and sort my music folders by artist and album name (still using WMP for this function)</li><li>Play music and videos</li><li>Auto-synchronization when device is connected to the computer</li><li>Create and manage playlists</li><li>Rip CD's (preferably with an optional vbr encoder)</li><li>Option to choose if metadata is overwritten or if only missing data is added</li><li>Ability to sync with Windows Phone 8</li><li>Ability to match music from CD's and other sources of music files to the corresponding artist in the Xbox Music Store, which allows for things like artist wallpaper, suggestions for other music, related artists, buzz, bio, etc.</li></ul>
<p>Like others&nbsp;have mentioned, we don't care what name the software goes under, the consumers just want the functionality that we lost&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;hoping for a few improvements along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You know, if MS really wanted to fix the issues related to the Windows Phone 8 - they would've done so long ago. And, they really do have the resources to address any of the issues listed. It's just that, as with most big corporations that are selling millions
 of units, they're very aware that they have the hammer, so-to-speak.&nbsp;As long as people are consuming their units why would they bother with addressing bug fixes with any sort-of urgency. I mean, c'mon man, who are we kidding here; bug fixes are "Low Priority"
 and certainly there is NO overtime pay going into bug fixes. So, we'll just have to take a bite of the&nbsp;sweet and sour MS sandwich and chew - just keep on chewing....ain't nothin' gonna change here. Cheers!</p>

<p>I would have to agree with you on that. Setting up one of my vm's with Slow right now to check.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That was my first thought but still, Slow always gets updated before RPR thus my question.</p>
<p>Indeed, we now have an outdated Slow Ring. Shhh..., I "borrowed" it from Google</p>

<p>Now that is interesting. I am showing the same result in one vm that I did use WU on. The other offline vm I had manually installed the 2 updates via cab files so it is not listed under Settings, Updates but shows in Control Panel (KB4501375 and KB4506933).</p>

<p>Hi Roger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I did notice that last night with the Feature Update on dump. As I dl the CU first, then the Feature which showed up later in the evening. The rest of the files were identical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange thing though, I could not manually install 2 of those cab files, the other 3 installed without issue. That had me wondering what they are for. Can't recall the errors I was getting but never seen them before. I did install the SSU update first kb4506933.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The clean install of the Feature ISO was trouble free.</p>

            If you set a fill colour for selected cells (say white) then you will not see the gridlines for those cells. Does that help?

 no 'Phone' tiles at all in the App list, is that right? Or are you only seeing one 'Phone' tile instead of two? The 'Phone' tiles for SIM1 and SIM2 can be merged into one tile only. If they are currently merged, you can unlink them by going to Phone &gt; ...

    <title>Simple Problem using MS Word Form Developer Tab - Design button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> botanikman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Simple Problem using MS Word Form Developer Tab - Design button</h2>
                    <p>I have used old MS Office programs that had a Form tool bar with no problem.&nbsp; in this newer MS Office, it is far more difficult.&nbsp; I follow the directions given in the help window.&nbsp; In Step 3 - Add Content to the Form.&nbsp; I type in the item that will be the
 same in the form template, e.g.&nbsp; Site Name:</p>
<p>Then click on Design tab, then the Rich Text button, then re-click Design button to go out of that mode (this used to protect the template).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem - UNLIKE IN THE OLDEN TIMES - if I am in form fill-in mode - if I happen to have my cursor near "Site Name:" I can destroy it or otherwise unintentionally modify it.&nbsp; In the old versions, I could simply hit the tab to move to the next
 entry say Site Location:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>without messing any thing up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is probably so basic that it will produce some laughs but I do not care.</p>

<p>In addition to Doug's explanation, you should be aware that turning the Design Mode button on or off has no relationship at all to whether the form is protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using legacy form fields, then you must click the Restrict Editing button, check the box in the "Editing restrictions" area and select "Filling in forms", and click the "Yes, Start Enforcing Protection" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f3b8d3b-dbbb-4a46-b9dd-c90bc3ba7a4b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f3b8d3b-dbbb-4a46-b9dd-c90bc3ba7a4b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>An alternative to this sequence is to go to File &gt; Options &gt; Quick Access Toolbar and add the Lock button (from the All Commands group) to the toolbar. That button toggles form protection on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using content controls, you should not go to the Restrict Editing pane or use the Lock button. Instead, select the entire form, click the Group button on the Developer tab, and click Group in the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other hint: You can use the Tab key to jump from one content control to the next,

<p>It sounds like you are mixing up the use of Content Controls, which do not require that the document be Protected for Filling in Forms, with that form of protection, which is intended for use with Legacy FormFields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it is probably better to move to the use of Content Controls, you can still use Legacy FormFields in later versions of Word</p>

    <title>How can I filter my contacts with the new version of Skype&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I filter my contacts with the new version of Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I used to filter my contacts into lists such as family, friends and different companies that I work for so I could easily find the contacts I needed.</p>
<p>With the latest version of Skype I can no longer filter my contacts as needed, and my contact list looks like one big mess :(</p>
<p>Does anyone know if it is somehow possible to filter your contacts into different lists in this new version?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>The feature to filter contacts has not been incorporated to the new Skype. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can still obtain this functionality with classic Skype: <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

 &gt; Click the <strong><span>v </span></strong>for the dropdown; then select
<strong><span>Get classic Skype</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd be taking note of this suggestion for the future version of the Skype application.

<p>
</p><p>Is there another link to switch back from Skype 8 to 7?&nbsp; Until Skype 8 functionality becomes more like 7, Microsoft should not force users to switch.&nbsp; Particularly the text messsaging functionality such as grouping contacts and ability to change the enter
 key to add a line instead of sending the text message.</p>

<p>Hi Joseph.</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of people put a lot of effort in trying to make the next version of Skype great... So why do you let out an obvious feature like this?</p>
<p>Even more, if the app insists on grabbing every single contact in a user PC, you will easily get 200 or 300 contacts....&nbsp;So I try to image that meeting in which every programmer/designer agreed that "yeah, a 300 contact list with no groupping is not a problem"</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your answer, you do can install&nbsp;the "classic" version of skype, but will be nogged everytime&nbsp;with a message to upgrade to Skype for Win10...</p>

<p>Agree - the "new" Skype seems to have removed a great number of features which users previously took for granted - as you suggest, why on earth would they even think of not being able to group contacts???</p>

<p>Why do Microsoft insist on dumbing down their software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contact lists are an obvious requirement for any software which holds contacts. For example Outlook and other email clients have all sorts of filtering capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to have to scroll down a large list of contacts to find the one I'm after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With contacts lists you could organise your contacts into smaller lists, making it much easier to find contacts, see who is online etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it incredible that the new version of Skype (which is being forced on users) has dropped this simple and useful feature.</p>

<p>Why drop an essential feature in the first place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nobody wants to scroll down a list of hundreds of contacts to find one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which group of contacts I want to see, and see who's on line, depends on what I'm working on at any given time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dropping this feature makes Skype more difficult to use, it makes no sense whatsoever to remove this feature.</p>

            <p>Did you delete the category from the contacts or from the category list? You can't undo the change either way - but if you deleted it from the category list, you just need to add it back. Deleting it from the list wont remove it from things that were categorized
 - it only removes the color from the item. </p>

            Hello Guy,<br />
<br />
<br />
The error code <strong>80072EFD</strong> usually occurs when your account fails to synchronize with your device. This error may also affect your phone's capability to download apps from the Store. You can try to resolve this issue by making sure that your phone's
 time and date settings are correct.<br />
<br />
You can also try to resolve your concern by performing a soft reset. Press and hold the
<strong>Volume down</strong> + <strong>Power</strong> buttons until your phone vibrates. It usually takes about 15 seconds and your phone should restart.<br />
<br />
In some cases, the sync issue may have been caused by the Internet connection that you are using. Connecting your phone to a stable Wi-Fi Internet connection may resolve your concern.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let us know what happens after making sure that your phone's date and time settings are correct, soft resetting your phone and using a stable Wi-Fi Internet connection.

<h2>            Please allow favorites in Edge to be pinned to left side of screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi, brand new Windows 10 PC.&nbsp; Most things seem easier, if not sensible, however I find myself continuing to use I.E. over Edge for the sole reason of viewing my favorites.&nbsp; I prefer having them "pinned" open, to the left side of the screen so I can view
 what's on the page.&nbsp; Microsoft Edge only allows favorites to be pinned open on the right side of the screen, which completely blocks the reading pane.&nbsp; Hopefully I'm doing something wrong and will figure this out, eventually.&nbsp; If I'm not doing anything wrong,
 this is a flawed design in Microsoft Edge and should be changed.&nbsp; I'll continue using Internet Explorer, and occasionally test Edge for updates.&nbsp; As things currently exist, the design for Edge is so flawed I absolutely prefer I.E.</p>
<p>

<h2>            &#91;N95&#93; audio stored on memory card - cannot open in music player...</h2>
                    hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I just received my shiny new N95, and I love it. The only problem I have encountered is that the music player doesn't seem to detect music stored on the memory card. I'm using the memory card to store music due to the phone memory being too small...<br />
<br />
I can still play the files, but I need to access them using the file manager, which sort of renders the dual slide function a bit redundant.<br />
<br />
Any users on here know of a fix? Or am I just being stupid and missing something really obvious?<br />
<br />
cheers<br />
<br />

            tried putting the files in E:\sounds\digital sounds\ and E:\my music\, but the player still fails to recognise them when I try to update it.<br />
<br />
the files have been converted to .m4a files by Nokia Music Manager before being exported to the phone.<br />
<br />
do the files have to be below a certain size? I'm trying to play mixed DJ sets, which are over 50MB...

            Can the Music Player find any " regular" size music files, ie: 3-5Mb?<br />
<br />
The location you tried is correct, not that that should matter as the Music Player searches the entire phone.

            the only files found by the music player are a selection of very small (~20KB) audio clips stored on the phone memory!<br />
<br />
when I received the phone, I backed up my N70 and transferred all the information onto the N95 using PC suite. would this have anything to do with the music player not functioning properly?<br />
<br />
having searched this forum, it seems a few other users have had similar problems, which appear to have been fixed when they changed the file format of the audio, or put it in a different directory. I have tried the fixes mentioned in these threads but still
 the music player doesn't recognise anything...

            The files need to be in a folder called My Music or MyMusic or Music.<br />
<br />
Also you need to refresh the music library by going to the Music player application then Options -&gt; Refresh Music Library.<br />
<br />
But keep in mind that music has to be int he right folder.<br />

WMA, M4a,Mp4, Mp3, 3gp, aac and other formats are supported.

<br />
I formatted the memory card, and the music player now recognises audio files stored on the memory card. If I need to, I can reinstall the map data.<br />

Thanks for everyone's help on here, I really appreciate it.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t open Skype in MacBook Pro OS</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded Skype on my MacBook Pro for work but I cant open it. Each time I press on the icon it either bounces once or does nothing. I have called Apple support who got into my computer and uninstalled and re installed twice plus checked some other
 things. They suggested to contact Skype. It would be so much easier if there was a customer support team I could call. Ive tried everything I have read in the community forum but nothing has worked. My Mac is Sierra OS 10.13 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot make Skype calls via the web either. I c an log in and see my contacts but when I try to call it says this function is not supported on my browser. Please help</p>

<h2>            Computer unresponsive after update to Windows Insider Build 14951</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Earlier today I changed my Windows Insider settings to move into the "Fast" ring of Windows 10 Insider builds. When an update became available (I assume the latest build, 14951) I went to install, but after restart received an "inaccessible_root_device" error
 screen. After a moment the computer shut down and is now completely unresponsive on startup. The power light turns on and I can hear the hard drive spin up but screen remains black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>- inserting both my Windows 10 Pro recovery DVD, and a bootable Windows 10 Pro USB drive; screen remains black, no recovery options ever appear</p>
<p>- swapping out multiple monitors, in case something went wrong with the display drivers; all screens remain black, whether using VGA or DisplayPort outputs</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hardware setup is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP ProDesk 400 G3</p>
<p>Intel Core i5 6500 3.2 GHz</p>
<p>Intel HD Graphics 530</p>
<p>8 GB DDR4 SDRAM</p>
<p>1 TB SATA hard drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise! Thank you.</p>

<h2>            how to change the language of references</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I recently switched from Office 2007 (running on WinXP inside Parallels on a MacbookPro) to Office 2011 for Mac.<br />
<br />
I have been using the reference manager on Office 2007, and I will also have to use it in Office 2011 for Mac. Both look somehow alike. But in Office 2011 for Mac I am missing the language field inside a reference. When I insert a citation to my document, the
 page is displayed as "S. 1" (for German "Seite), instead of "p. 1".<br />
Where can I set the language for the references? The document itself is set to English.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!!<br />

            Hmm, you might also be able to modify the LCIDs in the Citation list in&nbsp;

<div><br />
<div>(e.g. Macintosh HD:yourusername:Documents:Microsoft User Data:Sources.xml )</div>

            The language information is in there in the document - in the XML, it's in the b:LCID element of each citation.
<div><br />
<div>But the Mac version of Word doesn't let you set it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>AFAICS the only ways to do it are pretty unhelpful:
<div>&nbsp;a. go back to the Windows version, open the citation for editing, then modify the language</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. save the document and modify the XML of the citation. However, this is more easily said than done. It's essentially a programming operation. I was able to do it using a simple example here by saving as .xml format, then finding the text &lt;b:LCID&gt; and
 modifying the language code that comes immediately after it. But AFAIK the .xml format is not supported and there is a risk in a real document that you might lose information by using it. So you would probably have to&nbsp;</div>
<div>save in .docx format, unpack that (it's a ZIP file), find the Document Part that contains the citations, and edit that part.</div>

                    <span>

<p>Hello everyone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that bothers me a lot with Zune on WP7 is the inability to shut down Zune. Maybe it is just me, but the instruction manual does not say how to turn off Zune either.</p>
<p>After I press the Windows button on the phone, Zune is still playing in the background. This is fine until I decide to connect a Nokia BH - 503 Bluetooth stereo headset. The sound wouldn't transfer to the headset unless Zune has been started after
 the pairing.</p>
<p>While it is annoying, I can live with that, but&nbsp;<strong>I need
 to find out how to restart Zune without rebooting my phone.</strong></p>
<p>I am using an htc HD7 phone. I bought it from a third party retailer and it is not related to any mobile service provider. I use O2 service in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help. Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;Afraid that alot of power&nbsp; needed for this annoying problem</blockquote>
<p>There's no additional power consumption from a track name being displayed in the media controls. &nbsp;Also the presence or absence of the controls isn't indicative of the processing being alive or not as the MediaPlayer is a service that provides sound related
 functionality to other programs. The controls come and go depending on whether or not the last item of media being played audio from your media collection (they don't show if the MediaPlayer has audio from a program's collection or a video).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with with bluetooth transmission has come up in a bugs thread. So I don't think there's a solution to it. The media player controls are functioning as designed but it sounds like you'd like to see it changed. There's a feature request thread
 pinned to the top of the thread list wher you can make a suggestion.&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            In Word 2010, if the Background Removal Tab is missing when you click on the picture, do the following (do not exit the picture):<br />
<br />
Click File Tab in the menu.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
You should see a field headed "Information about &lt;Document Name&gt;" <br />
<br />
This opens a number of options that provide some control over the document you are working on.<br />
<br />
After you click on the FILE TAB, under it near the top should be an icon labelled "convert" and the the right the heading "Compatibility&nbsp; Mode".&nbsp; Click the convert icon once, then go back to you picture click on it again and the Background Removal Tab should
 now be there.<br />
<br />
You can now edit and remove the background.<br />
<br />
I worked this out by trial and error, and there is no instruction anywhere in the MS literature about this that I can find.
<br />
<br />
I assume MS is encouraging everyone to use the .docx formatting, that frustratingly is only compatible with MS products.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It may be the case you are saving your documents in the older .doc format by default, which may be why the newer features are disabled.<br />
<br />
Curiously, if you now repeat the steps above, and click on the FILE TAB again, this time there should be a different icon labelled Protect Document.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Screen rotation &#47; portrait mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlo razzeto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen rotation &#47; portrait mode</h2>
                    <p>I appreciate that Outlook now supports portrait mode by restacking the message list on top of the preview pane when I rotate orientation on my Pavilion x360, but I think it needs to remember the original landscape layout and return to that layout when it
 flips back to be truly useful. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance normally I have a folders column, then messages, then preview pane (pretty typical). Flipping to portrait flipped the message list on top of the preview pane (good I would argue) but it did not lengthen outlook to take more screen space (I argue
 bad, but I could see the counter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real problem for me is when I flip back to landscape -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Outlook does not return to its original size and now occupies a narrower space equallying screen width in portrait.
</p>
<p>2) Users will find the message list *still* on top of the preview pane. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For this to work a little more "app like"&nbsp;a bit more effort has to be put into ensuring outlook continues taking about the same % screen real-estate, and can generally return to original settings when flipping back to landscape.

    <title>N86 8MP Windows 7 64 bit drivers fail to install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> norwins  say:</h3>
<h2>            N86 8MP Windows 7 64 bit drivers fail to install</h2>
                    I have installed Nokia Suite twice (after first uninstalling it and removing all the drivers) and Nokia software update once, but neither product can see the phone connected by the USB cable. Windows is able to load some of the drivers, but depending on
 the time 3 or 4 of the 7 or 8 items windows tries to install fail. ie Nokia N86 USB LCIF fails, Nokia N86 USB Generic fails. Device manager has a flag on all phone related items, except for Nokia N86 USB Phone Parent. During the software installs the software
 sees a phone and asks for it to be removed before continuing with the install, which I comply with. So the software at least partially sees it. The phone is connected by the Nokia supplied cable directly to the motherboard in PC mode and this is a fresh (1
 week old) install of Win 7 64. Any suggestions? Thanks, John

<p>Try to clean your pc totally from nokia software, reboot your pc.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the latest updates in Windows. Install Pc suite (without having your device connected. after installing - reboot your pc. Do not load pc suite, but connect phone to usb and see if windows finds the device and does some driverinstalls.
 Let windows do its thing before you open pc suite. Try now...</p>

            Thanks for the quick response. Followed the noted sequence after uninstalling the software, and then hooked up the phone in PC mode. Before booting PC Suite, I checked Device Manager, and no flags. Looks good, but then I boot PC Suite and no luck, it still
 cannot connect to the phone. Interestingly, after I close the Nokia software, Device Manager has now flagged all but the USB phone parent as noted above. Also, if I go into mass storage mode, no problem, I can see all the files and folders fine. Next steps?
 Thanks

            Having not used the software, I'm not sure I understand the need for the OVI software, but just installed it now with the same effect. Device manger shows all the phone components fine until the software boots then device manager flags them as unable to
 start. The software is all the current versions downloaded today. Thanks

<p>Sorry, this was just a shot in the dark. I was lucky and everything worked for my w7 64 bit. Migh uninstall ovi suite as there has been some issues with those two on one computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can read this thread and see if we missed a spot. At leas it seems fine until you connect your device.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot help you any further, and since this did not work, I would contact Nokia using the "contact us" link on the page. Please post if you find a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is also a shot in the dark, but you could try to set compatiblity mode as vista...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck. Hope somebody can help you.</p>
