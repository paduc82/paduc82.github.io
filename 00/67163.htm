<p>Use some program like autoruns to figure out what is starting up and trying to run and stop it from starting up and trying to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that whatever application was installed or uninstalled improperly by its own means is attempting to run something still and is unable to. You need to find out where it put said startup entry and remove said startup entry. Install.cmd is not something
 that is native to Microsoft, it is something that someone wrote. It is a batch script in fact.</p>

    <title>Several failed security updates to windows 7 64 bit after using Vaio - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Several failed security updates to windows 7 64 bit after using Vaio Care to recover</h2>
                    <p>I have several failed updates after i recoveraed my computer using a program that has come with it called Vaio Care for Sony Vaio PCs. I will try to list as much detailed information here as i can and as I've come to gather. The Vaio Care Recovery System
 seemed to be a program that basically reformats the whole drive and erases everything and then reloads the windows os on to the pc along with the drivers and other programs and ect that it came with. Its suppose to reload everything back to the way it was
 out of the factory. I did that then i proceeded to removing the unwanted programs like the free Norton it came with and the best buy app. I havent touched anything Registry wise just those programs. Then I proceeded to updating Windows 7 as normal and it failed
 several updates. I countinued to search for other updates and update anything else that need to be updated then i looked and noticed it does not say Service Pack 1. It only says Windows 7 64 bit. Here is the list of the updates that have failed along with
 their error codes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update for Windows 7 for x64-based systems (kb2661254) error code 80010108<br />
Security update for Windows 7 for x64-based systems (kb2621440) error code 80004004<br />
Security update for Windows 7 for x64-based systems (kb2584146) error code 80010108<br />
Security update for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1 on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 For x64-Based systems (kb2742598) error code 80010108<br />
Security update for microsoft XML Core Services 4.0 Service PAck 3 for x64-based systems (kb2758694) error code 643</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I entered all the kb numbers into the the installed updates search. All of them show that they are on the installed update list, except for the last one (kb2758694) error code 643. I have no idea how to attempt to reinstall these updates. They do show that
 they failed on the list but give no other options. I did use the automatic Windows update&nbsp;repair tool that i downloaded off of one of the links in the failed error message box. It said it fixed two things. Im using Mcafee anti virus and ive gotten a few error
 reports that were put into the access log. (I didnt install Mafee until after I attempted to install all the updates) However I did try to upgrade to IE10 and couldnt because of service pack issue so i downloaded IE9 and it seems to be working fine. Also I
 have not attempted to to do anything to the windows updates since they've failed except for what ive listed above. I would like some help reinstalling these updates and getting my Windows 7 back up and running properly. Any help is greatly appreciated. Also
 I just noticed this the time on&nbsp;my pc that suppose to sync up keeps syncing up to 2 hours behind the actual time with my time zone being set correctly.</p>

            <p>Method 1 did not work. I downloaded and ran the microsoft fix it tool and checked for updates but nothing came up and there still all but one showing downloaded.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a couple of questions concerning method 2. If I download those specifically failed updates manually do i need to uninstall those updates from the installed update list? Also where do I find those specific updates? Do I just try to download the full
 service pack 1, or is their a way to go there and find each download and manually download each one?</p>

            <p>Nathan, there is an issue that is not addressed by you.</p>
<p>I have several "pending" updates that will fail a manual download and stay in the upgrade list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for failure is that the updates are for x86 system and mine is x64. and two updates are actually for version 8.1. These are all stuck in the update list and update cannot look for new updates because a reboot is being flagged by update. I cannot
 install certain drivers because they notice the reboot flag and stop installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have two successful updates that have not been removed from the list.</p>

            <p>I asked a search engine for "delete stuck pending windows updates", there are some promising results right here in the "answers" forum, e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/how-to-remove-pending-updates-in-windows-7/8ae5c1c8-3000-498a-a62c-e3cba4972c1f">how
 to remove pending updates in windows 7</a>. Your question might be the first search hit, pick an older answer :-) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I recall correctly one of the several "update" FixIts can finish off stuck updates, so there might be a one-click solution if you get the right FixIt for this job.</p>

            <p>I am having this issue too. &nbsp;It occurred spontaneously two nights ago. Up until then I had no issues with connection, now although I can see the internet connection (wireless), it has a strong signal and windows mail will still receive e-mails, I can't access
 ANY web connections. &nbsp;Can't get windows updates, can't use any browser (chrome or ie), can't connect to itunes store. &nbsp;Occasionally if I reboot I get one shot at linking to a web page and then nothing. &nbsp;I have spent hours on this - have used norton removal
 tool to remove vestiges of any norton pre-installed software, no proxy box is checked, have removed</p>
<p>&nbsp;and readded tcp protocols, tried altering DNS settings, removed and restarted winsock from registry. &nbsp;Finally last night I started removing applications - removed google chrome, removed itunes and all components, removed Trusteer rapport (which may have
 been the only thing to update when the problem started and removed my av software (panda). &nbsp;Finally, many reboots later, I thought I had cracked it as I was able to connect to the internet, reinstalled av software, reinstalled chrome, reinstalled itunes and
 managed to do the updates I was trying to do in itunes. &nbsp;BUT, this morning have restarted - when the PC was closing I got a fleeting glimpse off webcheckmonitor error message which disappeared before I could do anything and I am back to square 1 - I.e.I can
 get windows mail but NOTHING ELSE via windows browser. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Help responses advising linking to websites or downloading tools are of no use as I have No Internet Connection. &nbsp;And , yes , I have tried is to do a windows restore, and while I can restore to the most recent time point on 3rd July, going back to any other
 restore point generates an error (0x8007045b) - a Microsoft.windowscommumicationsappsdocx File can't be extracted.</p>
<p>Full scans of my PC with my av software have found nothing.</p>
<p>I am now on the verge of doing a full factory reset but the thought of reinstalling everything makes me want to weep</p>
<p>There must be a solution - all off the forums I have seen are a few years old referring to xp or vista but I am using windows 8 (reluctant upgrader after xp went out of support) and really wish I had that sturdy old OS back!</p>
<p>By the way, I am writing this from an iPad connected to the same wireless router so I know my internet connection is working.</p>

            I DOWNLOADED THE TROUBLE SHOOTER AND it ran some tests and it said the problems were: the service registration was missing or corrupted , I was not connected to the internet and I had no Microsoft account which I have but am unable to login in to because
 of this problem. it fixed the first 2 and said detected for the last one which is the windows account . it then said I should try the task I could not perform (browsing/connecting to&nbsp;the internet on desktop apps)&nbsp;and it still did not work

            Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Xbox
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:

    <title>A major problem on DOA 5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> last aquarius  say:</h3>
<h2>            A major problem on DOA 5</h2>
                    
<p>So basically, I have purchased DOA 5 and was trying it out a few minutes ago. When I got up to the main lobby (game mode selection), every all of the game options (including the offline modes) are being crossed out and made disabled! Only options left are
 Xbox live marketplace and Online Pass. I have updated both the console system and the game, tried to enter the online pass code and nothing changed!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I CAN'T PLAY THE GAME!! PLEASE HELP!!</p>
<p>P.S. I have played this game with a different console and had it saved on cloud in my own account. I have also tried to wipe the save data and it still doesn't work!</p>

<p>That´s a trick question but i have my suspects.</p>
<p>Let me try a theory you played the game first in a friends house and puch your account like a "visitor" and save on cloud correct?</p>
<p>If you do that you have recovery your acount in your console after that?</p>
<p>Go to social enter in enter or out and rescue our profile if that don´t works try a more radical solution</p>
<p>Go in management and delete your profile (THE PROFILE ONLY!!!, and keep the saves)</p>
<p>After go in social in enter or out and go to download profile and download again your profile.</p>
<p>I hope helped you and forgive my bad english it´s all self learnerd.</p>
<p>Edit: I most forgot if you have downloaded the seasson pass there you to do after all this&nbsp;is download again the pass.</p>

<p>I'm having this EXACT problem in the menus except I just opened the package and put the game in my console for the first time. &nbsp;It says something about downloading the free catalog update and NOTHING in the downloadable content says catalog. &nbsp;</p>

<br />
Those things would be blocked off if you dont have any of those items....so if other were using them online, your game wouldnt recognize it at all.<br />
<br />
Also, whats the deal with your Online Pass and other console? <br />
Did you buy the game new?<br />
Is this other console yours or a friends?<br />
Did you download any of these 3 packs and use your online pass on this other console? (and was it under his account or yours?)<br />
<br />
If you were on another console with your account and downloaded or redeemed the dlc and pass, most games would let you access them on your main console<br />
as long as you were connected to XBL....but there are a few very picky games that might still not let you access them.<br />
<br />
If DOA5 is one of those picky games, you will then have to License Transfer back to your main console so you can redownload your season pass and 3 DLC items.<br />
<br />
Now if you redeemed this code on your friends console, under his account, you are pretty much out of 10 bucks and will need to buy a new online pass.</p>

<p>I ran into this as well. &nbsp;The game tells you to download something that is misnamed, which is needlessly confusing. &nbsp;I already redeemed the online pass, thinking that might help, and now it's useless because the update it's forcing on me won't fit on my
 memory card. &nbsp;I have to delete the update and disconnect my network cable just to play the game at all. &nbsp;Boo-urns to Team Ninja.</p>

<p>I too, was experiencing this. &nbsp;This game is picky. &nbsp;I have DOA5, ultimate, and I stopped playing it, because there is almost ALWAYS a new costume catalog update for it whenever I put the game in. &nbsp;Once I download it, I play for a couple of days, and one
 day, I go to play and the menus are all crossed out and telling me I need to download the NEW costume catalog. &nbsp;So just download ALL the free costoume content available for the game. &nbsp;(It's about 3 or 4 GB, so I hope you have space). &nbsp;If this doesn't solve
 the problem, take it into Gamestop, and try and get some of yer money back. &nbsp;I like DOA5, It's a good game. &nbsp;But I bought it to play, not to dowload 100 things, before I'm finally ALLOWED to play. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To troubleshoot the issue with installing Java, follow these methods:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Try to install Java in a
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong></a><span> mode to check if any third party
 application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally
 after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>” to return the computer to a Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Try to uninstall the older versions of Java and then try to reinstall it. You may refer to the following link for Java support:</span></p>

    <title>Windows Vista SP2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nocturne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista SP2</h2>
                    I have been experiencing several problems when trying to install SP2. I have Vista Home Premium, 32-bit edition, and downloaded the standalone version of SP2 (it did not show up in Windows Update). When I run the standalone installer, it shows "Installation
 Was Not Successful," and that an "element was not found." An error code is given: Error_Not_Found(0x80070490). I clicked the link to find out more information, and followed the instructions to run the System Update Readiness Tool. I downloaded it and installed
 it (this presented another error, which was fixed by disabling my antivirus software, NOD-32). I tried running the installer for SP2 again, but to no avail. I then proceeded to restart my computer, after disabling my antivirus software from running at startup.
 After restarting, SP2 installation still did not work, presenting the same error.
<br />
<br />
On another Microsoft help page (http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/thread/24dad7a9-705e-4696-b35c-96fd86fdb33a), I read that might have to repair/update the Windows Update agent, and downloaded the corresponding fix. After running that,
 another error came up: "Windows Update Agent Installer encountered unrecoverable error." I followed more instructions in other Microsoft help pages that involved restarting the Windows Update service, and clearing the update history.
<br />
<br />
Nothing has worked. Please help!!<br />
<br />
I should note that Vista came preloaded on my Thinkpad T500, and I have no installation discs with which to carry out a repair installation.<br />

<p>
Hello nocturne ,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.</p>
<p>
Sorry to hear you are having&nbsp;a problem with this and I&nbsp;understand your frustration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest trying the following :<br />
<br />

<br />

<p>
</p><p>Can you please let me know how to stop "C:WINDOWS\System32\dsregcmd.exe" popping up on starting the computer? Computer runs on Windows 10 Pro; (64 bits).</p>
<p>I've stopped "Send to OneNote" appearing on starting the computer by removing it from "msconfig" --&gt;"Start up". &nbsp;But I don't see anything for this.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Surface 2 Sleep of Death</h2>
                    I've had my S2 for about 48 hours. In that time I've had at least 4 SOD experiences - i.e., the tablet is in sleep mode (from&nbsp;either closing the cover or pressing the standby switch)&nbsp;but it needs to be rebooted to turn back on. What's the problem here?

            <p>Power Button + Volume Up is a combination that works only in the PRO. The links posted in this thread point to discussions on that subforo relative to PRO.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next time that you have any issue, just press the Power Button for 10 to 20 seconds and you will get the same result because like I said, holding the Volume Up is just a lost of your body energy doing something that does not have any effect in the Surface
 2. ;-)</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 firmware update keeps installing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmpacheco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 firmware update keeps installing</h2>
                    <p>We have a Surface Pro 3 that shows the firmware update from 11/7/16 was installed successfully 5 times, firmware version 38.11.50.0. System Information shows the firmware controller version is 32. &nbsp;I have not checked Device manager to see what the date on
 the firmware controller is. Why does it continue to try to install?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have another Surface Pro 3 that shows the same update installed 3 times, this has the battery issue where the battery won't charge. In this case the firmware controller shows 38.11.50.0 shows on the firmware controller in Device manager but system information
 shows as 32. We've done hours of troubleshooting the battery issue which this firmware update is supposed to fix, the problem actually started right after the first time the firmware update was installed. So far the other one does not have a battery issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like Windows does not think the update is installed even though it says successfully installed multiple times. Or it's not really installing it? We have tried downloading and installing manually on the first Surface, without a functioning battery
 it's useless and we don't want the other one to end up with the same issue.</p>

<h2>            How do I add child account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Trying to set up a new Windows 8 machine and add two kids.&nbsp; I have a windows live Id but cannot find anyplace to create a windows Id for children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried clicking various links in the posts from both the windows8 machine and my vista machine which forced me to install windows essentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never see an option to add a child.&nbsp; I never have the option to prove I am an adult by entering a credit card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am beginning to think that buying a windows8 machine was a big mistake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I create a windows live id for my kids so they can get the full functionality of windows8?</p>

            <p><span>Hi RayVojtash,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you want to use Family Safety to monitor your child's computer and online activity, it is normal that you will be advised by the system to install Windows Essentials since Family Safety is part of Windows Essentials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please install Windows Family Safety client on the computer which your child is using. You can download the installer from the link below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home</strong></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After you've successfully installed the client, sign up a&nbsp;new&nbsp;child account at
<a href="http://signup.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://signup.live.com</strong></a>, and reconfigure the client and your child's account in that computer. You can refer to the link below for detailed steps:</span></p>

<h3> erinlen  say:</h3>
<h2>            AAP disabled but still enabled&#63; &#40;Game Trouble&#41;</h2>
                    <div>I upgraded to Windows 8.1 yesterday and discovered the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2907018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AAP</a>&nbsp;problem late last night but was only able to diagnose what was causing the problem this morning. I went ahead and disabled AAP, rebooted my computer, tested my game again and my problem appeared to be gone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, only a few hours later, I tried playing my game again to actually play it and AAP appears to be enabled again but when I went to disable it, it is still set to No Delay.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The symptoms of my problem:</div>
<div>I am able to move my mouse just fine when using the WSAD keys for movement.</div>
<div>I am unable to use M1 or M2, I can press them as many time as a want but as long as I am pressing a keyboard key, they won't do anything.</div>
<div>I am still able to use my scroll button for actual scrolling.</div>
<div>The mouse I am using is a Logitech M570 Trackball. The batteries are good and it functions normally outside of my games.</div>
<div>My list of games affected so far: Spiral Knights, Team Fortress 2. I have these games via Steam.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I have done to try and fix it:</div>
<div>I have checked my mouse's drivers, all are up to date.</div>
<div>I have set my games to compatibility mode and ran them with no change.</div>
<div>I have set the AAP setting to No Delay and should be disabled but clearly isn't.</div>
<div>I have tried other mice, including my touchpad, and all still act like AAP is enabled.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I contacted Microsoft support and I told them my problem. I waited 10 minutes with no response then the chat was closed by tech support so thus, I am posting here.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions? I can provide more information about my system as needed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: I rebooted my machine again. Right after rebooting, AAP is disabled and I can play my games properly. Going to check back again in a couple hours.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Heating up each use</h2>
                    <p>How to keep the Surface Pro 4 from heating up 'all' the time. The system gets so blasted hot I wonder what it's doing to the life of the unit.</p>
<p>It heats up every time I use it, and I've tried every hint on keeping it cool and nothing works.</p>
<p>Microsoft should really help those who have spent so much on these units, and not use the complaints only to improve the next Surface Pro that comes out.</p>

<p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some programs/apps, or outdated drivers may cause overheating issues. What troubleshooting steps have you tried to keep it cool? Have you tried checking the task manager to see what's running in the background? You might want to consider turning off Windows

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>There is a solution to overheat... <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>but I can not ensure doing this will not lose warranty</strong></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Intel XTU to adjust the core voltage of your surface probably will cool the device down for about 5 to 10 degrees. Probably will increase the battery life because the power consumption is lower.</p>
<p>Doing this will not decrease the performance but probably will make your CPU unstable if you lower too much (cause blue screen and you need to reboot the system).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also other ways, you could download software that limit/lock the max clock frequency, which will lower the performance but the system won't heat up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't use those method onto my surface book yet, I am still waiting for the reply from Microsoft, see if doing those cause void warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if you are using the method above, it's gonna be a better idea to ask MS about the warranty issue.</p>
<p>Don't lower you core voltage too much because there will be a higher change to get a blue screen.</p>

<h2>            I want to import music from iTunes to Windows Media</h2>
                    
<p>After getting an ipod for Chistmas I spent 5 days loading all of my CD Music (Genuine originals) to my itunes. I am unable to transfer them to my Windows Media Player. I have looked at advice on your forum and was advised to change my "Import Using" to "MP3
 Encoder" on Edit,Preferences, Advance, Importing but there is no Importing tab.</p>
<p>Please help I have a lot of songs to convert.</p>

<p>There's usually no need to convert all your music files to MP3, because WMP 12 has built-in support for MPEG-4, the audio format used by iTunes.</p>
<p>In WMP's library, click&nbsp; <strong>Organize</strong> , select&nbsp; <strong>Manage libraries</strong> -&nbsp;
<strong>Music</strong> , and add the iTunes Music folder as a library location there. Then, all of your music from iTunes should appear in WMP's library.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"<em><strong>Your PC can't project to another screen; try reinstalling the driver or using a different video card"</strong></em>.&nbsp; How can I get an updated driver that will work?</p>

<br />
<br />I would recommend you rollback to Windows 7 and stick with it.
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows

            <p>Hi Jake,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the printer scans but does not print and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>How did you install the driver?</li><li>When was the last time it printed?</li><li>Do you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>How do you connect the printer to the PC, through USB or wireless?</li><li>Is your printer connected to network?</li><li>Is your computer connected to domain?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li><li>Did you recently upgrade from previous version of Windows to Windows 8?</li></ul>
<p>There could be possibility of the printer driver missing/corrupted/outdated or documents stuck in the queue etc. You can try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>Method 1: </strong>You&nbsp;run printer troubleshooter&nbsp;to troubleshoot any issues with installing a printer, connecting to a printer, and errors with the print spooler by running the printer troubleshooter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Click to run <strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=260616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Printer Troubleshooter</a></strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>If the printer troubleshooter does not help, then we need to delete all the pending files from the print documents queue and then try to print the documents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To delete the documents, you have to stop the print Spooler service (software that temporarily stores print jobs on the PC's hard disk).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can stop print spooler service and then delete all the pending documents.&nbsp;In this ways you start printing the documents again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Press <strong>Windows key and R</strong> on the keyboard together.<br />
b) Type “<strong>Services.msc</strong>” inside the box and press Enter.<br />
c) Click on <strong>Print Spooler </strong>service and right click on it.<br />
d) Click the "<strong>Stop</strong>" button to stop the Print Spooler Service if it is running.<br />
e) Check whether the Startup type is set to Automatic. If not, then set it to Automatic.<br />
f) Go to the following location and delete all the pending documents from the “Printer”. “<strong>C:\WINDOWS\system32\spool\PRINTERS</strong>”<br />
g) Delete all the queued print jobs (select and delete all the files) in the folder so the folder is devoid of pending print jobs. The folder should be empty when you are done.<br />
h) Restart your system and check the Print Spooler Service again to be sure the Print Spooler Service restarts automatically on reboot (since the Startup type is set to Automatic).</div>
<div>i) After rebooting, check the Print Spooler service again and the "<strong>Status</strong>" column for the Print Spooler should read "<strong>Started</strong>".
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>If you have not tried this, visit the printer manufacturer's support website and install the latest printer driver available for Windows 8 and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to: <strong><a href="http://www.support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/HP-Deskjet-1510-All-in-One-Printer-series/5157551/model/5157552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HP Deskjet 1510 All-in-One Printer - Driver</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

                    I do not want to erase all of my bing search history, only certain ones. However, to do that it seems that I have to delete one at a time. Is there a way to select several and then delete?
