            Hi David, once Windows 10 is already activated on that laptop, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Reinstalling Windows 10 will produce a much better result than cloning the old hard drive onto the SSD . . .
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            You can create a image of your current harddrive, and transfer to new. Or you can create a Win 10 media disk. Once installed if Windows came with laptop, it should be tied to your systemboard. It should re-activate with no problems.

            Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

                    <p>Purchased Win 10 Home as USB from Amazon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried installing on my newly built PC... Boots up and gets to setup but the setup perma freezes at authenticate windows screen. I have an unused product key but when I enter it and press next...nothing. If I click anywhere before entering the key.. Nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: tried repair option and that also freezes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't click Anything after I select language and press next or the whole thing hangs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Super frustrating as I am dying to use my newly assembled rig. Can provide specs if useful. All peripherals work, tried all USB ports. BIOS runs smoothly without any hanging issues so I doubt its anything with the hardware.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Mouse cursor keeps disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caiedfwlch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse cursor keeps disappearing</h2>
                    <p>If I leave the computer for too long, it doesn't have a screen saver and just goes straight to saying that some cable isn't connected, and when I do anything like press a button on the keyboard, move the mouse or press the power button, it goes back to normal
 except the mouse cursor is always gone and I can't click anything so it's not just invisible or something but just gone, and will only reappear if I restart the computer. Sometimes, the cursor is there after leaving the cable not connected thing, but then
 the keyboard doesn't work, and one time neither the cursor nor keyboard worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer broke (something about some driver not being installed properly but I don't know which one) and I had to get it fixed after having that computer for 6 months, and it always did the same thing with the keyboard, and now after it came back the
 cursor disappears when I leave the computer long enough that it should go to a screensaver but instead goes to a black screen with a blue-ish rectangle with white text bouncing around saying that a cable isn't connected...</p>
<p>Is there any way to fix this without having to restart the computer? It's extremely annoying because it keeps installing an update each time I restart (why not just install all the updates one time instead of installing an update every single time??) and
 it takes like an hour and then I might decide to leave to do something else and when I get back, I was away too long, the update finished installing, and now I have to restart again because it went to the cable not being connected thing and the mouse is gone
 again before I could even log into the computer.</p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may run the SFC scan and check if this helps. SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows
 files on your computer and replace them as necessary. Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to these steps to perform a SFC scan:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press <strong>
<em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, select <strong><em>Command prompt (Admin)</em></strong> to bring up elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the command prompt type the following command:
<strong><em>sfc<span>&nbsp; </span>/scannow</em></strong> and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c) After the scan, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8 retrieve license key</h2>
                    <p>Hi All.<br />
<br />
A lot time ago a upgrade my HP notebook from Win 7 to Win 8 Enterprise Edition.<br />
<br />
I got Win 8 through an agreement with the school and therefore free. They gave me the product key, but unfortunally I can't find it.<br />
<br />
Now i have to restore my pc , but i can't find the license on the pc.<br />
<br />
I used program like AIDA and BelarcAdvisor.<br />
<br />
The first one give me an invalid key ( like BBBB-BBBB-BBBB-BBBB ) the second one give me only the last four digit, that's not enough.<br />
<br />
BelarcAdvisor specify that Windows 8 full product key isn't stored in the pc, Is this possible?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I searched through the net a valid solution, but anything useful was found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched in ControlPanel-&gt;System too, but even here there are only the last 4 digits.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there a way to find the product key through some program?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I restore my pc via Win8 utilities, do I really need the product key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 reboot failed - cannot recover using recovery disk, cannot restore to factory settings. Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm attempting to wipe the hard drive of an old pc as I'm giving it to a friend but it has gone badly wrong. I'm going to detail the steps that I went through as precisely as I can so that hopefully someone can tell me where I went wrong as what is the method
 to fix that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit of background, I bought this pc back in around 2012. At the time it ran windows 8 I believe, which I then upgraded to windows 10 when that was released. I stopped using it all together when I bought a laptop in 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at first I Went into Settings - Update and Security - Recovery and chose the option to remove everything to Windows 10 factory state. This all went well until it got to 10% installing windows and it froze. I let it run but another 20 mins but it had clearly
 frozen so I forced to shut it down. It then appeared to resume its installation but it gets to a certain point and then says something along the lines of "error installing operating system, please restart". So I would restart and the same thing would happen
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I followed the advice on&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/error-message-the-computer-restarted-unexpectedly/b770f14d-e345-e011-90b6-1cc1de79d2e2">this</a>&nbsp;page and opened a command
 prompt window on startup, opened the registry editor, b<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">rowsed to HKLocal machine/SYSTEM/SETUP/STATUS/ChildCompletion and changed the value on setup.exe from 1 to 3.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This appeared to work as the pc did not show the error message anymore, but it would constantly restart itself over and over. I then used my current laptop, which runs windows 10 and came with it preinstalled,
 to create a recovery drive on a usb. Once again this didn't work, it just said that a new windows cannot be installed on this pc as there is already an operating system on it, trying a different method it came up with an error message saying "the recovery
 process from the recovery dvd has not been successful". I tried to use the system restore button on the windows recovery suite but that just said that windows cannot use system restore. Any troubleshooting also is ineffectual.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I really don't know what to do at this stage. Any instruction that you guys give me would need to be very specific as I'm not a computer expert by any means. Thank you guys, I hope one of you can help
 me!</span></p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried what you suggested but it wasn't successful. I downloaded the Media Creation Tool onto a usb and plugged it into the troubled pc. I booted the usb drive first from the boot menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9e9a6b3-9a83-4159-bac2-79b5d4596761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9e9a6b3-9a83-4159-bac2-79b5d4596761" /></a></p>
<p>I then went through the process of installing it. I used my windows 7 home pro serial code on the side of my pc. I then was prompted to choose between upgrade and custom. I chose upgrade and received this message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83bc0bc2-f036-43f8-a83d-506365a08a40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83bc0bc2-f036-43f8-a83d-506365a08a40" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went back and chose custom. I was given the choice between two drivers to install windows: Drive 0 Partition 1: System (It said that I could not do it on here) and Drive 0 Partition 2. I chose partition 2.
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f14815af-f05a-4562-8148-ec6981deb127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f14815af-f05a-4562-8148-ec6981deb127" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It then began to enter the installation process and then restarted to a loading screen. I was then promted with this screen:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a2dbe1e-c920-4cd0-a05d-2c642ad24490" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a2dbe1e-c920-4cd0-a05d-2c642ad24490" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose the top option. I think the rest are there because I have tried this solution multiple times. I then received this error screen and then my pc froze:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87967f10-cd9e-4ca7-9c8e-615b9d12fa11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87967f10-cd9e-4ca7-9c8e-615b9d12fa11" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sorry for the small image sizes. I'm doing this from mobile and it uploaded small sizes for some reason.</p>

            <p>Corrupted system is one possible cause of the issue that you have. Since the repair installation didn't work, clean installation of Windows 10 might resolve it.

            I followed the instructions exactly and it goes through the installation process but then performs a restart and goes back to the beginning of the installation. It doesn't complete the installation.

<p>Hi, have you ever tried these steps below?</p>
<p>Restart PC, keystroke "Esc" and enter BIOS, choose start(install) from USB,</p>
<p>Then try to install a Windows here.</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t it let me change my e-mail address&#63;</h2>
                    When I set up my computer it asked for an e-mail addy and password to set up the log in. I originally used my gmail account which was nice because everything synced. I don't know how it happened but some how I wound up on my yahoo id to log on to my computer
 through my windows live. I can't figure out how to change it back to the g-mail one because nothing is syncing like it should with the yahoo addy. Even my calendar got disconnected from google some how, because of this. I can rename my computer but the bloody
 thing won't let my change my log on information. WHY?!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!! It's causing me a butt load of problems and I'm about to throw my windows 8 out the window for real.&nbsp;

            <p>PC Syncing requires a Hotmail, Windows Live, Outlook.com or MSN account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Just move your mouse to the bottom-right corner of the screen till the side menu pops up, and click on Settings (gear icon).<br />
2) From there, click on the "Change PC settings" link on the bottom-right.<br />
3) Now you should be on the PC settings full-screen menu. On the left, go to the "Users" section.<br />
4) On the right side, it will show your current account with a button that says "Switch to a Microsoft account".

<p>Once you have setup your Microsoft account (this requires a Windows Live ID (Hotmail or MSN).</p>

            Thanks Andre. That was a huge help. Because it somehow used my yahoo addy for a log in, I had to set up a non-email form of log in so that I could get the part where it said switch to a microsoft account. It's weird because when I originally set up I used
 the gmail addy to make the microsoft account but then somehow it switched over to the yahoo addy. No clue how...maybe when I set the mail part to check all of my addresses or something. It's switched back over now, but I still don't see it syncing to my gmail
 calendar and I don't know why. It used to be that when I would enter an appointment on the laptop, my calendar on my phone would update because they're both signed into gmail and likewise, if I entered an appointment on my phone it would sync to the laptop...but
 for some reason it's still not doing that, even though I have it switched back over. It's frustrating, because some of my work I do on the computer and some of it I do on the go from my android. Without the calendars syncing I kee

            Hi Anna,
<p><br />
If your Google calendar can't be synced with the Windows Calendar app, there's a workaround. If you have an Outlook.com account, you can move your Google calendar events to your Outlook.com calendar and then connect Outlook.com to the Calendar app.<br />
</p>
<p>You can refer to the following articles for further reference.</p>

                    Hi. I purchased my laptop 7 months ago. Windows 10(Home) was already installed in it. Now I want to use the "Fresh Start" tool. After that, will I be asked to pay for Windows 10? Also, I have Office Home &amp; Student 2016 already installed in it. It is available
 for 1 PC only. So, if I Fresh Start, will I be asked to pay for Office Home &amp; Student 2016?<br />

            Hi anoopms453
<br />
<br />The fresh Start will not affect your Windows 10 or Windows 10 licencing. You will just end up with a clean version of Windows
<br />
<br />Please Note: all 3rd party applications, including Office will be removed suring that operation
<br />
<br />Before you do the Fresh Start:
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in
<br />
<br />Make sure you see your Office 2015 installation listed there under your info
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Then when the Fresh Start Completes:
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a> and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted
<br />
<br />Select Install 
<br />
<br />Under Install information, locate that laptop which Office was installed on 
<br />
<br />Select Deactivate Install to deactivate the Office installation 
<br />
<br />Then, click Install to install Office

            Windows should be activated automatically , but for all other applications including Microsoft Office, you will need to reinstall them and for that make sure you have their product key ready. If you lose product key, you won't be able to activate Office
 or other apps where need product key.

            <p>WRT the Windows updates issue, I very recently updated 3 computers that hadn't been used in&nbsp;about 2 years.... 200 plus updates each and&nbsp;the experience is&nbsp;very fresh in my memory. :-) The one problem that recurred many times was mass update batches&nbsp;failing
 because certain of the updates had to be installed individually, or in a certain order, but they weren't identified that way.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I suggest trying each IE10 update individually first. If that doesn't work try downloading the update files manually (from the KB###### links shown in Windows Update) and run the updates from the downloaded files.</p>

<strong>Dear All,</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 72, 72, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 72, 72, 1)">
<strong>In my environment, we have two servers which are running on MS Windows Server 2012 R2 Core without
 GUI, so only I can type the commands to do any configuration on them.</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 72, 72, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 72, 72, 1)">
<strong><strong>So
 now my concern here is that how I can integarte those two servers in one SIEM for logging. As on this machine one HyperV is running and I want to capture the logs of that.</strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 72, 72, 1)">
<strong>What are the configuration steps which I need to perform on the server to get this done?</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 72, 72, 1)">
<strong>Can I capture the logs via Syslog method or is there any agent which needs to be installed or need
 to run any commands in Power Shell mode to get this done.</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 72, 72, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 72, 72, 1)">
<strong>Pls add your suggestions and ideas on this, as this is very critical to fix in RSA SA as per the audit
 finding.</strong></p>

<h2>            Xbox enforcement.</h2>
                    <p><span>I have recently been reported for my previous gamertag (which I paid to change), because apparently it was inappropriate. Half the gamertags i see while playing would be banned in that case. How does xbox draw a line
 between inappropriate and appropriate? It's a terrible system. Even worse, the gamertag I chose was suggested to me?! Now i have been given a randomly generated name which I have to PAY to change again. It seems as though xbox enforcement tries to pick out
 ANY tiny detail in your gamertag that could be classed as inappropriate and proceed to take it down. If i had paid for my gamertag, want to be able to change it for free if it is taken down.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I already asked this question but with no help whatsoever because xbox support cannot do anything about xbox enforcement. So how am i supposed to contact xbox enforcement?</span></p>

</p><p><a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howTo#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Case review</a></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Case Review</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If a player violates the Microsoft Services Agreement or Code of Conduct and receives a suspension, the Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team is committed to ensuring the player understands why. Part of this goal is accomplished through
 proper notification and messaging, but in the event a player is still confused about an enforcement or believes it was not warranted, they may reach out to XBLPET directly through the Case Review process.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
What is Case Review?
</p><p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Case Review is a tool that allows players who have received an enforcement action (for example, an account suspension or forced Gamertag change) to have their enforcement reviewed by a member of the Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team.
 Suspensions are never issued lightly, but Case Review allows Xbox Live members to interact directly with XBLPET and gain greater understanding of the enforcement and why action was taken. In the very rare event that the review determines that a mistake was
 made or the enforcement was not necessary, steps will be taken to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Who can submit a Case Review?
</p><p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Any Xbox Live member with an <strong>
active</strong> enforcement action may submit a case for review through the account's
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/Enforcement/ShowEnforcements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Enforcement History</a>, provided the enforcement meets the following requirements:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The enforcement's duration is greater than 24 hours in length</li><li>The enforcement was issued in the last 12 months</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You may only request a review of your own active enforcement actions, and must be signed in to the account that received the enforcement (or signed in to the parent account if a child account was suspended). Prior to submitting a Case
 Review, you may be prompted to complete a short questionnaire designed to gauge your understanding of the Code of Conduct. Failure to pass this questionnaire will temporarily prevent you from submitting a review, during which time we recommend familiarizing
 oneself with the Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, Xbox device bans are not eligible for Case Review.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
How do I submit a Case Review?
</p><p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Submitting a Case Review is easy, and can be accomplished in several steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><strong>Sign in</strong> to enforcement.xbox.com with the account that received the enforcement action and select the large box with an
<strong>orange hammer icon</strong>, or visit your <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/Enforcement/ShowEnforcements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Enforcement History</a>.</span></li><li><span>Find the enforcement action that you wish to have reviewed, and select
<strong>Apply for Review</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Read the Case Review Terms of Use and agree by clicking the checkbox and selecting
<strong>Agree</strong>.</span></li><li><span>If you are already eligible for a Case Review, select the
<strong>green arrow icon</strong>. If you are not yet eligible, you will be presented with a short questionnaire. These questions help gauge your understanding of the Code of Conduct and associated policies. Upon successful completion
 of the questionnaire, select the <strong>green arrow icon</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Provide any details (up to 500 characters) regarding the enforcement action that may help XBLPET conduct a more complete investigation. This may include context around the activity
 or content that received enforcement, information about your game activity, or any other facts that you believe are worth noting. When complete, select
<strong>Submit</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After submitting, an Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement agent will begin a thorough review of the enforcement action. This includes reviewing available data and re-examining evidence that contributed to the enforcement, taking into account
 any new details that you have provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Case Review status
</p><p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Over the course of the review, your case may show several different status levels, including:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Submit Case:</strong> You are about to submit a case for review. Please make sure to include any relevant information or facts before submitting.</li><li><strong>Under Review:</strong> Your case is currently under investigation by XBLPET.</li><li><strong>Need Info:</strong> XBLPET requires additional information from you. Please refer to the enforcement agent’s latest comment and submit additional details to continue the investigation. Note that not every case will
 require additional information and/or discussion.</li><li><strong>Decision:</strong> The Case Review has completed. Please refer to the enforcement agent’s comments for additional information.</li><li><strong>Summary:</strong> The completed outcome of the Case Review, which you may refer to following the case’s closure.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You can check your Case Review status at any time by visiting your Enforcement History or Case Review History.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Note:</strong> XBLPET welcomes all Case Review inquiries. However, abusive or belligerent behavior will not be tolerated. When submitting a case for review or replying to a request for additional information,
 do not abuse or threaten Microsoft employees or post profane, bigoted, or otherwise provocative content. As with all Xbox Live activities, the guidelines outlined within the Code of Conduct still apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Disregard for these rules may result in the closure of your Case Review. Especially egregious violations may result in additional Xbox Live enforcement action.</p>

            These folders should not be deleted at all. &nbsp; You can open them up and they should have various files in them. &nbsp;I have four of them on my computer. &nbsp; If you feel you are running out of disk space on your computer, you will need to see which programs, games,
 photos, etc. you can do without and then delete them via Uninstall Programs or the appropriate Photo App.

<p>Hello WoolFrankfurt,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you like, another option would be to change the default system font of Windows 10 to use a bold font to make it darker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tutorial below can help show you how to.</p>

            Hi

            Try following one by one. Skip a step which you have already tried.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections / Network / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooters
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt;
<br />1. Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />2. Click Network adapters &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />3. Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />C. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />D.  As a last resort if nothing works - I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            <p>My sound will work fine ,then all of a sudden it will cut out. The only way to get it back is if I restart my computer (&amp; then I have to reset my mouse settings; I don't use the touch pad--I have an external mouse). After reading your issue (updating the
 audio driver &amp; now you don't have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">any</span> sound), I am afraid of any upgrades (yes, I usually have upgrades "ready to go" when I restart my computer in order to get the sound back).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping I can find a resolution to this issue (other than upgrades). Makes me want to go back to 8.1!!</p>

            <p>I have an HP laptop, intel core i3. Touch screen. &nbsp;Not even a year old, never had a problem until now.</p>
<p>I upgrade windows 10 from windows 8.1 (64 bit) system.</p>
<p><span>After upgrade my internal laptop speaker doesn't work at all, I have Realtek HD audio. However, when I plug the speaker into the output, I do get sound thru the speaker.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I &nbsp;updated realtek audio driver and then I uninstalled and reinstalled the driver. No change.</span></p>
<p>Playing a test tone produces and error and says failed to play test tone.</p>
<p><span>Also, in device properties it's says my&nbsp;audio device worked properly. Tried a system scan</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">Start &gt; Run &gt; Type "cmd" Enter&gt; Type "</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">sfc/scannow</span><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">"
 Enter &nbsp;</span>Returned as "windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have restarted and checked that the volume is up several times, Nothing muted.</p>
<p>Also tried&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">1) Start --&gt; Run --&gt; services.msc&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>to restart the windows audio under the services tab. No change.</p>
<p>In the volume mixer there are green bars and sound with the speaker/audio output, but no green bars or sound when I unplug the speaker and go to the internal speaker. Waiting for a solution but until then I can use a speaker.</p>

            <p>Hey MelicaVP, saw your post. So sorry you are having a problem with Windows 10. In general, installing updated drivers is a good way to troubleshoot audio issues. If you look at the steps I provided the orginal forum poster you'll notice a few of the steps
 don't involve updating drivers. Something to try. If all else fails you may want to consider installing an updated driver. Also, you can always contact Microsoft support and they can work with you to resolve your issue one on one.

</p><p>Thank you for the advice. I did an additional upgrade (one that hadn't been done, I guess; I usually get auto upgrades), did a couple of restarts &amp; everything works great now!</p>

            Since posting this reply, I have received updates to the Realtek audio and microphone through my HP support assistant and everything seems to be working fine now. I hope everyone else has had similar experiences. They included the Realtek (LAN) driver
 that enables the Realtek (NIC) chip, and the Realtek HD audio driver, and the Realtek Card Reader Driver. Also there was an update for the Intel (MEI) driver that allows communication between the operating system and the management firmware. Now, when searching
 for solutions in the beginning, I kept finding that everything was updated to the latest version, but since then, these updates were detected and downloaded, and all is well again. Thanks for all of the other helpful posts.

            Looks like everyone on this thread was fixed with updated drivers. Great news. Thanks for installing Windows 10. I'll try to keep an eye on this thread to catch if anyone isn't fixed. Or you can create a new thread with details on your issue. Or you can
 contact Microsoft support for one on one help. Wish you all the best!
