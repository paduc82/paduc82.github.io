<h2>            Is the network adapter card seated properly&#63;</h2>
                    How do I check this on a Gateway 3040GZ without paying a lot for Gateway support.&nbsp; I do not even see info on the wireless card in the user guides on Gateway's support website.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The background:&nbsp; yellow exclamation point in device manager under network adapter;&nbsp; ping 127.0.0.1 sends and receives 4 packets but under ipconfig /all at DOS prompt it says media disconnected.&nbsp; I have reinstalled the updated driver and still no help.&nbsp; In fact,
 the wireless utility in the control panel is not usable.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks for all the help so far.<br />

            Thanks DatabaseBen for confirming what I thought:<br />
<br />
I knew the battery was dead but it was tricky verifying whether the file system was corrupted or the wireless hardware on the motherboard as you explained could be damaged.&nbsp; What I finally did was to go on Gateway's website.&nbsp; They provided instructions for
 doing a system recovery with a "destructive format."&nbsp; Not sure if this was what you recommended earlier but if it was , I finally got there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took about 1 1/2 hours to complete the procedure, perhaps because much of the software installed from the factory
 had been deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also took a risk because I did not have the backup CD's.<br />
<br />
Long story even longer - I was able to get the computer working and after solving another issue, I returned the laptop to my friend.&nbsp; Of course I did not charge him and I thank you immensely for your&nbsp; help and other Microsoft experts who offered advice as well.&nbsp;
 Your suggestions led to a favorable completel resolution.<br />
<br />
Take care - I know I will be back to this website.<br />
<br />

    <title>Acrobat Reader DC hangs with entry from keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kxrx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Acrobat Reader DC hangs with entry from keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded to Windows 10, and my acrobat reader hangs when I type from the keyboard. As such acrobat reader can open pdf files and with mouse pad from laptop, I can operate them.&nbsp; But whenever I am using page down/up keys or coming back from otehr applications,
 the acrobat reader hangs with "not responding" in the title bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this issue with web browsers, thunderbird (that mouse was working but keypad entry was making the applications hanging), but I was able to resolve them by selecting "run as administrator" option while starting. My earlier windows version (Windows 7)
 did not have such issue. I have tried the same (running as administrator) Acrobat Reader DC, but then the reader is not even getting started, but I see a couple background processes in that case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Acrobat Reader DC, but it did not resolve the issue. I am not able to use Acrobat Reader. Also, I am not able to use Microsoft Edge as I am not seeing any run as administrator option therein.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My account has the administrator privilege, but still I need to use the run as administrator option for some applications in Windows 10. Don't see any reasoning behind all these. These kinds of inconveniences are simply unwarranted. Note sure whether going
 back to the previous version is the best option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. <br />
Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</div>
<div><br />
Some Windows functions still require Administrators to explicitly run them as an Administrator. The reason is that the Run As command is there to protect Administrators from themselves and stop rogue processes seeking to run with the elevated privileges of
 the Admin user.</div>
<div><br />
Please refer to the link below to troubleshoot issues with Acrobat reader:</div>

<p><span>Hi, on Fable 3, I did not realise there was a "Kidnapped" quest, and now that i've been to Aurora and become King, I have no idea how to find/marry Elise. (I saved her at the start.) I read online that once you go to Aurora the Kidnapped quest disappears,
 so how can I get Elise now?</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, what you have read online is correct. &nbsp;After going to Aurora you can no longer get Elise on this play through. &nbsp;Unless you have a save from before you went to Aurora, you will not be able to marry her as the only way to propose is through
 the Kidnapped quest.</p>

            <p>"<em>Under the Network adapters only lists my mobile broadband card only</em>" - Your WiFi card is not detected by Windows or it would appear with your network adapters in Device manager &amp; the Network &amp; sharing center.</p>
<p>Go to your BIOS&nbsp;&amp; enable your WiFi card&nbsp;then check in Control panel, Device manager that it is enabled there as well [it should only take Windows a short time to detect &amp; install it after you have enabled it in BIOS then completed the bootup].&nbsp; Wait &amp; check
 there are no driver errors.</p>
<p>Most Dells have WiFi switched on by default [once they are detected by Windows &amp; installed].&nbsp; You can normally use F2 to toggle it on or off and, on mine &amp; I believe others, you can open Control panel, Windows mobility center to do the same.&nbsp; As you toggle
 it on &amp; off, you will see a brief onscreen display of a transmitter tower beaming / not beaming.&nbsp; When it is on you should also see the network icon in your system tray change to the 5 bars to indicate wireless adapter in use.</p>
<p>Then go to somewhere with a wireless signal with a friend who also has wireless.&nbsp; If they see a strong signal but you do&nbsp;not have a strong enough signal to connect successfully, you might have to uninstall a Dell utility called Dell Wireless Card Utility
 or similar - I had to do this as it was fighting Windows for control of the WiFi card and stopping me receiving signals [after I uninstalled the Dell utility, I received strong signals like everybody else].</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Normally something such as Wireless on or Wireless off appears for a few seconds on the screen.</p>
<p>I think you are going to have to refer to the laptop's manual for details of how to switch it on/off and whether or not there is an indictaor of some sort, such as&nbsp;on-screen display or led.</p>
<p>If you cannot find the manual it should be available as a download at the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>Tricky</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<ul>
<li>What were the changes made before the issue? </li><li>How long have you been facing this issue? </li><li>Do you receive any error message?</li></ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may refer these steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step A.<br />
</strong>a. Restart your computer.<br />
b. When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information gently tap the F8 key on your keyboard repeatedly until you are presented with the Windows 7 Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
c. Using the arrow keys, select the Safe Mode option you want.<br />
d. Then press the enter key on your keyboard to boot into Windows 7 Safe Mode.<br />
e. When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Windows 7 will enter Safe mode.<br />
f. Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step B.</strong><br />
If it works fine in safe mode try performing a clean boot to find the root cause.<br />
Refer to the article below for steps about how to start your computer in clean boot state.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.<br />

            Depends, if the drive itself is designed to be removable, remove it and reseat it. If the drive is not designed to be removable then an internal connection may have broken.

<p>At this point I'd recommend seeking assistance from a qualified repair shop. The fact that the lights come on and it spins mean only that it's getting power.&nbsp; The drive has both power and data connections to your computer and it sounds as if the data connection
 is not being made.&nbsp; That could be a bent pin or connector cable, or a more serious problem; either way it could be made worse by continuing to fiddle with it.</p>

<h2>            Should &#34;Smurfs&#34; be banned</h2>
                    <p>Honestly today's standards of gaming is not what gaming truly means. What gaming means is to have fun and honestly ease of stress but now everyone finds it funny to mess with people. Their multiple ways of messing with people including "Trolling and Smurfing". Trolling has always been a thing but Smurfing is somewhat new. Basically someone creates a new account goes into a game and try's their hardest to mess with people. Smurfs are honestly the most annoying thing because majority of the time the game matches you with people your level and so if a person creates a new account they get to play with people who bought the game or are also smurfs. This ruins lower levels experience of playing a game that they spent their earned money on and just decided not to play it. The thing that is worse about this is that YouTuber's are promoting this. Xbox is my favorite console and I hope the higher ups can do something about this because ruining a persons experience because you find it fun is mess

    <title>Cursor Randomely Jumps to Top Right Corner and Clicks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cursor Randomely Jumps to Top Right Corner and Clicks</h2>
                    I've recently had this really annoying problem where my cursor randomly moves to the top right corner of the screen (where the X on most programs are) and clicks, exiting whatever I'm in. This happens when I'm not touching my mouse, when I'm not touching
 my touchpad, and even when I'm not even near my laptop. The cursor jumps to the top right corner and clicks. I'm pretty sure that this is not a mouse or touchpad problem. How do I fix this issue?

            What is the make and model of your laptop?
<br />
<br />Its possible the touchpad sensitivity is too high.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad
<br />Click Additional settings under Related settings.
<br />
<br />See if there are any options there to adjust the sensitivity of the touch pad.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try uninstall the touchpad.
<br />
<br />Press Windows Key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Human Interface Device
<br />
<br />Right click HID-Complian touch pad
<br />Click uninstall
<br />
<br />Press Alt + F4
<br />Press the Windows key + X
<br />Press the letter U
<br />Press the letter R
<br />
<br />Restart in Normal mode and see if the mouse works.

<h2>            Can Not See Zip &#40;Compressed&#41; Files  ..  Windows 7</h2>
                    I have zip files on my hard drive but Windows will not let me see them.<br />
My OS: Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium,&nbsp; System Type: 32 bit&nbsp; Operating System.<br />
I can not compress files by using the&nbsp; ..&nbsp; Send To .. Compressed (zipped) folder, or, Properties &gt; Advance &gt;&nbsp; Check the Compress box then click OK.<br />
I have Folder Options set so I can see file extensions. I tried deleting my WinRAR program, that did not work. And, I tried,&nbsp; cmd /c assoc .zip=CompressedFolder. That did not work. I look for the Compression folder in C:\Windows\System32, and found a folder
 called com.<br />
<br />
If I am right, the compression program was some how deleted .. Am I right?&nbsp; What do I do next? Can I download it from Microsoft and install it?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you get any error message when you try to boot to Windows?</li><li>Do you remember making any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows may not boot if Windows boot files are corrupted. I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try removing any external devices connected to the computer and check if you can boot to the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try running an <strong>Automatic Repair</strong> from the OS disc. If you are using OEM computer you can use Recovery disk.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot into the Windows 8 disc or recovery . (If you did not make one, you can find the ISO file download to create a disc at the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create installation media for Windows 8.1</a> page. You will have to use another computer to do so.
<strong><em>Make sure you create the appropriate version disc, x86 or x64, depending on your current OS build</em></strong>)</li><li>Once selecting your language, time and keyboard settings, click <strong>
Next </strong>to load the next window, then click on the <strong>Repair your computer</strong> link on the bottom left corner of the window.</li><li>You should then be presented with a <em>Choose an Option</em> screen, with
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> as an option to select.</li><li>In the <em>Troubleshoot </em>screen, select<strong> Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Automatic Repair</strong> from the <em>Advanced options</em> screen and then select the target operating system to repair, which would be
<strong>Windows 8 </strong>in this case.</li></ol>
<p>If the repair fails, you could attempt a <strong>System Restore</strong>, but that will be dependent on whether or not there is a restore point saved on your PC prior to the set of updates you installed. You can find the
<strong>System Restore</strong> option in the <em>Advanced options</em> screen described above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<h3> antipragmatist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mistake on Printer Permissions won&#39;t allow any users to print, take control, or delete printer.</h2>
                    
<p>I made a mistake while setting up the printer.&nbsp; I have a 6 year old that is allowed access to the computer, I have used parental permissions in the past, but ...</p>
<p>I just installed the printer and when I set it up, under the security tab, I added the users who could print, then removed "everyone".&nbsp; even with my administrator account, it won't let me edit the settings or delete the printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom Line, Is there a way to fix this without having to re-install the operating system?</p>

<div><br />
<div>1. Log in as a computer admin, click on run, cmd and type regedit&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Navigate to the following keys and delete any entries related to the printer you're having issues with</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\ Windows NT x86\ Drivers\Version-2\</div>
<div><br />
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers\</div>
<div>(That's a 32bit system - if a 64 bit, go to x64 key instead</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Unplug your printer and reboot your system.</div>
<div>4. When the system comes up, navigate to "Devices and Printers" click on the printer and "Remove Device" and confirm deletion of the printer.</div>
<div>5. Plug the printer back in and Windows should re-install the drivers for you</div>
<div>- All permissions will be reset and you can re-assign new permissions making sure you don't lock yourself out this time.</div>

<p>Hi Matheus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this up to our attention. Currently on the Xbox you can only set one account as the Home Xbox. If you make another profile you home Xbox it ends up removing the other person who was previously sharing with you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you'd like more information in regards to the Home Console feature on the Xbox one go over our article:

<p>Well it definitely isn't because of the icon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try just deleting it direct. If you put "inetcpl.cpl" into the run box (right click your start button to reach it), it'll open the old IE Options. From there, hit the delete option for temporary files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to repeat in Edge, and other browsers, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, you can delete them manually from the folders, but that's a hassle we can hopefully avoid.&nbsp;</p>

            I think I tried that before but will give it another shot. If you look at my screen shot my lock icon in front of the temporary internet files is different from your screen shot.

<p>That's just due to dpi settings. At some core depths and resolutions the icons are no longer drawn in 3 dimensions rotated. If you add certain icons to your desktop and hold control while you scroll to resize them, you will see a similar effect at the very
 smallest size when it snaps to a 16 pixel icon. But trust me there's no indication of locked in this cleanup manager tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I am certainly perplexed on why it refuses to remove your files from the folder.</p>

<h2>            About Naughty Bear achievements...</h2>
                    
<p>Hi people! Hoping here someone could help me with some information.</p>
<p>Recently, I bought Naughty Bear Gold Edition. Gotta say, for the bad reviews it had, I have to say this game surprised me because the fun and arcade style replay value. It was very fun to play this game from the beggining to the end on the main story. Now
 I'm just with the DLC chapters 9 and 10.</p>
<p>However, I've come to realize that some (if not all) achievemtents for episode 9 are glitched. No matter how I many times I try to unlock them, the achievements don't pop up. I've even come to use some guides and follow them excatly to unlock them and nothing
 happens. I've been to other forums and some gamers are very sure that episode 9 in particular is glitched for unlocking the achievements and I gotta say that is not far from the truth... I've seen some friends having this achievements but that's because they
 have the normal edition and downloaded the DLC separately.</p>
<p>Please, if anyone has any info regarding this please let me know because there is no forum on NB's website to complain about this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for your help!</p>

<p>Brilliant game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strange that you've had trouble with the achievements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 things you can do are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Delete the DLC from your console and then re-download from your "Historic Downloads" queue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Check out <a href="http://www.360achievements.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.360achievements.org</a> and
<a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.trueachievements.com</a> which are 2 reuputable sites that specialise in unlocking achievements.&nbsp; Both sites will have guides to unlocking achievements and if there are any known glitches they will be listed with
 possible work arounds posted.</p>

<p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

<p>it depends how you complete it though.</p>
<p>if you go through the whole game killing every bear in the same few ways it is boring,the trick is to find all the different ways to kill them and go for the ironic kills for the achievements.</p>

            Hi Richard
<br />
<br />The System Reserved partition is not meant to be optimized, that partition is managed by the Windows System itself and it is an error that it even appears in the Defrag and Optimize App
<br />
<br />That partition will seem to be very fragmented, however, this will not affect the performance of your PC in any way . . .
<br />
<br />If your PC is having startup difficulty, you will need to look elsewhere for the cause, it is not this partitino
<br />
<br />Please explain exactly what happens in detail, when your system boots up . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            installing &#34;Windows Media 9 Series&#34; visualizations</h2>
                    I am trying to install this set of visualizations on Media Player 12: <br />
http://download.microsoft.com/download/b/4/c/b4c0c42c-fb60-40f3-b650-9f661c570c38/wm9viz.exe<br />
<br />
(I presume it's 12, whatever the current version is, it doesn't have any means of identifying it.)<br />
<br />
The visualizations have been downloaded and when I double-click the file to try to install it, give the program permission to make changes, etc. a download window appears very quickly - too quickly for me to see what it's doing - and then vanishes.&nbsp; There are
 no visible changes to WMP or anything else on my computer.&nbsp; I have no idea what the .exe file did or indeed if it's supposed to do anything.<br />
<br />
I am just trying to get some XP-era visualizations on my current version of WMP.&nbsp; What do I need to do to make this work?<br />

            <p>Hi LigerZero</p>
<p>If it is Windows 7, you have WMP 12 installed. </p>
<p>The link you posted is to WMP 9 series visualizations. Have you tried running it in compatibility mode?

<h2>            stuck in safe mode</h2>
                    <p>I have been having problems with IE 11 stops responding.&nbsp; I went into safe mode to see if I cold find a solution.&nbsp; I got stuck in safe mode.&nbsp; I have unchecked the Boot in Safe Mode Box and restarted and it started back in safe mode and the box checked itself
 back into safe mode.&nbsp; I tried system restore and it failed.&nbsp; I don't have network with safe mode.&nbsp; I unplugged the computer to no avail.&nbsp; I read several posts and tried them all.&nbsp; I read a post that said to uncheck boot and go to services and hide all Microsoft
 and disable them then restart.&nbsp; I tried that and it started back normal, but if I go back to msconfig and enable the services then it goes back to safe mode.&nbsp; How do I get my services back an and keep normal startup?</p>

            hello evrendemirkaya
<br />please try this and let me know if helps 
<br />Select Start , choose Settings , then select System &gt; Display.﻿ Under Brightness and color, move the Change brightness slider to adjust the brightness﻿﻿﻿.
<br />
<br />note:Some PCs can let Windows automatically adjust screen brightness based on the current lighting conditions. To find out if your PC supports this, in Display settings, under Brightness and color, look for the Change brightness automatically when lighting changes check box, and then select it to use this feature. This automatic setting helps make sure your screen is readable wherever you go. Even if you use it, you can still move the Change brightness slider to fine-tune the brightness level.

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hello,
<br />Please see the below options:
<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.
