<h2>            Location Services and Apps</h2>
                    I just do not understand why some apps absolutely must know where I am in order to operate correctly.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; why does the Looney Tunes app require my location?&nbsp; It plays cartoons.&nbsp; Why does a camera app that modifies photographs need to know where
 I am located.&nbsp; I understand navigation.&nbsp; I can understand some news apps providing me local news.&nbsp; Buy why of why does a cartoon app have to know where I am to play a cartoon?

            <p>Hello Edward H.Prince,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are having concerns about why some apps require to know your location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only speculate that this is a permission process that the app requires you to go through. It may not be supported for all regions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, to get a good answer to your question, I suggest that you contact the app developers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew Gr.</p>

<h2>            I hate WP7 OS and Microsoft programmers for luring customers into buying WP.</h2>
                    Microsoft, the king of silicon valley, has developed an OS which is ****. As I have bought a WP7, Lumia 710 at a price, where I can not just sell it. So, I have to bear it.  I wonder when the developers were developing WP7 OS, what were they thinking. They just excluded the basic features which even a Chinese phone has like:  -Bluetooth File transfer or at least Photo transfer -Connectivity to Windows desktop OS -Video Formats  The developers must have an android phone or an iphone and they didn't even bothered to have these features in there new **** work. I think they were not paid enough to use their brains. The team lead of OS 7 must have been a depressed soul, who didn't know what was going on in the workspace. Being a Windows Phone, it should have direct connectivity to windows and more options than android, but instead we got a lame ZUNE, who transfers video first converting them, taking years and then transferring them taking another year. I just feel being robbed.  Please deliver

            It surprises me that there seem to be some folks that have recently picked up a WP7, apparently without doing the most basic of investigation into the capabilities and limitations of the platform.&nbsp; I feel for the dissappointment, but it could easily have
 been avoided by coming to the forum in which you are now complaining. Nothing you have found fault with has been a secret for a very long time. Nothing has been sugar coated here. Most have other ways of accomplishing the task. Granted some assumes decent
 access to WiFi or cell data and the internet, but that is a basic expectation for the device. If your environment doesn't support that, this is not the right platform for you. Can you not return the device? Most places have a 15-30 return policy. If that doesn't
 exist in your locale, possible you should be more sure about a purchase before you make it. I think much harder about things with no return, no exchange policies than I do about things I can change my mind about. Then I make sure

<h2>            Palm Treo 700WX disconnects bluetooth</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Palm Treo 700WX and it continually disconnects my bluetooth headset and turns off the bluetooth on the device.&nbsp; I have been struggling with this for about a year now and if I can't find a solution I will be going back to a blackberry which I never
 had a problem with.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried 3 different headsets - 2 Plantronics headsets and the Jawbone headset.&nbsp; I have had 4 different Treo's and I have the same problem everytime.&nbsp; Is there a patch or update available to correct this problem?</p>

            I guess the best person that you can contact with this concern is your School's I.T. Admin since your Office license is for you to be entitled only on using an Office application. Your email address is not the original registered account for your Office

            It means that you have got Store version of Excel installed. Store version of Excel brings its own peculiarities. 
<br />
<br />You need not copy Personal.xlsb here.
<br />
<br />Just create a Personal.xlsb by following instructions in below link and see whether this gets created here. If yes, then you would need to copy all your macros from old Pesonal.xlsb into new Personal.xlsb manually by opening them in VBA editor.

    <title>Digital Signature in Microsoft Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jay88_777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Digital Signature in Microsoft Excel</h2>
                    <p>I am using Microsoft Excel as a form and I would like to include digital signatures from several persons and allowing them also to put remarks on the form when they digitally sign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the&nbsp;first person has signed, and&nbsp;the second person has to sign and put some remarks on the form, the&nbsp;digital signature of the first person disappears or becomes invalid.&nbsp; Is&nbsp;it possible to fix this in Microsoft Excel, so that the second person can digitally
 sign and put remarks on the form without invalidating the signature of the first person?&nbsp; Any advice is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>

</p><p>The first person and second person&nbsp;will be using&nbsp;different PCs to digitally sign the Excel file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, the first person sends the signed Excel file to the second person as an e-mail attachment, then the&nbsp;second person may make some comments on the Excel file before signing electronically.&nbsp; When the second person edits the file and&nbsp;signs it, the
 signature of&nbsp;first person disappears from the Excel file.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks. For several years I couldn't use skype because somebody else had registered with my email address and they didn't let me change it. Now today by chance I checked in and it is free again. I don't want to jinx it by opening new account. In any case,
 I find the interlink with skype and microsoft very confusing and don't want to have to change my passwords for everything if something goes wrong with skype. Thanks again. Hopefully at some point I'll find the account is working and use it.

<p>Surely you can register more than one Skype account on an email address, giving the very useful facility of having different contact groups such as:</p>
<p>social,</p>
<p>work, </p>
<p>work project,</p>
<p>family,&nbsp;</p>
<p>one social / sports group</p>
<p>etc. etc. depending on your contact patterns, with some contacts in multiple accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that you can be online just for that group, so that social contacts would know when they can call for a chat without disturbing you whilst at work, as they would not know with everyone in one account for example.</p>

1. based on the screenshot, does 'unable to preview attachments' means only half of the attachment can be loaded? if not, please make a more detailed description about the exact symptom. some other screenshots are greatly appreciated.<br />
2. by saying â€˜it is not computer related as i have got 2 users to logon to office 365â€™, do you mean they log into owa on the same computer and one user works fine while the other doesnâ€™t? if yes, iâ€™d like to collect both of the owa versions for our further
 analysis. refer to the following steps to get the owa version and share it with us:<br />
1) right click the owa page<br />
2) <strong>view page source</strong>.</p>

<br />
3. since the issue just happened in the last two days, did you modify some settings on the affected account recently?
<br />
4. please change to some other browsers (like ie, firefox, chrome) and check if there is any improvement.<br />
5. is the affected user unable to preview any attachment in owa including word attachment, powerpoint attachment, excel attachment and so on?</p>
<p>any updates will be appreciated.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
sam</p>

<p>1. when i click on a attachment &nbsp;the attachment loads the preview window where i can see inside the document. when another user clicks on a attachment nothing happens (no preview window opens) the user is left with the standard 2 options of download or save
 to one drive</p>
<p>2. my account works perfectly on my computer so i logged out of office 365 and got a user who cannot preview attachments to login. this user still cannot see preview attachments.</p>
<p>please see 2 attached files. i have noticed my version (working) is a lower version number</p>

<p>Hi GarethEntwistle,</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>To further narrow down the issue, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;May I know whether they use the same Outlook Web App policies?<br />
2.&nbsp;I understand that you can preview the attachments. May I know whether other users can preview the same attachments?<br />
3.&nbsp;If possible, please use pst to backup all data for the problematic user. After that, can you remove the license for a short time and re-assign it to the problematic user to re-deprovision the Exchange features.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

<h2>            Unhide Multiple Sheets based on one password</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am quite new to VBA and as such would appreciate any help regarding one specific line that is giving me some problems.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have worksheet with about 15 tabs, they include; a&nbsp;welcome tab (I have a userform that pops up for the user to log in), a LogIn tab&nbsp;(this is the administrator tab with all of the user passcodes and their respective access to certain sheets) and about 12
 other tabs that contain confidential information based on region (South, East, West, etc...). So far example - **all tabs have been *veryhidden* except for the welcome tab</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the LogIn tab: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Column A (passcode)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>JohnSmith123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East</p>
<p>JaneSmith456&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; West&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South</p>
<p>Administrator&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; West&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LogIn</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when John Smith signs in the only tab that is unhidden (visible)&nbsp;is the East tab. When Jane Smith signs in the East, West, North, and South tabs are unhidden, and of course when the administrator signs in all of the tabs are unhidden.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far the below is my code but I am having trouble with the line that specifies what row and what tab should be unhidden (row 5 in the below code), I am trying to use Vlookup function to specify what row but I think I need an array within this Vlookup,
 if multiple sheets are to be unhidden. Any help would be appreciated! </p>

            <p>Your original post was unclear about whether LogIn was the name of a UserForm or of a sheet tab; it used the same for both.</p>

Change "LogIn" to the name of the sheet which contains the usernames and lists of sheets.</p>

            That's probably where the confusion is- I named both the userform and the tab "LogIn". I will change the tab name to "Administrator" and keep the "LogIn" name for the userform.

    <title>Find first space from left to right in MID of cell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterhv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Find first space from left to right in MID of cell</h2>
                    <p>I have several dynamic descriptions with each in own cell and I want to pull out a portion of the cell, but the length varies, the postion varies, needs to be to the left, but all have OZ.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are two examples:</p>
<p>(H) TEST&nbsp;DESC&nbsp;ITEM DRC10 32.38OZ - This is in cell I16</p>
<p>(H) TST&nbsp;DESCS IW&nbsp;TESTS 20OZ 40CT - This is in cell I2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been able to create a formula but gives back more information than is needed.&nbsp; In cell AK16 I have this formula: =IF(ISERROR(MID(I16,FIND("OZ",I16)-5,7)),"",MID(I16,FIND("OZ",I16)-5,7)) and it does return 32.38OZ, which is what I needed.&nbsp; But for
 I2, the same formula will return ST 20OZ and I just&nbsp;want the 20OZ portion.&nbsp; I was trying to see if I can find OZ first (which I do in current formual), then find the first space to the left of this and just keep to right&nbsp;of space.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first from the two
 above, I would find OZ starts in 31, space of 6 to the left, so I take&nbsp;7&nbsp;to the right of the space: 32.38OZ.&nbsp; The second item above would have OZ starting&nbsp;at 26, space would be&nbsp;5, so I take 4 to the right of the space: 20OZ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any dynamic formula ideas to aacomplish this?&nbsp; I need to replace the 7 in the current formula to be dynamic.&nbsp; It will not always be after the 5th space in the description.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the data I have, forunately I have not found a space before the&nbsp;OZ (e.g. 20 OZ),
 so I will rely on this and assume all will be with out space.&nbsp;I am using Excel 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>

    <title>Cannot update child Microsoft account to adult account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rod_732  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot update child Microsoft account to adult account</h2>
                    <p>The problem originated when my mother created a new Microsoft account on a Windows Phone (a new Nokia Lumina Icon). A day or so later an error appeared in the email app saying that there was an error connecting to the account. She later signed into her Surface
 RT with the new account which signed her in, but it would not sync any of her pictures or email (she didn't have much at the time anyway). Upon researching further I found that her account had defaulted to a child account and it will not let me update with
 a credit card to prove that she is an adult. First we saw this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The up hitting "I'm an adult. Why am I seeing this?" We got:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plugging in her age we get:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As can be seen, there is no way to update her as an adult. The other option is to have a parent sign in for her, which you have to pay for, and then change her account to an adult account. I didn't take this route because I didn't want to pay and not have
 it work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have chatted with Microsoft support 3 times and this case was escalated to level 2 and beyond, but the browser I was using crashed. This is getting ridiculous and the only for sure option that I know will work is to clear the two devices and create a new
 account from scratch. Is there any help that you can give me?</p>

<p>Following advice, I did a clean boot...&nbsp; This procedure allowed a hidden Office installation message come up twice during Office 2010 installation:</p>
<p>* PRINTERS...It wasnÂ´t possible to complete operation (error 0x000070a).&nbsp; It already exist a printer or other shared resource with that name..change to other name.......!!!???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...OK</p>
<p>...I click OK and proceed.</p>
<p>2010 Office installation ended apparently correctly!&nbsp; I tried only 2010 outlook and runs OK!</p>
<p>By the way, kb2445957 article over System Register modification was unncessaraly.&nbsp; The register had the&nbsp;correct data!</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your help!!!</p>
<p>....though, I donÂ´t understand the message in the installation proccess.&nbsp; MS should be more explicit and refine its installation procedures!</p>

 you try to connect?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Focusing on the USB port -- does the phone charge when you plug in the wall charger?&nbsp; Will the phone connect to any other PC's?&nbsp; We're willing to help... just need a little more info to work with...</p>

</p><p>I am using word 2013 and now I have to fill in the template with drop down list. Whenever I click on the drop down box, instead of giving me the list, I get this kind of table. Can anyone help to to fix this problem and advise how to get a working drop down
 list instead of this?</p>

            <p>Looking at your illustration it seems the control is probably an ActiveX control. From the Developer Tab (you'll have to add it to the ribbon) uncheck 'Design Mode'. This should allow you to use the controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are developing this template, I would recommend that you use content controls or even Legacy form fields in preference to ActiveX controls for such a document.</p>

<p>
</p><p>design mode off does not help as you can see below. This is a ready template which I have to fill, so it is not me who is developing this form. It does not matter if I have design mode on or off, properties below design mode dimmed or not, I am getting this

</p><p>I did ask you why the&nbsp;FMS Questionnaire-Non-Profit contained a mixture of Legacy FormFields and ActiveX controls, rather than Content Controls not realising that you were not the creator of the form, rather a recipient of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As that form was supplied by the Department of Education of the State of Georgia, and as there is a problem with the ActiveX controls in that form, it is something that the Department of Education of the State of Georgia should fix.</p>

</p><p>The issue with those controls is probably that dealt with in the following article:</p>

            If you want guaranteed (not to mention immediate) support, you must be prepared to pay for it. Two MVPs made good-faith efforts to deal with your problem, and one of them offered to look at your document and then provided a plausible explanation for what
 was wrong with it. If you feel you wasted your time here, feel free to look elsewhere for support in the future.

<p>Whichever shortcut you are using to launch the window, right click it and select properties. Under the 'Run' drop-down, choose "Maximized".</p>
<p>If the window still opens small, try this next:</p>
<p>Grab the corners of the window and drag it to full screen size. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Do not use Maximize</span>. Close all other windows first and this one last. Windows will remember the
<strong>*last*</strong> screen size used the next time you open the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Office 365 Autofill Dates not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 Autofill Dates not working</h2>
                    <p>Information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Running office excel 365 on Pc with windows 10</p>
<p>- Cells are all formatted to long date</p>
<p>- Fill in the first cell (ex. B1) with the date then of course highlight the cell - use the small black '+' to autofill the rest following consecutive dates... HERE LIES THE PROBLEM</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to work fine with digits under 10. Anything more than double digits gives me "#########" or sometimes but more rarely it will do consecutive years with the same day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANY IDEAS!!!?? its driving me mad! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! :) </p>

    <title>Teams sends chat notifications on desktop and mobile - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Teams sends chat notifications on desktop and mobile</h2>
                    <p>As per title, I get notifications on the desktop Teams app, as well as on my mobile even though my mobile is set to "Send notifications only when I'm not active on desktop".</p>
<p>
</p><p>A related issue I face is that the desktop app seems wholly incapable of identifying when I am active on my computer. I often find it reporting me as "away" while I'm busy using the machine. That being said, I believe it to be an unrelated issue to what
 prompted this post. My status was definitely "Available" and I was actively chatting with someone from the desktop yet my phone still alerted me to all their replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S: there is no "Teams" categories to choose from in order to post this. A bit frustrating when Teams has a button for "Feedback" that leads me here.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm having the same issue. I think this is because the team app makes you inactive if you are using another application. You can find a lot of people having this issue here (as well as an official response from Microsoft):<br />
<br />

Hopefully they can fix it soon.</p>

<h2>            Track Who views Documents</h2>
                    Hello, I have a question about SharePoint is it possible to see who views a document ? And I am not referring to the Audit option, an example would be for Polices, can it be set up to see who looks at what policy?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is no Policy to track users to view files and folders. Generating Audit log reports will achieve your requirement. Is there any concern for the option? Please let us know so we can better assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Tina</p>

<p>Hello Tina,<br />
</p>
<p>The concern is for SharePoint online we are going to make a intranet for our employees but we are just trying to decide between SharePoint online and a SharePoint server, but the SharePoint online would be more practical it just doesn't have all the features
 we require.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Aaron</p>
