<h2>            Why I can&#39;t buy a Windows Phone &#40;even though I want to&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've been itching to switch from Android to WP for a while now.&nbsp; Recently, I got to actually try out WP with a long-term loan of a Lumia Icon (929) from a friend of mine.&nbsp; I really like it, in fact I would go so far as to say that WP8.1 is the best smartphone
 OS on the market.... (caveat I haven't tried out Lollipop yet) but I think I'm going to go ahead and upgrade my android phone with a new android phone instead, as much as I would like to join the WP world.&nbsp; Here are a few reasons why:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) No phones to choose from (this is far and away reason #1... by miles and miles.)&nbsp;&nbsp; I use Verizon, and as much as I dislike "big red" I am not willing to use a different provider for several reasons not worth listing here, (but the biggest is reception/coverage).&nbsp;
 There are basically two&nbsp;WP phones on Verizon that are even marginally decent IMO: the Lumia Icon, and the HTC One (M8).&nbsp; Both are getting a little dated from a hardware perspective now, but either would be acceptable to me, and the Icon's camera is really
 nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verizon has stopped selling the Icon for some unknown reason.&nbsp; I could buy one directly from Microsoft, but it would come with WP8, and there is no sign of VZW sending the 8.1 update, let alone a full Denim firmware release, any time soon, if EVER.&nbsp; Even
 though I like the Icon I'm using (which was flashed to 8.1 update by my friend while he worked at Nokia)&nbsp;I refuse to buy a phone that is not only year-old hardware, but also stuck with out-dated software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could buy the HTC One (M8) but it has an SD memory expansion slot, and due to a glitch (feature or flaw or bug, dunno) in the WP O/S, WP8 phones with SD slots will refuse my employer's security encryption requirements.&nbsp; Syncing the phone with my work email
 and calendar is one of the main reasons I wanted to switch to WP in the first place.&nbsp; So the HTC is out.&nbsp; All other WP phones available for VZW are low-end specs/hardware-wise and thus not of interest to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also haven't seen or heard any news about any new phones coming to the market for VZW at all, let alone soon.&nbsp; I don't understand this.&nbsp; Does MS care?&nbsp; If they want WP to succeed they've got to be putting out 2-4 new phones (MINIMUM) per year, with 1-2
 being "flagship" level phones and 1-2 per year being new, but lower end phones (e.g. like the Moto G for Android).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I'm stuck on Google.&nbsp;All of the *BIG* apps are available on WP (Facebook, Twitter, amazon, etc.) so the constant din of reviewers telling us that WP has no apps is false.&nbsp; The apps you want are largely there, except for one glaring exception: Google apps
 are completely missing. For the most part, I was able to find ways to duplicate or work around all the features I needed/used on my android phone, with the Icon.&nbsp; Syncing my gmail and G-calendar with the native apps in WP worked (mostly) beautifully, and syncing
 with my work email &amp; calendar was PERFECT.&nbsp; Every once in a while the google stuff would refuse to sync for several hours to almost a day, giving an error.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden it would fix itself and work fine for the next several days or weeks.&nbsp; So except
 for that occasional google glitch, I loved having my google, work, and MS (live) calendar events all synced in the same calendar, and email synced but seperate, in the same native app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did miss having my google drive accessible.&nbsp; I use both One Drive and Google Drive, and on my android I have both.&nbsp; I also missed Google Hangouts and Google Voice.&nbsp; My GV number has become my primary number I give people.&nbsp; So most of my texts
 and voice messages go there.&nbsp; Calls to my GV number&nbsp;were still forwarded to my VZW number, and so rang on the Icon.&nbsp; Texts though had to be forwarded to my gmail account which then showed up in the native email app which was synced.&nbsp; This worked, but was less
 than ideal.&nbsp; I also used GV for most of my dialing, but especially international calls (which cost next to nothing on GV).&nbsp; This functionality was gone when using the Icon.&nbsp; I think I could have got this set up using Skype, but didn't get to it, and I've never
 been a fan of Skype.&nbsp; GV is&nbsp;integrated with the phone's dialer so it was seemless and invisible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize I'm basically asking to have all my Google apps on a Windows Phone, which sounds strange.&nbsp; "Hey buddy, if you want to switch to WP you've got to switch!"&nbsp; But all these apps are available on iOS, so iPhone users can have both worlds.&nbsp; I know this
 is 100% Google's fault; they have no motivation to develop apps for WP, because WP has virtually no market share.&nbsp; But still, it's a factor.&nbsp; If WP had really good integrated replacements for all these bits and pieces (and for email and calendar they do)&nbsp;it
 would make it easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Nice-to-have features and functionality.&nbsp; This is a bit of an extension of #2, but not really.&nbsp; Cortana is pretty cool, but she's just not fully there (yet?) in comparison to Google Now, at least in my experience (I've never used Siri so can't compare).</p>
<p>Cortana has a terrible time understanding my speach (I'm a native of northern California with professional public speaking experience, a trained classical singer, and experienced stage actor; among my many faults, my speach&nbsp;not being understood has never
 been one of them).&nbsp; Google Now continually amazes me with what it understands correctly.&nbsp; It almost never fails.&nbsp; I have to speak like a robot for Cortana to understand some of my requests.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Google Now seems to use intuitive phrases to do things.&nbsp; "Navigate to (location)" works beautifully with GN, and "location" can be anything from a street address, to the name of a place/building (e.g. "city hall in Sioux Falls"), to something like "the nearest
 gas station".&nbsp; I have yet to figure out how to get Cortana to do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Little to no support.&nbsp; I know Android benefits from the largest user base in the world, and many of those users are uber-experts, and they are all over many different discussion/support forum sites.&nbsp; WP pales here.&nbsp; If you don't have the user base, at
 least get your own experts/engineers online and interacting/helping more until your user base grows.&nbsp; Just as an example,&nbsp;I wanted to try to use Nokia's "device hub" (which seems to be REALLY cool for people with a lot of connected devices (tv, tablet/surface,
 HT receiver, blu-ray player,&nbsp;laptops,&nbsp;NAS, etc.)&nbsp;in their homes)&nbsp;on my Lumia Icon.&nbsp; It wasn't working correctly for some reason.&nbsp; I had no idea how to trouble shoot it.&nbsp; It appears that there are maybe 5 people globally who have even tried to use it, and I
 couldn't find any information on how to work it or how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... what to do?</p>
<p>My friend isn't asking for the Icon back any time soon, so I may just keep playing with it for a while.&nbsp; But I'm eligible for an upgrade, and there are SEVERAL really compelling options in new Android phones, that I'm very tempted by.&nbsp; My only option in
 WP on VZW&nbsp;is a (year-old) Icon crippled with WP8 ("black" firmware).&nbsp; Meanwhile I could get a customized, beautiful Moto-X with Android 5.0/&nbsp;Lollipop for the same price (roughly $100 and a 2 year commitment.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft: do you have any answers to any of my issues?&nbsp; Are there any new phones coming to VZW any time soon?&nbsp; You acquired Nokia's mobile phone division (your&nbsp;#1 hardware developer)&nbsp;then fired most of the hardware developers there.&nbsp; That seems to be shooting
 yourself in the foot.&nbsp; All my other complaints are software related and could plausibly be fixed with time.&nbsp; But if you're not putting out compelling hardware, what are you doing?</p>

            Your contacts are safe. You need to make sure that you are logining with the right Skype ID.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has been moving all to a single Microsoft Account based services including Skype. Hence, a new Skype ID has been given to you on the basis of your Microsoft Account. Your old Skype ID is also preserved. So you can use either old Skype ID to login (to get into your old account) or Microsoft Account to login. This has been causing some confusion among the people.

            It sounds like you have signed into Skype with wrong Skype ID (Nick Name).
<br />
<br />Sign out then try signing in with the email address associated with Skype ID:

<p>HI,</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone had a fix for no sound after the latest update. I struggled to get installed and thought it was a driver error. But all of a sudden it did. But I cannot fix the sound issue. I have tried uninstall in device manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell XPS13 - 9343</p>
<p>I have tried downloading the driver from Dell and Realtek both and it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated BIOS and any driver it will allow to install. A few failed besides the audio. But only audio has the red X.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 1809 18309-1000</p>
<p>In device manager it shows Other:</p>
<p>PCI Data Acq. and Signal Prod. Cont and Unknown with yellow triangle.</p>
<p>Under sound it has Intel Smart Sound Technology (Intel SST) with yellow triangle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have searched online and on machine for drivers but it does not find or says cannot use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much for any help!</p>

<p>I have tried and on the sound it says it found a driver and it downloads it&nbsp; but could not install because it could not find the path? I thought maybe it downloaded somewhere but for some reason cannot see them but I cannot figure where it might have put
 them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Device Manager uninstall the sound adapter then go to the top and Scan for hardware changes.</p>
<p>See if this re-installs the sound adapters and drivers.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If there is more than one adapter when you click on the task bar there is an ^ and it should show all adapters ad you may have to change to get the right one for those speakers.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have similar problem with:</p>
<p>Realtek HD audio on Msi970a-g43 Bios A6/AMD FX8350/16GB/gtx760+radeon R9_380.</p>
<p>Since latest build /18309_rs_prerelease, 181220-1256/ <strong>NO SOUND</strong>, either on my X-Fi Fatality Championship Edition nor on-board Realtek HD.</p>
<p>Have tried all-literally- ALL those combinations w.Realtek driver versions/UAD, WHQL/, searching Intels SST etc etc. Uninstalling/reinstalling. Nope.</p>
<p>Although I can watch variable bar on loudness meter, both for the speakers and microphone, still no sound can be audible.</p>
<p>No difference-speakers or headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody-anything?</p>

<h2>            IE wont open &#34;iertutil.dll&#34; not found.</h2>
                    I have a solid state drive and wanted to get some more free space and ran a disk clean up. Many places recommended checking the box to remove old service pack files since you rarely if ever need to roll back. Ran the clean up restarted etc, and it was
 all fine no issues.<br />
<br />
Tried to run skype, it crashed over and over, re installed and finally someone said "check internet explorer cause skype uses it to run". And behold when i click on internet explorer up pops an error message "The ordinal 701 could not be located in the dynamic
 library iertutil.dll"<br />
<br />
Figured great the disk cleanup removed some IE9 .dll and now I have to fix that. I tried uninstalling 9 but it wouldn't, so I downloaded the install for IE 10 to fix it, install fails.<br />
<br />
I don't use IE for anything, but Skype needs it to run and I sorta need skype for indie game project im working on along with talking to people. Plus MSN messenger is switching over to skype this month and just my luck this happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know worse case scenario I might have to do a complete win 7 reinstall which would be a gigantic pain.<br />

<h2>            Visio page link report</h2>
                    <p><span>Our business process maps (Visio 2010 vdw files) have a main navigation page with links to other pages, and those pages have links back to the nav page or to other sub process pages.&nbsp; Some of these
 pages are not linked to at all meaning they are important to the business process, but have been orphaned and our internal customers are unable to navigate to them.</span></p>

<p>If yes, you can go to Data- check External Data Window to show the link in your file.</p>

            <p>Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your email on this topic and very sorry about my travel-induced delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you need to run the report you're imagining for links among pages within a single Visio file? Or across multiple Visio files? The first will be simpler than the second, although both will probably require writing VBA code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might -- and I emphasize the word <em>might</em> -- be possible to do this without code, but would require adding special data fields to every shape that could contain a link, running a report with output to Excel, and then doing some manual manipulation
 of the Excel file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know which you're trying to accomplish and whether you have ever written VBA code to work with a Visio diagram.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Scott - The report would be within a single Visio file.&nbsp; I have written extensive VBA code for Excel over the years, but have yet to do it with Visio ... seems like an opportune time to learn.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the kind words, Jim. I think your approach will work if you know that every shape should have a hyperlink and the absence of a hyperlink identifies a problem. However, a more general solution might be to use code below to do an inventory of all
 existing hyperlinks and write them to Excel. In Excel, you can sort by the column containing the target page to identify any pages that are not the target of any hyperlinks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub FindHyperlinks()</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim pag &nbsp; &nbsp; As Visio.Page &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim shp &nbsp; &nbsp; As Visio.Shape<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim hyp &nbsp; &nbsp; As Visio.Hyperlink<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Each pag In ActiveDocument.Pages<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Each shp In pag.Shapes<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Each hyp In shp.Hyperlinks<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'write to Excel: pag.Name, shp.Name, hyp.SubAddress<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next hyp<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next shp<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next pag<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: the Subaddress cell of the hyperlink is the one that contains the target page name for internal hyperlinks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, a better idea might be to create a dictionary object, then</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;for each page</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for each shape on the page</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if a hyperlink exists, write the target page name to the dictionary</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; next shape</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;next page</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;sort dictionary by page name and write out the results</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advantage of a dictionary in a situation like this is that it won't accept duplicates, so each target page will appear either zero or one time in the dictionary. This is great if you don't care where links come from or how many there are if more than
 one.</p>

<h2>            How to stop favorites from being synced between two computers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just bought a laptop for my wife,&nbsp; but when it is used it affects my pc (desktop).&nbsp;&nbsp; All my favourites were imported to the laptop and if I delete any of them they get deleted off my pc also. Is there any way I can set it up so it doesn't affect my
 computer?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help,</p>
<p>Ken.</p>

<h2>            Disabled Macro</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a macro attached to file. I have used the macro in the past, but right now it is disabled.
</p>
<p>The message is: "Because of your security settings, macros have been disabled. To run macros, you need to reopen this workbook, and then choose to enable macros. For more information about enabling macros, click Help"</p>
<p>I have been to the Trust Centre settings and it is set to "Enable All Macros".
</p>
<p>Do you know why my macro is still disabled? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>When you open the file, have you clicked the line re macros disabled and then enabled them for the workbook when you open it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise try resetting to Disable all with notification and open the workbook and see if that will allow you to enable on notification when opened. If it works, reset to Enable All Macros.</p>

<p>It might not have anything to do with your problem but sometimes you just need to make a change to force the system to update.</p>

<div>Hi Ernest,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would like to confirm the following information to better understand the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Which Outlook client version are you using? Please provide us with the detailed information
<em>(e.g. version 1901 Build 11231.20130)</em> about this. See <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c#ID0EAABAAA=PC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What version of Outlook do I have?</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>May I know whether you have <em>RoamingCustom.dic</em> in the Custom Dictionaries list? If so, please try to change as default to check this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Regarding the issue "<em>I can now add entries, but my thousands of old entries are no longer there</em>" please provide us with the detailed screenshot for further analysis.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To post screenshot, please refer to steps below：</div>
<div><br />
<div>•<span>&nbsp;</span>On the top ribbon, click on Insert Image, and then Choose File to browser the picture to upload.</div>

<p>
</p><p>Moreover, if the issue happened after updating to latest click to run Office 365 you may roll back to the earlier workable version as a workaround. See

            This article &amp; the additional links it contains should answer your questions. The article uses Word for Windows as the model but the same principles apply:<br />

As a suggestion, you may do well to look into some of the software that's expressly designed for the purpose of creating online forms for data collection. Search the web using criteria such as: form design. You might start with:<br />

    <title>Auto Populate cells based on data entered in another cell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris_kane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto Populate cells based on data entered in another cell</h2>
                    On a worksheet, a number will be entered into cell F3.&nbsp; in Cell F41 I want a dollar amount to automatically fill in based on the number in F3.&nbsp; The problem I am running into is there is a range of numbers that could be entered into F3 that would have the
 same dollar amount.<br />
<br />
If F3 is between 1 and 45, F41 = $150.<br />
<br />
If F3 is between 46 and 60, F41 = $180<br />
<br />
If F3 is between 61 and 89, F41 = $210<br />
<br />
If F3 is between 90 and 105, F41 = $240<br />
<br />
and so on<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; <br />

            One option:<br />
<br />
Create a 2 column lookup table anywhere you wish. It can even be on a different sheet. The example below happens to be in K4:L8. The values may not be exactly right because of the ambiguous use of the term "<i>between</i>" &amp; you didn't indicate whether you're
 dealing strictly with positive, whole numbers, but this is the idea:<br />
<br />
<br />
<u>&nbsp; <b>K</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>L&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp; </b></u><br />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>$150 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>46</td>
<td>$180 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>61</td>
<td>$210 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>90</td>
<td>$240 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>$270 </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
In cell F41 use the formula: <b>=VLOOKUP(F3,K4:L8,2)</b><br />
<br />
Sample results are:<br />
<br />
If the number in F3 is &lt;46, F41 will display $150<br />
If the number in F3 is &gt;45 but &lt;61, F41 will display $180<br />
If the number in F3 is &gt;60 but &lt;90, F41 will display $210<br />
If the number in F3 is &gt;89 but &lt;106, F41 will display $240<br />
If the number in F3 is &gt;105, F41 will display $270<br />

<h2>            Office 365 Account Folders and Apple Mail</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office 356 account and, among other folders, it has the typical folders (inbox, drafts, sent, trash, etc.). &nbsp;I am using Apple mail (the built in&nbsp;apple mail client) to access my accounts and the only folders crossing include Conversation history
 and Clutter. &nbsp;Where are the other folders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of note, in the Apple mail client I did create a new folder and it did cross over and I can see it in Outlook or on the web client. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a new setting that is stopping all folders from crossing? (I have this set as an exchange account)&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you add your account as an Exchange account, you should be able to find your folders. Based on your description, you are using the default Apple mail application. And folders are displayed correctly in Outlook. In this situation, you need to contact apple
 support as the issue is related to the default Apple Mail application. Thanks for your understanding. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same problem with OneNote, and it is very annoying.</p>
<p>Finally I found the solution on this page : <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/37b416a3-626a-4f16-9abd-8582b17cb568/extra-columns-in-excel-onenote?forum=officeitpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
format an embedded excel table in OneNote</a></p>
<p>What a relief ! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps (but maybee you already found it since your post in 2013 !).</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Albin</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS :</p>
<p>- the "insert/table" option proposed did&nbsp;not worked in OneNote 2013 and 2016 (as far as I am concerned) : OneNote would bug and close each time I tried this option.</p>
<p>- the "select all blank column &amp; rows/hide" works fine : more time consuming, but definitely a good workaround</p>

            I've been a Software Engineer for over a decate and have done development on Windows Mobile, iPhone, and Android. From looking at Windows Phone 7 I have to say the development experience is pretty good and on par with development on the desktop environment.&nbsp;
 I've also been using a Windows Phone 7 device for a bit over a month. I won't go into details about my experience with the device (NDA) but I'll say it looks promising. The first Windows Phone 7 devices are expected to be released to the public soon. Don't
 count Windows Phone 7 out of the game yet. You'll be able to examine the real hardware and the apps that developers are making pretty soon.

<p>Developers have access to an emulator, which allows them to test everything they need right from the compiler onto the desktop. I see it as a huge benefit because it eliminates a lot of steps in getting something to real hardware.</p>
<p>There were some devices lent to developers across the globe. Please realize that many of these people got this device because they indicated they were working on a Windows Phone 7 application and&nbsp;recieved this device&nbsp;to be able to test their completed product
 on real hardware....for a week! Many large developers had to beg to get hardware for a longer period just to be able to test all their applications in a decent fashion. So it isn't that every developer that registered got a crate of devices to use whenever
 they wished. Most of them were just able to look at one of them, for a couple of days. On the other hand, I never have seen such a huge investment in developers before an actual product launch (please realize that the devices delivered to developers are prototypes,
 with a huge pricetag because they are hand-made).</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you properly uninstall and remove all other realtime antimalware before installing MSE?</p>
<p>Perform these checks:</p>
<p><span><span>Verify that you have removed<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>all other<span>&nbsp;
</span>real-time antimalware products</strong> that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial product that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc). Then, use the cleanup tools here:<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Verify that Windows Defender is uninstalled (if XP), or Disabled (if Vista/W7).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET).<span>&nbsp;</span>Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Remove Zone Alarm if you have it and use the Windows Firewall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Verify that the Windows Firewall is on, and set to defaults.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Verify that you are not using a proxy server.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Verify that you have “install updates automatically” selected in Windows Update (even though the MSE definition updates are optional).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In IE, reset all security zones to default level.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You may need to remove and reinstall MSE as well.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>And, to improve performance, do a disk cleanup and defrag, and examine the necessity of the number of start up programs you have.<span>&nbsp;</span>To examine your startup programs, go to START, RUN (or START, SEARCH) and enter MSCONFIG.<span>&nbsp;</span>Then,
 use the START UP tab to control the start up programs.</span></span></p>

            You have to buy the product to get the key, same difference. Doesn't matter that you have the trial. You can but at a retail store and just plug in the key or when you open the trial it should ask you if you want to buy it.

<h2>            Word is all in French</h2>
                    I bought Microsoft word and the entire display is in French. All the titles for the categories and tools are all French instead of English, but what I write is in English. I have tried going to Control panel to switch my language, but when I do it still
 has me under english. Thanks in advance for any help. Not sure as I type this whether or not I'm running Windows 8 or 8.1&nbsp;

            Since you have an Office 365 subscription, the simplest solution would probably be to uninstall the French version and download an English one.

<p>Thank you for responding to our query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to resolve the issue by doing the following, uninstall and re-install the OneDrive app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If uninstalling and re-installing the app didn't work or is not an option, perform a soft reset by pressing the
<strong>Volume down</strong> + <strong>Power</strong> buttons until your phone vibrates. It usually takes 15 seconds and your phone should restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If soft resetting your phone still didn't resolve your concern, please <strong>

</p><p>
