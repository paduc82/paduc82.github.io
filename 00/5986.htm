<h2>            Reinstalling my microphone on my HP Envy and fan question</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have two questions. The first regards my microphone. I tried to use Cortana, but it appears I accidentally deleted my microphone? I right clicked on the sound icon, clicked on recording devices, and then right clicked and clicked on disconnected and
 disabled devices, and I have no mic. How do I reinstall it? My computer is an HP Envy that is running windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other question regards the fan in my computer. I got this computer last August, and the fan has always had a little clicking noise since I got it. I was hoping it would go away after a while, but nothing has changed. How can I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help in advance</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Image disappears when saving as PDF &#40;from Word 2007&#41;</h2>
                    I have read the other posts about this issue (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-word/when-i-save-word-2007-doc-as-pdf-text-boxes-drop/e5684db7-65d4-4dc8-af2b-23266b457074) but the original poster didn't reply to follow up questions
 so the issue, at least for me, wasn't resolved... I hope someone out there can help.<br />
<br />
I am using Word 2007 with the built-in save-as-PDF feature. Used it a zillion times, never had a problem. But now I'm working with a very long document; 250 pages with several images in it; lots of formatting. I am also using Endnote as an add-in, to format
 the footnotes and bibliography -- just in case that matters. Oh, and, also, the document is formatted as A4 size... I wonder if that's what's causing this odd behaviour.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is the problem: When I save the document as a PDF, one of the images just disappears from the document. All the rest stay just as they are and everything is fine... but this one image disappears.<br />

<p>If you copy and paste a few pages from the area of the document that contains the problem image into another document and then do the save as pdf, does the problem still occur?<br />
</p>
<p>If so, can you send me a copy of the document (the one into which you pasted the pages in Word Format) and I will have a look at the problem.&nbsp;

            I just tried that... also tried doing it and changing the size back to 8 1/2" x 11", and both times when I convert to PDF the image still disappears. I will email it to you. Thanks!<br />

<h2>            default calendar and sync with windows phone</h2>
                    <div>Welcome.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have Wndows Phone HTC 8X.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Often I use the Outlook calendar and very keen on my calendar synchronization from my phone.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Corporate email on the server we have a non-exchange server, therefore I used to synchronize Microsoft Office Outlook Hotmail Connector.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After connecting to the hotmail account set up appeared to me to be a new calendar calendars.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Assume that my main calendar called Calendar and the new that has appeared called Calendar1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Calendar data are automatically copied to the&nbsp;Calendar1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Synchronize my phone is fine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I now put the question here.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>How to synchronize the two calendars are fixed?</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For example: I get a valid email. I make reply to the meeting (CTRL + ALT + R) and select the option - copy to my calendar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This message appears in the Calendar, but she is not already in&nbsp;Calendar1, and is not it on my phone.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I've tried different combinations of grouping calendars changing their order on the list, but from what I see Calendar is simply connected permanently and Calendar1 mail account is associated with an account on Hotmail. Then copy the calendar is always
 a calendar with your account.</div>
<div>Any simple solution? Program? Or, another way to sync?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yours.</div>
<div><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does your phone sync correctly otherwisem do other cotnacts and notifications come in?
</p>

<p>Then, this looks definately like you will need to contact Outlook Support themselves, on how to best get this fixed:

<h2>            Microsoft Word Missing</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus.&nbsp; The program updated and now all of the programs are there and working except for Word.&nbsp; I tried opening Word tonight using the shortcut I had put on the Start Screen of Windows 8, and got an
 error message that the shortcut was no longer working.&nbsp; I have searched everywhere that I can think of and cannot find Word anywhere in the programs or on the laptop.&nbsp; I am new to the Windows 8 operating System and am getting rather frustrated.&nbsp; Any help would
 be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive Shows 6 Files Remaining to Sync Continuously</h2>
                    
<p>I've been through the basic troubleshooting for this issue with no positive results.&nbsp; The OneDrive icon continues to cycle the green line beneath it an indicates that there are 6 files syncing.&nbsp; There are no red marked folders in the local OneDrive location
 indicating files that have bad file names, etc.&nbsp; There are no swirling arrows indicating folders are syncing.&nbsp; All folders are green; yet, the mysterious syncing 6 files remain.&nbsp; I have searched for folders that violate the naming convnetions; i.e _private,
 and have found none.&nbsp; There are only just over 7000 files so that limitation is not reached.&nbsp; I have done a quick repair on O365 and also paused and restarted the syncing.&nbsp; The entire process has even been stopped and restarted from scratch.&nbsp; Now, I am just
 scratching my head.</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I figure out what files are still syncing? </li><li>What is my next step to resolve this issue? </li><li>is it safe to remove the Unsynced Files folder and will that help? </li><li>Should I rename the local OneDrive for Business folder and let the sync begin all over again?&nbsp; I'm pretty sure the syncing process has been totally restarted at least once.
</li></ol>

<p>Hi waburnam.landolakes.com,</p>
<p>Here are the answers for the questions:</p>
<p>1. If OneDrive for Business is still syncing, you can right-click or press and hold the OneDrive for Business menu icon &gt; Repair. It will create an archive copy of any file that had unsynced changes and places these files in a library folder under C:\users\username\OneDrive
 for Business archives\.<br />
For details, please refer to the article:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-sync-connections-in-OneDrive-for-Business-21aac895-9f32-4e3e-a75a-6f12824f0975?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-sync-connections-in-OneDrive-for-Business-21aac895-9f32-4e3e-a75a-6f12824f0975?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US
</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2. Please try OneDrive for Business Sync Issues Troubleshooter.<br />
<a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/common/survey.aspx?scid=sw;en;3790&amp;showpage=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support2.microsoft.com/common/survey.aspx?scid=sw;en;3790&amp;showpage=1
</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If it doesn't work, you can try to use the OneDrive for Business cache removal Fix it tool:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627
</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3. No, it is not safe to remove the unsynced files directly. It is suggested you back up them firstly.</p>
<p>4. If you have re-synced the library and the issue persists, you can try the steps above to see if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Hale</p>

<p>Hale, &nbsp;I have been through this troubleshooter two different times. &nbsp;I was not able to a identify anything via this tool that was causing the files not to complete syncing. &nbsp;Is there a way that I can identify the 6 files in question? &nbsp;I haven't been able
 to locate a log of any sort. &nbsp;Even after the repair, OneDrive shows 6 files continuously syncing but no red in the file structure indicating where the problem is. &nbsp;Can you think of some particular type of file I might look for? &nbsp;I searched for .pst files but
 did not find any.</p>
<p>Please let me know how to procede.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi waburnam.landolakes.com,</p>
<p>Are you using OneDrive for Business sync client to upload local files to cloud?</p>
<p>If so,&nbsp;to pin point file which violates any OneDrive for Business/SharePoint document library limitations,&nbsp;you&nbsp;may use&nbsp;the fix tool in this KB:<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, since the issue could also be caused by corrupted caches, have you tried the&nbsp;cache removal Fix it tool provided by Hale?<br />
Note: <strong>Backup</strong> all the local documents &amp; files to another place <strong>
before</strong> clearing cache to avoid any loss.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Frank</p>

<p>We were going to use the Cache removal tool but were advised to go through the OneDrive troubleshooting guide one more time. We have been through it twice but I asked the user to go through it again. &nbsp;I will also see if the FixIt tool can identify any file
 naming issues. &nbsp;If this yields nothing, I will try the cache removal tool.</p>

<p>Hi Wab, Unfortunately there is no solution to this problem, this has been an issue with OneDrive for Business for well over a year and it is not fixed, not by the new client and not with any solutions you will find on the internet.</p>
<p>Take a look at my post from over a year ago and the 6 pages of replies from people wih the same issue.</p>

<h3> skylab00  say:</h3>
<h2>            E71 lock code.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Does any one known what to do when I power up the phone it ask me to input my code which at the moment its 0000 and then it asks for my password but when I enter it the phone says its incorrect was working fine this morning and I have had the same password
 since I got the phone luckily I backed up my fone details only a few days ago so I could format the phone or wipe it clean if only I could get passed the pass word stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does any known how I can restart my phone from scratch?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did factory reset the phone a few days ago because Its was doing funny things and its was fine after I done that. Now this has happened It was working fine with my password the last week but not today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice I would be grateful.</p>

<p>The default lock key is 12345. If you can't access your E71, you'll have to bring your device in to a Nokia Care Point.</p>

            do you think is this your mistake purely no this is because of nokia, if you update your phone software it will ask code, even if you enter the rite code, phone will not accept, then you have to go nokia care point, also their might be some charge not
 because of your mistake better am going to throw in garbage

            the same problem happening for me too... On my e72...<br />
<br />
Before 2,3 weeks, i unfortunatly updated my phone's FW, which was the biggest mistake i had done in the recent times...:P<br />
<br />
on the very first day of updation, everything was fine...but problem starts when i restart my phone on the next day.. When it was switching on it asked me lock code and i entered the default 12345..phone showed me lock code error and it was not getting on...
 I tried allmost all codes i known, tried the 3 key hard reset, even again tried to update FW...but everything ends in asking lock code and an error msg and in final a dead phone...<br />
<br />
Then i took it to nokia care...they charged me 200 INR and told me that they restored the key to default...when i tried from the store, its fine, 12345 is working...<br />
<br />
Then i came back home and tried to update the cpntacts and all..and after that i again restarted my phone, which again aksed me code nd ends in the code error msg..<br />
<br />
This time my e72 gones miles further...it told me ''lock code error more than 5 times'' and it locked permenantly asking the PUK code... I called my service provider and collected the code...<br />
<br />
From that dat onwards my phone is alwayz asking me lock code when ever i restart it...and no codes are working...but the only happy thing is that, after that , even if i entered the wrong code ( it is happening alwayz) phone is getting on and i can use it...no
 problem in working....<br />
<br />
I dono what to do now..and im in constant fear that at what time it is going to lock again..

    <title>Some awful Issues with Windows 10 Mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dj morpheus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some awful Issues with Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    <p>Hi, all :-).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile last night on my Lumia 640 LTE, and what a mistake that appears to have been...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading, I have had (and still have) numerous problems, with apps, settings, notifications, audio...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a starting point, I don't have the greatest sight anymore, and now the phone is MUCH more difficult to use, because everything seems to have been reduced in size.&nbsp; Emoticons... More of them, but I can barely see which one I'm choosing, even with
 my magnifying glass :-|.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Text in SMS seems to be smaller, especially whilst typing your message. Some Settings Menu items are TINY.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been a Windows user since 3.11 (and I don't mean 11th March :-P), and a Windows Phone user for over 3 years too, so before anyone from Microsoft suggests it, I know about Ease of Access, and other tools to improve font/text sizes... It's made little
 difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This aside, there are other problems... The Twitter app YET AGAIN is faulty.&nbsp; Notifications not working, despite trying the Windows 8.1 fix for THE SAME ISSUE!.&nbsp; The typing on Twitter is awful, I have to type really slowly to avoid the keyboard choosing
 multiple letters/characters at once.&nbsp; Taking forever to type a Tweet now.&nbsp; Scrolling is jerky at best, doesn't move at all sometimes, or selects @ names # or just selects the Tweet, when all you're trying to do is scroll through the latest Tweets you've received...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notification:&nbsp; Email notifications are ON, but I am only receiving VISUAL notifications, NO AUDIO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other problems:&nbsp; Sometimes you need to access texts etc. whilst on a phone call, but trying to bring-up the navigation controls is a nightmare, as it is in Microsoft Wordament, where I keep clicking the stupid adverts (there used to be a setting in WP 8.1
 where you could enable them on-screen permanently, anyone know where that is in W10M?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are just the problems I've discovered in a little over 13 hours... I suspect I will discover more.&nbsp; After the lengthy delay in releasing W10M, I thought it would at least work properly... How wrong I was &gt;:-(.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions, or do we have to wait for what appears to be ANOTHER faulty OS to be patched AGAIN?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DJM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. Not sure if the topic is in the right section, but there wasn't a choice for "Faulty OS, who do I complain to?" ;-).</p>

            <p>As suspected, I've found more problems...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, replying to this post on my phone... Terrible.&nbsp; Slow to react, and if you make a typo, good luck trying to correct it within 2 minutes, takes forever for the cursor to realise where you need it to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Store Live Tile:&nbsp; Despite turning it off, there it goes... Rolling tile, no matter what you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Audio:&nbsp; Yet more issues with audio, this time ringtones.&nbsp; I have custom ringtones for almost everything, and have done for years.&nbsp; My SMS ringtone is from Star Trek: Voyager - "A vessel has been detected.&nbsp; Unimatrix 4-2-4 grid 1-1-6.&nbsp; Activate!".&nbsp; All I
 get now is... "A vessel has been detected.&nbsp; Unimatrix 4-2-4 gri".</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a way to correct THE SAME ERROR in WP 8.1, disable Banners in notifications, but that doesn't work this time, so I'm left with partial ringtones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apps:&nbsp; No idea if this is deliberate, but BAD IDEA if it is.&nbsp; We now have to close EVERY app by holding-down the back arrow (when you can get it to appear, as mentioned above) and swiping, or clicking X... EVERY TIME!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's just what I've found, I'm certain other users have all kinds of problems of their own.</p>
<p>

 it through the peoples app as it just gives a black screen upon access, cannot add or edit contacts, the disc icon to save a contact number through dialer doesn't work or do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to contact support but they directed me to another support link which doesn't work and no software patch has been provided to rectify either.</p>

            <p>I just checked my phone book (Contacts), and that is intact, but I do Sync certain things between PC and phone, so it uses the People app on my PC as a reference... Not sure if you do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that someone has really "dropped the ball" on this OS.&nbsp; My BIG questions are, did the Insider Preview members actually test this, and did they report any errors back to MS?&nbsp; It really doesn't seem like it... Maybe some of them just wanted the
 OS early? :-S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like yourself, some of my apps are awful, and nowhere close to working correctly.</p>

            <p>This release has serious issues, no doubt. After waiting for the roll-out for a few days, i resorted to the insider app and got .164 release on my 640 XL LTE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hard reset to give the OS a clean slate to work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking good i though, then i noticed the failing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lumia motion data</p>
<p>Gestures &amp; Touch</p>
<p>Rate your Device</p>
<p>Equaliser</p>
<p>
</p><p>All fail on SD card install, requesting to override and install to internal storage instead. I grant permission, the app update redownload, then fails again due to same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Camera app crashes to Start menu regularly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So much about 8.1 was clean, streamlined, intuitive and accessible for those with poor vision, little knowledge of smartphones and assistive technologies that just worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>( a severely vision impaired friend purchased one simply because of how easy it made staying in touch for her )</p>
<p>
</p><p>There used to be an easily accessible link to this support resource in the Lumia Help + Tips app, Microsoft have removed that. Had to use google to find the thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will give it a couple of weeks, then reconsider whether to roll back to 8.1, continue with Windows 10 mobile ( broken edition ), or just go buy a phone that works as it should.</p>

            <p>I'll be honest, I only take pictures at family events now, so I haven't tried the camera at all... Not looking forward to that, so might see if it works later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just been texting my sister, and I couldn't see what I was typing... Just the piggin' keyboard.&nbsp; Had to keep pressing "Back" to remove the keyboard, if only to check for typo's (which are common on mobile, as we all know).&nbsp; Totally ridiculous, even if you
 have full sight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This OS is a tragic mess that shouldn't have been released in this state (Alpha, maybe Beta at best), but... As with the games market (yes, I do still play what I'm able to), patches/updates are all too common now... Release a faulty product, and patch it
 later.&nbsp; 'Unacceptable</p>

            <p>In 10 you can adjust the size of everything in the display, text, apps and items in the display.
</p>
<p>In 8.1 you can only adjust the text size.</p>
<p>You have apparently not found this setting yet. Look in settings, system, display, size of text, apps, and items in the display. Move the slider to the far right, apply, the phone asks to reboot .</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS is still working on notifications, known issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Entering text on this forum has been a problem for a while and is not related to phone operation, it is a forum problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 10, anything in the background you see when you tap and hold the back arrow is suspended in ram, not using processor cycles. You do not have to continually remove them by tapping the X.</p>
<p>You can go back to them quickly with a tap or remove them by sliding them down, off the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have two 830's, same size screen as your 640,&nbsp;one on 10 and the other on 8.1.</p>
<p>With the size adjusted on the one on 10 the size&nbsp;of everything is about the same on both</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info, but I had already found that setting, didn't help me to be honest.&nbsp; Made some things really difficult to read also, because of overlapping text (a problem with zooming on some websites still, even after all the years it's been available).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't like apps running in the background, for two reasons... Annoyance, and they are slightly more difficult to see (especially when you have no colourvision AT ALL, which is the position I'm in).&nbsp; The main reason for getting Windows Phone was for the
 tiles, a LOT easier to see, rather than competitors with tiny icons on multiple screens/desktops ;-).</p>

            <p>So sorry to hear that! I'm not surprised at your reply. At the risk of rubbing salt into the wound I've just done the upgrade and it works for me, so maybe you've just been particularly unlucky, although it does sound as if the problem is a weakness in Windows
 10 itself rather than a bad upgrade.</p>

 is the central focus ring but no outer ring. Several hours later still can't take photos.

            Thanks so much for taking the time to consider my problem. In the meantime I compared the camera app on another person's Lumia 735. In effect, on that model I was shown that the focus button appears in the middle of the screen and to take a photo you press
 the camera image at the bottom of the screen. there must have been an upgrade to my Lumia because previously I pressed the images at the bottom of the screen simply to select camera, video or panorama mode but not to actually take a photo - that was a button
 in the middle of the screen which also operated the focus. So the two functions have been separated. Also discovered that you can now "pinch zoom" prior to taking a photo. So, problem solved after some annoyance. Now I have to return to the village where I
 wanted to photograph a small decorated fountain but was stymied by the upgrade...&nbsp; Many thanks again.

                    Downloads of bank transactions no longer work with latest version of Windows 10 Internet Explorer. At first I blamed the Banking software &amp; even Quicken but I discovered they DO work if I use Google to connect. Hence, problem is with Windows 10 Internet

            Hi Darlene.  
<br />
<br />I assume you mean Chrome since Google is not a browser, but Chrome is.  If you can do what you want with another browser like (the best ones) Chrome and Firefox, then I would use one of them.  You should always have multiple browsers to choose from because Internet Explorer is being phased out and it's replacement in Windows 10 the built-in Edge is still a work in progress.  
<br />
<br />If you think IE might be messed up and not just old and about to be discontinued, you can Reset it in Internet Options &gt; Advanced Settings.  That might help.  More likely the bank has stopped supporting it because it's being discontinued.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.       
        </p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; Yes, I did mean Chrome!&nbsp; And since I use the most recent version of Windows 10, I must be using Edge!&nbsp; I am still stuck in the "old" name rut--sorry about that--partly due to the fact that Microsoft continues to use the term "Internet
 Explorer" in instructions.&nbsp; Also I can no longer easily find version information for Microsoft 10 and Edge.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the banking problem, downloads appear to work -- Bank software allegedly creates a download file of the right type but it just does not open or save when connected via Edge--no warning, no message--just doesn't work.&nbsp; Same bank, same request via Chrome,
 downloads file just fine.&nbsp; Problem does not seem to exist with ALL banks/financial institutions which is why I originally blamed the bank that did have the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this makes sense!</p>

            Hi Darlene -
<br />
<br />IE is still in Windows 10, just hidden until you search for it.
<br />
<br />But if it's Edge then it's still a work in progress and won't work for everything.  One of my banks won't open in it.  
<br />
<br />I use Firefox, Chrome and Edge in that order of preference.  It's best to have all three on your taskbar so you can choose another to keep going if one balks.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            When you use Firefox and Chrome you can also sign in to set up and sync your bookmarks.  Right now I'm signed into my Firefox at MIT library so I can use my 500+ bookmarks.  Edge won't do this reliably.  Just a tip.  Hope it helps.

<h3> ernestgalajda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft word error message when printing&#58; WINWORD.EXE has stopped working.</h2>
                    <p>I cannot print from microsoft word because the error:&nbsp; WINWORD.EXE has stopped working.&nbsp; &nbsp; The error message appears and the document does not print.&nbsp; I have checked the printed using my email account, and it printed fine.&nbsp; The issue is with microsoft word.&nbsp;
 Has anyone else had this problem?&nbsp; I went online and ended up purchasing a program that would scan and repair...found over 1000 issues which it claimed to repair, and the same error message appears when I try to print.&nbsp; Obviously, I was taken by the quick
 fix for this message.</p>

<h3> alice meystre  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I call a word 2011 macro from apple script&#63;</h2>
                    I have a macro in normal.dotx <br />
<br />
Sub doStyle()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Style = ActiveDocument.Styles("MyStyle")<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
I need to transfer data from FileMaker to Word and apply the style (together with other stuff)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I used to have <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do visual basic "doStyle"<br />
&nbsp;in my applescript scripts but it does not compile anymore. <br />
<br />
I saw somewhere that I should use do VB but it does not work either.<br />
<br />
How can I run the macro within the applescript script?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Thanks for the reply Michael.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't used the PropertyAccessor before.&nbsp; I couldn't find much in the way of documentation but this is what I am attempting:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp;&nbsp; Private Sub appointments_ItemChange(Item As Object) Handles appointments.ItemChange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim&nbsp;PropAcc As Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.PropertyAccessor</p>
<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PropAcc = Item.PropertyAccessor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim myvalues As Object = PropAcc.GetProperty("urn:schemas:httpmail:reply-by")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catch ex As Exception<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is myValues contains myValues(0) = DBNULL.&nbsp; Some web pages say that this property doesn't apply to Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please share a bit more of your knowledge?</p>

            <p>Interesting. The DASL name seems to be invalid or unkown to Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does work with the Redemption (www.dimastr.com). That library allows to get the property number from its ID and GUID. This VBA sample works:</p>

&nbsp; Dim ID As Long, Appt As Redemption.RDOAppointmentItem<br />
&nbsp; Set Appt = ...<br />
&nbsp; ID = Appt.GetIDsFromNames("{00062008-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}", &amp;H8560)<br />

<p>An appointment is actually two objects, the Calendar.Item and an Outlook.Reminder object.&nbsp; The reminder object has a Appointment GUID to help you circle through all of the appointments and find the corresponding one.&nbsp; When snooze is hit,
 event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>note : I haven't figured out why but reminderchange often occurs twice after an action.</p>

<p>The runtime error &nbsp;1004 which you describe would occur if the active workbook had never been saved because, in that case, it would have no path and Excel would complain at the resultant file name of: &nbsp;<span>"\" &amp; saveStamp
 &amp; ".xlsm".</span></p>

<h2>            Custom colour palette in Word 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>My Word 2016 doesn't have any 'customise colours' button and i don't know how to change my colour schemes without it. As you can see i have managed to create a custom colour scheme in the past, but i am now unable too. Can anyone offer a solution?</p>
<p>

            <p>I never need to use a custom Theme My understanding Is that themes are created in PowerPoint. You create them and save the through PP but they made available to Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open PP opened help, clicked on PowerPoint then type themes and received these listings<br />
