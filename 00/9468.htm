<h2>            Speed Dial</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to set up traditiaon speed dial on the Windows Phone 7?&nbsp; Do I now need to set up a seperate hub with tiles, or put tiles on the home hub?&nbsp; Can I set it up so that when I go to the Phnoe app and press and hold a number, it will dial
 that person?

<p>There are a couple of applications you could get from the marketplace that would give you a more conventional speed dial,&nbsp; but you could just let the "recent" screen in the People hub serve as your speed dial.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, the "recent" screen will display
 the contacts that you interact the most with and as your interactions with people change, the "recent" screen will adapt automatically</p>
<p>I've been thinking about appending a number before certain contacts' names to force them to the top of the contacts listing.</p>

<h2>            Mobile phone lost</h2>
                    I lost my mobile phone on 26 Mar, 2016. I approached to the nearest police station with an IMEI number to file a complaint regarding this. But, police refused to take the complaint. I tried to lock my mobile I couldn't able to do that I got message like
 "right now your device cannot be locked". Police also not giving any response they are not even ready to hear my complaint. What shall I do? Somebody please help me on this......

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't open my uni emails either. &nbsp;When I checked the help in Chrome it said it may be because I needed the latest version, I checked and I have the latest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another idea said it may be due to the changes in Chrome no longer supporting a certain type of NPAPI plugin that some websites still use, though they stopped using this in September 2015!</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6213033?hl=en</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a bit of a coincidence that this is happening to so many in the past few days. &nbsp;I don't think it's our computers that are the problem!</p>

            Thanks for writing Devlin. &nbsp;A may have found a solution. &nbsp;The problem had been present for about 2 weeks. &nbsp;Usually I would open my Chrome browser and tap on the Outlook.com tab on my menu bar. &nbsp;It would connect with Outlook email until about two weeks
 ago. &nbsp;A few days ago, I noticed that my Bing search engine had an Outlook.com tab on its menu bar. &nbsp;I have been clicking this tab after opening and I can access Outlook email. &nbsp;So for now I think I'm doing okay.

    <title>Why Exchange Online forks email into N copies when sending email via - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why Exchange Online forks email into N copies when sending email via outbound connector</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am writing SMTP server, that process emails sent from Exchange and returns them back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to configure existing Exchange Online environment so that all emails sent from company domain users are relayed to SMTP server for processing, and then returned back to Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the following transport rule:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><span>If the message</span></strong>: Is received from 'Inside the organization'</li><li><strong><span>Do the following</span></strong>: Route the message using the connector named 'Outbound' and Stop processing more rules</li><li><strong><span>Except if</span></strong>: sender ip addresses belong to one of these ranges: 'SERVER_PUBLIC_IP'</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>and the following connector</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><span>From</span></strong>: Office 365</li><li><strong><span>To: </span></strong>Partner organization (or Your organizationâ€Ž's email server)</li><li><strong><span>When to use the connector</span></strong>: Use only when I have a transport rule set up that redirects messages to this connector.</li><li><strong><span>Routing method</span></strong>: Route email messages through these smart hosts: SERVER_PUBLIC_IP</li><li><strong><span>Security restrictions</span></strong>: Always use Transport Layer Security â€Ž(TLS)â€Ž and connect only if the recipientâ€™s email server has a digital certificate.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I also have receive connector, but it is not relevant for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what I noticed is that if email contains N public (To, CC) internal recipients, then Exchange Online sends N email copies to the SMTP server (one email for each recipient, "RCPT TO"). This is really bad behavior for me, as it causes a great performance
 hit on the SMTP server, that have to process the same (absolutely identical) email N times. Assume someone sends email to 100 internal recipients, then Exchange Online will fork this email to 100 copies and send them all to the SMTP server for processing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same situation with private (BCC) internal recipients. But Exchange Online does
<strong>not </strong>fork email for <strong>external </strong>recipients. If email contain N public (To, CC) or N private (BCC)
<strong>external </strong>recipients, then only one copy will be sent to the SMTP server via connector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does not it send one email copy and use several "RCPT TO" commands to specify all intended recipients?</p>
<p>Maybe this is configuration issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I prevent Exchange Online from splitting email to N copies for all internal recipients?</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Edited 2017.09.25</p>
<p>Noticed that behavior is a bit different depending on the client application. Email is always forked into multiple copies if it is sent from OWA. If email is sent from Outlook 2016, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>email is not forked if all internal recipients are regular users (not admins). I have only 4 users in the test environment, so cannot test much. Tested with 3 non-admin users.</li><li>email is forked if O365 admin is in the recipients list.</li></ul>
<p>This might not be related to the issue but anyway decided to share it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks, Oleksii</span></p>

<p>Hi Oleksii,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this the first time you configure the SMTP server? If not, did the issue occur before?
</p>

<p>Does the issue occur to all emails?</p>

<p>Hi <span>Brook.</span></p>
<p>Yes, I was configuring test Exchange Online environment for the first time. I did it some time ago. But noticed this behavior only yesterday (did not pay much attention to this scenario). Probably it worked in
 the same way before. I checked production environment in a company that I work for and found out that the same behavior is present there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It occurs to all emails. If email contains N internal recipients in To, CC, BCC, then N copies will be sent to the SMTP server. I expected up to 2 copies (one for public recipients To, CC, and another for private BCC recipients).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need some screenshots, feel free to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>
<p>Oleksii</p>

<p>I am afraid that Support Engineer will respond in this thread with something like "this is expected behavior".</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as for me this is a big drawback. It hurts performance a lot (just imagine 1000 email copies with 10 MB attachment in each of them). I know that sending big attachments by value (not as ref) is a bad practice, but users do it regularly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, I expected Microsoft to implement ability to create special kind of transport rules in Exchange Online admin center, that are processed before the point when email is forked. In this case I would be able to route and process ONE copy (2-3 if maximum
 recipients per email limit is reached, but not email copy for each individual recipient).</p>

            Robert,
<div>Yeah, the visual reports utility in Project 2010 has some issues. One thing you might try is to change the level of usage data (e.g. 'months' instead of the default 'weeks').</div>
<div><br />
<div>Are you using Cost resources? If so, I know there are problems with those.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately what I don't know is if there are any hotfixes released to address visual report issues. You could check at,&nbsp;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ee748587. But as a minimum, install SP-1 if you haven't already.</div>

    <title>Refining a List with Drop Downs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jesiccag  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refining a List with Drop Downs</h2>
                    <p>I have a list that has parts that we manufacture, and 2 types of 3rd party accessories that fit with certain parts. See below:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Accessory 1 Manufacterer</td>
<td>Accessory 1 Manufacterer Model</td>
<td>Accessory 2 Manufacterer</td>
<td>Accessory 2 Model</td>
<td>Accessory 2 Item #</td>
<td>Our Model #</td>
<td>Our Item #</td>
<td>Data Sheet - B&amp;W</td>
<td>Data Sheet - Reflectors</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I want to filter by this first. (drop down)</td>
<td>It will automatically pull a list of all these models to choose from. (drop down)</td>
<td>This may or may not be applicable. If it is, I want this to be filtered next.&nbsp;</td>
<td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td><td>
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Most of the other information I want to pull based on my selections I make in the first few categories (once I start I'll have a better idea what I want to do with the other columns exactly). Using Excel's filter options takes too long, as I want to be able
 to quickly pull information up while I am on the phone with a customer looking for our parts that fit Accessory 1 and Accessory 2 varieties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I select Manufacturer A, I want my only options for the next drop down to show ONLY options for Manufacturer A, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worked with drop downs before, but I don't know how to make them generate/narrow a list shown below the filter interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought that I could possibly use a Pivot table, but I am getting the feeling Pivot tables can only be used to calculate numbers, not generate lists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a fast learner, so if someone even knows what what I am trying to do is called, that would go a long way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Jesicca</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes, and this is good, but what I want to see are drop downs at the top of the page that will filter the list for me. This way, you know what you are looking at at all times. Does this make sense?</p>
<p>The closest I have come to finding a solution that looks like what I want is this one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://trumpexcel.com/2015/01/dynamic-excel-filter/</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my list is too complicated to justify making the helper columns.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Applying a filter (autofilter) does all that you described.&nbsp; It is at the top of your data and the dropdowns are progressive.&nbsp; As far as your example, you select out of the combobox, so typing in information isn't really necessary and the example doesn't
 really do anything you described in terms of having progressive dropdowns.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ashish has posted a link that appears to require macros&nbsp;to do what autofilters already do but you&nbsp;will make your own decision.

            <p>This is also very good. I also need the drop downs to update a list at the bottom of the page. This might clear up what I want to see:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67e97ab3-fe2e-42ba-b314-0d1f08572431" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom, I can use the filters, absolutely they will get the job done, but I already knew how to do that. The issue is that I have to scroll across the excel sheet to find the column that I want which takes up time and concentration (it's a large, wide sheet
 with many columns). I would like to be able to do the same thing within a few clicks, with no scrolling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ashish, the drop downs are an awesome start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there also a way to pull the categories from a repetitive list, and refine that repetitive list below given the choices in the drop downs? There could also be an Execute button, this all doesn't have to happen in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this make what I am looking for more clear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you guys for your help!</p>

            <p>So in the image above, I want to be able to select the accessory manufacturer Bridge in the drop down, and have the result be only seeing the items in the list below that have Bridge for the Accessory 1 Manufacturer. This would work for each column; if you
 select a particular item in the drop down that corresponds to the column, it will be filtered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I am questioning if this is even possible with Excel. I do also have access to Access, but I have never used it before.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Signing up for The Junk Mail Reporting Program &#40;JMRP&#41;</h2>
                    I tried signing up for Signing up for The Junk Mail Reporting Program (JMRP) at https://postmaster.live.com/snds/JMRP.aspx.<br />
<br />
It asked me to sign the JRML agreement and I have received it and signed it at docusign.com (it has status "completed").<br />
<br />
But the status at https://postmaster.live.com/snds/JMRP.aspx keeps saying "This feed is not active. In order to start receiving feedback, you must sign and return the JMRP agreement."<br />
<br />
After one week I received another agreement to sign at signed that as well. Now I have to signed agreements marked at sa "completed" in Docusign but SNDS still says "This feed is not active. In order to start receiving feedback, you must sign and return the
 JMRP agreement."<br />
<br />
What do am I missing?<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Arne

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Make sure that you and your mom have installed the latest version of Skype and specific system requirements for running Skype on both devices are met.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, kindly provide us information on below questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the Skype version and OS version installed on your device?</p>
<p>2. What is the Skype version and OS version installed on your mom's device?</p>
<p>3. Does this happen to one specific contact or multiple contacts in Skype?</p>
<p>4. Have you tried calling other contact and see if you'll encounter the same issue? Ask the other end to do the same.</p>
<p>5. Have you tried using another device to call your mom to see if the issue remains the same? Ask the other end to do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Isues with new skype versions. Call dropped instantly when attempt to make the call</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype forced me to lock out from using the older skype version today. I then downloaded the latest version of Skype</p>
<p>however, all call I attempted to make instantly dropped out by Skype system.</p>
<p>This has been the same problem I experienced during June this year when I installed a new Skype version</p>
<p>and eventually I had to download and used the older version of Skype 7.21 - and there has been no problem in making a call.</p>
<p>I still have sufficient Pay as you go credit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nwo with this Skype 7.36 that causes an instant drop of calls I made, can you please advise what shall I do to make Skype work for me again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you,</p>

<p>I had the same/similar issue.</p>
<p>I could not call anyone and no-one can call me.</p>
<p>My version of Skye is 7.40 - I updated it because I had exactly the same problem with 7.36.<br />
I could not even call the Skype Call testing service - it attempted a call for a few seconds then aborted.</p>
<p>Also nobody could call me. I could receive and send Instant messages OK.</p>
<p>My status was Online.</p>
<p>I have Skype for Android and Skype for iOS on my phones and they worked with no issue, meaning there was essentially no issue with my Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I took a very radical approach (which I am sure is not endorsed by Microsoft but it Works!). Hah 'Microsoft Works' - the industry's biggest Oxymoron. Here it is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstall Skype</p>
<p>2. Go to the hidden folder \Users\{your username}\Appdata\Roaming</p>
<p>3. Remove the directory 'Skype' including all contents</p>
<p>4. Re-install Skype (you will have to set up your profile again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worked a charm for me. I suspect that you could probably just remove a file or similar in that folder but that's another story.</p>

</p><p><span>Skype is retiring some older versions of Skype to align with Skype's commitment to bring you the latest technology and newest feature Skype has to offer which might have compatibility issues with lower versions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Call drops, calls not connecting and call quality issues are usually caused by connection issue. Please try using a different connection and see if the issue persists. If it does, try the following.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign out and quit Skype. <strong>Make sure that it is not running in the background.
</strong></li><li>Launch Run command by pressing Windows + R keys at the same time. </li><li>On the Run dialog box, type in<strong> %appdata%\Skype</strong></li><li>This will open your Skype folder. Locate a file named <strong>shared.xml </strong>
or shared if your file extensions are hidden then delete it.</li><li>Next, locate a folder named after your Skype name and double click on it.&nbsp;</li><li>Delete a file named <strong>config.xml </strong>or config.&nbsp;</li><li>Exit and rename your entire Skype folder to Skype_Old.&nbsp;</li><li>Re-launch the Skype application.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Y</em><em>our conversation histories are saved in your Skype folder. If you delete this without backing it up, you might not be able to recover some of your conversations.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything that you have suggested and it does not work. I tried downloaded the old version that has been retired, it does work.. but then abruptly one minute later the system signed me out stating that I have been using an outdated version.
 Therefore, I have not been able to used Skype since September 14, 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please bring back the old version that works for me.</p>

<h2>            Emails received in duplicate by recipients</h2>
                    <p>When sending emails from my Hotmail account using my iPhone, the recipients are receiving duplicate copies, sometimes 10 or more times.&nbsp; This only happens when I send them from my iPhone and only started happening when I installed Windows 10 on my laptop
 at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I attempt to delete emails from my Inbox (again using my iPhone), I always get an error message saying "Unable to Move Message" followed by "The message could not be moved to the mailbox Rubbish".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please provide me with clear instructions on how to rectify this problem.&nbsp; As suggested, it only started when Windows 10 was installed on my home computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the incident is only occurring when I access or undertake activities from my iPhone. I access my email directly from the generic Mail &amp; Contacts App on the phone, not through a web browser. I have deleted the account from my phone and then added it again
 without solving the problem. I have also changed the password to try and rectify the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I've checked the outgoing mail settings on my phone, the primary outgoing mail server is smtp-mail.outlook.com. &nbsp;Other outgoing mail servers are turned 'off'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Outlook reports that it is "Unable to move the message" when I move an email from my Inbox to Trash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please HELP as it is driving me insane!</p>

            If you move the mouse off the screen (probably to the left but possibly to the right) the mouse pointer should show up on the other screen. This will allow you to hit the Swap Displays button again.<br />

            <p>Hi Joan Ross Sobba,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are happy to assist you with this. It seems that your son is also having trouble changing his profile picture. This happens possibly due to to the web browser or an issue with the account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's try resolving this by these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sign in to
</span><a href="http://outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Outlook.com</span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></li><li>
<span>Click the cogwheel icon then select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">More mail settings.</span></li><li>
<span>Under </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Reading email,</span><span> click on
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Content from third-party networks</span><span>.</span></li><li>
<span>Select </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Don't show public content from third-party networks.</span></li><li>
<span>Click the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Save</span><span> button.</span></li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>When removing the Facebook account from the account:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>
<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Go to
</span><a href="https://profile.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://profile.live.com/</span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</span></span></div>
</li><li>
<div>
<span><span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Manage below your picture.</span><span>
</span></span></div>
</li><li>
<div>
<span><span>If you see your Facebook connected, click on
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Edit.</span></span></div>
</li><li>
<div>
<span><span>Click the link
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Remove this connection completely.</span></span></div>
</li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Try sending a test email and let us know the result.
</span>If the issue still persists, try changing the profile picture using a different computer/web browser and inform us if the profile picture has been changed.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you.</p></span>

            <p>Thank you Michelle, I will definately do that.</p>
<p>This problem is coming from emails being sent by my son.&nbsp;&nbsp;His email account is with gmail.&nbsp; He had no idea his FC profile pic was attached to his outgoing email.&nbsp; Curses right?&nbsp; As I mentioned he has changed his photo, even closed his FB account, yet the
 photo is still showing up on incoming Outlook emails&nbsp;- to everyone who has Outlook.&nbsp; &nbsp; Any ideas what he should do from his end?&nbsp; I urgently await a reply:)</p>

            <p>Hi Michelle</p>
<p>I did all of the steps you outlined above.&nbsp; When I de-selected show content from a third party network the photo was changed to a icon of a person.&nbsp; HOWEVER&nbsp; after completing several steps to delete the photo&nbsp; I reselected third party networks to test if
 the &nbsp;photo returned.&nbsp; It did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inbetween this:</p>
<ul>
<li>he changed his profile picture in his gmail account</li><li>change his profile pic&nbsp;on his facebook</li><li>closed his facebook account</li><li>deleted the picture altogether</li><li>repeated all of these step using another computer and brower.</li></ul>
<p>The photo is still coming up.&nbsp; Seriously - this is a problem.&nbsp; Is there someone who can help get this sorted out?</p>

<h2>            Removing additional mailboxes - &#34;if you remove this account, its offline cached content will be deleted&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been covering someone's job at work for the last month or so and they gave me their email login details so I can be on top of everything. I added their mailbox to my Outlook account so I didn't have to log in and out, however, now that they're back
 I want to remove their account from my Outlook. When I go to remove, it comes up with the warning message "<strong>if you remove this account, its offline cached content will be deleted</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to remove their account if it means I accidentally delete all their emails over the last month! I am currently using their computer (but logged in as my profile, and my main Outlook account is my own), so I am unsure whether this will delete&nbsp;the
 content <strong>only</strong> from my Outlook account/Microsoft user account, or from the computer as a whole?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove their account, will it affect their emails/account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;A.M.00,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will delete the offline cached content. You can sign in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a> and check if you can find the emails there. If so, the data has been synchronized to server side, and it won't affect their emails/account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a supplement, it is suggested to back up your data. For your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Back-up-your-email-e5845b0b-1aeb-424f-924c-aa1c33b18833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Back-up-your-email-e5845b0b-1aeb-424f-924c-aa1c33b18833</a></p>

Saving a TOC to the gallery is the equivalent of saving the TOC field as an AutoText entry (building block). As others have mentioned,
 to get the same appearance, you also have to save the TOC styles.

<h2>            Trusted Locations - &#34;Security Issue&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am consistantly getting an error message "The path you have entered cannot be used as a trust location for security reasons. Choose another location or a specific folder."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose a specific folder - no dice. &nbsp;I have full read/write delete rights to the path. &nbsp;The administrator was blocked too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried using the UNC - no good. &nbsp;We tried opening Access as the administrator - no good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We run an Access program on local HDD's and the data files for it on the network I am getting fed up with having to click OK everything the program wants to attach in a table from the Project Files. &nbsp; We do this because, despite may be said to the contrary,
 Access programs do not share very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the solution to this issue. &nbsp;It happens in 2010 and 2013 versions....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

            That is usually a content error and in that case there is no way around it. You can try renting the video choosing a different option to watch it (stream/download) then you can contact support for the double charge problem.

<p>Hi Becky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. About the issue that you didn't receive a passcode from Outlook Web app (OWA), firstly, please make sure you&nbsp;correctly&nbsp;entered your phone number</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please also try clicking â€œ<strong>I didn't receive a passcode and need it sent again</strong>â€ to see if you can receive a code from OWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still cannot receive a code, you may disable the "Turn of notifications" feature and re-enable it to see if there is any difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

<p>Hi Becky, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing the screenshoots. From the screenshoot, you are using IE browser, please make sure your IE browser is up to date or you can use a different browser to see if there is any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, to narrow down this issue, please also try following steps and share the results with us:</p>
<p>1. Please restart your mobile phone.</p>
<p>2. Check if your mobile phone set to reject this type of verification information</p>

<h2>            Alcatel Idol 4s with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp; My SD card started showing errors.&nbsp; I let the phone fix it but it didn't work.&nbsp; I finally had to shut the phone down and remove the card.&nbsp; I Tried putting the card into a PC, copying the data off, reformatting the card, copying the data back, and replacing
 it in my phone.&nbsp; The phone still didn't like it.&nbsp; Ok, shut the phone down, copy the data to another SD card, popped it in, and turned on the phone.&nbsp; NOW I have problems.&nbsp; Most of my apps were installed on the SD card.&nbsp; I would click on a blank tile and it
 would attempt to reinstall the app.&nbsp; Nope, errors every time.&nbsp; I finally took the SD card out and tried turning the phone on without one.&nbsp; (There is plenty of space available on the phone.)&nbsp; Nope - the apps still won't install.&nbsp; My Entrust all goes from Starting
 Download to installing back to starting download.&nbsp; Accuweather just keeps wanting to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can resolve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never mind.&nbsp; I restored from a previous backup and the apps are installing fine.</p>

<h2>            Dynamically Changing Cell Value at a Constant Interval, With No Timer &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<div><span>(posted on MrExcel Forum as well)</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Hello;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>1</strong>) A single value between <strong>
90.</strong> and <strong>270.</strong> is manually entered into cell <strong>E15</strong> on "<strong>Sheet1</strong>".</span></div>
<div><span>The corresponding display is Chart "<strong>Fig Projections</strong>".</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>2</strong>) It would be a good idea and very helpful if the chart is somewhat "<strong>animated</strong>".</span></div>
<div><span>By that I mean: instead of the current "static" chart corresponding to a single entered value (E15),&nbsp;replace it&nbsp;with&nbsp;a "dynamic" chart showing successive displays; each&nbsp;at an automatically&nbsp;changing E15 (with a constant interval,
 say, 5).</span></div>
<div><span>That's to say: 1st display would be for E15=90., then replaced with the display for E15=95., then for 100., 105., ..., 260., 265., 270., then repeat for 90., 95., 100., ..., etc. until the&nbsp;chart is no longer active.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>3</strong>) Can one achieve that without the use&nbsp;of a timer (2 sec) ??</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>4</strong>) Are <strong>Tools</strong>::<strong>Customize</strong>::<strong>Menu animations</strong> relevant in this case ??</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Your help, suggestions, comments would be greatly appreciated.</span>&nbsp;</div>

<p>We can do that in a similar way as you want.</p>
<p>Add this code to the code module of that sheet:</p>
<p>--- schnipp ---<br />
Option Explicit</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp; CancelChartAnimation = True<br />
End Sub<br />
--- schnapp ---</p>
<p>And all code below my name to a normal module and assign the macro Diagramm1_BeiKlick to the chart.</p>
<p>Click the chart to start the macro and look at the statusbar too.</p>
<p>Andreas.</p>
<p>Option Explicit</p>

<div><span><strong>Andreas</strong>;<br />
<br />
Thank you for your tremendous help in resolving the issue.<br />
<br />
Here's a summary of what to do to Suppress the <strong>Jiggle/Flicker</strong> running animation (<strong>XL 2003</strong>):</span></div>
<div><span><strong>1</strong>) The initial XL 2003 (flickering problem) w/b consists of a worksheet (data) and a Chart in its own sheet</span></div>
<div><span>....&gt; add a new w/s and place the chart in it (instead of&nbsp;chart in its own sheet. Right-click the chart and select Location)<br />
....&gt; name the new w/s as the replaced chart sheet (for consistency)<br />
....&gt; add a resize routine in <strong>w/s Activate</strong> event to scale the placed chart (to full window)<br />
....&gt; add <strong>Chart Activate</strong> event to freeze animation if you click the chart anywhere<br />
....&gt; add a line to the animation routine <strong>Sub Diagramm1_Beiklick</strong>() to deactivate the chart to suppress flickering</span></div>
<div><span>(refer to Andreas above code, Nov 04, 2010)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span><span><strong>2</strong>) Click the animation macro button on the chart<br />
....&nbsp;Press Ctrl+Break to STOP Animation<br />
....&nbsp;Click chart Or Select another cell to FREEZE Animation<br />
The chart would repeatedly "resize" when animation is interrupted by clicking the chart followed by switching between the 2 w/s.<br />
One&nbsp;needs to STOP the animation (Ctrl+Break) to properly end the session.<br />
</span></div>
<div><span><strong>3</strong>) For those who prefer <strong>
XL 2007</strong>:<br />
The initial&nbsp;(problem) XL 2003 animation w/b&nbsp;(with the chart in its own sheet) would run quietly in XL 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;No flickering/jiggling during the animation!</span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,&nbsp;should one follow the steps in Item 1 above, the chart would NOT&nbsp;repeatedly "resize" when animation is interrupted by clicking the chart (or selecting another cell) followed by switching between the 2 w/s.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong><em>Problem solved</em></strong>!</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Thanks again.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>I have a home computer running win7 x64 Home Premium, and Office2010 (x64). I am connected to the internet via a BT HomeHub Router (wired connection). Recently, my PC has started blocking attachments, including PDFs. The emails with blocked attachments come
 with an attached txt file, which states, for example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The WatchGuard Firebox that protects your network has detected a message that may not be safe.</em></p>
<p><em>Cause : The message content may not be safe.<br />
Content type : application/pdf<br />
File name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Sudbury accepted entries.pdf<br />
Virus status : No information.<br />
Action&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : The Firebox deleted Sudbury accepted entries.pdf.<br />
Recovery&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : cannot restore</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, I do not have a Watchguard Firewall - I do have "Wathcguard Mobile VPN and SSL Client" installed. My AV is MS Security Essentials. Could BT HomeHub use Watchguard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I added a Level1Remove string under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\Security and added .PDF to the string. This seems to work for new PDFs, but I now:</p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot preview the document in Outlook </li><li>I get an Attachment Security Warning forcing me to save the file to disk before opening it.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched online but can't seem to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oisin</p>

            <p>That key does not have anything to do with the blocked message. Delete it.&nbsp; That key forces the attachments to be saved.

<p>I'm not familiar with Watchguard Mobile VPN and SSL Client, but if the client is not doing it, the router or watchguard on the server is. Did it start when you installed the client?

<p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, were you able to use the <em>combo </em>chart type for your pivot table?<br />
<br />
If you are able to, can you provide us a sample screenshot of what you are working on so that we can have a better gist of the results you wanted for your chart.<br />

Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>For this&nbsp;copy-your-contacts feature, you need an originating phone which offers the Bluetooth Phone-Book-Access Profile (PBAP). Your

Nokia 3110 classic</a>&nbsp;is based on the too old Nokia Series 40 <a href="https://www.bluetooth.org/tpg/QLI_viewQDL.cfm?qid=11976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PR 6.1</a>. That release of the operating system did/does not offer PBAP. As solution, you could go for a used Nokia Series 40 phone, sync your Nokia 3110 classic with that (directly via Menu Â» Settings Â» Sync Â» Copy from device) â€“ and then you are able to&nbsp;copy
 to your Nokia 215 from that. For this, you need at least a Nokia Series 40 <a href="https://www.bluetooth.org/tpg/QLI_viewQDL.cfm?qid=13150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>You have to start the download from your Nokia 215 because the Nokia 215&nbsp;lacks the Bluetooth OMA DS Profile (SyncML) for that â€˜Syncâ€™ feature.&nbsp;Because the Nokia C2-00 offeres PBAP, it should work as contact source. Did that help?</p>

<p>Yes. By the way, I am an end-user like you. The situation&nbsp;is even greater: If you go for such a Nokia Series 40 â€“ however in good condition â€“ you would notice that you do not need your Nokia 215 anymore.</p>

            Thank you for your answer, but Nokia 225 doesn't have option of sync with another mobile. So I could not sync Nokia 225 (<span>http://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/phone/225/specifications/</span>) with another phone and transfer all contacts,
 calendar and messages. Really Microsoft forget that someone want to transfer dates from his previous phone. I'm very disappointed with this phone.

    <title>Windows 10 resets Registry settings - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 resets Registry settings</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just recently updated to the Creators Update via the Update Assistant. After updating, I've suddenly encountered a very annoying issue - all my icons were broken and all my installed applications cannot be found by Windows. I remembered setting my install
 path to my HDD (since I have an SSD+HDD rig) via the Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I checked out the Registry, and turns out that the Creators Update also reset the registry in Windows. Really annoying, especially for those who are on an SSD+HDD rig and set the default install path to the D: drive. I've since set it back to normal,
 but the icons remain broken (<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26efeba5-ec3d-4ced-920d-a48556499a48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26efeba5-ec3d-4ced-920d-a48556499a48" height="32" width="32" /></a>).
 Resetting the icon cache does NOT work in this case, sadly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to prevent Windows from resetting the registry back to default when updating to a new version? If there isn't a way, then I really hope Microsoft does something about it. It's annoying to have to update, and realise you have lost access to
 all your programs because Windows decides to reset the Registry to its default settings at will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
