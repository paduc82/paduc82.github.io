<h2>            When is the Surface pen tips coming in stock, and what do you think about them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am thinking about getting the pen tips, but they have been out of stock for a while. On Amazon it even says pre-order (with no date).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those of you that got the pen tip kits. How do you like it? Is it worth the month?</p>

<p>I've already tried that. In fact, I tried that before I made this topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They just said that there is no way of knowing when that will be or what is going on. When I asked how to be notified on when a product is available, they said that's not possible. When I asked them to leave a suggestion for that feature to be added. They
 said they were a low person on the pole, and the suggestion will most likely never get past them.
<br />
<br />
(To me it sounds like a disconnect in Microsoft. Even more so, since the automated phone directory said press X number if you have questions about a product.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In fact, there looks like there is a big communication problem with Microsoft. I can't even find an area to leave suggestions about features like that.</p>

            Hi Mannat.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Run a Startup Repair to check over the boot files:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then do a Startup Trace and post it up here:  <a href="http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/140247-trace-windows-7-bootshutdownhibernatestandbyresume-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/140247-trace-wi...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Microsoft Store and pre-installed apps broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eduji  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Store and pre-installed apps broken</h2>
                    <p>Ever since a few updates ago, most of the pre-installed apps on my computer have no longer worked. This includes (but is not limited to) the photos viewer, the calculator, the calendar, groove music, maps, etc. I have tried many ways to fix this, including
 "src /scannow," which comes through with no problems, and even going as far as to download and reinstall windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The start menu and cortana will also occasionally stop working, however i usually fix this by using "Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}" in powershell. This will
 usually fix the start menu until the next update (after which it breaks again), however cortana stops working every time I turn on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using 3rd party software as replacements to the pre-installed apps, however these are often very buggy. I've previously sought help with this, to no avail, here: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_store/microsoft-store-broken-after-update/b7fd641f-07fe-4e21-b99d-166b6090cdf0?tm=1512698187354&amp;auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help that can be offered would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            When this happens, its best you perform a repair upgrade:

<p>I believe i already did something similar to this, though it was with a different tool than the "MEDIA CREATION TOOL" and iso file, and it didn't help. But, if this is slightly different, I'd be happy to do so again, and I will report back with the results.</p>

            Unfortunately, this did not seem to fix the problem. Once my computer booted back up, the start menu (and cortana) wasn't working, and the pre-installed apps still aren't working either. I can fix the start menu myself, and temporarily fix cortana, but
 I still have no idea for the other stuff.

            Would this end up uninstalling my apps? If possible, I'd rather avoid doing that. But if there's no other way, I suppose I could back them up on an external hard drive first.

            Yes, your apps will need to be reinstalled. 
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />

<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try running your apps again.

<p>Unfortunately, that didn't change anything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, a slight update: while I was looking for other solutions, i came across another similar forum question, which i followed some of the advice of (specifically the 3rd to last comment on it). While it didn't fix my problem, it changed what happens when
 i try to use the apps. Instead of an error message popping up, when I try to open the app using the start menu, a white bar appears under it, with nothing else happening.

            Hi Rose.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is asking you to change an "expired" password.  I've not heard of this.  Can we see a screenshot of the error message?  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />If this is an error in Windows 10 Mail app, go to Mail Settings &gt; Manage Accounts to put your password in which it requires periodically.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 Nvidia Driver Crash</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>last night (29th July) I updated my Windows 8.1 pro to Windows 10 pro via the Microsoft download web page. After about 1.5 hours the upgrade was complete. I allowed some time for the screen resolution etc to 'sort it self out'. I then looked at the drivers
 that had been installed for my Nvidia GTX 980, only to find it was a Microsoft version. I also noticed that my Nvidia Geforce Experiance software was missing. I went to the Nvidia web page and downloaded it, and then installed it. This then told me that there
 was a 'new' graphics driver for Windows 10 (ver 353.62), I then accepted that it should update. It finished saying it could not update, and&nbsp;I should reboot. I duely did this, only for the start up to crash, giving an error (which&nbsp;I cant remember the exact
 wording) but it looked like a conflict with graphics drivers. The system then rebooted giving the same error, restarted again, and then went into 'repair mode' which failed. Windows 10 then gave me various options to sort the problem, of which none of them
 work, so&nbsp;I 'reverted back' to a previous version. this being my original Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Am&nbsp;I doing something wrong or is there a fix somewhere? I really want the Nvidia Experiance as it optimises the game settings and also keeps the drivers (or should do) upto date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gary.</p>

            <p>You did not read&nbsp;GaryE'&nbsp;notes&nbsp;correctly.. He upgraded to 10 from windows 8.1. If you're going to respond, at least read and digest what's posted correctly. To many people will have wasted their time following your suggestion since it's unrelated.&nbsp; I've already
 wasted 2 hours trying to sort this out. I'm not interested in wasting more time. READ!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, to clear this up. I've done the same as him. Upgraded from windows 8.1 pro with EVGA / Nvidia video card(s) only to have MS drivers, working just well enough to run the desktop, but at least in the correct resolution. Then auto update changes them to
 NVidia's driver version&nbsp;10.18.13.5362. Which in my case claims driver errors on reboot with the yellow "!" device error 43. which is not a physical device error. It's a software error. and dumps me down to a resolution of 1680x1050, with is obviously below
 my supported 1920x1080 monitor. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried disabling the auto update for NVidia , and worked on putting drivers in place via the Nvidia.com driver&nbsp;download for my particular cards. Still no positive result or change in issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a widely talked about error for some time since the windows 10 preview. How about some research into this topic before responding with a wrong answer!</p>

            <p>I think I sorted it out, but I've yet to see if it stays persistent. see the following image. You can access this from the system icon under control panel. (the long way for those not used to the short ways.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the "advanced System Properties" then click the hardware tab. From there click the&nbsp;"Device Installation Settings!" button&nbsp;and change the radio buttons as indicated in the image.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot</p>
<p>Head over to NVidia (if you don't have the driver from them already)&nbsp;Then start installing the Driver from Nvidia's website the same way in windows 8.1/7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a successful install, I can now access the Nvidia control panel in all functional ways windows 8.1 and 7 do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was with a single 760 NVidia card. I have a pair in SLi that I will try this evening and report back on that topic.</p>

<p>Yeah, mndwgz, same here.&nbsp; I already had the&nbsp;353.62&nbsp;driver auto-&nbsp;installed, but decided&nbsp;to re-install it from the Nvidia site. The problem did not initially&nbsp;go away.&nbsp; However, after 2 re-boots it now&nbsp;seems to have solved the problem.&nbsp; That was about 3 hours
 ago and I haven't seen any reoccurrence.&nbsp; Keeping my fingers crossed!&nbsp; This was the ONLY problem I have had with Windows 10.&nbsp; Other than a slower booting time than 8.1(1+minute rather than 30 seconds) I am quite pleased with it.&nbsp; The W10 download even transferred
 my&nbsp; Stardock&nbsp; Start8 start page, complete with a real W7 start menu and a MS&nbsp;flag&nbsp;symbol start button&nbsp;--&nbsp; AND, no visible colored squares.&nbsp; With one click of the left&nbsp;Windows flag key, I'm in the Metro, colored square world if I really want it.&nbsp; I do that
 when I want to play solitaire or play &nbsp;with&nbsp;Cortana --&nbsp;lots of fun but more of a gimmick than a real useful tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my limited experience with W10, looks like it may be a real winner.</p>

            <p>Let me now how any of your DirectX 11 Games work with your GTX 760's.&nbsp; Got 4 PC's fresh installs with Windows 10 Home all with GTX 760's.&nbsp; Not a single DirectX 11 Game will work... crashes as soon as you try to start playing a game, (I.e Dungeons2, Alien
 VS Predator in DX 11 mode.) its almost like 2 years ago when the GTX 750 and GTX 760 series were plagued with this same issue and now has come up again except under Windows 10 and Latest Drivers of Nvidia.&nbsp; Other Games like League of Legends, Hearthstone,
 Smite are all working will plenty of hours of play.&nbsp;BattleField 4 you can totally forget... dies at launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even my 970's (SLI on or off) are experiencing a lot of Games not working or crashing that used to work fine under windows 8.1</p>

<p>I have to disagree. Games like Apex Legends and Sea of Thieves have shown that this is something developers can easily work around. I know a lot of people who play and sometimes are simply not able to be on a mic - e.g. it would be too disruptive to others
 in their home - or even some people who use party chat to catch up with friends who may even be playing a different game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I entirely agree that using a mic for team based-games is the gold standard though, but I think everyone has to respect it won't work for everyone all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand your frustration though and instead I'd suggest that you petition the makers of whatever games you like to include a matchmaking filter based on communication preferences and/or use an Xbox Club for that game as a base for a Looking For Group
 post with one of the criteria set around must have a mic.</p>

<p>Mics are great, when people use them correctly. I play Halo 5 and quite often have people complaining about how/why the died, instead of telling the rest of the team where that other players location is. I also come across people with mics who don't say
 anything, but have their tv/monitor volume up way too loud, or are just sitting to close to their screen/monitor/speaker.<br />
</p>
<p>But others have said, for some using a mic all the time simply isn't an option, you have to remember that not everyone is in the same/similar situation as you. Maybe their only gaming time doesn't allow them to use a mic, due to living arrangements, others
 sleep schedules, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, a few solutions:</p>
<p>Fill your team with people that do have mics. (via LFG, your friends, or how ever else you can think of)</p>
<p>Not play team games.</p>
<p>Accept that not everyone is going to be using a mic.</p>

            I have a few mics and I rarely use them in games like Apex. These games are designed to allow communication with your team through other means that are just as effective. People have multiple reasons for not using mics outside of just not having one. I
 dont think it's fair to say they need to use one if they want to play multiplayer.

            Not sure I agree I mean I do enjoy being able to talk with friends while playing to call stuff out or make a plan but almost all multiplayer games have a way for a player to communicate without a mic weather it be tagging an enemy or marking a area to
 go or tagging loot. From what I see more than ever developers are helping team based game be better by adding more and more of these features. Good examples are apex legends ,battlefield 5 , black out . Also one of the things I do is invite people to a party
 to see if they would like to chat and play.&nbsp;

<h2>            Skype Won&#39;t Ring When People Call Yet Takes Their Message</h2>
                    Skype worked perfectly until some point in the past I can't remember. Now it doesn't ring when people call. All I eventually see is a missed call or I get a message if they left one. Uninstalling and reinstalling does nothing. In fact the new install has
 all my data without me signing in. I just tried to install it on another user account on my computer and it works perfectly! A pop-up window comes up and the phone rings. I can only assume there's some magic files that aren't deleted when I uninstall it on
 my user account. When I search my computer there are numerous files with the word skype in it but it would take eternity to delete them all. How do I have a true fresh install of Skype so it works correctly. I'm paying money for this! Is should work right!

            According to Microsoft: 
<br />
<br />Use the money in your Microsoft account to buy stuff from Microsoft Store . 
<br />Go through the regular purchase steps. When we ask how you want to pay, select Microsoft account.
<br />
<br />
<br />The money in your Microsoft account can't be used to shop at Microsoft Store retail locations, or to get cash, gift certificates, or similar payment products, except when required by law.

<br />
<br />Microsoft does retail Windows 10 licenses on the Store, so you could try using it to buy a upgrade through it.

<p>so I got my account about 5 or 6 years ago I think and when my parents made my live and Microsoft account we used there email. well sense then that email was put out of use and can no longer be accessed. well that was not a problem until I had to do the
 recent security update. it said to sign in but when I did it said that something was wrong and what to do to fix it. well that required me to sign in at account.live but when I did it said someone else might be using my account. but sense the email is no longer
 in use I cannot verify by logging into it. iv had the account on my current xbox for a number of years so this baffles me. I really would appreciate any help because I have over 16500G and multiple purchases and&nbsp;really don't want to, nor to I have the funds
 to, make a new account</p>

<p>Hi Dog,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the account troubles. Let's see if we can get it back in your hands.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Do you know that Microsoft account that was attached too it?</strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
If so, I would suggest attempting to <a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recover your Microsoft account</a>.</span> When filling out that recovery form, provide as much info as possible.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>File sharing over LAN now requires username and password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinhamer  say:</h3>
<h2>            File sharing over LAN now requires username and password</h2>
                    <p>We have 4 devices on our LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Desktop with Windows 10, 1 Laptop with Windows 10, 1 Desktop with Windows 7, and 1 Surface 3 Pro with 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an external hard drive on one of the desktops that acts as our media server (for sharing music, videos, and public documents).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are no longer able to access this drive from any other computer because it is now asking us for a username and password. &nbsp;In fact, it is now saying that we are on a domain, whatever that means. &nbsp;We also cannot print anything without plugging directly
 into the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem seems to have began when we upgraded the two computers from windows 8 to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File sharing on each computer is turned "on" and password protected sharing is turned "off".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have idea what might be going on here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kevin</p>

<h3> quatro9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I bought a computer just over a year ago without Windows. I had a laptop already with it pre-installed and it was at the time when an icon appeared to be able to install windows 10. So I used the key from my laptop to put Windows on the new PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now i want another PC. Is there a way of transferring Windows 10 from the old computer to the new one, and how?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Well you would be wrong about the Norton or McAfee. (You can send me a check if you are so inclined)<br />
<br />
Computer components selected and put together by specialist computer builder.&nbsp; Only software installed was Vista and Hardware drivers etc and then only because I specified that this should happen.&nbsp; Normally I would put them together myself as well but was too
 busy at the time.<br />
<br />
Couldn't link back to this thread in the other forum as havnt been validated.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the assistance.<br />

            <p>It's a System Builder job - on a retail board - so it's unlikely to have been pr-installed with anything :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@wvanduin</p>
<p>There's no indications of any problem with the report - what happens if you attempt validation at
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate</a> ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you reboot - does the notification go away, only to reappear later?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No need to start a new thread - you'd only get me there, as well :) </p>

<h2>            WLM2011 Sign in Issues&#47;HTTPs Connection Refused</h2>
                    I hate to be another thread seeking help with my login issues but I have been researching this problem for weeks now. The error code is
<i>8004840f</i>, which from what I have gathered, points to an issue with either my ports, firewall, antivirus, or proxy. I have tried everything to try and solve this issue that only seems to affect my mother's computer which runs Windows 7 Home Edition. Here's
 a quick rundown of what measures I have taken so far:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tried cmd &gt; ipconfig/flushdns. </li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tried running the repair wizard in windows live and everything checks out okay. (except wireless?)
</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I noticed that there were some missing ports that the windows help center pointed out so I added the most important ones. List of added ports are:</li></ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TCP 80, 443, 1863<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TCP 7001 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UDP 9, 7001
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I turned off anti-virus/firewall and tried signing in and still nothing. </li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I uninstalled windows live messenger and reinstalled. Still nothing.</li></ul>
<br />
It seems to be connecting to some extent because while I try to log in with valid credentials it says,
<i>"loading contacts, loading this, loading that"</i> and hangs when on <i>"starting up"</i> but when I try and login with incorrect credentials or a fake username it does not even say any of that.<br />
<br />
I also have noticed that even logging into windows live through chrome/firefox does not establish an https connection. On firefox I get a message telling me there was an error loading the page. On chrome I get an:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;Error 102 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED): The server refused the connection.</b><br />
<br />
However, when I access the windows live login page on another computer it works fine (which is why i'm creating this topic from my computer). What could I be dong wrong? This issue seems to have appeared out of the blue because her messenger was working fine
 before.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I have a log file and used a batch found on skydrive (found it while lurking these forums) to put that in a cab file:<br />
<b>http://www.mediafire.com/?s6n1cxzujvhbj21</b><br />
<br />
Oh and here are some quick specs:<br />
<b>OS Name:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium <br />

<h2>            WLMM Won&#39;t Play MPG Anymore</h2>
                    Windows Live Movie Maker won't play my MPEG files any more. The same video files from the same camera I edited before in the same program, won't work anymore. I drag the video into WLMM and all I get are grey boxes with a yellow triangle with an ! in the
 middle.<br />
<br />
Any help, please?<br />

            <p>Hi sithru,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting. I understand that you are receiving yellow triangle icons in your storyboard. This normally happens if&nbsp;Movie&nbsp;Maker cannot&nbsp;find&nbsp;the files used on the project. I would like to clarify if&nbsp;the&nbsp;videos you used was directly dragged from&nbsp;the
 camera you used. If so,&nbsp;the moment you removed the camera, your Movie Maker&nbsp;will not be able to find those video files used. What you can do&nbsp;is to&nbsp;copy/import the videos in your&nbsp;computer. After that, click the yellow triangle icons and locate&nbsp;the&nbsp;video used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case this is not your concern, feel free to post back.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Richard&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for that information. To further troubleshoot this issue, we request you to e<font><span>nsure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files since&nbsp;audio and video require codecs to play the file and
 it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC. Please refer below for more information:</span></font></p>

            The videos play fine in Windows Media Center, wouldn't that indicate I have the right codecs for these files? I'll try out the link anyway.<br />
<br />
I don't want to resort to converting my videos. That's the main reason I use WLMM. If I have to convert my files from now and on, I'll just switch to a different movie editor.<br />
<br />
I'll let you now how things work out.. If it doesn't work I really won't understand why the exact same files that worked weeks ago don't work now.<br />

            I ran the fix it and it didn't help.<br />
<br />
Media Info really was no help either as I didn't understand what I am supposed to be doing with the program...<br />
<br />
Any other ideas...?<br />
<br />
Looks like I'll have to find another program. :( This is disappointing. It's for a business so I need my videos up ASAP.<br />

            Never mind, I just downloaded an older version of Windows Movie Maker and it works fine. I prefer it over the new stuff anyways.<br />

            It means that SMART thinks that your hard disk is failing and that it needs to be replaced.&nbsp; If the disk cannot be replaced immediately you should not take chances and backup the disk while you still can, if you don't you risk losing all the files on the
 disk!<br />
<br />
SMART is not always 100% accurate so you should get a disk diagnostic from your hard disk manufacturer and run it to see if it concurs with the SMART utility.&nbsp; If the disk diagnostic utility reports the disk as failing you should replace the disk in the shortest
 delay. <br />
