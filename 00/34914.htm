<h2>            Windows 10 install on laptop from Windows 7, caused flickering screen on home network PC.</h2>
                    <p>After having windows 10 installation problems on PC that were eventually successfully resolved, I waited 3 months before also installing Windows 10 on my laptop that was running windows 7.&nbsp; Both computers are on a home network, sharing a wireless printer
 and other files. The Windows 10 install worked fine on the laptop but after the install, the PC screen started flashing again like it did when I installed Windows 10 on it months ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked up solutions. Both the screen and task manager pop up screen flashes.&nbsp; I followed steps to put it in SAFE MODE WITH NETWORKING.&nbsp; It&nbsp;remains in SAFE MODE&nbsp;WITH NETWORKING,&nbsp;but I am unable to do anything else that was recommended (on the Win 10 site
 ) to uninstall the display adapter. I can't even restore it to a previous date at this point because I am a novice at this. I could really use some help here.&nbsp; I have a couple of papers due. Thanks! Coleen</p>

            <p>Hello Coleen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry to hear the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly happening when you try to uninstall <span>Display adapter's</span> drivers?</p>
<p>Is anything preventing from doing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Task Manager does flicker, a display driver is probably causing the problem. To update your display driver, you'll need to start your PC in safe mode, uninstall your current display adapter, and then check for driver updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;I see you telling that you're
 on&nbsp;SAFE MODE&nbsp;WITH NETWORKING. Follow the below steps to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<div>Right-click the <strong>Start </strong>button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.4%2fmain%2f851aefc6-d9e7-41b6-a160-2a5e45499b33_17.png" />and select
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>. </div>
</li><li>
<p>Expand the <strong><span>Display adapters</span></strong> section, right-click the listed adapter, then select
<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>. Select the <strong><span>Delete the driver software for this device</span></strong> check box, then select
<strong><span>OK</span></strong> and restart your PC. </p>
</li><li>
<div>After your PC restarts, press the Windows logo key <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.4%2fmain%2f851aefc6-d9e7-41b6-a160-2a5e45499b33_17.png" />+I on your keyboard to open Settings. If that doesn't work, select the Start button

<strong><span>Settings</span></strong>. </div>
</li><li>
<p>From Settings, select <strong><span>Update &amp; security</span> &gt; <span>Windows Update</span> &gt;
<span>Check for updates</span></strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If you have multiple display adapters, you'll need to disable the added adapter (often an Intel HD 400 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) by right-clicking it from the list in Device Manager and selecting
<span>Disable</span> &gt; <span>Yes</span>. Then, turn off your PC, disconnect installation or recovery media (if you're using it), and turn your PC back on. If that doesn't fix the flickering, restart your PC in safe mode, re-enable the added display adapter,
 and then disable the other adapter. </p>
</li></ul>
<p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

            Thank you for you assistance but the problem remains.&nbsp; After reading your response to my query, I surmised that I have already followed the protocol you provided. I disabled the driver while in SAFE MODE with network and rebooted with no success.&nbsp; The
 PC rebooted and returned to SAFE MODE and screen continues to flicker. When I try to click on the lower left windows icon, the result is the spinning blue processing circle that doesn't allow me to select anything.&nbsp; What I can do is access the task manager
 by clicking CTRL+SHIFT+ESC. I can choose a new task&nbsp;and see: msconfig but don't know what to tell it to do.&nbsp; Any more suggestions? Maybe at least reset it to an earlier date? Thanks, Coleen

            <p>Hello Coleen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us with an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you uninstall the driver in Safe Mode, on restarting PC will install the driver automatically. So, before you restart your PC after uninstalling the drivers, try to install the compatible driver for your device. You can find the latest and compatible
 driver on device Manufacturer website. Download it by using some other PC if you problem your PC, then transfer the same to your PC using USB stick.

            The Lenovo PC met the requirements for the Windows 10 download and in fact worked for a few months until I installed windows 10 on my laptop which is on the same home network. The laptop works fine bit the Lenovo PC started flashing again as I stated in
 my original question. And yes! I went to the manufacturers website for the driver but need to know which one to choose from the list.&nbsp; DID YOU EVEN READ MY QUESTION? I need help on this please!&nbsp; Time is going by with no answer to my original problem.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Finding a compatible drivers depends on the model of PC your using. On the Manufacturer website, when you put model number, it will list all
 the compatible drivers. You will also get an option <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/find-product-name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 fails to find the correct one.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I see you telling the screen still flicking in Safe Mode, even after uninstalling the driver. Then the root cause of the problem might be deep.
 It's not an easy task to install the driver when the screen flickering, even in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Suggest you to perform Reset from Normal Mode.
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Resetting lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then reinstalls Windows. To get started, when you reach login screen (I.e. before you enter into

            Hi RijulGanguly
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />1. Run Audio / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; 
<br />A. Playing Audio &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />B. Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Audio Driver 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Sound, Video &amp; game controllers &gt; Right Click on the entry below (if more than one, then you will have to repeat the steps for all) &gt; Properties &gt; Driver Tab &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Roll Back -  If Roll back driver is enabled, roll it back
<br />
<br />B. Download and reinstall the driver from computer manufacturer's website - If you face issue, let me know your computer make and model?
<br />
<br />There are two other actions which you can undertake. You can try them one by one and check after each.
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>

<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Sidewinder X8 movement has become incredibly jerky</h2>
                    I've had my Sidewinder X8 for about 6 months and until now it's been absolutely perfect. All of a sudden yesterday the mouse movement started occasionally becoming really jerky and skipping around the screen weirdly. It's not like that all the time, but
 I'd say it happens every couple of minutes or so for about 5 seconds, and it seems to be doing it more often now than it was last night.<br />
<br />
Could it be that my mouse is dying? Or maybe just the battery is dying? Either way that seems weird after only 6 months, I'd expect both to last a lot longer.<br />

            <p>It means the phone is drawing so much power that the ports are being shut down to prevent damage to your laptop.&nbsp; Seek out a powered USB hub (one that plugs into your computer and comes with an AC adapter to plug into the wall) to provide more power, or plug less items into your USB ports at once. </p>

                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noted all your posts and replies to the above. If I click on the Icon I get circle going around and around and nothing loads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried what you recommend but it still comes up in the tasks list as not responding.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all previous updates to operating systems I have never had a problem with FSX until I went to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I solve this issue please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note all my drivers etc are up to date. I am running a HP Pavilion Elite so the PC is not the issue.</p>
<p>

            <p>If it is of any comfort, I use FSX on Win10 and it runs just as it did on Win7, except for its preference to be in windowed mode for functioning of its menu bar items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say you have tried everything in the other relevant posts. &nbsp;Do you get any error message in Event Viewer: &nbsp;this could be useful to find the faulting module? &nbsp;So just to check that we're on the same page, I will briefly list a number of things to try
 (if you haven't already). &nbsp; Also make sure that all your Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables are installed (you should have them from 2005 - 2013, as is in mine); &nbsp;the link is: &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>- if you need info on any of the points below, please ask:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp; attempting a start from the fsx.exe in FSX folder</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; disable display scaling and tick run as administrator in fsx.exe</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; compatibility mode in fsx.exe</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; deleting your fsx.CFG (you will lose specially mapped keys)</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; attempting a repair of FSX via Disk 1</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; remove all addons and try the points above</p>
<p>7. &nbsp; booting into Safe Boot and then start FSX (remember to go back to normal boot)</p>
<p>8. &nbsp; remove FSX and its Service Packs and also its files in various locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I listed removal of FSX as a last resort, not because it can be inconvenient, but also the possibility of a failed activation on reinstall. &nbsp; Hope something helps here.</p>

<p>Jeśli gra kupiona w sklepie ma oznaczenia PL/CZ i konsola ma również ustawienia regionalne na PL to gra sama powinna automatycznie ustawić język na PL. Jeśli jednak tak się nie stało przejrzyj opcje ponownie, może przeoczyłeś tą opcję. Jak nie to dzwoń do

<p>Wejdź w opcje konsoli, potem opcje regionalne. Zmień region na "Polska" i język konsoli na "Polski". Jeśli to nie zmieni tobie języka w grze, to nic jego nie zmieni. Czasami jak masz ustawiony język albo region konsoli na inny niż Polski, a gra ma wersję

            Hi,<br />

Sometimes grabbing it can be tricky so might need to try several spots.<br />

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />The first thing that would try is unplug and plug the cable to that display to see if that works, it worked for me a few times.
<br />
<br />If that didn't work, restart your computer and try again.
<br />
<br />If you still have the problem the next step would be reinstall the Motherboard/GPU Video driver from device manager, i suggest you to download it from the manufacturer's website.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Citrix App in App Store will not work with legacy enterprise systems as Citrix are currently only supporting their latest versions with their RT App in the Microsoft RT Store. This renders the Surface RT useless in&nbsp;environments where users need to access
 their firm's systems remotely and they are not using Citrix's more recent server offerings. It is interesting that Microsoft has not sorted remote access out with Citrix as iPad and other tablets appear to have Citrix support for legacy system access!&nbsp;

<h2>            Recovery partition in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi every one,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using windows 10 professional on laptop Dell vostro 5470.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I installed Anniversary update for few days ago, I see an unexpected partition in the list partitions of my system.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3eaf66f-30d9-4d88-80b9-ffc0413ae619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3eaf66f-30d9-4d88-80b9-ffc0413ae619" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the picture:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first partition, I used for Linux</p>
<p>Volume C: is for system files.</p>
<p>Volume D: is my external SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, there is one 25 Gb partition which has status "recovery partition", and I could not do any thing with it.</p>
<p>I could not delete it normally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me:</p>
<p>How can I make it more useful &nbsp;(such as use for backing up the system or save the system image)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I created a WindowsRE and use for reset the system?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell computers running Windows, by default, has a hidden "Recovery Partition" which contains the factory image for your laptop. This is used by the system when running a Reset to recover the factory settings and software for your computer. Deleting the partition
 may cause issues especially that it will be very helpful should you need to reinstall your operating system.<br />
<br />
You can confirm this information by checking on an article from their website on "<strong><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/SLN130027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How To Restore or Reinstall Microsoft Windows on a Dell Computer</a></strong>."
 Under the topic "Operating system restore," it is specifically stated that "Dell computers are built with a small amount of hard disk space reserved for reinstalling your operating system."<br />
<br />
For more information regarding the said Recovery Partition, it would be best to contact Dell through this
<strong><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/incidents-online/us/en/04/contactus/dynamic?ref=contactus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.

    <title>Weird problems with relocating library folders in 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reece williams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird problems with relocating library folders in 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I got stung by relocating my c:\Users folder from my SSD and couldn't upgrade to 8.1; having had to reinstall windows thanks to a restore point trashing my registry, I thought it would be a good idea to just use the "but you should have used" relocation
 option for Documents et al.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now is it me, or is this functionality really stupidly broken?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) Create a new folder to put my libraries in, D:\UserData\Reece</p>
<p>2) Right click a library folder under "This PC" e.g. Documents, click the Location tab followed by the Move... button and select D:\UserData\Reece for the target folder</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The D:\UserData\Reece folder disappears and is replaced with the Documents library, so I now have D:\UserData\Documents!&nbsp; What's more, that folder isn't really called Documents, it's still called "Reece" - if you try and create a new folder called "Reece"
 windows says it conflicts and the contents will be merged.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I relocate the Documents library again, this time to a newly created folder called&nbsp;D:\UserData\ReeceX, the ReeceX folder disappears to be replaced with the Documents library and the original Reece folder magically reappears - but wait! It's NOT REALLY
 THERE!!!&nbsp; Spooky huh!? If you click on the Pictures library in the treeview, you get an error saying something like&nbsp;"D:\UserData\Reece is no longer there".&nbsp; Basically, explorer hasn't refreshed the view and is displaying a stale folder structure.&nbsp; Reopening
 explorer fixes that.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Trying all this with my Pictures library has now somehow&nbsp;left me with a Pictures folder under c:\Users\Reece, which even as an administrator, I cannot access nor delete; I can't even change file permissions.&nbsp;There's no owner for the folder and I can't change
 it because I don't have permission! &nbsp;If I try to use the Restore Default button on the relocated library, I get an "Access is denied" error - it can't go home, poor thing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It would seem that in order to relocate a library folder, you&nbsp;need to enter the full&nbsp;name of the folder that you are moving it to, e.g. d:\UserData\Reece\Documents.&nbsp; And of course, you don't actually need to call it "Documents", you could call it "Cabbage"
 and you'd still end up with a library folder called d:\UserData\Reece\Documents in explorer.</p>
<p>Now I realise that these libraries are just virtual folders, but this mechanism of letting the user choose the name of the folder then not displaying that name is not good UI design. Libraries appear to the user as if they are folders, so you expect them
 to behave the same way - I expect it to appear <strong>inside</strong> the folder I choose; I don't expect that folder to be replaced.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What is very worrying is that this munted behaviour is the Microsoft recommended way of relocating folders from the C Drive, which is an absolute must if you have an SSD.</p>
<p>Sure, I could just bung everything into plain Jane folders, but then you lose all of the built in functionality of library files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And to cap it all, I have to do this for all five users in our family.&nbsp; It might be easier just to get a divorce.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>Agreed. I don't understand why windows doesn't have an automatic method of setting files on another drive. The option should be done during installation BECAUSE as many of us know, some too late,&nbsp;the windows 8.1 installation couldn't handle the users files
 being on a separate drive. I hadn't paid attention to this and the install left my computer completely corrupted with no recovery options besides obtaining an actual copy of Win 8 to repair the previous installation. I opted to do a clean reinstallation, updated
 basics, etc so that I could&nbsp;update to Win 8.1. Now I have my computer back up and running win 8.1 on my small ssd and I am trying to figure out which&nbsp;library folders it is safe&nbsp;to move over to the hdd. Can they safely be moved after 8.1 is installed? I read
 the skydrive has issues being moved.&nbsp;Fortunately for me I would never trust a company like MS to handle my files in clouds when they can't get it right with oldschool pc&nbsp;hd technology.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>BTW I too had merged folder name issues the first time I tried moving the files. I had to be very very careful, especially with the lack of proper 'undo' options.</p>

            <p>I've moved everything that gave me the option to move and haven't run into any problems!</p>
<p>Having said that, I too don't actively use SkyDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doing that for five different accounts was painful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You just need to watch out for those programs (like outlook) that store large volumes of data under the AppData folder, since you can't move that.&nbsp; Fortunately you can relocate the default pst files for outlook, but that's not always an option.</p>

            <p>Relocating&nbsp;does actually work, you just have to know how it works.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You need to create the folders you want up front, then relocate the libraries to them.&nbsp; I went back to having the users folder (and hence AppData folder)&nbsp;on the SSD, which is far from ideal, but with all the relocations most of the data is now on my HDD
 now.</p>

<h3> danielleperillo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 10 - Flash Drive Storage Not Showing In Device Manager</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 Flash Drives, all the same (generic bought from my son's high school supply store). They all worked on my old laptop, an Acer, with Windows 8, but is broken. None of them are showing up in the device manager on my new (refurbished) Dell Inspiron
 14 with Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I need more storage because Windows cannot update. I deleted every app that I downloaded to my Dell to get more storage for the updates, but it wasn't enough. (I've since reinstalled the apps.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried to do the clean installation of Windows 10 but I didn't have enough storage for that either (which I don't understand because I thought it wipes everything clean and reinstalls). Regardless, I must find a way for Windows 10 to read the flash drive
 so I can expand the storage.</p>
<p>Please help! </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <pre>Hi Danielle -
Let's first try to fix the flash drives, then provide you with everything that matters on managing smaller drives effectively, plus how to troubleshoot a Clean Install which will always install if booted properly regardless of the condition of Windows.
1) Troubleshoot flash:
Access Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  find the USB drive under Disk Drives, right click to Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall driver.
  Right click Start to open Disk Management, find the drive in map, right click to change drive letter.  
Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
 Recent Windows Updates are causing device problems in Windows 10, including USB flash and external drives.  You should be able to access and back up your files on another PC.  Then here are some things to try:
You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/
You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943
  Run a disk check on the drive:  https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/
  Try the drive in another PC.  Back up your files to that PC if it works.  Then I'd reformat it in Disk Management.  
 
2) Manage Smaller drives including Version Updates
I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook
As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install
 
Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587.  
 
This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html.
There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/
You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
There are ways to block Updates here:  https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/
If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install 
3) Troubleshoot a Clean install:
Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587 
Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
 Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html
If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html
Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
DISKPART
LIST DISK
SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
CLEAN
EXIT
Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your prompt reply. I'm sorry I could only just now read and attempt your solution (I was ill for a while).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1) Troubleshoot Flash:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all that is under Disk Drives in Device Manager:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/388e3e7f-b22b-4fa8-8207-e51c15512728?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/388e3e7f-b22b-4fa8-8207-e51c15512728?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some googling and changed my view to "by connections,":</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>Ar</em><em>e yo</em><em>u saying to uninstall the Realtek USB 2.0 Card Reader?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only confirming because I am in no way computer savvy and don't want to uninstall something that I can't reinstall or that will change certain functions making my laptop inoperable to a tech "dummy" like myself. :)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>You gave me a <em>wealth of information </em>and<em> I am truly grateful </em>
for that! However, I'm unsure&nbsp;of whether I should continue with 2) Manage Smaller Drives or 3) Troubleshoot a Clean Install regardless of the USB.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>What I'm asking is, are they numbered possible solutions or steps of an order I should follow? If 1 Troubleshoot Flash works, do I continue to 2 and then 3, or if I can't figure out 1 do I proceed to 2 or 3?</em><br />
</p>
<p>I apologize if the answers to my questions seem obvious; I'm lost in the tech world.<br />

<p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the reply.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Drive is not working is one issue and updates not working is another issue on the PC.
</span></p>
<p><span>The solution provided is 2 fold for the issue that you are facing. Steps 1 and 2 are for the drives which are not working and Step3 is for the clean
 install of Windows. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you got the help you needed by clicking 'Yes' or 'No'.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Very Slow &#40;Start Up &#38; Opening Applications&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded from Windows 7 to Window 10 and my start up time has increased as well as the time it takes to open applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance on Windows 7 opening Outlook 2013 took approximately 2 seconds max, not it takes around 25-40 seconds. This is a huge decrease in performance and is not acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when&nbsp;Windows 10 loads, going to the start bar and searching for things is lagged and&nbsp;even the typing is delayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the problem with this OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Intel i7-980X (6&nbsp;core processor), with 12Gb of RAM and a hybrid hard drive, so I don't understand why it is so slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it&nbsp;simply that Windows 10 isn't completely ready yet and when will future updates resolve the issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I revert back to Window 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was very happy with Win7 and my computer was very fast, now it is slow and I am unhappy. I really thought Win 10 was going to be super fast, not super slow. I suppose it is because it is free, Microsoft thought they could release a sub-standard product
 initially?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am having the same issue. I updated my mother-in-law's older Toshiba laptop and it runs like a treat. My &lt;6 month old Asus (Intel 2.4GHz processor, 4GB RAM) runs much much slower than it did with WIndows 8. Every time I open a folder it freezes and the
 OS adds the "Not Responding" message to the header bar. Same with using Edge - slow to load up, big delay of 20 - 30 seconds waiting for it to unfreeze and for typing to appear.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see from the other laptop that W10 could be great but I've had a downgrade in capability rather than an improvement...</p>

            <p>I have managed to fix my slow running issues and here is how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, when the computer is running slow, push Ctrl+Alt+Del and select the Task Manager. Under the Processes tab (which is open by default), the Disk memory was at 100% constantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a known fault that can occur with Windows 7 and 8; it wasn't a problem for me before the upgrade but was after.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution (which I found by googling for "Windows 10 100% disk memory" and watching a couple Youtube clips) was to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- search for services.msc in File Explorer (i.e. open any folder up, select "This PC" in the left hand pane and use the search bar in the top right corner), right click on services.msc (ignore the results that turn up from the C:\Windows.old folder btw),
 run as an administrator, then find in the list of services, Superfetch and Windows Search. Stop and disable both of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then followed the instructions from another youtube video to find Superfetch and prefetch in the registry using regedit, and disabled them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooted, and instant transformation from an almost unusable computer (I searched and watched the videos on my iphone which was ironic given how much I defend Windows PCs) into a quick and responsive machine again.</p>

            <p>I just tried all of these steps. I had timed my startup time from nothing to the point where I could actually launch a browser and use the program before following these steps. It took my system (core I5 2.5 ghz 6 Gb ram, very few startup options enabled)
 6 1/2 minutes to be usable. I then followed these steps and made the changes. This made absolutely no difference whatsoever. It still takes my system 6 1/2 minutes to be usable from startup. This is absolutely ridiculous. I have a computer that used to be
 able to be used within 2 1/2 minutes of startup with Windows 8.1. Now we have gone back to the days of go make a pot of coffee while you wait for your computer to startup. This is a pitiful excuse for an "upgrade".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have any suggestions on how to decrease startup time besides replacing the hard drive with an SSD?</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Adjust Screen Brightness on Samsung Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Adjust Screen Brightness on Samsung Laptop</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I can't seem to adjust the brightness of my screen. I've used the '<b>Fn</b>' key, gone to the
<b>Settings</b> icon to where it gives you the option to power down, adjust volume, check wireless status, etc., and have even gone into my
<b>Control Panel</b> to tweak the power options. None of these are doing anything to help the situation.</div>
<div>What am I missing?</div>
                </div>

            Yea i'm using windows 8.1 and the brightness keys were working for a couple of months after I download windows 8.1 and then suddenly would stop working sometimes but then it would be okay after I would restart it. But now i can't even adjust it through
 windows settings where the shutdown options and volume control are and restarting doesn't help. The brightness is just stuck at a certain level and its really annoying. Its very hard to use my laptop at the brightness it's stuck at.&nbsp;

Hi,<br />
<br />
The issue seems to be with the display card drivers. I would suggest you to update the drivers for the display card from the manufacturers website and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Follow the steps to update the Video card driver:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">a. Press
<strong>Windows Key + X key</strong> and click <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b.
<p><span>c.
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span></p>

            I tried this and it looked like it had stared to download. It then stopped after 10 minutes and referred me to the Samsung website - where I found no help t all! Can you suggest anything else - I'm desperate?

            Well the issue on my laptop was fixed automatically somehow after an update. However you do not necessarily have to use your function keys to increase the brightness, you can also increase it through the settings that pop out from the right hand corner
 where you go to shut down your computer. Hope that helps.

            I paid the 14.99 to install it on my computer. It worked for a while and now nothing... It does not work and no support. I am more than a little peeved.&nbsp; I am peeved because I had to deal with it and also because I missed a workout because of it. I downloaded
 VLC free media player and it works!!!!! WIndows 10 is just plain awful. Wish I had never upgraded.

            The problem starts about a week ago when I up loader several of my old games. I had to reload my operating system earlier this year. (Windows 10) the games were Age of Empire 2, Star Craft and Sim City. Since then my windows DVD player hasn't worked properly.
 Should I unload the games.

    <title>Error 1079 on starting Bluetooth Support Service service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rangarajan kundalam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 1079 on starting Bluetooth Support Service service</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Dell Inspiron 3521 laptop, preinstalled with Windows 8. I then upgraded to Windows 8.1. But the Bluetooth is not working. On searching through various forums, I found that Bluetooth Support Service service needs to be started and running. It was
 set to Automatic, but not running. I tried starting it, I get this error. Further, I tried changing the Log On credentials to my specific account, removed the password, then clicked Apply. I got a message as the user has been authenticated. I restarted the
 PC, but no success. Again, I tried with Local Account, still no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same error message, Error 1079, is displayed on every step I tried. Bluetooth was working fine with Windows 8. First time when I upgraded, I had this issue and hence reverted to Windows 8. But as Microsoft mandated Windows 8.1 upgrade recently, I need
 to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Changing the account name to Local Service and the service starts and runs. But still I'm unable to use the Bluetooth. In most of the forums posts I found that the account name must be of the user name. But if my username is selected, the error is
 displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently logged in online account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to this issue, I'm unable to use Bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>NOTE: I tried reinstalling the drivers, which is also not successful, although the drivers are compatible with Windows 8.1. So kindly do not suggest this again.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Rangarajan, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please answer this question to get more clarity on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the error message you get while trying to use the Bluetooth device?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to several reasons like software or hardware driver incompatibility, missing updates, broken drivers etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue may occur if the service is started by the Local System account instead of by the Local Service account (NT AUTHORITY\LocalService). The Local System account may have insufficient permissions to start the service.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Set the service and any dependent services to run under the NT AUTHORITY\LocalService account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1.</strong></p>
<p><span>Recommend you to refer to the steps provided by “Bennet Martin” from this thread to set the service and any dependent services to run under the NT AUTHORITY\LocalService account.:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-hardware/error-1079-the-account-specified-for-this-service/4cd3a470-7cd5-4f16-a023-55623719345a">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-hardware/error-1079-the-account-specified-for-this-service/4cd3a470-7cd5-4f16-a023-55623719345a</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2.</strong></p>
<p><span>The Hardware Troubleshooter is an automated tool which checks the hardware on the computer for any known issues and provides the details on how to fix them.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plug in the device and follow these steps to run the troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Click on “Hardware and Devices”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Click on “Advanced” and then click on “Run as Administrator”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Click “Next” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Article for reference:</span></p>
<p><strong>Why isn't Windows finding my wireless device?</strong><span>: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/why-isnt-windows-finding-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/why-isnt-windows-finding-device</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3.</strong></p>
<p><span>Turn on the Bluetooth enabled device and then make it discoverable. Methods for making it discoverable can vary widely depending on the device. To learn how to make a Bluetooth
 enabled device discoverable, check the info that came with your device or go to the manufacturer’s website.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your device has a wireless switch, make sure it’s turned on. The switch could be on the front, back, or side, and it could be small and unmarked. Check the info that
 came with your device to see if a picture shows where it’s located.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 4.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Usually after an update to a newer version some drivers or devices may not work as expected. This issue may occur as the computer may need the latest version of updates
 or drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Drivers are updated occasionally. Windows can update them automatically, or you can install the updated drivers yourself. It's important for you to have confidence in the
 updated drivers you install. Windows notifies you if it detects a suspicious or unsafe driver you shouldn't install.</span></p>

<p>Power on password's are designed by your computer manufacturer. Normally , They can be activated and de-activated from BIOS</p>
<div>
<p>Procedures vary depending on the BIOS manufacturer. Usually, you must press a key (such as F2, F12, DEL, ESC) or a key combination immediately after you turn on your computer but before<span>Windows</span> starts. For more information, check the information
 that came with your computer or go to the computer manufacturer's website.</p>
Warning
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be careful when changing BIOS settings. The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it's possible to change a setting that could prevent your computer from starting correctly.</p>

Power-on password is a device designed&nbsp;to deter theft.<br />
Either you take it to your local reliable technician, or with proper proof of ownership contact the computer manufacturer for help.<br />

In short, don't do it yourself.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are willing to change the resolution of the display on Monitor. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>　</p>
</span><span>
<p>By default, Windows chooses the best display settings for your system based on your monitor.
</p>
</span><span>
<p>I suggest you to follow the below steps to change the resolution of the display on Monitor. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Click on <strong>Start </strong>or press <strong>Windows key + I
</strong>and navigate to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>
Display</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced display </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; settings</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <span>Under <strong>Resolution</strong>, select a screen resolution (recommended 1920 x 1080) that you want for the display.</span></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Click on<strong> Apply </strong>and <strong>Keep changes </strong>
to save the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>It is recommended to set the screen resolution of the display to the
<strong>(Recommended)</strong> native resolution to get the best display on your monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need at least <strong>1024 X 768 </strong>screen resolution for modern apps to work. The Windows apps will not work in screen resolution less than 1024 X 768. To snap apps, you need a screen resolution of at least
<strong>1366 x 768</strong>. Make sure that the screen resolution meets these requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you were charged for an automatic subscription renewal that you did not intend to continue. I recommend going to
<a href="http://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Account Services</a>&nbsp;and cancelling the subscription or turning off automatic renewal. Since you were already charged you may need to go to
<a href="http://xbox.com/refunds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Refund Request form!</a>&nbsp;Some regions don't have the webform available, for those regions you'd have to

<p>Тебе нужно обязательно отключить <a href="https://support.xbox.com/ru-RU/billing/xbox-subscriptions/how-to-cancel-xbox-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
автопролонгацию подписки</a>и возможно если карта не действительна оплатить задолженность. Если карта не действительна как списались деньги?</p>
<p>Там только если новая карта привязана и выбрана как основная.</p>
<p>Из истории платежей также возможно отменить покупку изапросить возврат.</p>
<p>Удачи!</p>

    <title>Bugs when working in Tablet Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> uwe001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bugs when working in Tablet Mode</h2>
                    <p>I installed Win 10 Home (64bit) on a PC yesterday.&nbsp; Just for fun, I pinned a few of my applications (for example Mozilla Firefox) to Start and then switched the desktop computer into Tablet Mode.&nbsp; With strange results, I have to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the corresponding (Firefox) tile on screen for example, there is only a short flicker, Firefox gets hidden/minimized immediately, and the tile groups are displayed again.&nbsp; Other programs open correctly first, but then the screen flashes and
 the applications get minimized again automatically.&nbsp; Yet another category of programs stay open in full screen mode as expected, but when I terminate them I end up with an empty screen.&nbsp; No more tiles visible, and they will only show again after a mouse click
 on the screen.&nbsp; Outlook 2013 is such a program, surprisingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I found out so far is, that those applications which open and then get minimized right away are calling WS_MAXIMIZE on initial CreateWindow in their source code ( I was able to reproduce this with some of my own programs that I've written).&nbsp; As it seems,
 setting the PC to Tablet Mode calls WS_MAXIMIZE as well, so the window gets maximized twice.&nbsp; Which might also be part of the problem with the flickering screen, but the main culprit here is definitely the window animation.&nbsp; If you turn it off (Settings -&gt;
 Ease of Access -&gt; Other OPtions -&gt; Play animations in Windows), the screen flickr stops when in Tablet Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can't explain though is, why the programs which open correctly leave the screen blank (except for the Taskbar) once they are terminated.&nbsp; Is this a driver issue?&nbsp; I'm using a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 745, driver version 10.18.13.5362 .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>-Uwe</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Installed Win10 on a Surface Pro 1 as well and encountered the same bugs as described above.&nbsp; So definitely not a faulty display driver, but a bug in Windows.<br />
<br />
Some of the programs that open and close correctly in Tablet Mode but leave the screen blank after their termination seem to have set their main window as a borderless form.&nbsp; They paint the buttons on the title bar themselves in code.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Sharief,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your approach resolved the second issue <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>temporarily</strong></span> (the first one is simply a coding error of certain software developers, IMO).&nbsp; Firefox started correctly afterwards and stayed open as one would expect.&nbsp; But then the latest Firefox update (39.0.3) came in just a few minutes
 ago, and after installation the same issue started to raise its ugly head again.&nbsp; Strangely, the tile behavior has changed now.&nbsp; When I try to open Firefox the first time, the screen just flashes and the application is minimized right away.&nbsp; If I terminate
 the program and then click on the tile again, Firefox behaves as expected - it stays open.&nbsp; Looks as if a registry entry has been overwritten by the installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third issue is still not resolved.&nbsp; Running Outlook 2013 and terminating it again, the screen stays blank if in Tablet Mode.&nbsp; I have to click on the screen area to make the tiles visible again.&nbsp; On both the PC and the Surface Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>-Uwe</p>

<h2>            Computer takes 10-15 minutes to boot or wake up from sleep mode</h2>
                    I have had laptop for 3 months. Worked fine up until a month ago. I am running Vista Home Premium. The computer will take 10-15 minutes to boot up or wake up after sleep mode. The hard-drive is being accessed continuously while waiting. The hard drive
 checks out okay. I have tried to run a virus scan but Macafee locks up after several minutes or the computer crashes and reboots. I have disabled various startup programs. When checking performance there are warnings for reduced performance and recovery from
 catastophic shutdown with error codes. The error codes lead to no information. Vista was preloaded on laptop and no disks were provided to reinstall. I have no recovery disks. Please advise.

<p><span>hi cpcops</span></p>
<p><span>It appears you have tried the “Clean Boot” with no help, so let’s try to see if there might be Malware attacking your system. Click start to search, type in
 “Defender”. When you see “Defender” click it and click the draw down for the Scan, click “Full Scan”; see how your system does here.</span></p>
<p><span>(Reminder) please turn off ALL Sleep, Hibernate, and Screen savers while this runs.</span></p>
<p><span>Once this is done, clean what might need to be cleaned, if this doesn’t seem to help then we can take a look at the “Performance Monitor”, please follow these
 directions.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>Performance and Reliability Monitor:</span></p>
<p><span>Click start, to search, type in Performance and Reliability, after booting the Performance and Reliability Monitor, click on “Reliability Monitor”, look in
 the system support section on the right side. If you can see what has failed, then you know what to search for and remove.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not see anything in there, then let us know and we will go from here.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helped.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your post.</span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also iexplore.exe stopped responding message<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also a number of successful driver installs of Generic Volume Shadow Copy<br />

<p><span><span>Hi cpcops,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for using the Vista Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I think you are having print driver issues.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The error hpslpsvc has to do with your printer. (Assuming you still have an HP printer installed.
 If not, uninstall the software and drivers you are not using.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Go to HP’s website and get the latest and greatest drivers and software.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Uninstall your printer drivers and software. (Please make sure you have the installation media
 handy if you do this.) </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Install the new drivers and software and restart.</span></span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The driver uninstall re-install did not have any effect. The computer seems to work fine once I'm logged on. It's just the boot up and wake up&nbsp;time. It takes 10-15 minutes to get going. What does the Generice Volume Shodaw copy do?</p>

            Hi cpcops,<br />
<br />
Can you give me your system specs? Specifically, how much RAM, how much SHARED video RAM and what kind of processor is in your system? If you are running with anything less than 1 Gb of RAM, you need to increase it. Also, if you are running any protection programs
 other than Windows Defender and an antivirus program, they could be putting too much load on your processor. You could check your page file settings and virtual memory and other settings, but unless you are good on RAM (2GB would be GOOD), then you might be
 better off doing a reinstall, what with all the other issues you have listed. If Mcafee is crashing and you are getting initialization errors, there may be multiple problems at work here. You say that you did not receive any recovery disks - you may have a
 recovery partition on your hard drive. Check that out and if there is none, I would ask the vendor why you didn't receive any recovery software.<br />
<br />
Post back and let us know some of the answers and we'll continue to try to help you.<br />

<p><span>Cpcops,</span></p>
<p><span>In your original post you mention disabling some startup prgorams with other then a satisfactory result. I ask
 that you perform the below detailed clean boot. This will disable all startup programs and non Microsoft services. After you do so and restart your computer, test your computer for the length of boot and revert from sleep. Post your results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Test in a
<strong>Clean Boot</strong> environment to see if this issue is related to interference from other services / programs:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER. (If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>.)</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.On the
<strong>General</strong> tab, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.Under
<strong>Selective Startup</strong>, click to clear the <strong>Load Startup Items</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.Click the
<strong>Services</strong> tab, click to select the <strong>Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable All</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>5.Click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>6.When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>7.Log back into your Account.</span></p>
<p><span>---------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not return while your computer is in a clean boot mode, a background program is likely causing
 interference.</span></p>
<p><span>---------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>You may determine which background program is causing the problem through following the steps (Begin at
<strong>enable half of the Services items</strong>) in the below linked article:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to perform a clean boot procedure to determine whether background programs are interfering with a
 game or a program that you currently use</span></strong></p>

<p><span>---------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>To restore your
<strong>Normal </strong>startup:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER. (If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click

<p>
<span>2.On the

<h2>            Can I separate the updates to download and install 1 at a time&#63;</h2>
                    My rural Oklahoma Wi-Fi struggles to download all of the updates together.&nbsp; Is there a way to separate out the items listed in the updates and download/install them one at a time?

            Windows 10 does not allow for select-able updates. 
<br />
<br />As in, you cannot actually pick and choose which updates you install one by one. 
<br />
<br />Only windows 8 and below had this option
