    <title>Lenovo Yoga 2 13 still has no Windows 10 Energy Manager - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lenovo Yoga 2 13 still has no Windows 10 Energy Manager &#40;battery&#41; driver</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Yoga 2 13. Energy Manager driver is not compatible with Windows 10 which means (with or without EM 8.1) I cannot use my computer on battery power or discharge/charge battery without computer being shutdown. And battery % readings are inaccurate
 as it will "charge" more than 5% in just a couple of minutes when, say, using System Restore or installing Windows updates (the only way it seems to charge while turned on as Windows itself has not loaded its drivers but the computer is powered on).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling Windows power drivers has no effect on the problem. Lenovo says Microsoft is working on the issue to make a new driver. When I was prompted to upgrade to Windows 10, it said my computer was compatible, BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO USE A LAPTOP ON BATTERY
 POWER IS NOT COMPATIBLE! I am passed the 1 month revert to 8.1. My computer warranty runs out in December. I like 10. I hate 8.1. I like my computer. But the battery is the entire point of having a laptop. WHEN WILL THIS BE FIXED!? Frankly, if it is not fixed
 soon, Microsoft should buy me a Lenovo Yoga 2 13 with Windows 10 pre-installed so everything works as it should, because this is bull. Not having a Windows 10 driver for a popular computer or not warning me that there would be a major incompatibility issue
 before upgrading is inexcusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows how to fix this, let me know. And running the battery down to restart in BIOS and reset the battery is not an option, because I cannot run the battery down accept when the computer is shutdown (as I have to keep it plugged in when in sleep
 mode), so it would take WEEKS for it to reach 10%.</p>

            <p>I have exactly the same situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;My usage on battery has degraded to an unacceptable level.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it gets to roughly 50%, it dies within a few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; When fully charged,&nbsp;it will now last&nbsp;about an hour before shutdown even though the monitor says
 there&nbsp;is about an hour left.&nbsp;&nbsp; The battery monitor is completely useless as it reads all over the scale and changes&nbsp;minute by minute.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I love the Yoga 2 13, but just spent hours on tech support and have been told to send the unit in for testing and fixing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to ship it, only to get it fixed and have the problem occur again.&nbsp; I want it to perform the way it did before - which
 was excellent!&nbsp;&nbsp; The battery life keeps going down and I see the latest battery manager update covers many Lenovo products but not the Yoga 2 13.&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree that we need the fix very quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; My warranty runs out in a few months and I do not want to ship
 my laptop off to have it come back with no real fix in place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's get this taken care of now please.&nbsp;&nbsp; I too, am passed my one month to revert to Windows 8 and don't wish to do so at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; I too, like windows 10 but do not want 8.1 again or ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Without a Windows 10 driver there is nothing they can physically do to the computer. If hardware has been compromised, it will just happen again with the replacement parts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have chatted online and talked on the phone with Lenovo tech support. I have chatted online and spoken on the phone with Microsoft tech support, including a Level Two Research &amp; Development person which required&nbsp; scheduled call-back. All reached the same
 conclusion: until a new driver is offered by Lenovo, there are two choices:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Do nothing, use the computer on AC power, wait.</p>
<p>2) Go back to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I also only have a couple of months left on the warranty (stupid me for not getting the extended warranty from Best Buy, but who figured this mess would happen?), I am really annoyed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Windows 8.1 option, I also cannot find my Product Key. It's not on the computer (it's on the motherboard and Lenovo does not keep those records). I KNOW I used Belarc Adviser to find it, but where I wrote it down has been lost (Arrrrggghhh!). The
 Level 2 guy told me, though, that they would provide a product key for free if I used the ISO file I made from 8.1 before upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HATE Windows 8.1, though. I don't really want to go back to 8.1 and then, months later when (if) a driver comes out, upgrade AGAIN and have to deal with AGAIN all of the bugs I had to work through the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER, MICROSOFT! YOU TOLD ME "YOUR COMPUTER IS COMPATIBLE" WHEN I WAS PROMPTED TO UPGRADE BUT THAT WAS
<strong>NOT</strong> THE CASE. THIS IS <strong>YOUR</strong> FAULT AS MUCH AS LENOVO'S!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a solution. I had the same problem on my Yoga 2 13, just upgraded to Windows 10, and the Flight mode button did not work (I new from before that it' caused by Energy Manager not being on, or there), and the battery stayed on 58% (and would not charge
 any higher ever more), because I upgraded with battery save mode on (upgraded stupidly without 10s of hours reading all possible forums). Many hours later, reading many times, that everybody has this same problem and there seemed to be no solution, I got really
 fed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded from the Lenovo site two nearest model's Energy managers (because the correct one does not exist), and the first one I tried WORKED, well and flawlessly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's 7xuf08ww.exe for lenovo Yoga 2 Pro (I think). I manages the battery again and flight mode button works again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wanted to share with you, who have the same problem, to save you to have to spend tens of hour researching, and hating Microsoft and Lenovo (in that order).............</p>

            Try installing and running the Lenovo Settings app available from the Microsoft App Store. You can turn on/off conservation mode from the app (along with quite a few other settings).

    <title>Xbox 360 pop-up menu on Xbox one&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chosenking12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 pop-up menu on Xbox one&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I strongly believe that the Xbox one could hands down have the best OS / UI, if they just add the 360's pop-up menu to the controls of the Xbox One controller. I think they should just add it as a 2.5 sec press and hold feature the menu button already
 present. I say they keep the Xbox emblem button as the home page and power on/off, and the menu button should serve as what its name is, a pause / menu / 2.5 sec P&amp;H pop-up menu.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How it would work... it would work like it does now, but during any point if you press and hold the menu button for 2.5 sec the pop-up menu style that pops-up on the Xbox 360 would come up, giving you all the actions/features/functions and settings
 that made Xbox navigating signature. I just think that feature alone would boost the Xbox and give it the competitive edge that Xbox always had on all other console when it came to navigation-(ing). Xbox and the Xbox 360 both had this which everyone fell in
 love with, now what's keeping them from keeping a feature that was so obviously pivetil to there success. Now I know this console is something inspired to be and feel new.., but you never get rid of patent signatures. (It's just suicide). Its like Micheal
 Jordan getting rid of his fadeaway and tongue wagging during his highlight moments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>What you guys think? comments please!</p>
<p>Bring Back the pop-up menu style of 360 or no?</p>

<p>Yeah it does, but that's for the Jewel emblem button, not the menu button, I was referring to the Menu button if you re-read it. &nbsp;I wouldn't want them to take nor change that button usage, just was saying add an 2+ sec 360 style pop-up to the now called

<p>Yeah, but if you still have your 360 like I do, you'd see I'm referring to the whole shutter style of how it come pop up and you don't have to completely jump to the home screen to access, lets say music, the notifications, apps &amp; games, updates and things
 of that sort. don't get me wrong I like the whole snap screen thing but its limited and refers you to use full screen on some snap app. The issues come into play per say while in particular games when you get an notification, accomplishment, or message, you
 should have the option to check it both instantly in its full app or the 360 style pop up menu. That was something that I really thought Xbox separated itself by and with.</p>

<p>It is instant though... The only difference is instead of it being a smaller screen that hovers over your game it swaps you to your home screen, which provides everything that the 360 has. Do you not know the repercussions of the 360 style? It was laggy
 when you were in a game. Xbox One's home screen is literally INSTANT and allows your game to run in the background while you multi-task to other things..</p>
<p>Honestly don't know why people compare the two, completely different systems and OS's, deal with it, what you got is instant swapping from game to game and a plethora of other features.

<p>Do you mean the Xbox Guide menu? I love it. I love the Xbox 360's current UI 100% because its more faster to navigate with the controller compared to the loading times on Xbox 1 when navigating with it's controller through all the menu's waiting for them
 to o..o...o... load (voice commands may be faster) and with 360's UI you can even add a picture/theme of your wish to the Dashboard background which definitely personalises your Xbox experience. And 360's UI to me is more user-friendly Xbox 1's UI is a bit
 too saturated with Windows 8. 360's UI is also metro. With my experience, Xbox 1's dashboard's font size is really small compared to Xbox 360's font size and several peps on here have commented about it. I've played a few Xbox 1 games and the font size in
 those games is a relieve to that with the Dashboard font size. </p>

<h2>            NASCAR Sim Racing Setup won&#39;t load from CD</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">I just recently purchased a brand new copy of NASCAR Sim Racing, however when I go
 to run the "RunGame.exe", nothing happens. I've tried compatibility mode, shutting off my antivirus, and running it as a administrator to no avail. Does anybody know what to do to fix this?&nbsp;</span>

            <p><em>NASCAR Sim Racing</em>&nbsp; uses SafeDisk copy protection which MS had decided to block.
</p>
<p>This is not the only possibility but a serious contender...DRM Blocking is a major issue with Win10 and old
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">secdrv.sys</span></em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp; on the disk</span> are being prevented from launching
</p>
<p>by MS's DRM Blocking malware.I have more details in my post at&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
--this thread--.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>- NASCAR&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>Thunder</em> &nbsp; 2003/2004 also use SafeDisk.</p>
<p><em>-&nbsp; NASCAR 4</em>&nbsp; and 2002/2003 <em>Season</em> use SecuROM ,&nbsp; so they&nbsp; should run on Win10 without fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- DRM Blocking malware aside, the majority of games that ran on Win7 will run on Win 10.
</p>
<p>Some may need coaxing.</p>

            <p>Thank you for responding BossDweeb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I have already tried this method and have had no success. The funny thing is that I was able to already&nbsp;install NASCAR Thunder 2004 without any trouble on my PC. I have even gone far enough to reinstall Windows 7 and install Windows 8.1 and
 Windows 10 to see if that worked, but it just won't start no matter what I do.</p>

            I also noticed that when I try to open the setup, there's a&nbsp;file called "dllhost.exe" that opens in task manager for 2-3 seconds and then closes, nothing else seems to open when I try to run the program.

<h2>            Xbox one new update&#58; completely messed up my xbox.</h2>
                    
<p>Last night my xbox randomly started updating and It was the new dashboard update that I accessed early through the preview program. I had an issue with the update itself and had to contact support &nbsp;twice where they got me to hard rest a couple times and
 it wouldn't work and then after disconnecting from the wifi and restarting it and then allowing the update to finish it finally went to the new dashboard but it now won't let me hard rest manually, the text is all messed up on the xbox. It won't let me access
 friends or start a party. It won't let me change tabs from the home tab and if i do it freezes there. And other tedious things. I understand the preview program and I expected issues but i think the update itself wasn't downloaded properly due to the hard
 resets during the update. So i'm not sure what to do. :( Just before the battlefront beta comes out to. It's so disappointing :(&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Password Required to Connect to Computer &#40;via Switch&#41;</h2>
                    Hi, I have a home network of 3 computers connected via switch. Two computers have Windows 7 and the other is running Vista. My Question is that when i try to access my other computers' shared folders while on my Vista PC it asks me for a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Password and User name</span> ? I don't have to do that for the 2 computers running Windows 7? I'm not aware of ever creating a password. Anyhow all 3 computers ping correctly and they have connection. Just that the main
 problem is that I don't know/have a password or user name to access shared folders via Vista. What should I do or Redo?

<p>Thank you Avijit_G</p>
<p>I figured out the problem was something more simple it took me a while to figure out. But i had to turn off password protected sharing in my network &amp; sharing setup on my windows 7 machines. But I am glad it's working now. Thank you though for giving me
 a hand.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 unable to do anything</h2>
                    <p>Your update the other night that was bogus and contained garbage has froze my husband's windows 7 computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I no longer get the windows logo screen so am unable to go into safe mode to remove the update.</p>
<p>When I press F8 or F12 (step by Step for his computer) to get try to get into safe mode, etc - I get invalid format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to put his Windows CD in the Drive and it is not reading that either so I can't repair windows that way either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to click on IE so I can try Fixit from MS website - the computer hangs up - won't do anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This mess was caused by your mess that was released so now please tell me what you are going to do to resolve my issue so I can get my husband's computer back up and running? &nbsp;or are you going to buy him a new computer because you totally messed his up with
 your download that screwed it up?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I guess they don't have an answer yet? &nbsp;or don't know how to fix something they screwed up with their updates? &nbsp;Is that the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If people can't access things on their computer to delete the files that were downloaded, can't get to safe mode or even run the windows recovery from the Windows CD - then please tell me what are we suppose to do? &nbsp;you guys screwed things up not the consumers
 - because I can't get into any aspect of the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>No Windows Logo - means</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot access - Alienrespawn, Bios, Safe Mode, or step by step boot&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is your problem to fix and I would like an answer -</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>12/12/2015 &nbsp;2:10 pm CST</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we are into another day and still no response from Microsoft on what to do - amazing - other ppl get responses and this goes unanswered and ignored it seems like --</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is basically dead in the water because no matter what I try I can't fix the errors that Microsoft caused with their last update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still cannot get windows logo screen&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to do anything on the computer and it hangs - totally frozen&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press a key when it is booting - i.e. to try to get to alien respawn, safe mode etc - &nbsp;the computer doesn't even boot after that - just get a black screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>reboot - no windows logo - STILL - and once everything has loaded - get the endless circle of death on the status bar at the bottom. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer is Windows 7 Professional 64 bit</p>
<p>8 mb of ram</p>
<p>1 tb of disk space - c drive where windows is at is 250 gb - how much is free at the moment since I can't even get to that with the mouse - that locks up computer as well - I have no idea</p>
<p>d drive has tons of free space I know that much</p>
<p>

            <p>unfortunately I can't change anything&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the computer set to boot from CD rom first if CD is in the drive - however even this is not working&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I can't get into the Bios - I can't check there either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your update Freezes every aspect of the computer operations :( &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is NO Windows LOGO Screen at all - therefore unable to hit any of the function keys without the system totally freezing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Only thing that was recently installed on this computer was the Windows Update on 12/8/2015 - since then this computer has been like this. &nbsp;Like it never finished the install and keeps trying but it's totally froze the system up once a mouse or key is
 pressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the windows 7 CD from the manufacturer that was provided at the time - it has not helped - since can't boot from it because of the issues with the update -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take responsibility for the screw up the Microsoft did with the update that has caused the issue and quit trying to say something else caused it ;) &nbsp;because there was nothing else that caused the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would gladly restore it to an earlier point if I could get one of the function keys to work - but alas - this is the issue that was caused by the update&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NO WINDOWS LOGO SCREEN - NO way to get into Bios, No way to get into step by step boot, and no way to get to Alien respawn (system restore) &nbsp;- all of those require being able to hit the function key and the system not freezing but since the update that is
 what happens. &nbsp;It's like it's in perpetual sleep mode even when you unplug the machine from the wall :( &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I boot the computer normally - and things load on the computer all you see is the endless circle of death on the bar at the bottom of the screen. &nbsp;Nothing else - as soon as you click to minimize the one window - the system freezes and nothing
 else can be done - if you try to bring up the start menu to run anything it freezes with the start menu up - so one cannot click on updates and remove the bad updates&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I created a system recovery disk on another Windows 7 computer - and it works fine on that computer I can boot from it on that computer - however, I still cannot boot from it on his computer - I get invalid format and it goes right into the normal screen&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this started all that he was doing was allowing Windows update to run - he left it run overnight - and came out the next day and this is how his computer was - unable to do anything further on it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You guys really need to know how to fix peoples computers when you mess them up with your updates - we should not have to pay out to have them fixed because of Microsoft updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I would please Like some information on How I can fix the boot issue without being able to access any of the function keys since you guys have totally corrupted his computer at this time. &nbsp;Clearly it is not working the way it was set up. &nbsp;And it was
 working just fine until the last Security updates that Microsoft put out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am unable to access Bios, Safe Mode, etc - then please tell me what the next steps are. &nbsp;I am not taking it to be repaired without Microsoft footing the bill in the case - since Clearly Microsoft screwed it up&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>My next step is to try and clear the cmos and see if I can force it that way&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>by the way I do know something about computers clearly&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but that will be a while - as I tend to leave unplugged a while to make sure it is cleared and try different things -&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So finally got in to bios and got things restored to factory settings&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the issue in a nutshell&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates started on 12/8/2015&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6 updates were done on 12/10/2015 - 11 pm&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 days to do updates and I think the endless circle of death means it is still working on updates - so clearly has to do with your server on your end because No matter what I have Never had updates take 48 hours to do -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These updates are your problem and have caused issues for people and to say that they may have installed other things on their computer when it's updates that caused the problem is beyond reprehensible in my book. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pulling a cmos battery is normally the last step anyone should do to reset things on their computer - and should only be attempted by those that know what they are doing. &nbsp;So fair warning to those reading this post. &nbsp;It's not something I like to do myself
 although I know how to do it - I try every way possible to fix a computer prior to pulling the cmos battery. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So know you know how to fix an issue you caused - but first I suggest you fix the update servers so that this doesn't cause issues for others. &nbsp;It shouldn't have caused issues to begin with &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You are not suppose to do that .......................... &nbsp;and especially not roll back drivers this may very well be the issue - Hubby doesn't look at the updates just installs - I looked at them this morning after I reset his computer yet again ..............
 and really Roll back his video driver 2+ years is really out there</p>
<p>

                    <p>As I made the mistake of buying a 32gb laptop, I ran out of space quickly and can't free anymore up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not update the laptop, it's slow and i just wanted a clean install. Well I can't do that either because when I use the Media Creation Tool it tells I need 8gb of space free on the C drive even though I can't free any space(I have nothing but chrome
 installed) and I have a 16gb usb stick plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment it's nothing more than a paper weight that won't even let itself be reset because it needs more space than it itself can't free up.</p>

            Hey DK.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You'd need to create the bootable media for your licensed version on another PC.
<br />
<br />Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings so you can choose only your PC's version and bit rate.  
<br />
<br />Then  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />--------------------
<br /> 
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />A clean install of Windows should only use at most 16GB of disk space. You can try to save more disk space by following these steps:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4026616/windows-10-disk-cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/402661...</a>
<br />
<br />If that still doesn't give you enough storage space, you'll need to use another PC to create a bootable USB drive by typing "create recovery drive" into Start, or by following the steps in the below link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/</a>...
<br />
<br />The USB drive needs to be empty and have at least 8GB storage space. Once you've created to bootable media, you can plug it into your other computer and reinstall Windows. It'll load up the Windows Recovery Environment, and from there you can reinstall.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support. Thanks!

            Hey DK.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You'd need to create the bootable media for your licensed version on another PC.
<br />
<br />Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings so you can choose only your PC's version and bit rate.  
<br />
<br />Then  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />--------------------
<br /> 
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>

<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.

<p>I put a pass code on my xbox live account half a year ago.. I can't seem to log in now.. I always have to recover my account to play online and I'm getting pretty tired from it. Any way xbox can send me a new one? I also have a visa card on it.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business Chats not Deleting</h2>
                    For the past two days, Skype for Business is showing chats for the past two years. If I delete them, they just re-appear. I have removed the app, and reinstalled the app, but nothing will fix it. I work on an iMac. We use Adobe Cloud programs and Microsoft
 Office 365.<br />

<h2>            Subnautica not launching.</h2>
                    



<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I've been playing the subnautica trial for quite a while, I've probably put in like 10 hours at this point, but trying to load the game up the other day it just errored, gave me a code but the code doesn't exist in the help section.
 I reinstalled the game to see if that could have been the issue. Yet no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
My only guess is it's either just broke right now but I can't find others with the issue, or maybe it could be an indicator of the trial ending. I want to play more especially if I can continue my game (not sure if I accidentally deleted the save game data
 deleting the game, the latest dashboard preview is awful) and I would pay for the game but I'm not sure it would even work if I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced anything like this, perhaps with a different game or just have any idea on what I should try.</p>
<p>Tommo</p>

            <p>What is the error code you get?</p>
<p>I think 10 hours might be the limit of the trial. They're not the same, but EA Access trials, for instance, are limited to either six or 10 hours each. As soon as you mentioned the time you'd already spent playing, I suspected that would be the issue.</p>

<p>Hmmm I thought I would try the prison architect trial since I had played that, which had a clear time limit that I had reached the end of. It does the same thing. same error code. I think I may have worked this one out.</p>

<p>If you were to purchase it, the game would begin working again; if not, it seems like the trial period has run its course.</p>

<p>Interesting turn of events. I try to buy Subnautica. I click buy, comes up with the payment options, but before I can proceed it says you already own this and just starts downloading something (presumably the key to unlock the full game, it was only mb/s).
 Now it says I own the game, but still wont let me launch it. The latest dash build is truly awful.
</p>
<p>Hmmm I will see what I can do from here.</p>

<p>It's definitely a preview program bug. It's affecting EA access and game previews. I'm trying to buy ARK in this sale but to no avail. Ibe manually updated the console, no luck. I've opted out of preview and factory reset, no luck there either. In fact it
 kept the preview OS after the reset. </p>
<p>I guess the only thing we can do for these games would be to opt out and wait for Microsoft to unenroll us. In my case, before the sale ends hopefully.</p>

    <title>No option for extending display &#40;for two monitors&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickitatz  say:</h3>
<h2>            No option for extending display &#40;for two monitors&#41;</h2>
                    Hi&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hoping you can help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I got a new laptop with windows 7, as well as a LG flat screen which I wanted to use to extend my display. However, it only lets me duplicate/clone the display so that laptop and monitor have the same display.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have read the other related questions but my problem seems different: I went to
<i>screen resolution</i>, but the <i>display</i> drop box only has an option called '1|2 multiple displays'. How do I get an option to display two screens there? Also, the
<i>multiple display</i> drop box does not have an 'extending these displays' option. So how do I extend my display??</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help!</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Kate,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me try and assist you with the concern.</p>
<p><br />
Kindly, refer to the section '<strong>My child's web activity shows a web site that I am certain he or she has not visited.&nbsp; Why?</strong>' from the article.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-security/family-safety-frequently-asked-questions/5672f7b2-e3c0-498a-9a6c-c9cab39f68e5"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-security/family-safety-frequently-asked-questions/5672f7b2-e3c0-498a-9a6c-c9cab39f68e5<br />
</span></a><br />
</span>As an example, let’s say your child visits a page that contains a “Like” button.<span>
</span>Even if the child doesn’t click the “Like” button, the mere presence of this button on the webpage may appear on the activity report as a trip to Facebook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>

<h3> lemonadestand  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP &#40;SP3&#41; Home Edition will NOT hibernate &#47; standby&#33; It remains stuck&#47;frozen.</h2>
                    <div>The screen goes to the usual Hibernate or Standby screen, displays "Preparing to..." and then hangs. The hard-drive indicator works at first but then it stops, the CPU fan too, and the Hibernate screen is stuck on "Preparing to hibernate..."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tried a few solutions such as "dumppo admin /ac minsleep=S3" (changed it from S1 to S3) but didn't work. Uninstalled my anti-virus Eset nod32. Problem still here. Disabled and re-enabled Hibernate, no solution. The hidden Hiberfil.sys file exists and matches
 my RAM size of 2GB. I downloaded FixIt but there's no option for "Windows XP fails to hibernate or standby."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I have been rebooting for ages now and am really angry at this piece of **** Windows. Also, Sony being the stupid manufacturer that it is, has left me with a laptop BIOS that is hardly useful for anything. You can change the boot sequence and that's it. There's
 no way to see Power states or ACPI&nbsp;settings. But I did check In Device Manager, there's no exclamation mark besides my hardware.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything was fine last week until I installed the latest trial version of Eset Nod32 and it told me my XP was out of date, so it ran Windows Update which downloaded about 5 updates. I ran Chkdsk after that (as a maintenance thing) and it fixed something
 about free disk space.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a verbose/log screen for "Hibernate," so I can see where exactly that stupid Windows is stuck?</div>

            For Hibernate and Stand By issues, it is prudent to look at video drivers.<br />
<br />
If you accepted some MS updates and those updates included any hardware video drivers that could have done it.&nbsp; Generally, if MS offers you any hardware drivers (video, audio, network) it is best to decline them and tell MS update to never offer you those updates
 again.<br />
<br />
Always get hardware drivers from either your computer manufacturers WWW page or from the WWW page of the manufacturer of the specific device.<br />
<br />
I suggest you undo your dumppo adjustment since that didn't work anyway and who knows exactly what that did and I have never used dumppo to fix any problem.<br />
<br />
Since even the latest Microsoft Answers forum implementation STILL does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know next to jack about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration
 and agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />

            Am afraid there's only a recovery partition and the Recovery CDs that i made. Am sure I have a bootable CD (PE Builder) somewhere and USB somewhere. The USB is mainly for BIOS update. Frankly i only consider those as last resort/desperate times.

<div>Oh btw, Shutdown is now hanging too. So i force shutdown by holding the power button until the screen goes black. I guess I could re-install the nVidia driver... I remember installing a trial DRM Remover software last week but it didn't work, so I removed
 it. I did note each time ZoneAlarm Pro informed me ]it was trying to change the system: SMServer, Snmvtsvc, Gsservice, ksuser.dll, soundtools5.exe (Mspclock, Drmaudio), customsetup.exe (NPF Service), Wincap 4.1.2. ...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did uninstall AV (Eset Nod32) and the problem was still there. My firewall is a 3-4 years out-of-date Zone Alarm Pro. Most times I live with just the firewall and no AV but with the rise of infected pop-ups, i had to install Eset Nod32 AV trial.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there a Shutdown or Hibernate command-prompt or &nbsp;log screen which shows all the steps it's running?&nbsp;</div>

            Let's see this part too from msinfo32:<br />
<br />
<i>For video device and driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.</i><br />
<br />
I am not a fan of ZoneAlarm and I understand some folks love it, but you might have to start getting some suspects out of the equation (uninstalling a few things) at least temporarily - you can always reinstall, right?&nbsp; That goes for your ESET too.<br />
<br />
If you are using the ZA firewall, you need to be sure to disable the XP firewall so you are not running two at a time and it is possible to apply "too much" protection to your system in that it will suffer in performance if you think that more protections might
 be better..&nbsp; Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Using the power button can cause corruption in the NT File System (NTFS) and I know sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, but you could end up in a no boot scenario and this familiar message:<br />
<br />
Windows XP could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SOFTWARE

            I have Zone Alarm Pro 9 (stable), expired in 2010 after which i never bothered paying for Firewall subscription. It's not an anti-virus. I should really remove and re-install it as part of eliminating the usual suspects.&nbsp;

<div>P.s. This is a laptop I upgraded when warranty was off. It has a 7200rpm 320GB hdd, 2GB ram and a 2.33Ghz core duo (did the thermal repasting and all). The in-built wireless stopped working in 2009 and since repairing this requires full laptop dis-assembly,
 I opted to buy a PCMCIA Linksys a/b/g card. Laptop is good (if you compare it to a tablet/netbook). But as I said, this Hibernate/Restart/Shutdown issue only started 1.5 weeks ago.</div>

            Your NVIDIA driver version says:<br />
<br />
<b>Driver Version<span> </span>6.14.10.8418</b><br />
<br />
NVIDIA says your driver version should be:<br />
<br />
<b>179.48</b><br />
<br />
I would navigate to the NVIDIA page and let their online scanner take a look at your system and if they suggest a driver update, take it.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</a><br />
<br />
When looking at the msinf32 info for NVIDIA driver versions, you have to know how to read them since it is a little screwy...<br />
<br />
On one system here, the msinfo32 NVIDIA driver version looks like this:<br />
<br />

Driver&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32\drivers\nv4_mini.sys (6.14.13.0681, 11.98 MB (12,557,728 bytes),
<b>9/27/2009</b> 4:12 AM)<br />
<br />
Note that it says the driver version is:<br />
<br />
<b>Driver Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.14.13.0681</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;--- must shift the decimal point to get NVIDIA version<br />
<br />
In NVIDIA language, that is driver version:<br />
<br />
<b>306.81</b><br />
<br />
Looking at the NVIDIA page for that card, it says the correct driver is:<br />
<br />
<b>Version: 306.81<br />
<br />
</b>So that is good...<b><br />
</b><br />
If you shift the decimal on <i>your </i>version, that would make your installed driver<br />
<br />
084.18<br />
<br />
And that makes no sense to me or NVIDIA.<b><br />
<br />
</b>If your driver update works, your version should be something like:<b><br />
<br />
6.14.17.948<br />
<br />
</b>I don't think it is good to run ESET and ZA at the same time either...<b><br />
<br />
</b>Since AV tools have gotten so complicated, many have their own uninstaller programs you need to use to really do a good job of getting rid of them, and ESET is no exception:<br />
<br />

<br />
</b>In their nice video, they explicitly say not to uninstall ESET using the Add/Remove Programs applet (I don't know how you uninstalled ESET though).<b><br />

            Hey!
<div><br />
<div>As you may know these nVidia drivers don't usually work for branded laptops. It has to be made available through the Vaio support website, otherwise you will get failed installation and error warnings "hardware not detected." So stupid, I have a Toshiba
 gaming laptop and I have the same problem there. Pathetic.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, I went along your thinking of checking each and every installed drivers for updates. I re-installed the driver for my PCMCIA Linksys wireless adapted (WPC54GX), well, I immediately uninstalled it afterwards because I had a change of mind. I felt
 it'd be best to let Windows detect it and re-do its driver installation. My XP is now working, I can
<u>Shutdown</u> and <u>Restart</u> properly. Sadly <u>Hibernate</u> is still not working. It is stuck on its first screen "Preparing to Hibernate" and if you press capslock, it lights on and off, indicating the system has not crashed. Just stuck and because
 of the GUI, I cannot see where.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have to say at this point that I may have tainted this solution by installing the latest&nbsp;<i>UPHClean-Setup.exe</i> for Windows XP. It's version 1.6G i think. Now I have a TSR in TaskManager called "uphclean.exe" and according to ZA Pro, it's doing its
 job right after boot up when Notification Area icon are loading. I like ZA, it tells me everything. No software can go online without my say so. And I can stop this "Software X wants to have this component Y run each time your computer starts."</div>
<div><br />
<div>There's a website I would like to give credit to and it's <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/answers/windows-shutting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MakeUseOf</a>&nbsp;. There was a section on Troubleshooting shutdown problems by right-clicking on 'My Computer,' select 'Manage' and in the list on the left, select '<b>Event Viewer</b>.' Something in the error messages/log tipped me off that it could be a network
 driver problem, and that's why I went for wireless card adapter.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Am glad it's working because otherwise I was getting ready to dig into this MS
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;308029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Incorrect zip code format when buying Windows 8</h2>
                    Trying to buy Windows 8, but in Portugal when normally resident in UK.&nbsp; At the billing address form fill in, I fail repeatedly on Zip/Post code.&nbsp; Tried various formats but never gets beyond this error. No where on the form is there a country option.&nbsp; So
 i ausume that the Zip code format is defaulting to local country format; ie Portugal and therfore does not like UK code!!&nbsp; Others seem to be suffering the same block to full Windows 8 purchase&nbsp;8.&nbsp; Bad start to Window 8 expereinece&nbsp;8.&nbsp; Hope it gets sorted soon!!

            <p>Same thing. I am living in Croatia, but am currently in London, UK. When I enter my Croatian ZIP code, the program won't accept it. I tried to fool it by just entering my London ZIP code and it worked, but I don't get the option to buy W8 for the advertised
 price (14.99$), but would have to buy them for UK price of 17.98 GBP, which is 14.99$ times two. I won't buy for that price as a principle matter, and I don't think I should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree that it's a bad start, and hope they'll correct it soon.</p>

            You should use the Zip Code/Postal Code of the Country where you are. For example: I bought my laptop in United States and order the windows 8 upgrade from Brazil. I had to use the Zip Code from Brazil (the City where was I). When I tryed to use the United
 States Zip Code the system didn't accept it. I hope this can help you.<br />

<p>Welcome to the world of being British!&nbsp; £17.99 = £14.99 plus 20% VAT.<br />
</p>
<p>MS sells everything in the UK for the same in pounds as it sells in the USA in dollars!&nbsp; In most cases it will be the same in the euro zone in Euro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; $14.99 plus tax in USA</p>

They will be restricting it to local addresses so they can work out what local taxes to add.&nbsp; Different countries have different taxes.&nbsp; In the EU the rate of VAT varies from country to country.

<h2>            clipomatic not working as before, any other  free program which can do the same</h2>
                    I have been using clipomatic for pasting text in different applications instead of typing them again and again. I used to press Ctrl+Alt+C and it used to show all the copied items and I used to select the item I wanted and it was pasted at the cursor position
 in the application but now it is not working that way. Can some body tell me some alternative free program which can do the same for me. thanks

    <title>Windows 10 HP Envy x360 Brightness Buttons Won&#39;t Work&#47;Stuck on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 HP Envy x360 Brightness Buttons Won&#39;t Work&#47;Stuck on Max</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The brightness on my HP Envy x360 laptop is stuck on max:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1) I've tried updating my both Intel(R) HD Graphics 5500 and NVIDIA GeForce 930M in the Display Adapters column. However, it said that both of them are up to date already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Also, I've confirmed that the PnP-Monitor is enabled but the screen brightness problem still continued to persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Plus, I even reverted the Intel graphics card back to an older version and readjusted the resolution back to recommended afterwards but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2 Other Possible Solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could possibly uninstall Windows 10 Home and replace it with the older version (Windows 7)</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a full system restore while erasing everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*However I want to see if there are any other suggestions out there to fix this bug before moving on to the last two options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>A fellow HP User in need</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Any information regarding this issue would be useful</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.P.S. Thank you guys in advance!! :)</p>
