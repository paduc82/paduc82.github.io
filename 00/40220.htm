    <title>Suggestion&#58; Family Sharing enabled on Xbox One Games - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Suggestion&#58; Family Sharing enabled on Xbox One Games Downloads&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Yo Xbox Forums!&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's been an exciting week! E3, aftermaths, lots of games, and today, the DRM removal of the Xbox One.</p>
<p>For one, I think many people over the net are happy, others are lent down because this could remove the proposal of having cheaper games at early times. Others, like me, are quite sad to see that the family sharing feature will fade away. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Since I believe that complaining does not &nbsp;solve a thing, I suggest (which I could be very wrong) to allow games downloaded via Xbox Live to be shared with family members. Furthermore, the DRM will be the same used on the 360.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do it a la iTunes. For example, if I connect &nbsp;to the Internet, I decide which family members will be allowed to play the game at once. Since, I believe there were two people, I select the ones I see fit. if I select two family members, then my game
 is locked out, and I can't play it until I relinquish the authorization from other family members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The thing is that a single player game could be replicated throughout all family members if they decide to set each other offline. Example: I have three family members: Alan, Wilson, William. I activate the family sharing, and lend Wilson the game. I can
 still play the game because I own the authorization. I disconnect my xbox from the Internet. I log in in another console and relinquish my own authorization and give it to Alan. Then, Wilson does the same: he disconnects his device from the Internet, and logs
 in in William's device. He sets the rights to use the game to William. Now, the 4 can play the same game at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why? Because each xbox offline were previously authorized to play each game. They will be able to do so, as long as you don't connect back to the Internet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;To counter this method, I'd suggest a mandatory online check, each 24 hours, IF AND ONLY IF you enable Family Sharing. Both parties would be happy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Things that changed:</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>1. "Family Share Plan". They never clarified what this meant. </p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>2. Discs. You must have the disc in console to play.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>Things &nbsp;that haven't changed:</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>1. Your digital library of games will still follow you from console to console; as it ALREADY does with the 360.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>2. Digital or disc on day one.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>So your crying about the "Family Share Plan" that, more than likely, would have turned out to be a extended demo. It doesn't make sense for game companies to cry about lost revenue from used games then offer a "Buy 1 Get 9 FREE!". Don't want to put a disc
 in your console to play games? Buy all digital! Problem solved.</p>

<p>No it was a very clever and genius way of marketing a game to 10 potential buyers and also worked out in the consumers favour because they get to play the entire game too. Think about it,</p>
<p>If I have call of duty (a big game that alot of people are highly addicted to) and 5 of my friends don't have it but start playing it with me. They get addicted and want to play it from my library, but the same thing happens to another friend, and they want
 to play it too. Only one of them can play it at a time or one can play with me (the original owner of the game) because the friends that don't own it want to come and join in with all their friends in all the online shenanigans, they have tried it, loved it
 and know that its a game they want, they have no choice but to buy their own copy which they can do instantly and join straight in... Boom a copy sold. And seeing as all the games presented were all based around being online, even during a single player campaign
 you will see others in their own game (like world of Warcraft) this would happen very often. And both sides benefit. They promote a game, our friend can play it as much as he liked before he buys. Win win. Its like now, i only have a copy of each game, if
 i lend it to friend A i cant lend it to friend B but i can lend friend B a different game from my collection. The benefit of a friend being able to play co op games with me without disc was awesome too. Also keeping money within the industry is a good thing
 as it will invest in the future of gaming.</p>

<p>If I have call of duty...[/quote]</p>
<p>C.O.D., Battlefield, etc., may warrant multiple copies though single player games would bleed money. My friends already had it worked out...</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>1. Three other of my friends play the C.O.D. franchise. That comes down to 2 purchases instead of 4.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>2. Games like Tomb Raider, Bioshock, etc., would have been split between at least 6 ways with each of us buying a different game. Between the short campaign of said games and our different work/school schedules it would have saved us a TON of coin.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>3. Instead of 2 copies of say Fable sold between the girlfriend and I, it turns into one sold. Not to mention my friends could play it too.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>4. The majority of my friends live to far away to just borrow discs (Which turns into a purchase from all of us.); now if we could just "Borrow" digitally...</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>Yep, they would have made a lot of money of of us. Now just think of the truly clever ones; they were already setting up share clubs with rotating "Family" members.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>Get real. It would have never worked.</p>

            Hi Phrischil 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 is strange, dues to the Fast Startup, a shut down is not really a shut down and a restart is a real shut down - it's confusing . . 
<br />
<br />On a cold boot, Windows 10 actually reads back in the previous state of your RAM from the hard drive into RAM - it is very much like the old Hibernate function
<br />
<br />A Restart, actually shuts your PC down and starts up again, that is why in Windows 10 a restart takes a lot longer than shutting down and starting again . .. 
<br />
<br />_____________________________________________________
<br />
<br />
<br />Try repairing your Windows Startup routine:
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot efficiently each time . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to

            Hello Pris,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try repairing boot records, using these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />5. Type following commands one-by-one and press Enter key after each:
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /SCANOS
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /FIXMBR
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /FIXBOOT
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD
<br />
<br />6. Close Command Prompt and see if you can boot now.
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Memory testing methods are in the section following these driver update methods.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your<br />
system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address<br />
of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and<br />
more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most<br />
current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and<br />
complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the<br />
version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind<br />
certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if <br />
3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers <br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then<br />
Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest<br />
versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while<br />
there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT<br />
after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing<br />
actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed<br />
(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is<br />
installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER -<br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in<br />
Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers<br />
which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then<br />
HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

=======================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
That is a lot of Bug_Check, too many to specifically try to troubleshoot just one at a time.<br />
So the best plan is to use a broad based method to try to reduce the number to none or<br />
one (hopefully).<br />
<br />
<p>Use the methods such as SFC, CheckDisk, Driver Updates, and others in the troubleshooter<br />
referred to in this link as they will help solve or at least narrow down the issues. After those<br />
you can post the information from BlueScreenView and these other utilities so we can offer<br />
more specific advice. Of course checking with a real computer shop or System Maker's<br />
Support would be a good idea however I would try the possible solutions you can first.</p>
<p>Check this thread for information using BlueScreenView, MyEventViewer and other methods<br />
to troubleshoot BlueScreens - top 3 replies (+1 other).<br />

Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps.<br />
Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner?<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the<br />
vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all<br />
you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (still can try adding a small fan as a<br />
test).<br />

<h2>            How to change Windows Store games language</h2>
                    There are some games featured in the Windows Store, such as Wolfenstein II The New Colossus which doesn't give the player the ability to change the language of the game. I've tried to change OS language, change the region, to no avail. Ive contacted the
 Windows support via chat and they told me to get in contact with Bethesda support, which in turn told me to get in contact with Windows support. So nobody knows how to change the language of the game. I want it changed from Spanish to English, so I know it's
 possible. Even in the installation folder there are sound files for various languages, including english, but Windows won't let me change anything insdide the folder.

            Just for the games that don't give you the option to change the language. Games such as Gears of War 4 and Hello Neighbor do feature the ability to change the game's language from within the menus, but other games such as Wolfenstein II do not. So I'm
 just having problems with those games.

<br />The System File Checker tool built into Windows can scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a file has been modified, it will automatically replace that file with the correct version. Here’s how to use it.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow

<h2>            Service Host&#58; Network Service - Continuosly using bandwidth for over a month</h2>
                    <p>Service Host: Network Service has been using bandwidth for well over a month at this point, its currently limited to 0.5Mbps, as i managed to limit its usage by turning background down loads down to 5%, if i undo this it increases how much it uses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>at 0.5Mbps it doesn't really impact anything as its hard to low, regardless of how bad my net is. However I don't see how is could actually be downloading still over this amount of time, when i first noticed it i left it going all day trying to get whatever
 the update was out of the way but it never stopped.</p>
<p>If i manually check for updates, its up to date. According to the activity monitor I've downloaded 30GB of date from the start of this month (16 days at this point)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have zero idea how to check to see what is downloading/uploading or anything like that, i simply know it is doing something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have all p2p stuff turned off and it hasn't used any data for that reason as that is also limited to 5GB and still have 5GB left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So does anyone have an idea of what windows is trying to do?</p>

            Hi Nerfix 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Update
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options - Delivery Optimization - Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Pull the sliders you will find there to their minimum values . . .
<br />
<br />That should dramatically reduce your data usage . . .

            Hi Nerfix
<br />
<br />In your original post, your system is reporting it is up to date
<br />
<br />That delivery optimization feature allows for updates to be downloaded, then that update will be uploaded to hundreds of other PC's from your PC and can use up to 500GB of data in a month, that is why I suggested pulling those sliders to their minimum, especially the bottom 2
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what Version No. and build No. of Windows 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Open the Settings App, go to Network and Internet - Data Usage
<br />
<br />Is it shown there, an application with very high data usage?

<p>just wondering when your going to fix the cheating in this game.. many many lobbys have people usen aim bots and hacks..the lagg is a total joke the lagg comp. is a total joke cause if you lagging then your dieing.. more then a hundred times now i got hit
 markers on someone&nbsp;olny for them to one shot me dead. my rockets disapper all the time or i shot&nbsp;one in the middle of 5 people it kills olny one person or it blows up and im killed bye friendly fire and i know for a fact there no friendly team mates near them
 at all copple times now i shot one and it blows up in open air there nothing anywere near me but open air but some how it blows up right after i pull the trigger..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o wait your not going to fix this one cause&nbsp; you got black ops 2 coming out in a week to get you more of are cash and you dont give a poo about this game or any of its players because if we matter you would have fixed this flop b4 you made a new one.. but
 you made a new one and going to release it with out good testing so your going to have the same problems with blo2 because theres hacks out for the game and it hasent even been released yet.. just shows you have no control over your owen systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i wont buy the new game cause this one sucked so badly it ruined my will to play any game made by I.W.&nbsp; i want to thank you for the worst game i ever bought</p>
<p>good luck with the aim bots hackers and modded controlers since you have no control over them and they rule your games..</p>

<p>There are cheats, hacks, glithes, and exploits for sure but not near as bad as your making it out. &nbsp;Most of the problems you described are a combination of lag and people having a better understanding of how to play the game. &nbsp;Been playing this game since
 release and tho its not my favorite game its not broken either. &nbsp;Every hack has been fixed pretty quickly but expect new ones to pop up after the next release.</p>
<p>As far as Blops 2 goes, I would expect it to be as clean as Blops.&nbsp; 3arc seems to have&nbsp;a better grasp on how to keep thier games secure.&nbsp; I.W. has nothing to do with it, fyi.</p>
<p>Modded controlers are cheap but are condoned by microsoft and sold in stores.</p>
<p>I think your on the right track by not picking up any more cod games if they get you as frustrated as your coming off.</p>

<p>OP--It seems you have lag and lots of it. Maybe you need new internet or upgrade? Aimbots, nah, there is auto aim built into console FPS (first person shooter) games, Learn2useit. BTW (by the way), IW has NOTHING to do with Black Ops 2. Your rockets and

<p>I understand lag but rockets blowing up in your face doesn't usually happen unless you hit something, too close to a fence or window sill? &nbsp;I've had that happen, even though I thought my launcher was clear. &nbsp;Sorry the game was such a disappointment to you.
 &nbsp;I still enjoy it.</p>

    <title>New Skype for Windows 10 is badly broken&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr yossu  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype for Windows 10 is badly broken&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I just started Skype, and was given a message telling me there was a new version, especially for Windows 10, and did I want to try it. I accepted, and the new version started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from the fact that it asked me to sign in again (why can't it pick up the sign-in details from the existing version?), it seems to be badly broken. The following points spring to mind immediately, although there were many more.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>None of my keyboard shortcuts work, such as Ctrl-Alt-S to minimise/restore the Skype window, Alt-PgUp to answer a call, Alt-PgDown to end, etc</li><li>In the old version, if I minimised the Skype window, I could then restore it without problem. In the new version, when I restore, it seems to think it's starting up again, and gives me the same message about trying the new version.</li><li>The new version insists on using my computer's speakers, instead of the headphones I use. If I go to the settings, the options to change the microphone and speakers are both disabled, so I can't change this.</li></ul>
<p>Thankfully, the new version is so badly broken that it repeatedly asks me which version I want to run, so I was able to go back to the old version, but I'm worried that they are going to push this out as a compulsory upgrade soon. The way it is now, it's
 pretty unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are they going to fix this before hoisting it on us?</p>

<p><span>Since Skype for Windows 10 (Skype for Preview) is still a work in progress. Skype is still gather feedback regarding the new Skype app, you may want to provide

<p>If it's such a work-in-progress, then this should be made&nbsp;<strong>very</strong> clear when offering it to unsuspecting users. I would say that the current version is little better than a beta, and certainly not something you want the general public using.
 People who do beta testing know what to expect, and proceed accordingly. Members of the public don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I submitted feedback, although based on my previous experience of giving MS feedback, I don't hold out much hope. Meantime, I'll steer as clear of this beta as I can.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>to me it was forcefully installed without me asking for it, and also there is no way to return to the old one anymore (i said yes once and after some time i reverted back to the old version because it was not working properly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i revert back to the old one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>My upgraded skype became unusable just before an important virtual meeting. So we had to to it by expensive phone.</p>
<p>How do I downgrade to something that does work?</p>
<p>No wonder WebEx and other competitors are taking over.&nbsp; It is worth paying for something that works.&nbsp; A free ball and chain went out with the middle ages.</p>

            I also was not given an option that I recall. Or if so it wasn't memorable. Skype seems to have drasitically changed with the recent Windows update and now Skype is useless. It actually blue screened my newish expensive PC (i7 32 RAM). I use Skype for
 my coaching business and I am now being forced to use my PHONE until I find something else. Ridiculous. Please! How do we get the old full Skype back?

<p>Please add to your "work in progress" list that it doesn't seem possible to define what the ENTER key does.</p>
Some people like the ENTER key to start a new line insead of sending off the half completed message.

    <title>Returning a game bought from Xbox Live marketplace since - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Returning a game bought from Xbox Live marketplace since it&#38;&#35;39&#59;s not working</h2>
                    
<p>I know that all purchases are final, and you just can't return a game due to not liking it or something else. But in this case, it's litterally not working as promised.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about HALO 4 - the campaign and online-multiplayer might work fine, I haven't tried it - but 4 times splitscreen, which is the only thing I bought it for, is next to unplayable. Completely hopeless framerate; under some circumstances people almost
 teleports back and forth. And that just can't be right.<br />
<br />
So what do I do; who do I contact? And while I've convinced myself that a refund most be possible in this case - are some of you of an opposite opinion?<br />
<br />
Best regards, and thanks for your time<br />
Rightlov&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your input, onyx62is. But how can that be a valid argument? - people have different tastes and different reasons for buying a game. For me, that's the split-screen function. Everything in my case gets played in split-screen with my friends; be
 it online, local or campaign, and it just doesn't work. Some maps I simply can't play, as I reckon it has &gt;10fps. Clearly that can't be acceptable? - And it's not the xbox; it's one of the newest, and it has been at this one position ever since I bought it,
 + it work just fine with all the other games.</p>
<p>Thanks Killswitch, I'll try to redownload it soon. But still, I won't take a no for an answer - cause this is ridiculous; I understand that if I didn't like the game, completed it too fast, or something third, that it'd be nonrefundable, but when a game
 simply doesn't *work*, that's something else.</p>

<p>In theory, anything can be infected by malware.&nbsp; In practice it would be pretty nearly impossible to happen.</p>
<p>These days, any device with more complexity than a toaster has a microprocessor and a program that is usually embedded in flashable (re-writable) memory.&nbsp; So yes, a custom-written malware package could infect the flash memory inside the device and cause
 problems.&nbsp; But it would have to be written to expressly do so and customized for each modem type.&nbsp; In other words, not very likely, but possible.</p>

<h2>            win 7 home premium&#47;event id 7000 and 7009&#47;sony vaio nw26m</h2>
                    HI all,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a <u><b>pre-installed win7 home premium</b></u> for 2 yrs now and the laptop isnt even used that much. For the first year was used about one hour a week.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>Anyway, I would like to THANK ANY1 WHO CAN HELP. Also, Sorry for long post I am not that good with computers.&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyway after the first 8 months I had a virus and reboot to factory &nbsp;default. And didnt have any further problems until about 2 months ago.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The <b><u>problem </u></b>started when I was trying to reactivate Office 14 Pro Plus. During the last 2 moths I changed a few things (cant remember all) in
<b>Services </b>and <b>Computer Management</b> and<b> Firewall Settings advanced</b>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And during this process I started getting <b>Windows Activation error 80070002.</b> But windows
<b>was always showing as ACTIVATED</b>. Just the <b><u>MGA report </u></b>was showing the above error. I was not getting anywhere with the Office 14 Pro Plus reactivation problem (did a rearm using cmd prompt) as well&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>(this Office 14 was installed from a Original Disk from a friends' company) and I was having too many errors on event like (7000, 7009, 33, 100002, 7, and so on) &nbsp;</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>SO, and because I read that Windows uses KMS to activate (or something) and Office too, uses KMS and I had been changing services lots of them(SSP, KMS, OSPP, and lots of others...after reading which one depends on which I was enabling lots of them) I
 decided to<b> RESTORE MY C: to 08/10/2011 through System Restore.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Problem</b>: Restored <u><b>sucessfully</b></u> but I had <b>AVAST </b>running when i did the restore and
<b>after restore</b> I had <b>AVG </b>on my list of programs and desktop, and <b>
AVAST</b> was not. <b>BUT &nbsp;AVAST</b>&nbsp;did show on my C:/program files86/...but I could not get
<b>AVG </b>to work (not opened) nor <b>Uninstall </b>it (CCleaner and REVO) didnt work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Solution</b>: Restore C: to <b>FACTORY DEFAULT &nbsp;</b>through <b><u>Vaio Recovery Center.&nbsp;</u></b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Result</b>: Sucessfully done. Now I get <b>McFee </b>again the Trial Period I had used already, but
<b>couldnt open</b> the d<b>esktop Icon </b>but showing as <b>Running </b>In <b>Services</b>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Solution applied:</b> Uninstall Mcfee and installed AVAST.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now that evrything looked OK, apart from my partition was <b>named I: </b>and after the restore was showing<b> D:</b>. But cause I
<b>did restore C:</b> I thought the restore points are deleted so the backups wont work.
<b>So, I deleted the volume D: and created a new one. Although the first volume D: (the partition where I had the Backups, and System Image) was showing the correct GB used and Free. The same ones I should have except it should be named I:. But cause I changed
 the Computer Name and User Name after the Restore of C: I decided it was better to delete D: and create a new one.</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>SORRY FOR THE LONG POST, I AM FININSHING NOW.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Well everything looked OK now, But the ERRORS 7000 AND 7009 ARE STILL COMING SOON i START THE LAPTOP. i DIDNT EVEN TOUCH ANYTHING , NOR LOADED ANY BACKUPS, OR CHANGED ANY SETTINGS. IS AS DEFAULT.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CAN ANY1 PLEASE HELP????? &nbsp;I read somewhere that I have to change the values under registry...I think is too dangerous...cant afford to make changes that might put pc at risk.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>The errors are : 7009/7000</b> A timeout was reached (30000 milis) &nbsp; while waiting for HsFxAudioService to connect. I stoped the service under msconfig(disable it) and now get the error 7009 ( something similar but now references to Roxio upnp)&nbsp;</div>
<div>ALSO 4001 WLAN autoconfig is stoped.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>DID<b> SFC /scannow </b>was <b>OK</b>, DID <b>AVAST BOOT SCAN</b> was <b>OK</b>, DID
<b>MALWARE FULL SCAN</b> was <b>OK</b>. Also, DID <b>CHKDSK </b>was <b>OK</b>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>THANK U</div>

            HI Ganesh A.B.,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>FIRST - I would like to THANK U &nbsp;for ur time and for reading such a long post, but I just thought it was important to explain all the problems the laptop had since new. And also all the steps I had taken.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This laptop is very Important to me and I really dont want to put it at risk by changing things that CAN CAUSE impredictable damages like changing the registry.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am wondering if theres any other way (without spending money) to get this sorted, What is causing this change? if before the service was responding and connecting and sundenly not, it must be from one of the updates/? I have read so many posts about
 this error, but luckyli I am not getting any blue/black screens, or sudden shut downs...not yet at least....</div>
<div><br />
<div>But thats exactly what I am worried about.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also read that the &nbsp;service HsFxAudioService and VzcdbSvc has to do with Sony Vaio Entertainment Platform...but no solutions work....If I contact Sony...is out of warranty...so...</div>
<div><br />
<div>But if their product updates are conflicting with Microsofts' updates ...than who is supposed to pay for it?I mean, if any thing goes wrong and system just crashes?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe If I DO A SYSTEM FULL RESTORE BACK TO DEFAULT...AND USE THE LAPTOP AS I BOUGHT IT, WITHOUT DOWNLOADING ANY UPDATES EVER ,IS BEST?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry for so many ??? I just dont feel confortable to back up registry and do the changes...anyway I will give it a go later. &nbsp; thank u</div>

            Hi Nirmal,
<div><br />
<div>Thank u for ur reply and ur time. I only checked in today....after so many problems I decided to do a second system restore of C: to default.</div>
<div><br />
<div>the errors <b>7000 and 7009 from HsFxAudioService and &nbsp;VzcdbSvc </b>are still logging everytime I start the laptop and regularly...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I turned off the<b> Win Updates</b> and <b>Vaio Updates</b> straight after the restore....hoping the errors would be gone, and assuming that it had to do with any update. Apparently the errors are still logging and no updates have been installed, so...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, my webcam (which always worked well)&nbsp;<b>Arcsoft Webcam Companion 3 </b>
that is pre installed , tells me (soon I open it):</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Set up Needs the Next Disk </b>screen opens and says :&nbsp;</div>

            <p><b><span>Hi Rosh19,</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Thank you for keeping us posted about the status of the issue.</span></b></p>
<span>
<p><br />
<b>Method 1-</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p><span>Try to <b>uninstall and reinstall the Arcsoft Webcam Companion 3</b> on your computer.<br />
Check if the issue still persists.</span></p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<b>Method 2-</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform <b>Clean Boot</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in <b>Clean Boot state </b>helps in identifying if any
<b>third party applications or startup items</b> are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below for performing a
<b>Clean Boot</b>-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></b><span><br />

<p><span><br />
<b>Note:</b> You need to follow <b>Step 7</b> from the article mentioned above to get the computer back to
<b>Normal Startup</b> after you follow all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the errors still come up after performing a <b>clean boot</b>. If the errors disappear then it means that a
<b>third party startup application </b>is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>If none of the steps help fix the issue then you need to perform the <b>
steps (registry)</b> from the article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/933757" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi Nirmal,
<div><br />
<div>Sorry for this late reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am Really mentally drained about all the problems I am having...and I dont even use the laptop that much.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All these problems started couple months ago. Anyway, on the<b> 10th I did a second restore of drive C: to factory default</b>. The laptop was bought 2 yrs ago and only &nbsp;got one virus after 8 months of buying it where I had a full restore done to factory
 default. and in the last<b> 2 months I did 1 restore to 08/10/2011 </b>which was sucessfull but I had a diferent Antivirus at the point to which was restored and couldnt get AVG uninstalled or AVAST to work so I then did the
<b>1st restore of drive C: (Default)</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>But through out these last 2 months I am always having the <b>7000 (HsFxAudioService) and 7009 (Roxio PnP) errors. A timeout of 30000 miliseconds was reached while waiting for HsfXAudioService to connect. The same for msg for Roxio Pnp Server 10.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>As well as <b>4001</b> source WLAN AutoConfig. - Stpped and&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>10002 </b>Source WLAN Autoconfig WLAN Extensibility Module has stopped.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>1014&nbsp;</b>Name resolution for the name dns.msftncsi.com timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>1</b>. After the<b> 2nd and last restore of C: on the 10th May 12</b>, I downloaded the
<b>Arcsoft webcam 4 Trial of 30 days</b>, and <b>now I get to work with both Arcsofts : the Webcam 3 - which came pre installed ; and the Webcam 4 which is the Trial for 30 days.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div><b>2</b>. Also, cause I have had a few problems with the Win Updates before,<b> I had turned off the Auto updates from win Updates. But after the 10th May, I selected about a 100 updates just after the restore of C: to default and by mistake (I think)
 I must have selected the &nbsp;WINDOWS SP1 Update, which installed Sucessfully. I was about to uninstall it but when I got to the point of SCAN FOR PROGRAMS AFFECTED I noticed that lots of drivers are more recent ones than the ones i have pre installed(as I said
 the laptop has 2 yrs) so I didnt uninstall this WIN SP1 update although I already have the WIN 7 SP1 pre-installed.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, I will try and follow ur advice, but please could you tell me if I should
<b>uninstall </b>the <b>Win7 Update SP1 </b>and the<b> Arcsoft webcam 4 before I attempt the Clean Boot?</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Dont know if this will help</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Thank you for keeping us posted about the status of the issue.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is not necessary to uninstall
<strong>Service Pack 1.</strong> You need to <strong>uninstall</strong> the <strong>
Arcsoft webcam</strong> and then check if the issue persists.<br />
Also perform the <strong>Clean Boot</strong> mentioned in the earlier post. Get back to us with the results.</span></p>

            Hi Nirmal,
<div><br />
<div>Sorry for the delay. I have been really busy with other things.</div>
<div><br />
<div>- I tried the option u advised me. Did the reboot in selective mode and selected to hide all microsoft services...and so on, as mentioned in the link and the problem still persists. Errors 7000/7009/etc(mentioned in the other post)</div>
<div><br />
<div>- Tried to re install <b>arcsoft webcam 3 </b>but i get this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please insert the disk 1 that contains <b>C:Windows/mount/temp/1 that contains setup.ini file.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>- Now I did insert 3 Disks 1 that I created, and the last one was created just after the last restore of C: to factory default last week or so<i><b><u>(these are the recovery disks i believe)</u></b></i>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And nothing happens is like I didn't insert anything. Just the auto-run screen starts and i cancel it so that I can click on the OK in the
<b>set up Needs Next Disk</b> screen(when asking for the above Disk 1)</div>
<div><br />
<div>- Also, tried to restore arcsoft from the only back up I have which is about 3 weeks old but it says it can't restore to insert Disk 1, the same msg above.</div>
<div><br />
<div>- Haven't tried to uninstall the<b> arcsoft 4 </b>cause it is a <b><i>trial with 23 days left</i></b> and I am wondering if I could use, somehow, that<b> setup.ini</b> file to get the
<b>Arcsoft 3 </b>to work. Even if it means doing some changes on the file so that it doesn't expire when the trial expires. But I don't know how to or if it is possible.</div>
<div><br />
<div>WOULD APPRECIATE FURTHER ADVICE.THANK U.</div>
<div><br />

<p><span><br />
<b>Thank you for keeping us posted about the status of the issue.</b></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Method –</b></span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is possible that missing <b>Setup.ini file could be due to a damaged disk</b>.<br />
Try to re-install the <b>Arcsoft</b> <b>Webcam</b> <b>
3</b> with the disk by running the <b>Setup</b>.<b>exe</b> <b>

Check if that helps.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.

The attached DMP file is of the <b>WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR (124)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<p><i>A fatal hardware error has occurred. This fatal error displays data from the Windows Hardware Error Architecture (WHEA).</i></p>
<br />
<p>If we run an !errrec on the 2nd parameter of the bugcheck (address of the WER structure) we get the following:</p>

<br />
BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; X64_0x124_<b>AuthenticAMD_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV</b></i><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This implies that the WHEA error reporting service reports a generic timeout error, which indicates that the CPU found and/or ran into a problem but couldn't pinpoint it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What this - <i><b>AuthenticAMD_PROCESSOR_BUS_PRV </b></i>tells us is the culprit and/or issue came from somewhere along the bus.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As this is a fairly generic *124 and not so straightforward, some troubleshooting is required. I am going to first off recommend running Memtest for NO LESS than ~8 passes (several hours) to check the health of your RAM. If it passes, ensure you have the
 latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented with the latest video card driver
 and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the above fails, there is only so much you can do with a bugcheck like this until it comes down to a faulty processor that will need to be replaced. Start from 1 and work downward:<br />
<br />
<b>1. </b>Ensure your temperatures are within standard and nothing's overheating. You can use a program such as Speccy if you'd like to monitor temps -
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/speccy</a><br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Clear your CMOS (or load optimized BIOS defaults) to ensure there's no improper BIOS setting -

http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm</a><br />
<br />
<b>3. </b>Ensure your BIOS is up to date.<br />
<br />
<b>4. </b>The <i><b>only</b></i> software conflict that can usually cause *124 bugchecks are OS to BIOS utilities from manufacturer's like Asus' AI Suite. If you have something like this software-wise, remove it ASAP.<br />
<br />
<b>5. </b>If all of the above fail, the only left to do is replace your processor as it is faulty.<br />

            Thank you for your reply, I have on provlem with solutions number 1,2, and 3. The problem is that I cannot uninstall AI Suite II. I have tried going into safe mode to uninstall but it wouldn't let me uninstall it. Do you have any solutions to that problem?<br />

            Could be a video card issue. Do you have access to integrated graphics? If so, I'd uninstall your video card drivers, shut down, physically remove the video card and install the latest integrated graphics drivers and use the system as you would regularly.<br />
<br />
If this is a laptop and/or there is no access the integrated graphics, run Memtest as I said above:<br />
<br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<h2>            Stolen Laptop&#47;find my device</h2>
                    My computer was stolen a month ago, I am able to track it down under the find my Device and it shows that it has not been turned on since they took it, and the battery still appears the same at 77%. I already turned on the option to lock it but it says
 it cannot do so because its off line, does this mean they haven't tried to turn on my device or they already wipe it, or jailbreak it?

            Hi MCEE_88,
<br />
<br />If it cannot be located, one of two things have happened, they have not put that device on the Internet, since they stole it, or they have wiped it flat and it will not be traceable, if they have done that . . .
<br />
<br />Yzou can wait for another while in case they have not formatted it and it might appear on the Internet
<br />
<br />A lot of the time, these thieves, sell to a unscrupulous second hand shop and the PC sits there until it is sold to some unsuspecting customer. at that point, if they turn it on and put it on the Internet, it will be locked . . .

            Hi MCEE_88, yes if they have wiped it, your data will have been wiped also.
