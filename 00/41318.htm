 on that. That way when you go to your friends house all you have to do is plug it and go.

    <title>Turtle Beach X12 with the Xbox one without the adapter&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vamprizm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turtle Beach X12 with the Xbox one without the adapter&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I've used the Turtle Beach X12 headset for the xbox 360 and lately I've been thinking about using it for the xbox one. I've done my research and it turns out I needed the adapter, but then I realized I have the 2015 wireless controller with the 3.5mm
 port, so then I thought, "I wouldn't need the adapter."</p>
<p>For those of you that don't know, the turtle beach X12 consists of a USB for power, and a green 3.5mm audio jack. There is also a 3.5mm pink audio jack for the mic but there is no need for that pink jack for the xbox.</p>
<p>So, I plugged the green 3.5mm audio jack into the port at the bottom of my controller, and plugged the USB into the xbox one. My audio didn't work. To verify that my audio was working and it was the headset that wasn't working, I plugged in earphones with
 a similar 3.5mm audio jack (the earphones didn't have a USB for power), and the audio was coming out of the earphones fine.</p>
<p>My assumption of why it wasn't working is that the USB and the audio jack are plugged into different sources?</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I could hook up my headset to my xbox with buying the adapter or anything else? Is there a way around this with the 2015 wireless controller? Btw, I play on a monitor and it has no audio ports for my headset to plug in to.</p>

<p>I had the exact same problem but I upgraded.</p>
<p>What I would do is make sure you have all of the cords plugged into the Xbox One and the TV.</p>
<p>If that does not work let me know. :)</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update&#47;Installation - WHAT A MESS&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> longknife32b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update&#47;Installation - WHAT A MESS&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, this all started when my computer (HP Pavilion P6000) automatically began the latest Win10 cumulative update program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While apparently in process, I attempted to open a folder in win explorer and the computer seemed to "freeze" and both screens went blank.&nbsp; I gave it a few minutes, and couldn't seem to do anything so I did a hard restart (held down the power button).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it powered up it went into the automatic repairs and then froze on the "Choose your keyboard layout" screen with no method able to input a choice or progress.<br />
<br />
I tried every option I could find.&nbsp; I created a bootable USB and tried every system restore/recover option and they all said I was out of luck with nothing to restore or repair.&nbsp; None of the repair/recovery tools worked and my Win10 seemed to be corrupt.&nbsp; Nothing
 could detect or recover anything from my Win10 installation files.<br />
<br />
I went through and then installed Win10 from the USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here I am stuck with a completely empty Win10 installation with none of my apps, settings or files.&nbsp; Plus, I don't have a product key to input for this install as I never had one.&nbsp; I did a free Win7 to 10 upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing is, there is the "windows.old"
 folder sitting there from previous install with all of my files and data.&nbsp; Again, none of the repair/recovery tools will recognize it and run automatically.&nbsp;In 10 years, this is the most catastrophic computer related event I've had experienced and is ridiculous
 in the fact this was due to a OS software update.<br />
<br />
As none of the automatic tools will recover my old data, is there a way I can copy everything over to my current install and get everything back?&nbsp; I do not have the installation discs/keys for much of the software anymore (including critical MS Office) and
 am not prepared to start fresh because of an OS update ruining my day.&nbsp; What about the product key issue?&nbsp; With MS give me one?<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;am at a complete loss and fairly devastated at the idea of starting over.&nbsp; I definitely don't have time in my life to deal with something like this and I rely on my computer for a lot.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your response, you are still having issues with updating Windows 10. Having said that, we suggest that you follow the steps given on this forum article by Andre Da Costa:

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I was unable to resolve my original issue which resulted in a re-install of Win 10.&nbsp; Not exactly the solution I was hoping for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subsequently, I am having issues updating Win 10 which I have addressed in a separate questions here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/cumulative-update-for-windows-10-version-1703-for/f30d53d4-7d58-47d3-b92e-34d230482591?messageId=acd011a5-b66e-47c9-9d9c-497a41090a41</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope to not have to go through the install process again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Bans for offensive gamertags</h2>
                    
<p>I've noticed people using offensive tags, and I heard that you can get banned for them. Is there a certain amount of times you can be forced to change your tag before you get banned, or is it just based on the name? How long would you get banned for anyway?</p>
<p>I saw a guy recently who's tag was Mo Lestar1 and it was pretty funny. I want to use a variant of it, but would I get banned for doing so?</p>

 between.<br />

This is exactly why they don't give a specific number of Forced name Changes. If someone knows they Perma-Ban after let's say 6 times, one could just stop at 5 times.</span></p>

<p>Wow, they get perma-banned for offensive tags? I feel bad for people who get banned for stuff that isn't even offensive, but I guess the actual offenders deserve it. The "If you have to ask" rule doesn't really work though, because i've been banned once
 on my main gamertag for something that wasn't offensive in the least, and was then lied to about it.</p>

<p>i have seen a response from xblpet on the suspension forum when banning one guy,stating he had been given 80 forced name changes on one account.</p>
<p>the guy was posting on a newly created account appealing his ban and his new gamertag was one of the most offensive i had ever seen.</p>
<p>i have seen others banned instantly for mildly offensive tags.</p>
<p>my advice is,if you have any doubts at all,don`t use it.</p>

<p>You had to change from DADDY HIT MOMMY? So violence is seen as offensive for a tag? I'm guessing the forced changes are inconsistent because you can have all sorts of violent gamertags, but only some will be banned if it offends a certain group of people.
 The first 2 tags you mentioned aren't exactly offensive, but the 3rd one would be forced to change if someone reported it.</p>

<p>I see lots of people with things like BONG MAN420 (who spawned the somewhat infamous KLOBB MAN504, my alt account which I use to troll on Calla Doody) and the like, but generally the ones I've run into have been nice guys. The connotation of making a hilariously
 awful gamertag like "DADDY HIT MOMMY" is probably that you're some kind of jerkass, but if your feedback is nothing but positive, I'm sure they take that into consideration for really exceptionally minor things like my gamertag, for example. I've had this
 account since the Xbox 360's launch and I've been in and out of talks with XBL reps, they generally don't bother me.
<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, I recently saw a guy with the gamertag "FUCC NIGGGERS" running around on MW2. Just so the 2 people who still play MW2 are aware.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Due to them<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;having macro's on them they are bannable to my knowledge.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I think if you just use the back peddles like a scuf controller you will be fine but anything like recoil reduction and fast trigger is considered bannable.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I would just stick to normal controllers as this doens't give you any advantages.</span></span></p>

<p>There is nothing in the ToS from the owners of Strike Pack, I have done some digging and as long as you are not using it to jitter, rapidfire etc. you should be fine. If you use it the exact same as a Scuf pad/elite controller with only using the back peddles
 and trigger grips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Owning a scuf pad I understand that they are expensive mine was near enough £140 but they are legit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just stick to specifically <strong>only&nbsp;</strong>using the back peddles and nothing to do with modding I think it will be fine from what I have read. But all in all you should try to stick to the known things (SCUF/Elite controller) and hopefully
 someone will also add to this thread who knows a little bit more.&nbsp;</p>

            Not sure, but does this really provide what it promises? If it does, and if there's a way that Microsoft can detect it is connected to your controller, then it may mean trying to cheat to get a competitive edge.

 without glasses" look too it. After that it crashes. Or sometimes it goes to the balloon blowing up screen but its black and I can only hear the sound then it crashes. Maybe its that I'm running a 64 version of windows but my specs are more than enough to
 play any major title. </p>

<h2>            stuck at  &#34;Restoring your previous version of Windows&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a HP sleekbook about 3 months ago. &nbsp;Last night it recommended that I update from windows 8 to 8.1, so I installed the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today the screen alternates between being completely black and the message "restoring your previous version of windows." I.e. no login screen or anything!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not brilliant with computers but was told to try a hard reboot, it has made no difference. Short of taking it to be repaired I have no idea what else to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would really appreciate any help anyone could offer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Orginal title : Won't go past "restoring your previous version of windows"?!&nbsp; Please help!!</p>

</p><p><span>Hi ChrisCoatney,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the frustration when things does not work as expected.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. What happens when you try to restart the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do get any error message?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might be happening due to the boot files are corrupted. I suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I like to suggest you to disconnect any external hardware (monitors, printers, USB devices etc) from the computer except the keyboard and the mouse.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, hard shutdown the computer and then try to perform the System Restore with the Windows 8 DVD. Check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are not able to boot the computer then you should require a Windows 8 DVD or the USB to fix the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you don’t have a Windows 8 DVD, you can refer to the article mentioned below to know how to create a bootable USB for Windows 8.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Create installation media for Windows 8.1</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-re<span>set-refresh-media</span></span></span></a>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>BIOS Disclaimer:
</span></strong><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot
 guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To perform a System Restore, follow these instructions and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Boot the computer using Windows 8 installation media.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the “Windows Setup” dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click “Next”.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click on “Repair your computer” from the lower left corner.</span></p>
<p><span>d) From the “Choose an option screen”, click on “Troubleshoot”.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click “Advanced Options” in the “Troubleshoot” screen.</span></p>
<p><span>f) In the “Advanced Options” screen, select “System Restore”.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Follow the on screen instructions to restore the computer to an earlier state when the computer was working fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now check if you are able to boot the computer successfully.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong> The System Restore restores the computer back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove
 recently installed apps and drivers and also reset the recently changed settings on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you boot the computer to desktop, I suggest you to disable the antivirus software installed in the computer and unplug all the external devices connected the computer and then try to update
 Windows 8.1. You can refer to the following link for more information</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note: </strong>
Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon
 as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. Please revert with the issue status.</span></p>

            I am having the same problem. I tried to upgrade to 8.1, it was installing updates for 24 hours (not an exaggeration) then I thought well maybe its finished just stuck. I turned it off and turned it back on and now its saying "restoring previous versions
 of Windows" for another 24 hours. I turned it off and on. Took the battery out. I don't know what else to do. I can't get to the home screen &amp; I don't have a cd for setup because it didn't come with one.

<h2>            High CPU and Disk usage by &#34;Click to Run&#34;</h2>
                    Hi: My laptop (Dell Precision 7520, Win10 Pro) was just brought to a grinding halt by MS Click-to-Run. Something called Superfetch or Supercache was also pigging out - just caught a glimpse of it. It completely locked me out, couldn't even force a quit
 or restart with the Task Manager. Had to pull the battery to get control back. Totally unacceptable. There was a thread here a while back by PatrikZeman on how to recover from this problem but the fix doesn't work for the version of Office (Pro 2016) I'm running.
 Anyone have any ideas? Thanks, John

            Hi Angus.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) See fixes here for 100% disk usage:
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usage-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usag...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-percent-disk-usage-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-pe...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers from the Dell Support Downloads web page <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Products/?app=drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Produ...</a>, using the  Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />
<br />Please do not mark "No" to the popup asking if this post helped you, as it may remove my ability to help you further.  Just ignore it until problem is solved and then please mark the post which helped most as Answer to help others..

</p><p>Note: <strong>Some older video cards might be incompatible with Windows. </strong>
It likely means the graphics adapter has or is approaching End of Life status which limits the level of support the manufacturer can provide. The card will likely function just fine for general purposes, just don't expect it to work well for scenarios such
 as playing games. There might even be glitches with certain casual games not working well at all.

<p>
</p><p>Check the manufacturers website to find out the status of the video card. Check if there are at least&nbsp;Windows 8.1 drivers available. If there are no drivers available or manufacturer support options, you should purchase a new video card.

<p>Your settings for the BenQ are correct. You can't do 10 bit or HDR.</p>
<p>You should set the Surface display to its native resolution.</p>
<p>If you're not using the Surface display along with the external monitor you might want to select make this my main display for the external monitor and disable this display for the Surface display.</p>

<h3> addict mamba  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bannissement des communications</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour à tous,</p>
<p>Je vous sollicite aujourd'*** pour un bannissement des communications qui à commencé ce jour le 6 février. J'ai déjà été victime récemment d'un ban qui devais durer 1 mois, mais suite à un problème de votre coté, ce ban à été doublé ! En effet, le ban été
 bien levé mais je ne pouvais pas parler à mes amis dans les groupes. Je vous demande donc aujourd'*** de me faire grâce de ce ban qui tombe vraiment très mal puisque je participe à un tournoi sur World of Tanks&nbsp;et j'ai besoin des communications. J'ai pu voir
 que ce ban serais levé dans 15 jours mais je vous le demande encore une fois : s'il vous plais, pouvez vous stopper ce bannissement. Je suis client de Microsoft depuis 8 ans et je possède&nbsp;les consoles Xbox, de la 1ère à la One, et je suis de plus en plus déçu
 de voir que&nbsp;se sont les bons clients qui se font toujours taper sur les doigts...&nbsp;Je sais que je ne suis pas toujours un modèle de gentillesse sur le live mais je ne mérite pas de me faire bannir à chaque fois qu'un joueur occasionnel signale un message ou
 porte plainte parce qu'il n'a pas aimer la manière que j'utilise pour lui détruire son tank, ou éliminer son personnage à répétition ! Il faut savoir qu'un grand nombre de joueurs utilisent vos règles à mauvais escient,&nbsp;ces derniers demande à leur liste d'amis
 de poser&nbsp;une plainte pour tricherie par exemple, au GamerTag qui les dérangent dans les parties sur le live et donc ce sont évidemment les joueurs&nbsp;très actifs sur les jeux ou ceux qui se situent en haut des classements qui subissent les bannissements de toutes
 sortes... Merci de me répondre, et merci d'avance d'étudier ma demande pour stopper ce ban le plus vite possible.</p>

                    <p>I've just run a clean install of&nbsp;Windows 10 on my HP Stream 11&nbsp;d001dx and my trackpad isn't being recognized. I've tried rebooting, installing a couple different Synaptics drivers, rebooting after each install, tried several things suggested for windows
 8 &amp; 7 here in the forums and nothing has worked so far. The only time my device manager sees a mouse option is when I plug my Logitech in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. I really don't want to revert back to 8.1. I have too much work to do and reinstalling operating systems is rather time consuming.</p>

<p>3. Click 'Option 1', which will scan your computer for missing drivers/updates or 'Option 2' for a full list of recommended updates. I think both should lead you to the same options</p>
<p>3. Under 'Driver-Chipset' you should see '<span style="color: rgba(55, 55, 55, 1); font-weight: bold">Intel Serial IO Driver without Connected Standby Support'.&nbsp;</span>This
 is the driver that should help with the trackpad. You'll have to restart after the download is complete.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what worked for me, so hopefully it works for you as well. You should note that it takes just a minute or so to start working --- after my restart I thought it wasn't working, but after a minute the driver did update.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your detailed response! I actually took this one step further and installed the Synaptics driver from the HP website because after installing the Intel driver I didn't have full functionality of my touchpad ( gestures didn't work, two finger
 scroll didn't work, etc.) They don't have a Windows 10 driver up yet so I gave the Windows 8.1 driver a shot and it worked! So if you can't use the scroll function of your touchpad you may want to try the Synaptics driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help!</p>

            All you have to do to get the synaptics driver to show is select windows 8 as your OS and it will show up. Install works fine on Windows 10. Took me a bit to figure it out :)

            <p>Hi Vahid,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to search in Windows Store for the Solar calendar. By design there is no Solar calendar on Windows. You may also refer to the following Microsoft Help article and check if the information helps.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and&nbsp;I am glad to assist you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to restart your system and check. remove non-essential USB device attached to the computer.
</p>
<p>If any programs which eats up a lot are running in the background, you may stop those programs and check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also scan your PC for any corrupted settings files and automatically fix them via SFC and DISM scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Run the Hardware and device troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Try these steps to run the troubleshooter: </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type <strong><span>troubleshooting</span></strong> in the search bar.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;Click <strong><span>view all </span></strong>in the left panel. &nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select ‘<strong><span>Hardware and devices</span></strong>' and follow the on-screen instructions.
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the System update readiness command. It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available. Follow the steps.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: <span>&nbsp;</span>DISM </span></strong></p>
<ol>

Click&nbsp;<strong>command prompt (Run as administrator)</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>&nbsp;key after each command:
</span></li><li><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong><span>
<br />
<strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong> </span></li><li><span>To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type&nbsp;<strong>Exit</strong>, and then press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>
</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp; SFC</span></strong></p>
<ol>

<h2>            Verify payment or Cancel order... Windows 8</h2>
                    I ordered Windows 8 online, however, Microsoft is showing that "There was a problem with your payment information. Please verify the information and try again, or use an alternate method of payment." Also, "If you'd like to cancel your order or verify
 your payment information, contact the order verification team." But I could not find the order verification team in their website. I need to verify my payment information or cancel the order and place a new one, but how? who should I contact? where can I find
 them?

            I made my order on Oct 26, Microsoft sent me an email to confirm my order on Oct 30. They will send you a link in order to confirm your order and make the payment after they reviewed your information. However, I have no idea why they delay orders!!! it
 is really annoying. <br />

<p>Does the CD drive LED flash when you insert a CD?</p>

<p>If you do not&nbsp;get an error message,&nbsp;the CD drive is in the configuration, and it still will not play, try a CD drive cleaner disk, and if that doesn't work, replace the CD drive for one that works..&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Snap Assist error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> argentarus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Snap Assist error</h2>
                    <p>I've had this this problem for months. Using Snap assist to put a window onto the right third requires me to place it in specific places outside of the box, and even then, the window will occupy (just shy of) half of the screen instead of the intended third,
 as shown in the picture below. (Other vertically based "snaps" are also proportionally messed because of the error).</p>
<p>I've tried loading my computer in Safe Mode on multiple occasions, restarted Snap Assist and Dell PremierColor multiple times, and correctly performed a recommended clean boot.
</p>
<p>Correction: Snap assist is stuck perpetually on a third, so if I do a window on half screen and want to do it as a third on the right side, it won't do that. I can do everything normally on the left side, but the right isn't working correctly.

<h2>            Xbox One Error Code E305 00000001 80073CFE</h2>
                    
<p>So, i got my new Xbox One console today. And i began to plug the plugs in and all that. But i accidently turned on my Xbox One in the middle of it when it was supposed not to be turned on yet, so i turned it off. I think some update was supposed to update
 my Xbox when i noticed it was on and turned it off. And now when i tried to start it up i got an error message. First off it loads like if it was going to start up and then the error message pops up. I wonder if someone knows how i fix this.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>First, disable any security and/or anti-virus software you are using.</p>
<p>Then disable error reporting: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7863/disable-error-reporting-in-xp-vista-and-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Then see if the backup now works.&nbsp; These were two solutions I found online that worked for others - but you may have a different problem (but it's worth a try).</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Keep me informed.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Quanto a questão de instalação, não saberia como te ajudar, mas descobri como iniciar o jogo.
</p>
<p>- Pare na frete do aparelho, numa posição que o kinect te reconheça. Estique o braço para frente e levante a não como se estivesse sinalizando para alguém "PARAR". O kinect vai reconhecer a tua mão e abrirá o jogo te dando as opções disponíveis.
</p>
<p>Espero que ajude, pois eu levei 4 meses com o jogo comprado sem conseguir jogar. Rs</p>
