<h2>            Account verification issues</h2>
                    I have been trying to solve this issue for about a week now, I have called the Microsoft support service, talked to the Live Chat representatives and clicked all the links related to this topic and have found no solution (this includes the article&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-signin/my-account-is-blockedwhat-do-i-do/82dc5db6-dea1-45ef-985a-c8f4b5b36cb7">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-signin/my-account-is-blockedwhat-do-i-do/82dc5db6-dea1-45ef-985a-c8f4b5b36cb7</a>&nbsp;so
 please don't send me to read this again). I sent a private e-mail to Microsoft support and received this e-mail in response:&nbsp;

<div>I pay for my Xbox live account to watch netflix When I turn on my Xbox and try to sign into my account it says my account is blocked. So I went onto hotmail and tried to access my account and it said it needed me to verify that I was the owner of the account
 (even though I had the correct password). I filled out about three of the verification forms and they all came back saying they could not confirm that I was really the owner of the account. The problem is I haven't actually used this e-mail in months. I have
 no idea who I last e-mailed or what it was about, I don't think I even created any new folders either. It also gives me another option of emailing "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" which is the hotmail account I am locked out of, so that doesn't really help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would make a new account but the pre-paid card I bought is already linked to my account that I am locked-out of. I tried to change the password several times and was successful. I was given the option to get a text sent to the phone I had put in to contact
 me when I first signed up for my hotmail account and get a reset code for my password. The code was successfully sent to my cellphone and I changed my password. This did nothing, I am still locked out of my account. I keep filling out forms and they all come
 back the same. I don't know how else to prove it is me, but it is me. I don't understand why they can't also send a verification code to my phone if they can send a password reset code to my phone. I also remember answering a security question when I first
 signed up for this account, I think I would remember the answer to this much better but I was never asked it. I have been sent many different links of different articles and posts on this website and none of them are applicable to my situation. I need my account
 unlocked and I cannot fill out a form of what my last four passwords are (because I honestly don't know).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need access to my account. Someone please help!!</div>

            <p>Apparently you missed the countless posts in this forum that would have informed you that you cannot use Windows Easy Transfer with Outlook. It has never worked and never will.
</p>
<p>Create a new Outlook profile from scratch. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;829918&amp;Product=out2003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;829918&amp;Product=out2003</a></p>
<p>The ".ost" error message is intriguing. It suggests you are using a mail account type that never even required data migration in the first place. You should always provide your mail account type when you post a question. If it is Hotmail, there was no reason
 to use WET in the first place. Just install the correct version of Outlook connector and configure your hot mail account in the new profile.

<h2>            how do I forward an e-mail without sending all the other e-mails in the same conversation&#47;messaging</h2>
                    <p>Forwarding an e-mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a number of messages that Outlook decides to keep together.&nbsp; however when I&nbsp; forward one e-mail the rest of the mails in that conversation are also sent -this is crazy.
</p>
<p>Question: how can I send an individual e-mail from a group of conversations without send all the mails in that particular conversation.</p>

possible workaround for ie is here<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_other/http-403-forbidden-error/12adbd32-5b7a-40ee-8044-7146759dab1c">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_other/http-403-forbidden-error/12adbd32-5b7a-40ee-8044-7146759dab1c</a><br />
<br />
other than your scenario, 403 can be occurred due to one of the below reasons.. <br />
<br />
<p><span><span>(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Lack of file/resource permissions.</p>
<p><span><span>(2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>IP restriction (country based or single IP restriction)
</p>
<p><span><span>(3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Other server side misconfiguration issues.<span>&nbsp;
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
More about 403 error.. most of the time this may be due to ip restriction.. check using a proxy browser

<p>Hi Sashan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible purposes of your emails triggering the junk email filter is to

<li>If you have a stable Internet connection.</li><li>If you change your Internet connection. Hence, you change your location that you sent the email.</li><li>If you can send email to your own email address.</li><li>The exact error you encounter when you send emails from Outlook.com (Provide us a screenshot).
</li><li>If you can confirm if your email directs to <strong>Sent Items</strong> folder not on Outbox.</li></ul>

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are migrating our Hosted exchange tenets to Office 365 with the use of BitTitan Migrationwiz. We need to move Distribution Groups to Office 365 which we have scripted out with Powershell but.. the commands no longer function with Office 365. We were able
 to track down the new commands to get the groups added&nbsp;<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set-UnifiedGroup</a>,
 which also don't function..</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the current methods of adding Distribution groups to Office 365 for new Clients (We will be migration all our hosted tenets)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being multi tenet Migrationwiz is our best option for fast cut overs.</p>

<p>Return it to where you bought it form for a replacement as it is clearly not of satisfactory quality. Not all the screens show this problem so therefore the ones that do should be considered defective and returned for replacement/refund.&nbsp; it is a £400 smartphone
 and should therefore be of high quality.</p>

<p>The problem is the screen not showing the grayscale or gradation in colors correctly, this can be seen in many places throughout the o/s and ui but an easy way to spot it is to save the following image, load it to your n8 and view it via the gallery</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2foi53.tinypic.com%2f2ivlhcl.jpg" /><br />
<br />
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br />
<br />
This image is a test image designed for computer monitors and is a proper test image used in the industry to show the gradation of colors from white to black<br />
<br />
If your n8/c7 screen is fine then the image should display as it does on your pc monitor, this can easily be seen by having the test image in the phones gallery and holding the phone next to the pc monitor while the image is displayed on both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If however your n8/c7 is showing some of the squares as a purple red color, then you should take your handset to the nearest Nokia Care Centre to have it serviced or possibly replaced under your warranty, as already suggested elsewhere in this forum.<br />
<br />
You can also test the image using either TV out or HDMI out, just load the test image to your device, display it on the phone via gallery and then connect your phone to your TV via TV out cable or HDMI out cable. If you have a problem screen you will see the
 image displayed correctly on the TV screen and the image showing purple red tint on the phone screen.<br />
<br />
The problem may be reduced by setting the phone screen to full brightness, although the image is displayed correctly at any level of brightness on phones that do not have this issue.<br />
<br />
The test image can be used to check other handsets with AMOLED displays as well, I have tested it on Samsung i8910 and Nokia N86 where it is displayed without any traces of coloration.</p>

<p>The purple issue is true. Sadly (the people) in the care center and the callcenter operator don't recognize this as a common issue. I noticed it when enabling the analog clock. Its also there when opening photos, webpages and videos. So it can't be ignored
 by stating that its only a problem with the analog clock like some people do. Waiting desperately for a response from Nokia. Will take this down&nbsp; to the wire. Other than this, almost everything is perfect. Seems that even IPhone 4 has got a blue tint when
 using the camera. Crazy how they launch expensive faulty phones. Hope that Nokia value their reputation and gives a resolution for this solitary issue with the N8.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there seems to have been some commotion last week over the picture above. Just to make things clear, there's no problem whatsoever with posting that picture on the forum (on the contrary, thank you!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the picture was removed when it was accompanied by a poll, asking how many people were experiencing the issue. This is a global
<em>support </em>forum, so any threads like these are bound to be read (and polls answered by) mostly by people who are experiencing the problem. This makes any such polls here lose any statistical relevance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We in the Nokia Discussions team are proud to provide all Nokia users a global meeting place to discuss using and troubleshooting their Nokia products. We are strongly against censoring or hiding any issues, on the contrary - there's no point in having a
 corporate forum like this unless people are free to speak their mind. But sometimes we need to make moderating decisions to keep the discussions on the right track.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone wants to discuss this forum's policies, just send me a PM, email (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***), or look me up on Twitter.</p>

<p>I've been playing around with a very defective phone and one in which the purple-red is only noticeable in the dark. It seems that the problem is two-fold:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>There are some extremely defective screens that should never have left the factory. Quality control procedures really need to be looked at if something like this (which is immediately and easily noticeable) left the factory in such quantity.</li><li>There is a problem with the color profile of the phone itself at low-brightness levels. You can see this quite easily when by covering and uncovering the light sensor or by subjecting it to bright, localized light that doesn't shine on the screen as well.

<div>It may be that Problem 2 isn't entirely software related, but it seems to be at least a contributing factor from what I have seen.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will say that Nokia's response to the issue (especially when they edited out their promise to issue a press release or statement) is very underwhelming and quite disappointing. One would think that they would like to keep as much good will as possible
 with the recent controversies regarding Symbian and the problems with earlier N8s... Oh well. At this point I just find myself wondering what the next problem will be.</p>

            <p>I just installed IE 11 tonight (without the Bing and MSN changes).&nbsp; Immediately after installing, the clock is gone from my desktop (and I cannot drag it back or "Add" it back).&nbsp; Also, the Weather gadget appears in a bright pink color only and I can't change
 it).&nbsp; So, you're not alone.</p>
<p>I ran CCleaner to clean up my registry but it didn't help.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Apparently this bug has been around since the IE11 preview but wasn't fixed for RTM!?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My guess is that IE11 comes with new&nbsp;dll's which&nbsp;Win7 gadgets&nbsp;are allergic to!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>IE11 seems slightly faster than IE10&nbsp;but I might have to&nbsp;restore&nbsp;back to IE10 if this is not fixed yesterday!&nbsp;</p>

            I uninstalled IE11 yesterday and my gadgets are back and working fine.&nbsp; Interesting note: I mentioned that I could NOT get the Clock gadget onto my desktop.&nbsp; Neither dragging it nor Adding it (via right-click on the gadget) worked.&nbsp; Nothing showed up on
 my desktop.&nbsp; Once I uninstalled IE11 and rebooted, I had about 20 clock gadgets on my desktop.&nbsp; Apparently, they WERE being moved there, but somehow in IE11 were not visible.&nbsp; I think I'll wait till January 2014 before reinstalling IE11; maybe it will be better
 by then.

</blockquote>
<p><br />
I&nbsp;have tried IE11 on several Win 7 systems and the Gadgets always fail.&nbsp; Perhaps&nbsp;the difference may be we use 64 bit versions.&nbsp; By&nbsp;searching the&nbsp;web&nbsp;I have also&nbsp;found a&nbsp;large number of users complaining about this going back to the preview version; many of
 these complaints&nbsp;are on Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize Microsoft recommended no longer using Gadgets due to security concerns&nbsp;however many users still like them and have been willing to take the risk;&nbsp;as do some of the executives at&nbsp;our company.&nbsp;&nbsp;We limit Gadgets to those provided with Win7&nbsp;and I&nbsp;expect
 Microsoft to provide security updates for those (of course I have not seen any).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;See:
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2719662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2719662</font></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restoring to IE10 by using the control panel and uninstalling the program listed under Windows Updates always restores the Gadgets.&nbsp; Oddly the&nbsp;only "Microsoft"&nbsp;Gadgets that fail to display correctly for me are the Clock, Weather, and &nbsp;CPU Meter (the most
 popular around here).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not one of those who objects to using IE over other browsers; in fact our company only supports IE so Chrome and the others are not an option (except for our Web Site Developers of course)&nbsp;for the over 4000 desktop systems we maintain.&nbsp;However, that
 said I personally use Chrome and Firefox, as well as others,&nbsp;and have not been unhappy with them---they each have their benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gadget issue makes me concerned about the probability there are other more significant issues.&nbsp; I recommend holding off on installing it until it has been in use for a while longer.&nbsp; I have already recommended we not consider "updating" until at least
 the second quarter of next year but I do not expect us to adopt it until we are forced to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Restoring an outlook backup from a .bak file that fails to open.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a bit of desperation I am posting this query again as I got one response which just asked some questions for clarification and then once I provided the clarification went dark.
</p>
<p>I am still stuck and would really appreciate if someone could point me in the direction of anything I can try to restore the lost emails.</p>
<p>(I've rewritten this so everything I was asked to clarify is in the query now.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having a problem with email synchronising earlier this week and I ran SCANPST which "fixed" problems with my outlook folders. In the process it also deleted some very important folders going back over a couple of years plus some recent important emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily I have a backup file <strong>created when I ran the scanPST app</strong>. Its called *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and
<strong>its approx 450meg</strong> so I think all my mail ever is in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the advice on restoring from a .bak file and followed the recommended steps which was to create a backup of the backup and then reneame it to .pst and open it from outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook wont open the file. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running the outlook 2013 desktop application on windows10.</p>
<p>I go to file-&gt;open and export-&gt; open outlook data file</p>
<p>I select the renamed *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and click open</p>
<p>I get an error message that "the file &lt;filename.pst&gt; is not an outlook data file (.pst).</p>
<p><strong>It</strong><strong> fails to open.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated as I have lost some quite important information which I would really really like to recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>M</p>

            <p>Do you have any other backups of your pst-file from before you started having issues? If so, it would be best to use that instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, try running scanpst.exe multiple times against your recovered pst-file until it no longer finds any errors. If that doesn't bring anything either, you could consider trying a 3rd party recovery tool against your original backup.</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately I only have the scanpst created backup plus a backup of that backup that I created since before I started messing trying to restore stuff.</p>

</p><p>I'll try what you suggest and keep running it - it is still reporting errors.</p>

<p>No, scanpst.exe is updated with each Outlook release. Make sure you are using the one that is included with your Office installation and not downloaded from somewhere else as that could damage your pst-file beyond repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The page I gave you earlier also includes instructions on where to find scanpst.exe on your computer.</p>

 I only saw that the build is the same as before upgrade and I receive no message about the error<br />

            Personalising the Start Screen with the limited 20 accent colours can become boring after a while. So, there are many apps like WizTiles, Skinery and many custom tile makers. Here's what I found on Nokia Conversations Blog on how to create awesome artistic
 Start Screen and thought to share! Hope this helps.

<h2>            Wrong OneDrive Profile</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there</p>
<p>I am an administrator on our Office 365 service</p>
<p>When I login to OneDrive it shows my colleague's, the other administrators, OneDrive profile even though the text in the URL looks like it is pointing to my user name.</p>
<p>Please advise how this can be rectified</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Eric</p>
<p>One Drive is now displaying the correct name, as of today. I checked it yesterday but it was still holding the wrong profile name, but I know it sometimes takes a while to update everything.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for you pointing me in the right direction</p>

</span></span>Expand the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Display Adapter,<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>right-click on the display driver and choose<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Uninstall<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and follow the on-screen instruction.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>To install the driver in Compatibility Mode, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a. Locate the&nbsp;<strong><span>executable</span></strong>&nbsp;file (.exe file) for the driver installation program.<br />
b. Right-click the file, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
c. In the&nbsp;<strong>Package Name</strong>&nbsp;<span><strong>Properties</strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click the&nbsp;<strong>Compatibility</strong></span>&nbsp;tab.<br />
d. Click to select the&nbsp;<span><strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>&nbsp;check box, click&nbsp;<strong>Windows 8&nbsp;</strong>with which it is compatible with in the Run this program in compatibility mode for list, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong></span>.<br />
e.&nbsp;<strong><span>Double-click</span></strong>&nbsp;the executable file to start the installation program.<br />

            <p>I have the same issue.&nbsp; I bugged it with NVidia.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I however am able to kill the Store task, but the NVidia dialog box still thinks it's open and therefore won't proceed to enable SLI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was on a clean install of Win 10 Tech Preview with 344.11</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So I got the answer to this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the 'Application Frame Host'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you kill off this process, you can then enable SLi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be something that you guys need to work out with Nvidia on the next set of drivers, or sort out at the OS level before retail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this is the work-around for now.</p>

            <p>If I understand it, the ApplicationFrameworkHost.exe is responsible for displaying Apps in their own windows on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you end that application, the Nvidia control panel will allow changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, you seem to lose the ability to open any more apps in a window and restarting the framworkhost does not re-enable the ability.&nbsp; Possibly because a User cannot open it with the necessary permissions.&nbsp; Since I am not a programmer, I can only guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is funny, I was having the problem on a clean install, but when I did an 8.1 upgrade install, it seemed to work normally, most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't think the FrameworkHost is the cause of the Nvidia Control panel not opening until you stop the nvidia User Experience task, unless you have an explanation for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like all parties have been advised of the situation, maybe an update will be forthcoming.</p>

            <p>I'm running the new Build 10041 that came out today (or last night) and after the restart and re-installation of the new build SLi was disabled (previously enabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I can apply the change to enable SLi I'm told to close the following:-</p>
<p>Windows Shell Experience Host</p>
<p>SearchUI.exe</p>
<p>and finally ApplicationFrameHost.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can close all 3 via Task Manager, but before I get the opportunity to hit apply on the enable SLi box, Windows Shell Experience Host restarts automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other programs/services linked to Windows Shell Experience Host that I can close to stop this restarting?</p>

            <p>Haha so like what Rusty said the windows shell experience restarts automatically, but thinking I was smart I moved really fast and clicked apply before it could restart...</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED</p>
<p>
</p><p>it very much broke my windows, it will load but as soon as I do anything it breaks. ex: right click, open the start menu, open a program. Also it got rid of my recycling bin and two folders. At the moment I have no idea how to fix this but I think im going
 to try removing the SLI bridge so it will get rid of the SLI settings. Nothing else works, nothing in windows recovery can fix it (Im guessing because its an nvidia setting not a windows setting) So I really hope this fixes it.</p>

            Work around for that is to restart in safe mode and reinstall the video drivers. Make sure you select "clean state" option to fix sli issue.&nbsp;

            Try the tool on a different PC if possible. If you have no access or it still won't work; contact your local Service Center and let them reflash your phone for you.
