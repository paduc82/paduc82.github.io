<h2>            Excel 2016 Error Message</h2>
                    Using Excel 2016 and Windows 10 I have just started receiving&nbsp; the following message a few second after opening a worksheet.&nbsp; We are sorry but Excel has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly.&nbsp; Excel will need to be closed as a
 result.&nbsp; Would you like us to repair it now?&nbsp; If I say yes, it closes the program but when it is opened again it does the same thing.&nbsp;

            Below are general troubleshooting steps to solve various problems in Excel. Try them one by one and check the result after each step -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors. If Feb 10, 2016 update (KB3114717) is installed, this should be uninstalled.<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-Office-and-your-computer-with-Microsoft-Update-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5<br />
<br />
2. Perform Quick Repair of the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
6. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
7. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
8. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
9. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
10. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
11. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
12. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
13. If above don't solve your problem, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license
 keys ready before you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

    <title>Switching themes creates new master slides - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blackadder_999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Switching themes creates new master slides</h2>
                    Hi - I have a presentation with a a dozen slide masters. Four of these slide masters exist in two variants (pale background and dark background. The client needs to be able to switch between the two variants easily, even if the actual presentation contains
 hundreds of slides.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've solved this as follows: Taken the PowerPoint (2010) template, opened as template, saved current theme as "pale.thmx". Then I go into the slide master view and modify the slide masters of those few slides which need a dark variant by giving them a
 dark background (and white text). Exited master view, re-saved template. Now saved current theme as "dark.thmx".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The idea is that the client can open a presentation based on the template (double-clicking) and then apply "pale.thmx" or "dark.thmx" as needed. and this works fine. He's delighted. But I noticed that when switching, it duplicates some slide masters. Strangely,
 not any of the ones which switch color: Title, one content slide type and the closing thank_you slide. Creates 1_Title, 1_ Thank_you, etc. Very strange. Switching back and forth and back and forth from light to dark does not make any more slide masters, but
 it's messy. I've tried duplicating slide masters that don't get multiplied, changing layout to exactly match title slide, etc, then assigning title slide to this new slide layout, then deleting the original title slide master, but when I repeat all the above
 steps, it still multiplies that slide master.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any ideas? I've also tried to assign a template directly instead of a .thmx-file, but the behavior is identical.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks for any help, this is driving me crazy... :-/</div>

<div><br />
<div>I'm certain you're right and I will explain it to the client accordingly. That explains why I wasn't able to get it to stop. It is in fact the case that the two master slide sets contain modified placeholders (one set has the company logo in white, the
 other in black) - so from PowerPoint's perspective the placeholders change.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your help is greatly appreciated! Many thanks once again! :-)</div>

<p><br />
Glad to hear it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fix it, first open a new blank template, then drag and drop the appropriate layouts into your template to ... well. basically to reset the broken ones to the default ones. Then duplicate the default layout you need to add/remove PH from (it will be named
 1_layout) and add or remove PH as needed. Then rename that layout and keep both of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can modify placeholders on layouts -- reposition them, reformat them, etc. -- you just can't add them to&nbsp;or delete them from the default layouts without causing issues like the one you're experiencing. I know it sucks. I think it was a horribly bad design
 decision on Microsoft's part.</p>

            I don't have time right now to look at the sample decks, but I can almost guarantee you it's because the layouts in question either have an extra placeholder or a deleted placeholder. So PPT is giving you back the layout with its default placeholders.
 But it's not deleting your modified layouts so you get layouts with duplicate names (indicated by "1_").

    <title>Powerpoint 2007 Cannot insert chart. &#34;Some chart types cannot be - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darrell tan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint 2007 Cannot insert chart. &#34;Some chart types cannot be combined with other chart types. Select a different chart type.&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I am unable to insert a chart in Powerpoint or Excel. In Powerpoint I get the above error message. In Excel there is no visible response at all.</p>
<p>I use Office Pro Plus 2007 SP2 on Win XP Pro SP3 and have never installed Office 2010, so the KB on conflict between versions should not apply here. I have also removed all COM add-ins but it has not helped.</p>
<p>I ran Office Diagnostics but it reported no errors.</p>
<p>I also could not open a Powerpoint PPTX file with charts that was sent to me. Powerpoint kept crashing even with "Open and repair".</p>
<p>Any ideas or solutions?</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> I found this in System Information, under COM Add-ins: "Microsoft Office Excel 2007 is not available. Verify that Excel 2007 is installed and running and then choose Refresh from the View or Action menu." The same goes for&nbsp;Powerpoint. However,
 both programs run more or less normally (except for charts, so far).</p>
<p><em>2nd Update:</em>&nbsp;I ran a Repair from Control Panel (Add/remove programs). It took a long while, but still no use.</p>

    <title>Windows Defender initialization error 0x80070002 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jetstream90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender initialization error 0x80070002</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e1e46c5-97af-477e-b54a-a57b70f5dbec" /></p>
<p>I currently have Microsoft Security Essentials installed, but before anyone says "Defender doesn't run with MSE," let me add this: having MSE on my laptop for years has never caused this error "by itself" or "on every startup," and certainly not both (which
 is currently happening.)&nbsp; Defender has always just been quietly disabled by MSE without dialog box popups and errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backstory: I've had a couple of bad viruses that badly compromised my laptop to the point where every day for a month or so, I played a desperate cat-and-mouse game with the virus by tracking recently added files and folders (or files with weird names including
 Chinese and other nonstandard characters) and deleting them cold (not from Programs and Features as nice programs do.) The reason for the cat-and-mouse file chase was because the virus hid from virus checkers. That was a few months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cause: Recently I installed the free (not realtime) version of the Malwarebytes AntiMalware just out of curiosity to see what it would find (and of course it had to find something.)&nbsp; It put some things in quarantine, many of which were indeed suspicious,
 but some I wasn't sure about.&nbsp; I left them there and since then proceeded to forget about them until this error popped-up. I'm decently sure Malwarebytes mistakenly picked a system file as one to quarantine, but I can't repair it because it was deleted from
 the quarantine list.&nbsp; Any suggestions? Some possibly-unrelated (but probably related) symptoms are that any browser sometimes takes much longer to load webpages, sometimes the computer starts slowing down and eventually freezing entirely (requires power button
 shutdown and restart,) and sometimes the memory usage will semi-gradually inch-up until all is occupied then either plummets or more likely freezes.&nbsp; All of them started this past month</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently ran a MicrosoftFixIt program to try to fix it and it caught the following, but was unable to fix it:</p>
<p>Issues found: Problems installing recent updates, Not fixed</p>
<p>I also have a separate WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab file I'd like to run for this same issue, but it can't connect to the support server (probably old file.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: My end goal here is to repair Windows Defender, but if nothing else works and disabling it removes the error and is safe enough (doesn't cause other issues,) then I may settle for that.</p>
<p>This PC is Vista 64bit.</p>

            <p>Yes, with MSE installed, Defender cannot be started. There is no good reason to as the definitions/detection of MSE is a superset of Defender for Windows 7 and earlier.</p>
<p>What is the current state of MSE?</p>

<p>Each rescue scanner will miss things – because none of them will have a perfectly complete and up-to-date set of definitions; so you might need to use several of these rescue scanners, or something like
 the Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility, which creates a custom bootable CD or flash drive that includes multiple rescue scanners:

 for SARDU. I tested this install some time back and the first offer was for the hated and difficult to remove Delta Search Toolbar. The developer noted that the latest version no longer has bundled installers, but be careful.

                    <p>!)- &nbsp;why there is no button for the French language?</p>
<p>2)- Why I can't find a clock bases on 24 hours in French?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)- Why Microsoft system isn't what I would expect from Bill Gate... simplicity to, &nbsp;access, simplicity in logic in many situations the public has to deal with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)- Since the set&nbsp;-up in Hotmail was changed, when searching past emails in strolling down the button, it doesn't seem right to see the search disappear process jump to nothing, then ?</p>
<p>5)- Too many changes, add-on, etc., without forgetting Skype... which was added to my email account when I don't want it that way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6)- Why the 2 technicians from Microsoft who worked at distance on re-installing Windows 7 and Home Premium few days ago and took many hours of my time , each one of them didn't do what I expected them to do in this process as yesterday I went to a computer
 technician to install a Webcam which wasn't right, &nbsp;the process I asked him to check the 64 G &nbsp;USB I bought specially for this process they were they supposed to store the data, but he told me there was nothing frorm Windows 7 and Home Premium stored!</p>
<p>So, what type of technician who worked for Microsoft have discontinued the "chat line "without my knowledge and unsertanding to do so and not knowing if they did the changes they agreed to do?</p>

<h3> cartwright118  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint for Mac - Blue Border around images make it impossible to edit</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
A few months now I've been having a few problems with some images that I have imported into a few of my presentations, where some images seem to be 'objects' (I'm assuming that also, by the way) The images affected have this light blue border around the image
 (see below for screenprint) I am unable to distinguish how the problem is occuring or even reproduce the problem. Unsure if its a bug within the application or a user error on my part. It doesn't seem to have any trends or any identification of how its happening,
 I always import the images using two ways either from iPhoto into Presentation via the copy and paste method and occasionally by using drag and drop or copy and paste from an existing presentation. When you right click the image it actually states 'Save as
 image' which says to me power point isn't recognising it as an image? (See below for screen print) I've tried multiple ways to try and reproduce the problem using different methods of copy and paste, different pictures etc and no luck, I still cannot seem
 to reproduce the problem.<br />
<br />
Every photo with this blue border will not allo w me to edit with any tools used to edit 'pictures' - e.g crop, resize, recolour etc.<br />
<br />
Please see links below of screenprints of problem<br />
<br />
http://365tech.co.uk/powerpointimages/image1.png&nbsp; - picture showing the blue border<br />
<br />
http://365tech.co.uk/powerpointimages/image2.png - picture showing right click menu, with 'Save as Picture'<br />
<br />
http://365tech.co.uk/powerpointimages/image3.png - picture with how it usually looks when I right click other images in the powerpoint<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
Regards<br />
Christian<br />

            <p>&gt;&gt; When I double click the 'picture' that has the blue border, it displays a message (see
<a href="http://365tech.co.uk/powerpointimages/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://365tech.co.uk/powerpointimages/image4.png</a>)
</p>
<p>Ah, that verifies my suspicion.&nbsp; Somehow this image has come in as an object rather than as a PPT picture shape.&nbsp; That can happen when you copy/paste content from other applications.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When you get one of these, you could try this: </p>
<p>Select it</p>
<p>Choose Edit | Copy</p>
<p>Delete the original or move it off to one side out of the way</p>
<p>Choose Edit | Paste Special and select Picture</p>
<p>Now it's a PowerPoint shape and not an object, and no longer has the blue border.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I never really batch import, i prefer to do it one by one as I have to add text at the bottom sometimes anyway.</p>
<p>Hmm.&nbsp; I'd look at it this way:</p>
<p>One by one, let's say 30 seconds to insert the photo, 30 seconds to add the text.</p>
<p>Times 120 photos: two hours.</p>
<p>Batch importing, 10 seconds to import all 120 photos, 30 seconds each to add the text.</p>
<p>120 * 30 seconds for the text, one hour plus 10 seconds for the photos.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Modify the code to create and format the text boxes for you automatically, even faster.

<h2>            My Excel formulas have recently stopped working&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have many Excel files for my invoices, among other docs. They have worked fine up until this month. All of a sudden, they have stopped working in existing documents. If I drag down that column, it just copies the total from the above cell. If I click on
 the cell, it shows the correct formula - it simply has stopped applying it! I have to double click on every cell with a formula to get it to properly calculate. And these are very simply formulas - just multiply 1 cell by a number and the sum/addition cells
 at the bottom are not updating either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is insane! They were working just fine until recently - from what I can tell. I am going to have to go back to all my recent client invoices to audit them to make sure I did under or over charge all my clients!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a new computer in January so I have Office 2016. The first few months. I think are fine, This seems to be out of nowhere!</p>

<h2>            Phone Number Change</h2>
                    Hi there, I have a file with about 500 phone numbers in one column. These are in 7 digits: XXX-XXXX. How do I change the column of numbers to include the default local area phone number and remove the ' - ' in the phone number? The final product being
 a 10 digit number without hyphens or commas. Thank you.

            Assuming that your local area code is <i>123</i>, in an unused column to the right use this formula,<br />
<br />
=INT("123"&amp;SUBSTITUTE(A1,"-",""))<br />
<br />
By converting the stripped phone number to an actual number with INT(), you will be able to use a
<i>special number format</i> for phone numbers.

<p>HOW TO INSTALL MACROs<br />
------------------------------------<br />
If you are new to macros, they are easy to install and use. To install it, simply press ALT+F11 to go into the VB editor and, once there, click Insert/Module on its menu bar, then copy/paste the above code into the code window that just opened up. That's it....
 you are done. To use the macro, go back to the worksheet with your data on it and press ALT+F8, select the macro name (FixPhoneNumbers) from the list that appears and click the Run button. The macro will execute and perform the action(s) you asked for. To
 make things simpler for you (especially if you will need to call this macro often), when you select the macro from the list, before clicking Run, you can click the Options button and assign a keyboard shortcut to it first and then use that keyboard shortcut
 the next time you want to run the macro.<br />

    <title>Hyperlinks in Microsoft Outlook 2013 don&#39;t work - resolve with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buttercup19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlinks in Microsoft Outlook 2013 don&#39;t work - resolve with Fixit then recur within days - need permanent fix please&#33;</h2>
                    <p>This has been going on for about 6 weeks and is driving me crazy as I have to re-boot for Fixit to take effect.
</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 HE on a 64 bit machine with 6GB RAM and a 1TB HDD and 2GHz CPU using Firefox as my browser.</p>
<p>All software is up to date and nothing significant has been changed recently to account for the behaviour.</p>
<p>I run MS Office 365 of long-standing and have uninstalled and re-installed that without any benefit. Re-setting Firefox was similarly useless.</p>
<p>I can get round the problem by using "copy" on the hyperlink but this is tedious and doesn't work to click through images etc and although I have a permanent copy of the appropriate Fixit on my desktop it doesn't usually work without a re-boot which is a
 real nuisance if I have a lot of windows open and am in the middle of a project or something - and anyway it ought to work!</p>
<p>Why won't the Fixit 'take' properly? Presumably something keeps knocking it out again - but what? I understood it was usually the browser that dislodged the relevant code or whatever but I have no idea where to look or why it should keep doing it so regularly.&nbsp;
 I thought it might be related to a plugin/extension, but I disabled all of these and it still kept happening so I enabled them all again.</p>
<p>If anyone could help I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Bobby</p>

    <title>Where is the close button in Powerpoint 2010 &#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark tko  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is the close button in Powerpoint 2010 &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just switched to 2010 and notcied there is no File &gt; Close button in Powerpoint on the right hand side at the top. There are the minimize, maximize and close buttons for the application itself at the very top but not for the file you have open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's there in&nbsp;Excel&nbsp;but not Word either - I have found in Word you can switch it on via the Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Display menu. Can't do this in powerpoint though !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know you can add the File &gt; Close button&nbsp;to the Quick Access Toolbar but am sure there must be a way of making it visible on the right ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks in advance</p>

            Yep Not in PowerPoint though. This is because 2010 PowerPoint is now truly Single Document Interface I guess.<br />
<br />
We hate it too and have an in house addin that adds close File to a Right Click menu which is very easy and quick (Maybe even quicker than the old X!)<br />
<br />
Oh and Free<br />

<h2>            Error message - &#34;This page is not working right now...&#34;</h2>
                    <pre>1.  Last Tuesday, this problem started and continues now.  When we are on the MSN home page, and click "Sign in" in the upper right hand corner to go to Outlook, we then click on "Sign in" again.  We enter our email address and our password.  The below message appears:

"This page is not available right now
We're working to restore it as soon as possible. Please check back soon.

Click here to try this page again, or visit: http://www.msn.com

Ref 1: 3000b160beb6449eae5cf5fb95f2221d   Ref 2: 000000   Ref 3: Sun Dec 14 2014 19:13:21 GMT-0600 (CST)"

The links in the message just repeat the same error message.

2.  At some point, I remembered that I needed to change our phone number on the account.  We have had several conversations about that with an Escalation Agent now and it is still not resolved.  As I said, the phone does not ring with a call from MSN.  I don't know why it would be blocked.  

3.  We were then told to go to Outlook through https://outlook.com, but when we are done there, and try to go back to MSN, we get the same message as above.</pre>
<p>Please research this error message.</p>

<p><span>As I understand the issue correctly, you cannot delete entries from your Safe Senders List and it throws an error code 4202 and 4205. If that is correct, may I have the
<strong>impacted email address&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> the accounts you wanted to delete&nbsp;in your Safe Senders List</strong> in the Private Message tab that I have initiated for you for us to investigate the issue on our end.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sophie,</p>
<p>The changes that you make to a table style should appear automatically in all the tables that have the same&nbsp;style and don't have other conflicting formatting applied to them. I suggest that you&nbsp;place your cursor in&nbsp;each of the other tables and see if the
 name of your style appears in the <strong>Apply Styles</strong> dialog box. If it does, click the
<strong>Reapply</strong> button. It it doesn't, you will need to apply the style to the table as I described. Actually, after you have seen the name of your style in the
<strong>Apply Styles</strong> dialog box once, you can just press Shift+Ctrl+S, start typing its name, which should be completed automatically, and press Enter. If this works, you can try moving your cursor to the next table and just press F4.</p>
<p>If you have a large number of tables in your document and you want the same table style applied to all of them, this can be done&nbsp;in one step with a macro, but you should first try to do it manually to a few tables to see what needs to be done.</p>

            Hello
<br />
<br />Power Pivot is an add-in that you can use to perform powerful data analysis in Excel. The add-in is built into certain versions of Office, but by default, it's not enabled.  
<br />
<br />For a list of the versions of Office that include Power Pivot, as well as a list of the versions that do not, please see: Where is Power Pivot?
<br />
<br />Here’s how you enable Power Pivot before using it for the first time.
<br />
<br />Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Add-Ins.
<br />
<br />In the Manage box, click COM Add-ins&gt; Go.
<br />
<br />Check the Microsoft Office Power Pivot box, and then click OK. If you have other versions of the Power Pivot add-in installed, those versions are also listed in the COM Add-ins list. Be sure to select the Power Pivot add-in for Excel.
<br />

Hi all. I work 4 days per week and would like to be able to set an automatic reply (out of office message) for the one day per week that I am not in the office. This is preferable to setting a permanent auto reply that individuals who contact me (both within
 and outside of my organization) will receive everyday, even when I am in the office. Is this possible? Thanks for your help!

            <p>Here are a bunch of potential fixes for Invalid product key problems. However, the first thing you should try is do a phone activation. Talk to a service rep. They can
 tell you the specific reason behind the error. There may be a simple fix you can do before trying these suggestions.</p>

</span>
<p>The tool in KB 836178 walks you through a trouble shooting procedure for Office 2010 Product Keys</p>
<p>This behaviour may occur for one or more of the following reasons.:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a Trial Version of Office installed that is “intercepting” the activation attempt, uninstall it first
</li><li>Check the numbers and letters on the product key:
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the number eight (8) can resemble a capitalized B,<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the number zero (0) can resemble a capitalized O or Q<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the number six (6) and letter G<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the letters VV and letter W<br />
Copy the product key from an email message to avoid typing errors.
</li><li>Make sure that you are not using a product key from an older version of Office. These product keys will not work with Office 2010.
</li><li>Office 2010 Product Keys do not Contain following Characters:<br />
Numbers: 0 1 5<br />
Letters: A E I L N O S U Z </li><li>Do not use a product key that might be attached to the bottom of your laptop, or on the back of your desktop computer. These are usually the Microsoft Windows product
 keys and will not work with Office 2010.
</li><li>If a Product Key Card was purchased at a retail store and activated at the register, do not use the key that is inside the card to unlock Office 2010. You must logon
 to the website listed on the card and follow the instructions to obtain the actual product key for the version of Office that you purchased.
</li><li>A product key for an Office 2010 stand-alone product (such as Microsoft Visio Professional 2010) will not be accepted as a product key for an Office 2010 suite. It is
 important to match the product key to the product for which it is specified.
</li><li>Volume License product keys will not be accepted for a retail Office 2010 product.
</li><li>Product Keys that start with “FC7HF” can only be used on Office Web Apps running on SharePoint
</li><li>Check your Windows Product ID in the Help about screen. Ie PID 00426-068-0288566-86858 - The
<span>068 </span>is a MS indicator that this type of license is not for retail sale.
<span>Your entire retail box and its contents is a counterfeit product, including the COA sticker.
</span></li><li>If none of the above conditions apply, before, or after trying the following procedures you may want to do a Phone Activation and ask the service rep to explain what
 the specific problem is. 
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>How to fix the problem</span>
<p>Sometimes the problem has been that Windows has had problems granting the right access to files, folders and the registry. The following tips provide some workarounds.</p>
<p>As you go from XP to Vista to Win7 certain operations require higher access rights to perform. These access rights are “higher” than even those granted to the Administrator
 ID by default. These “elevated” rights are accessed by way of the UAC confirmation dialog which is invoked when you select to “Run As Administrator”.</p>
<p>In theory, any one of the following tips should work. The process is: run one of the fixes, run each affected Office app, reboot, try the office apps again to confirm
 the fix worked.</p>
<p>If you want to first confirm that access rights are a problem this article describes how:

 5 ways to run as admin</span></i>
<p>In Windows 7, even when you are logged in as administrator, UAC no longer gives you “Full” administrator rights. To get all of the access you now also have“run as administrator”
</p>
<p>It appears there is an error where your userid is not being allowed to update the activation information.</p>
<p>What you need to do is "runas admin":</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the start menu and find the program icon you want to start
</li><li>&lt;Shift&gt; &lt;Right Click&gt; on it
</li><li>Select “Run as …”
</li></ul>
<p>If that doesn’t work try this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In the start menu, right click on the shortcut for any Office app, select “RunAs Admin”<br />
If runas does not appear, right click and drag the shortcut to the desktop 
</li><li>create a shortcut on the desktop.
</li><li>Right click on the desktop shortcut,
</li><li>runas admin should be there.
</li></ul>
<p>Activate the application/office:
</p>
<ul>
<li>2007 Office button / 2010 File tab
</li><li>Help
</li><li>Click on “Activate the Application”
</li><li>Follow prompts to enter product key
</li><li>Close the app
</li><li>Restart app normally
</li></ul>

            Do you have Norton installed as I believe they use Ask search disguised as safe search?
<br />Have you ever installed Java? It can also come bundled with that.
<br />Run Malwarebytes.
<br />Check under Programs &amp; features for anything Ask toolbar related &amp; uninstall it.

    <title>How do I get the Reminders window back&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron craig  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get the Reminders window back&#63;</h2>
                    I just switched from Outlook on the PC to Outlook 2011 for Mac. All seems to be working fine -- except for one thing:&nbsp; I really valued the little Reminders window I had on the PC, which displayed a list of every current reminder until I clicked to "Dismiss"
 those that were no longer needed.&nbsp; I thought I would get that same window with a list of Reminders with Mac Outlook.&nbsp; Instead, I just get an occasional iCal reminder showing up on the desktop -- singly.&nbsp; Why is iCal doing this (and for only single reminders)?&nbsp;
 Can I configure Outlook for Mac to give me the same list of reminders that Outlook on the PC showed?<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp; I have tried using the Microsoft Database Utility to rebuild the database associated with my "Identity."&nbsp; That just succeeded in creating a new identity with a calendar stripped of all entries.&nbsp; (Glad I backed up the original so I didn't lose everything.)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.<br />

<br />
<br />
Delete the Main Identity and in the Finder rename the one with [Backed up.....] to Main Identity.<br />
<br />
Tip: If you import any PST files in the future, create a new Identity to import the file. Some users have lost all data after importing a PST file. Once you verify the imported file is OK, under File &gt; Export select to export as .olm file. Import this file
 into your Main Identity. <br />
