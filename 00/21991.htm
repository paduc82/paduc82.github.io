<h2>            Hotmail login vacillates between about&#58;blank and login.live until it times out.</h2>
                    <p><span>When I attempt to sign in to hotmail, I am directed to login.live.com and then redirected to about:blank, jump back to login.live.com and then
 back to about:blank, and this continues for several minutes until it finally times out. What is happening? This computer is only about six months old and I have never had a problem before now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried resetting IE and still had the same problem. I even went back to IE 8 and it happened. I am back on IE 9, Windows 7, and having the same problem. I have tried just about everything under the sun and still have this problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, I can go on to hotmail if I start IE without addons, but it will not allow me to access mail in folders. I disabled every single addon and it still will not allow me to log in to hotmail unless I start IE without addons. Mozilla will not allow
 any kind of access to hotmail, even though I have it as a favorite. I have tried four different anti-malware programs to no avail.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Other computers in my household do not have this problem. Please advise.</span></p>

<p><br />
At least with IE8 you could have the Status bar showing you which security zone you would be in.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; ]</p>
<p>(With IE9 that diagnostic has been removed from the Status bar and consigned to the File, Properties dialog where you can't use it when redirects might be "vacillating" betweeen security zones.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; }</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with IE9 you could try using its new Developer Tools Network capture to try to figure out what is going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you have already done that to get as much detail as you have managed so far?&nbsp;&nbsp; However, IMO that would be awkward because the new
 tool seems to reset after redirects.&nbsp;&nbsp; You would want a continuous trace, such as the one Fiddler2 can give but when HTTPS is involved that tool may not be a transparent trace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW can you tell me if you posted this more than once with a different title or whether you think it has just been reworked e.g. given a different title by the moderators but without any indication of that having been done?&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW I first became aware of
 your post from a <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/forum/mods/continuous-vacillation-between-loginlive-and/968a9d51-2d21-4922-8a84-a8adccc40dd7">
feed</a> in the Feedback forum but it has a slightly different title and different messageID.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google shows that it ended up on&nbsp; W7 Networking but for some reason it is inaccessible with that URL.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/continuous-vacillation-between-loginlive-and/968a9d51-2d21-4922-8a84-a8adccc40dd7">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/continuous-vacillation-between-loginlive-and/968a9d51-2d21-4922-8a84-a8adccc40dd7</a></p>
<p>(Google search for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inurl:968a9d51-2d21-4922-8a84-a8adccc40dd7<br />
)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought that it might be an example of a moderator merging the original thread and its MessageID into a different thread with a similar topic in the same forum but hopefully such a procedure would result in the same MessageID being reused though no longer
 as the threadId.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I would have to use Google, for its&nbsp; inurl:&nbsp; search term attribute.</p>

<h2>            Visio Internal error&#58; &#35;3400 Action 1031&#58; Insert Object</h2>
                    I am running Visio Professional 2013 (Trial). When I try to insert a PDF object into my drawing I get the message 'Visio Internal error: #3400 Action 1031: Insert Object'. I have tried closing the drawing and reopening. I have tried shutting down Visio
 and restarting. I have created a new blank drawing. I have tried various, different PDFs from different sources. Each time the same thing occurs. I can insert all other types of objects without problems. It is just PDF files.<br />
Any ideas, please?<br />

Thanks for your reply, but after trying all you suggest, I still have the same problem. It is with every PDF; I have no addins running. Taking the files to work and running Visio 2007 there is no problem at all.<br />

            Hi everyone :)
<div><br />
<div>I've had some difficulty inserting excel sheets, into Visio. My solution to the problem&nbsp;<span>has been</span><span>, so far, to close Excel before inserting the object. The same goes for editing the inserted
 object.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>If I don't close Excel first I get that error&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers :)</div>

<h2>            Restart taking hours</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Build 10074 installed OK but takes hours whenever I have to restart</p>
<p>Build 10074 installed OK on my HP laptop (quicker than previous builds) and everything seems to run OK but when I need to restart it takes literally hours sitting on a blue screen before the logon screen pops up. I assumed there was a problem with the upgrade,
 but couldn't get it to roll back. I was just about to give up and rebuild last night, then decided to leave it and go to bed and this morning there it was, happily sitting at the logon. Then it wanted a new AMD driver and asked me to restart again. Since it
 was Sunday and I had nothing urgent to do, I pressed restart at 9am and the logon popped up at 2.30pm.</p>
<p>Anyone else having this problem?</p>

            <p>Thanks Giridhar</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebuilt my laptop and installed Build 10074 first. I am installing programs one by one and testing the restart after each install. So far I have Office and my Adobe CC apps installed and it's still starting OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet to install a lot of my utilities - HP CoolSense, Icon Restorer (maybe I don't need this with Windows 10 :-) ), security apps, etc. and all the plugins. I'll keep restarting after each install to see if something shows up that creates the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment it's working well.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to get Office ProPlus 2016 ISO with actual Build</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>how we can get a ISO for Office Profession Plus 2016 On Premise 32-Bit en-US with an actual Build?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Download Page theres is a old Version from the beginning of the Year 2016. The Build Number is 16.0.4266.1001.</p>
<p>With this build we get hundreds of Updates until the User can use it. This Needs several reboots and hours of Installation time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it would be great to have an actual Source for this product not only for Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we get this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

We appreciate your query. By default, the downloadable ISO for Office Professional 2016 is set to the standard version to give option to the users to update it manually, automatically, or not to update at all. You may also check on the link below for your reference:</p>

<p>
</p><p>thank you for this link. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a way we can choose. We patch central with an automatic software. So the User get a fully patched System. But we must save Installation time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for Office 365 there is a way. Is there really no way to get this also for the Office 2016 VL Version?</p>

            <p>My problem is not about that but thanks for trying. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem sending and receiving emails because i can't access outlook. I can access to my outlook account through my mobile phone but not through my pc. I also can access from my pc as long as i use another network and not my own wifi, and i don't
 know why is that happening.</p>

            <p>Hi Francisco, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Which operating system is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>2. Does the issue persist when you use other websites? </p>
<p>3. What all troubleshooting steps have tried in order to get the issue resolved?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess then the issue is with your network. If you are using operating system Windows 7 or above you can execute the Network Troubleshooters and you can share the result of running the network troubleshooter.
</p>

            <p>Hi Jessen,<br />
</p>
<br />
Thanks for commenting.<br />
<br />
1. I'm using Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. No, outlook is the only webpage i have problems with.<br />
<br />
3. I've tried almost all, i mean, clearing the browser, testing my antivirus, updating my browser (firefox), going to "https://status.live.com/" and checking everything, trying other browsers... And still cannot enter.<br />
<br />
I've just checked the Network Troubleshooter and everything seems to be ok, but it's obviously not ok.
<p />

<p>
</p><p>I don't usually use IE (i use firefox), but i tried anyway:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Cannot access again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. "res://ieframe.dll/dnserror.htm" this appeared. I get slightly informed by that issue on the internet and it seems that is related with updating IE, but i have it already updated.</p>

<h2>            How can I make Outlook more compact, get rid of the &#34;white-space&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The Outlook 2013&nbsp;program is taking up&nbsp;too much room on my desktop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I make the size of the actual visual program more compact/smaller, so it takes up less desk-top space?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 2007 version I had my Favorites and then my other Outlook folders below that.&nbsp;&nbsp; My Favorites took up about an inch and a half visual space; the 2013 program takes up 4 inches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not want to loose my favorites etc....I just need the visual part of the program to be more compact so it fits better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Can I update Huawei Ascend W1 to this version? Or will the retail store do it for me? Is it already pre-installed?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an update today for Computers and Tablets running Windows 8 (and Windows RT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 runs a different system.&nbsp; There will be an update in the next few weeks, and Windows Phone 8.1 will arrive in spring 2014 (as far as I know).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any updates to Windows Phone 8, you can do it yourself via WiFi.&nbsp; The phone will tell you when there's an update, or you can use settings-&gt;update on the phone to check manually.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and Intel HD 3000 Graphics</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is great and all but it still has no support for Intel HD 3000 Graphics. From my understanding Intel was developing drivers for said graphics but abandoned them and left them in Beta.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of this, games I usually play like Star Trek Online,&nbsp; Team Fortress 2, have had an issue that doesn't let me enjoy the game experience due to the excessive amount of latency or hangs that occur every 2-3 seconds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen other insiders complain about this as well, and&nbsp;other Windows 10 users, is something going to be done about this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using HP Pavilion DV6 7112HE Entertainment Notebook. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP seems to have put a "Windows 10" category for the laptop but I haven't noticed anything:

            <p>That's one of the first things I tried, drivers for my graphic drivers are supposedly not supported for Windows 10. Everything works great on it except gaming.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just puzzles me how they had a beta driver in place for it and then abandon it, leaving us with generic drivers for Windows 10.</p>

            <p>mine is the 4400, and i do have drivers for it.. &nbsp;just looked in device mgr. said they were made 6/6/2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>i dont play any real games, so, not sure if mine is great or not. dvd movies, and pics look awesome. but, some menu's and text in alot of the pop up app boxes look a lil grainy. i heard the newest build are suppose to address that. (i think) but, no big
 deal, just happy win 10 works (after a couple bad problems with some different intel things).</p>
<p>well, im babbling.</p>

            <p>Mines is dated 5/25/2015, but they're generic drivers for the OS.&nbsp; Windows 10 works great for me in all areas except for gaming, so I personally have no issues other than the aforementioned.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really hoping Intel works on them.. at least one small update to have a stable hardware for Windows 10 would be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, really appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

            <p>Drivers do not need to be updated to work on Windows 10. You can use drivers from as far back as Vista as long as they use the WDDM model. Of course there may be slight compatibility issues, but that aside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update should get the latest drivers available whether or not there are any designed specifically for Windows 10 (WDDM 2.0). You can check for an update through opening Device manager (Win+X or right click start), expanding &nbsp;"Display adapters" and
 selecting "Intel(R) HD <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
3000 Graphics</span>" -- right click it, select "Update driver software..." and then select "Search automatically for driver software".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it can't find an update, you should be able to install the 8/8.1 drivers from HP.</p>

            The 8.1 drivers for the HD 3000 do work but not well at all.&nbsp; Scrolling in browsers is not smooth, many games don't work.&nbsp; There is no OpenGL/CL support (needed for Lightroom an Photoshop and such).&nbsp; So, this really is a problematic issue.

            <p>I agree with you HarrisonClark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've started to notice the same problems as you with things you mentioned. This is a problematic issue Microsoft, and this deserves Intel's complete attention.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what OS driver I've used for Windows 10 for my Intel 3000 hardware, the issue has persisted. Looking at the Windows Insider App I can see I am not the only one experiencing these problems.

            I banged my head for hours until I decided to search for a fix. The whole time I thought it was a bad install. After researching I found that I was able to go into safe mode , uninstall the video driver and boot up normal. That was a sign that the black
 screen was not a bad install but a graphics issue. &nbsp;Updated the bios in my Dell n5050 I3 3rd gen. no Windows drivers as everyone had stated. I would try the bios update first.

            <p>No one should ever buy a computer of any description which only has an Intel gpu *if* gaming is something you enjoy or think you would like to enjoy in the future.&nbsp; Intel is way behind the gpu curve and always has been--very slow to support d3d APIs 100%
 in hardware.&nbsp; Its laptop gpus are designed for power conservation and 2d display--not performance &amp; gaming. I also would not buy a laptop unless I absolutely 100% *had* to go mobile (a desktop is like another world, it's so much better, especially building
 it yourself!), but if did buy a laptop I'd make sure that it had a single gpu, and that it wasn't an Intel gpu. Because I like my games, too...;) (The dual-gpu designs using Intel for battery life &amp; AMD/nVidia for performance seem to be problematic.)</p>

    <title>Search not working in Outlook 2016 for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zigzagwanderer11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search not working in Outlook 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I am running OSX10.11.3 and Outlook 15.19.1. &nbsp;When trying to search in Outlook, no results are returned. &nbsp;This is the same for simple searches, advanced searches...&nbsp;Everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From reading on the forums, it seems that Outlook search uses the Spotlight engine. &nbsp;I have, therefore, completely re-indexed the Mac by removing all indexing and then turning it back on (via Privacy settings). &nbsp;Spotlight works fine and it can find emails
 that are stored within Outlook. &nbsp;Hence there is no problem with Spotlight</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also checked that the MS Office Identity file is correctly named. &nbsp;I have also rebuilt the identity which involves re-downloading all email from the server. &nbsp;After that I again re-indexed spotlight</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2011 that i just upgrade from worked fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>A pretty miserable problem and i really&nbsp;don't know why i bothered upgrading</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas out there?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Pretty similar issue I had recently. Has migrated to new Mac (both are on Sierra 10.12.6) and on new Mac Outlook365 search stopped working (any search for any word provided no reply - nothing was found) while Spotlight works perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Found in one blog the following tool - OutlookSearchRepair on the link&nbsp;https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/office_for_mac_support_team_blog/2017/08/10/mac-outlook-support-utilities/</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;and it worked out! In 15 minutes reindex for Outlook was done and search is back again without any terminak commands or reinstallations.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for your post and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There could be some settings that may have changed thats preventing the Wells Fargo site from opening on the computer.<br />
</p>
<p>Kindly answer these questions so I can better understand the issue.<br />
1.Have you tried opening the website from another browser if you have one installed?<br />
2.Which version of Internet Explorer are you using? Desktop or Modern UI?<br />
3.Does the issue occur on both versions?<br />
4.Do you get any error message?<br />
<br />
You can try these methods to check if they help resolve the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Check Date and Time Settings.</p>
<p>Incorrect date and time settings on your PC can cause problems accessing webmail servers. Make sure that the date and time settings are correct on your PC. To check the date and time, follow these steps:
<br />
a)Press "Windows key + R" and type "control" and press enter.<br />
b)Click "Clock, Language and Region".<br />
c)Under "Date and Time" check time and time zone settings and correct them if necessary.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Run the Internet Connections troubleshooter and check if it helps.<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows logo key + W’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) Type "Troubleshooting" in the search box, click "Settings" and then press enter.<br />
c) Click on "View All" on the left pane and select Internet Connections and run the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
Refer to Method 2 here <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956196</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: </strong>Check if the site opens in no add on mode for Internet Explorer<br />
a) Press "Windows key + R" and type "iexplore.exe -extoff" to start IE with no add-ons.<br />
b)Try opening <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wellsfargo.com/</a>.<br />
c) Then through "Internet Options &gt; Manage Add-ons", you can enable/disable each add-on to identify which, if any, add-on is creating problems.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4:</strong> Add Wells Fargo to the trusted site list<br />
a)Press "Windows key + R" and type "inetcpl.cpl" and hit enter.<br />
b)Click the "Security" tab then select "Trusted Sites" as the zone and click the "Sites" button.<br />
<br />
You can now type "<a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wellsfargo.com</a>" and add it.</p>
<p><strong>Method&nbsp;5 : </strong>Reset Internet Explorer<br />
Follow the steps here to reset the browser <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer<br />
Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Feel free to use the forum for any other Windows questions you may have.</p>

            Sorry, I don't think it is possible. But you should be able to update your phone's firmware to a European version, which should include the French language. It is always advisable to keep your phone's firmware up to date.

            You need to go to a Nokia Service Centre and pay for the French installation. Any other method is dubious and should not be discussed here.

<p>If the key is functioning properly in Office (other than Word) and in IE (and probably elsewhere as well - you might want to test some other programs to be sure - especailly Windows Explorer) there is probably nothing wrong with the key itself or the keyboard
 or the keyboard driver.&nbsp; There may be something not working right with Word (since that is the only place you're having this problem) - though I'm surprised a program could act to deacivate a keyboard key but I suppose it is possible.&nbsp; As a workaround, you
 should be able to right click and click on Cut to esentially delete material from the documents (depending on your version of Word - I'm using the beta of Word 2010).</p>
<p>For questions about Word, please repost (you can just copy and then paste the above) in the Word section of the Office Discussion Group at:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/community/en-us/default.mspx?dg=microsoft.public.word.docmanagement&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 you are using in your post as well as any steops you have taken to try to resolve the problem (including the above it you gave them a try).</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

 list under the January issues,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-in-Outlook-for-Windows-ecf61305-f84f-4e13-bb73-95a214ac1230?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-in-Outlook-for-Windows-ecf61305-f84f-4e13-bb73-95a214ac1230?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a>.

            I think I solved the problem. I couldn't find the KB401 update that everyone is saying to delete, but I did find the previous update, and deleted that one. My Outlook opens now, and I didn't have the error come up, so that's a good sign. Running XP, by
 the way...

<p>Outlook.com now has the ability to invite individuals as calendar editors, rather than generating a link (which is read-only). The system lets you type in any email address for the notification, and the recipient would then need to sign in with a Microsoft
 account to link to the calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I type in a Gmail address to send the notification, the system won't let me (I get some message about "Outlook.com" is being upgraded). This message doesn't appear with any other domain (even non-Microsoft ones). Does anyone know why this is?
 It seems pretty ridiculous that I can't even send the co-authorship notification to a Gmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there a way to generate a link to the shared calendar that allows edit capabilities? Because it seems that the only links you can create are for read-only access.</p>

    <title>disconnecting projector stops PowerPoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leathemmehaffey iii  say:</h3>
<h2>            disconnecting projector stops PowerPoint</h2>
                    In talks that I give I sometimes have to swap the computer and an overhead projector as sources for the projector. This is accomplished via a switch on the overhead projector which chooses between the two sources (camera or computer). However, if I'm in
 the middle of a Powerpoint presentation and switch to the camera, when I come back the presentation is frozen. As a workaround I have to end the presentation (which is in the Windows 8 Metro version). The PC screen then reverts to the classic Powerpoint version,
 and then I have to find the last slide I was showing and restart the presentation from that point. Is there any way to avoid this? It seems to me that a while ago Powerpoint did not automatically go to the Metro version and this problem didn't exist.<br />

            <p>Dear Nayana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm sorry to report that the fix you suggested did not work. Nothing changed. As before, the presentation was showing &nbsp;on the projector, but when I disconnected the projector and then reconnected it the projector showed only the desktop, not the presentation.
 The presentation was still visible on the computer and was still running, but simply ignored the projector. To get it back I had to stop the presentation, which took me back to the classic Powerpoint mode, which I then could restart after locating my last
 slide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps I should add that I am using Presenter mode with the screen set to extended, as I always did in the past.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since 5 days I have now the E7-00!&nbsp; For the moment I was not capable to find an OVI suite parameter description. My fear is that this software will modify too many parameters on my PC with I can't control - which I don't need!</p>
<p>I don't need really any thing else than the possibility to backup my phone, and edit my contacts (not synch at all)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- can I use also the previous software 'PC-Suite' for my E7-00?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- can I get a really good parameter description about OVI Suite some where?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- do some body have any as much as simplest solution for that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm just missing really good documentation about Nokia Software</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank in advance for all your answers</p>
<p>Cheers,&nbsp; Rolf</p>

<p>PC suite detects E7 and I'm using it. It's working fine and you can do all operations such as content copier, edit contacts, music transfer etc. Sadly, synchronisation isn't supported with PC suite.</p>

<p>I use version 7.1, which is the latest one. I was using it to connect my old N73 and E7 too worked with it, so download PC suite 7.1&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokia.co.in/support/download-software/nokia-pc-suites/compatibility-and-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>,
 not sure the one in that link is a direct .exe file.</p>

<p>Good morning again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are we talking really about the same E7-00?&nbsp; This brand new E7-00 is not listed in the official compatibility list, enven in Europe it's on the market since just a few days - Check the link "<a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/find-products/phones/nokia-e7-00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia

            Yes, E7 is on stores here in my country, since PC suite is an 'old' software suite they won't list it under new devices and, in this case, that doesn't mean it won't work, as I said before I used Nokia N73 with PC suite and E7 too worked with it. Download
 version 7.1 of any device and connect it with the E7, all you need is the PC suite installed on to your computer and I thought that's what you were asking for?

<p>Just a cautionary information the latest update of PC suite 7.1.60.0 doesn't support E7, I updated PC suite today to see it saying the device is not supported by PC suite. Better don't update PC suite if it shows an update available it won't detect E7 anymore.</p>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yes, this is&nbsp;my experience too - I download PC-Suite and automatically I got this latest version.</p>
<p>Since them I did arrange almost every things as needed without PC-Suite, except the backup of my personal settings - this is still an open issue. The problem is that I was not able yet to get access to the protected system partition to copy these files.</p>

<h2>            ActiveSync Install keeps coming up on non-admin XP account</h2>
                    I have ActiveSync 4.5 that I installed on my XP SP2 PC to support my Asus 626 PDA.&nbsp; I normally run as a non-priveledged user and I made the mistake of trying to install as that user.&nbsp; That failed and I switched over to the admin account and installed fine.&nbsp;
 I've made that same mistake with other products and done the same thing, no problem.<br />
<br />
However, now whenever I log in to the non-priveledged account ActiveSync attempts to finish installing.&nbsp; And whenever I attempt to run Windows Media Player ActiveSync also tries to install.&nbsp; In fact, it attempts to install several times, which is pretty annoying.&nbsp;
 How do I get rid of the partial install?<br />
<br />

            I started researching how to grant permissions to my non-admin account on the folder and realized that this doesn't sound like what I want to do.&nbsp; I don't want to re-install as a non-admin user.&nbsp; The install completed fine on my admin account, and I'm
 ok with switching over to that account to sync.&nbsp; I just want to clean up whatever is causing Windows Installer to start up.&nbsp; I'm afraid that granting permissions on the Program Files folder will just be the start of a long chain of "user doesn't have permssion
 to do this, user doesn't have permission to do that".<br />
<br />
I did go thru the registry searching for activesync but didn't see anything obvious that I felt comfortable deleting.<br />

<h2>            MS Project overallocation expected but not shown</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have created a test-wise mini project plan, based on the empty standard default template,&nbsp;with only three 1-day tasks and the same&nbsp;resource assigned to each task, to reproduce an issue that I only have since today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No changes done to this resource, so a normal 100% resource, no special calendar.</p>
<p>All 3 tasks start at the same day (default project start date) so I would have expected to see an overallocation for this resource on that specific&nbsp;date as also in the resource usage view, it is displayed with 3d total on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;it doesn't show up with the overallocation indicator,&nbsp;and the column "overallocated" says NO.</p>
<p>I have no clue what I did differently than in my normal plans where I always got the overallocation as expected (and which still are available in other, existing plans).</p>
<p>I already tried saving/closing/reopening the plan plus a reboot of the notebook but it is the same behaviour in every new plan that I try....</p>
<p>Any idea what happened here?</p>
<p>Thanks so much in advance for any help,</p>
<p>best,</p>
<p>Gabi</p>

<p>Gabi,</p>
<p>Simple answer. I'm guessing you did not change the leveling option calculation, which by default is "week by week". Go to Resource &gt; Level group &gt; Leveling Options and change the calculation to look for "day by day". You will then see your single resource
 as overallocated on Wednesday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>John, good call, but doesn't there have to be something else to it if there is no over-allocation indicator. Perhaps max units for the resource is set higher than 100%.</p>
<p>Gabi, assuming all auto-scheduled tasks, if you level and nothing happens (tasks don't get delayed), then the tasks weren't over-allocated, so check max units for the resource.</p>

<p>John, I should have checked before I posted. Of course you are right. The resolution setting in leveling options
 is checked in leveling options.</p>
<p>A bit of a puzzle here, though. Over-allocated says no?</p>

<p>Dear both,</p>
<p>actually you are right, the setting in the leveling did the trick!</p>
<p>So I changed it to day-by-day and now I can see the red indicators (alternatively, I extended the duration to 5d and also got the indicator).</p>
<p>But as Trevor mentions, it is confusing that the "overallocated" field says no to all of them....</p>
<p>I thought it actually refers to the same test logic as the indicators?</p>
<p>cheers</p>
<p>Gabi</p>
<p>P.S. is this leveling option a general settings that will be transferred to every other plan as well when I open a different one? I remember I have played around with it a while ago but expected it to be a setting relating to only that very specific project
 plan and every other one would open with the default or its own specific setting... - is the default "day-by-day"? Thanks for info!</p>

            Every plan is different. Every combination of tasks and resource assignments and overallocation is unique. Leveling settings and options need to be checked and set every time you level. It is probably always a good idea to start with minute-by-minute every
 case to see if there is any overallocation at all.<br />

<p>Trevor,</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad you gave it a second look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the Overallocated field in the Gantt Chart view, there are no overallocations of Bob on any given task so the field says "no", as it should. However, if you look at the Resource Usage view, you will see that the Overallocated field for the
 resource is "yes" because Bob himself is overallocated but the field for each assignment is "no" because Bob is not overallocated on any given assignment.</p>

<p>Gabicia,</p>
<p>You're welcome and thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the Overallocation field, see my response to Trevor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the default leveling period, that is a global setting. In other words you can set your Global to whichever period you want and that will be the default for any new file you open. Once you create a file and change it's particular leveling period,
 that new setting now stays with the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>

<p>All --</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pardon me for bumping into this conversation, but I wanted to shed some light on the column named Overallocated.&nbsp; There is a task Overallocated column and a resource Overallocated column.&nbsp; The Help text for the task Overallocated column is blatantly WRONG.&nbsp;
 The only time that the task Overallocated column displays a Yes value is when you assign a resource to a task with a Units value that is greater than the Max. Units value.&nbsp; It does not show a Yes value for parallel tasks assigned to the same resource which
 result in an overallocation.&nbsp; That means this column is not very useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, the resource Overallocated field works just fine.&nbsp; If you apply any resource view, such as the Resource Usage view for example, the software will correctly display a Yes value for every resource that is overallocated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, there is also a default task&nbsp;filter named Overallocated Tasks which SHOULD show every task with an overallocated resource assigned...but alas, it does not.&nbsp; Because this filter uses the task Overallocated field for its filter criteria, this
 filter is not very useful as well.&nbsp; Hope this additional information helps.</p>

<p>Dale,</p>
<p>Always appreciate your expert commentary but I have to take exception to your statement about the help file being blatantly wrong. At least in my version, it states:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If a task has overallocated&nbsp; assignments, this field contains Yes. A task is overallocated if any of the assigned resources is assigned to more work on the task than can be completed within the resource's normal work capacity".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in my mind, the help file is exactly on track for what the Overallocated field shows in a task view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I fully agree that the Overallocated field is of little or no value for a task view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<p>Thanks much John,</p>
<p>just to make sure I got your point:</p>
<p>when I create a new plan from scratch and change the leveling to, say, minute-by-minute, this will also be carried over to any future plan. If I open an existing one, this one will not be impacted by that change and "keeps" its own setting?</p>
<p>I just tried it out a bit but the minute-by-minute also got transfered to the existing plan, which might be really confusing when the indicators sometime show up and sometime won't, depending on the leveling settings of another plan?</p>
<p>cheers,</p>
<p>Gabi</p>

<h2>            Calculated field in Main Form Help</h2>
                    I am working with creating a custom form &nbsp;i have a main form that is called &nbsp;ProgramsWithMembers and a Subform Called ProgramWithMembersSubform &nbsp;in the main form i have the fields &nbsp;ProgramID ProgramType MonthlyFee, &nbsp;and PhysicalRequired
<div>&nbsp;In the Subform are the fields Name, Phone, ExpirationDate, and MembershipStatus What i am looking to do is create a calculated field in the main form that will calculated the number of members listed in the subform. Does anyone have any suggestions on
 how to accomplish this? </div>

            <p>Add a textbox to the header or footer of the subform.&nbsp; Set its <strong>Name</strong>&nbsp;property to&nbsp;<strong>txtRecordCount</strong> and set its
<strong>ControlSource</strong> to <strong>=Count(*)</strong>.&nbsp; You can also set <strong>
Visible</strong> to <strong>No</strong> as you probably don't want the count to be displayed in that position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, create a textbox on the main form with this <strong>ControlSource</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>=[SubformControlName].[Form]![txtRecordCount]</strong></p>
<p>(replace "SubformControlName" with the name of the control which contains your subform)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This textbox will display the number of members showing in the subform at any time.</p>
