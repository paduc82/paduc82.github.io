<h2>            Windows version 1803 vs 1809</h2>
                    <p>Desktop updated to version 1809 on 1/17/19, laptop is still on version 1803 and up to date on updates...Today checked for updates, on laptop has a update to 1803 and another update to 1809..but has never updated to 1809 ????
</p>
<p>Issue is first when/if is laptop going to get update to 1809 and why getting a update to 1809 when not installed, since can't remove stop updates any longer can only assume that the update to 1809 will not successfully install..

<p>I had a similar thing happen with one of my PC's. The update screen had the message that it had been upgraded to the new release when it was still running 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on "Check for updates" always came back and told me I was up to date.</p>
<p>

            Hi CrashA
<br />
<br />I would try upgrading manually:
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />
<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1809 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br /> Have you checked the manufacturers website to determine compatibility?
<br />Check this List to Determine if Your Computer is Compatible with the Windows 10 1809
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/check-this-list-to-determine-if-your-computer-is/5152bb37-f95d-48a6-b7b2-ad0d5c738923">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />	perform the following tasks:
<br />	12 Things You Should Do Before Installing Windows 10 
<br />	<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-computer-windows-10-creators-update-version-1703/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-comput...</a>
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don't, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />How to Upgrade to Windows 10 on a Drive with Limited Space
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update-on-a/d7cdba8b-c59b-4a23-86e2-6635a7e44489">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />Thats it, the Windows 10 1809 is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1809 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

<p>Thanks for the info. The list of compatabilty pc's references upgrading to ver 1803, i am on&nbsp; ver 1809 i question. I checked manufacturer site but not listed for Acer Aspire, model 5552-5898.</p>
<p>I am not comfortable with forcing the upgrade, especially not knowing if pc compatible, will just create more havoc. At this point let the system determine when to upgrade..if at all.
</p>
<p>My guess is a some point 1803 will become obsolete and no longer supported ?</p>
<p>I just didn't understand why if on 1803 sent a update for 1809 which error'd off anyway.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>But i am not comfortable or that technical to attempt this. Especially considering below response that pc may not be compatable with 1809.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system,microsoft should identify with the version and send the update, it did with previous versions, so something else is amiss..</p>
<p>The update i received did error off, but since not on 1809 questioned why it sent the update.</p>

<p>In addition as great as your instructions are i am not tech savy and would not attempt to try above recommend. My luck would be a negative result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If setting a restore point and then try a forced ver upgrade, maybe , knowing i could restore back. But your way seems no going back.</p>
<p>But thank you.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 activation ceased after bios update</h2>
                    <p>Hi there I recently upgraded my operating system from win 8 to 8.1 then finally 10 and everything activated fine.&nbsp; Then my solid stated drive died suddenly, so i replaced the drive reinstalled win 10 and hey presto windows was activated automatically, amazing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However i have a Clevo laptop which has always made a racket either on full or off even during web browsing and minor tasks.&nbsp; My plan was to give this laptop to my eldest son but wanted to sort out the fan noise once and for all.&nbsp; Tried speedfan and another
 hardware monitor to no avail, then i found on the pcspecialist forums (where I brought laptop two years ago) a link to a third party modded bios which addresses this issues.&nbsp; So I took the plunge and everything went well and fan noise is significantly reduced...only
 problem now my windows says it needs activating. It then sends me to the store where it informs me that it will have me activated again shortly, but then the webpage throws up an error and cant complete request.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I am stuck with an unactivated laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows 8 key was brought directly by myself digitally a couple of years ago and yet I can find no record of purchase on my microsoft account.&nbsp; I had written the product key down but tried to activate windows 8&nbsp; with it when my harddrive went down it
 refused it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>By now I am very frustrated.&nbsp; Please help me make my windows genuine again.</p>

    <title>Printer keeps going offline and creating a copy of printer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printer keeps going offline and creating a copy of printer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a printer that didn't install very smoothly the first time. First time I actually connected it via usb first and then installed driver after. I then removed it and did the opposite way around. This appeared to work successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it will work for a while and then either the printer will appear fine in devices and printers but won't print anything OR a copy of the printer will appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried switching the printer with another of the same model and the issue remains... so it does appear to be a problem at the computer itself. It is running win7 32-bit. I have also tried changing the usb printer cable and power cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So currently when the issue presents, either turning the printer power off and on will at least get it printing again... OR i need to go into print management and remove the printer and driver package and then reboot and then reinstall driver and connect...
 it will then work fine for possibly a day or so...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer is a Zebra label printer with the latest driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a second printer running on this machine fine (it was installed after the other printer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering whether I need to do a complete removal (registry and all) of any traces of the printer to reinstall it???</p>

            Go to your printers folder from the control panel. Locate your printer. Right-click on it and make sure it is set to 'use printer online'.
<br />
Remember if your printer is turned off it will show as 'offline'. When you turn it on it should automatically go back to 'online'.
<br />
You can still change it where I showed you. <br />
This should take care of it.

<h2>            Cannot ping msn.com but can ping hotmail.com</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 8 OS. I recently moved to another wiki network environment and found something weird. I cannot connect to my mail server. In command prompt, I pinged the email server pop.AA***.com with error message "Request timed out".&nbsp; I then ping hotmail.com,
 and msn.com and got the following message:</p>

Here we see that I could ping www.hotmail.com, but I could not ping www.msn.com nor my email server pop domain. However I can access both www.hotmail.com, and www.msn.com in browser.<br />

Could some expert tell me what was wrong with&nbsp; Windows or networking setting ? </p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

<h2>            Problem in accessing Outlook.com on Internet Explorer and someother issues on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Windows 10 problems</p>
<p>Last week I upgraded my Windows 7 to Windows 10.<span>&nbsp; </span>As Louis Armstrong might say “Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I wasn’t sure where to post this.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problems with Email in Windows 10</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>I frequently cannot access my email.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>I frequently get a message “Failed to connect to Windows Service”</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>I frequently get kicked out of my email after I do access it.</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>I frequently get a message “This page cannot be displayed”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once I get this message I cannot access my account again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Refreshing the page does not work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have to reboot the computer and start fresh.</p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>I cannot manage my account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(Settings &gt; Accounts)</p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Outlook frequently freezes/becomes inaccessible while I’m using it and has to be refreshed or the computer rebooted.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I frequently get the message “This page cannot be displayed”</p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>From the time I start trying to access my email account until I finally access it frequently takes 4-5 minutes but sometimes takes as long as 25 minutes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I frequently read a book while I’m waiting or go off and do some chores.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Accessing my account is that reliably bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>I tried to add my wife’s email address “to the family”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Microsoft sent her an invitation.<span>&nbsp; </span>When she accepted the invitation Microsoft would not accept her.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email type problem extends to other Microsoft accounts as well.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It took 35 minutes trying to log into the Microsoft community site, mostly time spent checking out my online name for availability.<span>&nbsp;
</span>While I was waiting I wrote my problems/issues that I posted here.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I still had time to go do a number of chores and ate dinner (periodically checking to see if the attempt was completed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After 35 minutes I got the message “This page can’t be displayed”.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I rebooted and tried again.<span>&nbsp; </span>It still didn’t work.<span>&nbsp; </span>Three times but still no access to Microsoft Community.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Windows 10 sucks and is FUBAR, at least on my computer.&nbsp; Total time 1 hour 35 minutes with no access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally shut down the desk top computer and am writing this on my laptop with Windows 7.&nbsp; Total time about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What I think is a possible solution:</span></strong></p>
<p>I didn’t have these email problems until I linked my email account to the bloody Microsoft account.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I believe there is clearly a problem with the Microsoft account or the linking of the accounts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Is there a way to disconnect my email account from the Microsoft account?<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Since I was running Windows 7 could that be part of the problem?&nbsp; This laptop runs Windows 7 but it isn't compatible for an upgrade to Windows 10.</span></p>

            <p><span>Sorry it took so long to get back to you.&nbsp; My email account right now is quite unreliable.&nbsp; Also I wanted to compare Internet Explorer with Moxilla Firefox.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; With Windows 7 I was used to being able to sign into my email account relatively easily.&nbsp; I frequently would get error messages
 "We can't connect to Outlook right now" but I could usually refresh the page and recover my email account.&nbsp; When I upgraded to Windows 10 I should never have gone the route of signing into my Microsoft account in order to access my email account.&nbsp; The more
 elaborate a program is the more chance of having problems.&nbsp; And I definitely have problems.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I upgraded over a week ago so I don't necessarily remember exactly what I did.&nbsp; But I went to "Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your email and accounts" and signed in to my Microsoft
 account.&nbsp; I verified my account through a code sent to an alternate email address.&nbsp; There's a place that says "Manage your account".&nbsp; I clicked on that but there was a problem.&nbsp; I don't recall what exactly happened except that I apparently couldn't manage
 my account.&nbsp; The I tried to add my wife's account (more on that in question #3 below.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>Since I signed in through my Microsoft account/upgraded to Windows 10 I have encountered the problems I listed.&nbsp; This morning when I started the computer I made some notes.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I timed how long to open web pages hoping this might help you determine what the problem is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Marketwatch - ~20 seconds</p>
<p>
</p><p>EBay - ~10 seconds</p>
<p>
</p><p>Craigslist - ~1-2 seconds</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several other web pages - ~4-15 seconds</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook – wouldn’t open.<span>&nbsp; </span>I refreshed the page a couple of times. After about 10 minutes I tried to restart the computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The restart process did the same thing my email account did.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It froze in the mode of restart (with the little dots running around in a circle).<span>&nbsp;
</span>I manually shut the computer down, waited a few seconds, and restarted the computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It started still frozen in the restart phase.<span>&nbsp; </span>I manually shut the computer down again and waited about 5-6 minutes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This time the computer started up and let me log into my email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at my emails and within 15 minutes I got a message “We cannot connect to outlook right now”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I refreshed the page and then got the message “This page can’t be displayed”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Taking that same page and typing “google” into the address bar, google page came up in 1-2 seconds; craigslist -~1-2 seconds; eBay - ~10-15 seconds.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These various web sites are still readily accessible but the Outlook account page won’t open.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I typed my Outlook address into the address bar and after about 1 minute, 10 seconds I got a message “This page can’t be displayed”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried opening Outlook in a new window.<span>&nbsp; </span>After about 2 minutes, 40 seconds I got the message “This page can’t be displayed”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Taking this same page I retried Google, Craigslist, etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>All of these web pages again opened in seconds.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had to reboot the compute to access my Outlook email account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the length of my description of problems.&nbsp; I thought maybe a chronological process of what happened, including error messages might help.</p>
<p>A Microsoft representative asked me to run sfc scan on the computer to check if there are any corruptions on the computer.&nbsp; The scan was clean, no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p><span>Your questions:</span></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you referring the problem with both Mail Client and Web browser?&nbsp;
 connect to Outlook right now".&nbsp; I refreshed the page and my email account came back.&nbsp; The other web pages worked fine.&nbsp; I want to stress the Outlook account behaved very different than it usually does.&nbsp; More on that later.&nbsp; Then I tested Moxilla Firefox the
 very same way.&nbsp; The Outlook behaved fine but Moxilla had trouble opening a couple of the other web pages.&nbsp; Again, this is unusual compared to what I usually experience.&nbsp; Moxilla Firefox generally opens web pages a bit faster on my computer than Internet explorer.</span></span></li><li><span>What do you mean by this statement "Microsoft sent her an invitation.&nbsp; When she accepted the invitation Microsoft would not accept her."?&nbsp;
 Her email address is listed, she can sign in to her email, but her membership/admission to the family is still pending.&nbsp; This all happened over a week ago, I didn't expect a problem,&nbsp;and I didn't write down the exact message.&nbsp; All I can tell you for sure is
 that she can sign into her email account but her membership?&nbsp;is still pending.</span></span></li><li><span>You mean to say, unable to login to windows PC even after accepting invitation?&nbsp;
 she should be thankful she didn't join the family.&nbsp; In my case I have had trouble even accessing my computer.&nbsp; When you start the computer there is a full screen photo.&nbsp; Once you remove the photo the Microsoft account login is there.&nbsp; I have had times when
 I've logged in and nothing happens.&nbsp; The little dots run around in a circle but everything is frozen in place.&nbsp; Once it took 25 minutes before I could access my computer.&nbsp; I would love to get disconnected from my Microsoft account.&nbsp; If I had know that I couldn't
 access my computer unless I logged into my Microsoft account without any problems, I would not have&nbsp;connected my email to my Microsoft account.</span></span></li><li><span>If yes, what error message you will get there?&nbsp;
 for 25 minutes to access my computer.&nbsp; However, when I'm actually in my email account I frequently get error messages "This task could not be completed.&nbsp; Please try again."&nbsp; I have that message on my screen as I type this.&nbsp; I also frequently get " We can't
 connect to Outlook right now" and "This page can't be displayed".&nbsp; Sometimes this problem affects other web sites I'm using, but I think that occurs only/mostly when I have my Outlook account open.</span></span></li><li><span>When you say Email address linked with Microsoft account, which email account are you referring? Note: Don't include your email address with your post.&nbsp;

</p><p>From your whole description, I have&nbsp;noticed below things,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Unable to open&nbsp;Outlook.com by using your account credentials on Internet Explorer, but you can open on Mozilla Firefox without issues. Right? Also did you tried logging&nbsp;into Outlook.com using some other Outlook account credentials?
</li><li>Sometimes refreshing the webpage, you can able to recover your Outlook account. Right?
</li><li>Adding Microsoft account under Family and&nbsp;accepting invitation&nbsp;is okay. But the status still show as pending. Then are you able to see the account on Windows 10 login screen? Did she tried logging into that account? Did you tried removing and reconfiguring
 the account under family again?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, add-ons can cause browsers to run slowly and crash, or they might pose a security or compatibility risk. Suggest you to try accessing the Outlook.com on Internet Explorer without add-ons. You can refer the below link for the steps for doing this.</p>

            <p>First, thank you very much for your time and effort.&nbsp; I sincerely appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Unable to open&nbsp;Outlook.com by using your account credentials on Internet Explorer, but you can open on Mozilla Firefox without issues. Right? Also did you tried logging&nbsp;into Outlook.com using some other Outlook account credentials?&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(172, 25, 61, 1)">When
 I reboot the computer I can generally, but not always, &nbsp;access my email account by signing in with my Microsoft account.&nbsp; It generally takes 2-5 minutes&nbsp;from the time I enter my password until I'm in the account.&nbsp; It has taken&nbsp;up to 35 minutes.&nbsp; Once I'm in
 my email account I generally get kicked out after about 20-30 minutes.&nbsp; It starts with "We can't connect to&nbsp;Outlook right now."&nbsp; Sometimes refreshing the page will recover the Outlook account, sometimes not.&nbsp; When I do recover the Outlook account I generally
 will get kicked out again in a short period of time.&nbsp; At some point refreshing the page no longer works and I get "This page can't be displayed."&nbsp; Then refreshing the page&nbsp;no longer works.&nbsp; I have to reboot the computer.&nbsp; I reboot the computer probably1-2
 times per hour.&nbsp; Today this same scenario applies to some other web sites as well.&nbsp; Those sites were affected somewhat before but today they were much worse.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Sometimes refreshing the webpage, you can able to recover your Outlook account. Right?<span style="color: rgba(172, 25, 61, 1)">&nbsp; Answered above.</span></li><li>Adding Microsoft account under Family and&nbsp;accepting invitation&nbsp;is okay. But the status still show as pending. Then are you able to see the account on Windows 10 login screen? Did she tried logging into that account? Did you tried removing and reconfiguring
 the account under family again?&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(172, 25, 61, 1)">Yes, her email account shows up on the login screen and she can log into her Outlook account.&nbsp; Her status still shows as pending.&nbsp; She just isn't part of the family, whatever than means.&nbsp; I think
 she's fortunate that her status is still pending because she generally doesn't get kicked out of her Outlook account as often as I do although today she got kicked out twice.&nbsp; I haven't tried removing and reconfiguring the account under family.&nbsp; I wouldn't
 know how.&nbsp; </span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(172, 25, 61, 1)">Is there a way to disconnect my account from the Microsoft account?&nbsp; I don't have a need to sign into my Outlook account through a Microsoft account on my desktop computer.&nbsp; I would much rather just sign into my Outlook account
 directly.&nbsp; It was scary that day it took 35 minutes before I could access my computer.&nbsp; I would much rather not have my computer held hostage by having to sign into the Microsoft account on the login screen.&nbsp; I can protect my computer just as easily with just
 a password and not be reliant on a non-working Microsoft account.&nbsp; My computer has been extremely unreliable since I upgraded to Windows 10, particularly with respect to my Outlook account.&nbsp; My feeling right now is if I can't disconnect my Outlook account
 from my Microsoft account I may uninstall Windows 10.&nbsp; I didn't have these problems in Windows 7.&nbsp;

</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us with an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your complete description, I don't think that the problem is related to Outlook.com. I guess the problem might be any of the below things.</p>

</p><p>- Problem with your network connection.</p>
<p>- Problem with the User Profile or might be with the System files.</p>

<p><span><span>After I updated some drivers and cleaned up the computer things are working fairly well.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>My biggest problem now is still finding my files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My wife and I each had separate user accounts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now after switching to windows 10 a large portion of my files, particularly photos and music, are under my wife’s name now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>She didn’t have any music or photo files in Windows 7 and now most of my files are under her name.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That’s just going to take some time to sort out but it is something I can do.</span></p>
<p><span>For the time being I’m keeping my email account as part of the Microsoft account.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I’m doing that in part because my Outlook account is working fairly well and I don’t want to make any changes that might make things worse.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m having heart surgery in a couple of weeks and I want to have access to my Outlook account while I’m recovering.</span></p>
<p><span>I considered trying the Clean Boot you suggested but decided against that for the time being.<span>&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 Updates - rebooting automatically</h2>
                    <p>Why does Windows 10 take away the functionality of the updates being installed. You no longer have control of what is installed, and even though you tell Windows 10 NOT TO RESART AUTOMATICALLY, and you set a time for it&nbsp;TO restart it goes ahead and restarts
 when it wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so disappointed with this UPGRADE to WINDOWS 10, that I refuse to update my other machines with it. It is VERY unstable, and I constantly have low memory warnings with&nbsp;16 GIGS of memory.&nbsp; NOW - my question, HOW DO I KEEP THIS&nbsp;FIASCO CALLED
 WINDOWS 10 FROM REBOOTING MY MACHINE AND CAUSING ME TO LOSE EVERYTHING THAT IS OPEN ON ITS OWN SCHEDULE. I EITHER WANT TO TURN OFF THE UPDATE FEATURE COMPLETELY OR FIND A WAY TO CONTROL THE UNSCHEDULED RESTARTS.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please do not link me to worthless answers that in no way resolve my question, I don't want to know how to create a restart disk, DVD on anything like that, I don't want to be linked to articles that list the importance of running a maintenance service on
 the computer to see what files are missing.&nbsp; I am not interested in putting&nbsp;information from my computer on a cloud to have it securely stolen.&nbsp; Microsoft said&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;would be the update that&nbsp;saved&nbsp;the world.... the only thing it has done is made life
 harder, continually having to redo stuff, and never having the questions of a fixing a

            <p>I have done 1 and 3. I have no interest in setting up another user account, as I am the sole user of this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also might add, I find extremely frustrating that when I click on any link going to a MS Community post, Microsoft refuses to let Chrome proceed with the login. I inevitably end up at a screen that says "Something went wrong and we can't sign you in right
 now. Please try again later". However, the same link ALWAYS works if I copy it and paste it into Edge. This seems highly likely to be intentional on the part of Microsoft, at least in my opinion.

            <p>Surprised that almost every person I talk to is having this problem. Reboots no matter how it is scheduled. My work is almost non-existent because of this. The updates aren't installing, even with the multiple reboots. So what is the answer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) How do I get the updates to even install</p>
<p>2) How do I stop unscheduled reboots</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think answering these two question will stop any problems I have with Windows 10 and am sure others will benefit from the answers, as well.</p>

            After you install an operating system, you must then install drivers for all your hardware. This includes your network adapter so you can have Internet access. Since you can't get to the Internet on the target machine, download the drivers from another
 computer with an Internet connection and save them to a USB thumb drive or burn to CD-R (not RW) and transfer to the target machine.<br />
<br />
Never get drivers from Windows Update. Get them from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />

<h2>            Can&#8217;t log into my Windows account</h2>
                    <p>I use facial recognition to log in all the time, and sometimes a pin. My laptop tells me that “Your PIN is required to sign in”, so I oblige.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, getting an error message along the lines of “Something happened and your PIN isn’t available. Choose another sign-in option...”. Problem is, I don’t remember my password (even with the hint), resetting it requires a USB key that I don’t have (as in
 I never created one) and there is no admin account on my laptop. So what do I do to login/reset my password???</p>

    <title>Set paint to default to JPEG&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slickrcbd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Set paint to default to JPEG&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Somehow many years ago I set Windows XP to default to using JPEG when saving screenshots by hitting &lt;ALT&gt;-&lt;PRINT SCRN&gt; and then pasting into paint.</p>
<p>However, Windows 7 insists on using .png and I have to change it every time the way Windows 98 insisted on using .BMP.</p>
<p>I can't find anything to change the default.</p>
<p>Is there a way to make Paint use JPEG by default without having to select it multiple times? It makes a smaller image for posting, and a lot of forums only take JPEG or GIF, not PNG or BMP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If necessary, I can copy the old MSPAINT.EXE from my XP computer to the Windows 7 computer the way I copied calc.exe, but if there is a way to set it in Windows 7, please let me know.</p>

            <p>There is no way to change the default save format Paint uses, it's hard-coded to use the higher-quality PNG format so that it doesn't cause corruption (JPEG setting causes pictures to get blurry artifacts and pixelization).
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">PS. I think you know this, but for the benefit of future visitors I want to clarify that prior to Windows 8, there was no way to automatically save a screenshot as a file when you pressed a key combination.&nbsp; It simply copied it to
 the clipboard, ready to paste somewhere else, and has no "file type" set.&nbsp; If you go to a plain Windows XP computer and press Alt+PrintScreen, no JPEG file will be created at all (you have to go paste it somewhere, then save it). &nbsp;If you were seeing a JPEG
 get automatically created when you pressed those keys, you must have had some extra program to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PPS.&nbsp;I tested it out in a virtual machine, and&nbsp;moving the mspaint.exe from an XP computer to&nbsp;Windows 7 runs, it appears to default to a save of "24-bit Bitmap" option.&nbsp; Technically this is against the licensing terms of use to transfer part of Windows.</p>

            <p>Interestingly enough, the guides say the Vista version defaults to JPEG, and since</p>
<p>my system is still set up as a dual-boot with Vista, I thought I could just create a shortcut that said "Vista Paint" to use.
</p>
<p>However opening the version in \Windows\system32\mspaint.exe on the the Vista partition does NOT work with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open it just fine, make some scribbles with the various tools, but the Save As... did not do anything, and the X button doesn't do anything either. I had to terminate it with Task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's weird. Most dialog box options work, but New, Open, Save, Save As..., and Exit do nothing. Nor does the X box, but the restore, maximize, and minimize buttons work just fine. It seems ONLy the New, Open, Save, Save As..., Exit buttons don't work, nor
 does the X button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find how the heck I configured XP to default to JPEG format either. Maybe the webpage I used is gone, but all the results are for 7 or 8 even though I put in "change default save format to jpeg mspaint XP" into Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like I can't figure out how I made it so that my limited account can access the C$ and d$ administrator shares on my Windows98SE/Windows XP machine from my Windows Vista/7 computer, it seems that people have taken down those great tips because they
 are obsolete.</p>

            Hi ILIKETORTULZ.
<br />
<br />This issue occurs if the Net BIOS under TCP/IP is enabled. Let's try to disable it by following these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Go to Control Panel, then click Network and Sharing Center (or simply right click on the Connection icon on your task bar, and click Open Network and sharing Center)
<br />
<br />2. On the right pane, click Change adapter settings.
<br />
<br />3. Right click your network adapter and select Properties.
<br />
<br />4. Highlight Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IP) and choose Properties,
<br />
<br />5. Click Advanced... button on the lower part of the window.
<br />
<br />6. Next, go to the WINS tab, and in NetBIOS Settings section select Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
<br />
<br />7. Click OK and restart the PC (Important).

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When did the problem start?   If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />  If this is Fall Creators Update Version 1709, which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About, you can also roll it back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide it using the same tool above until it matures.  
<br />
<br />Update the network, chipset and BIOS from the PC or devices' Support Downloads web page.

    <title>Dissapointed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dissapointed</h2>
                    <p>My husband was gifted a Microsoft Surace Pro 5th Generation&nbsp;last year with extended warranty.
<strong>One month</strong> after the warranty expires, the device locks on the Windows screen out of the blue. &nbsp;We promptly took it into the Microsoft store and were told it just needed to be reset at no cost.&nbsp;Two days later, phonecall comes in stating it was
 a "hardware issue" that cannot be fixed. We had two options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Just keep it and have an <strong>unusable</strong> device.</p>
<p>2. Pay $485.00 dollars to receive another Microsoft Surface Pro 5th Generation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of those options are not acceptable in my eyes. It's one month from the expiration of the warranty for something that clearly wasn't at any fault of our own. It froze to the Windows screen out of nowhere while just simply browsing Facebook. The technician
 stated the hard drive was bad after further inquiry on what he meant by "hardware issue." He stated it could have been a bad motherboard issue, etc. The staff was courteous, however, we will never purchase a&nbsp; Microsoft product again. Unacceptable to ask for
 an additional 485.00 after ONE year of use, for what is now an expensive paperweight.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also stated these could not be fixed because they are impossible to take apart. Why are you manufacturing devices that cannot be serviced?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there is no where listed on this site to email or call Microsoft directly.

<h2>            Updating to Windows 10 Creators Update from Anniversary Update fails using the Update Assistant at 71&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I am currently using Windows 10 Anniversary Update. I downloaded Windows 10 Update Assistant to update to Creators Update.
</p>
<p>When I run the tool, the tool downloads (step1) the update successfully but FAILS in the installation step at 71% and restarts from step 1&nbsp;- and ends up in a loop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: </p>
<p>1. I have tried disabling antivirus&nbsp;- no effect. </p>
<p>2. Tried running windows update and then ran the tool - no effect. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an extract from the log updater_default.log file. </p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm also receiving this kind of problem. And Yes I have McAfee Livesafe installed on my system. It did update to the anniversary edition with No Problem with McAfee in tacked, but maybe I should try and uninstall it???&nbsp;did you leave Defender running???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hi&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre Da Costa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank-You for replying. I will definitely remove all of McAfee LiveSafe before I try and run the Upgrade Assistant again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
