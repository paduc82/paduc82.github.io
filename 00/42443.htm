<h2>            Windows error code starting 0x0 &#40;lots of 0s here&#41; ending with 14007FBAB</h2>
                    <p>I've been receiving an error code at logout that flashes too quickly to write the whole thing down. &nbsp;It starts with 0x0 then there's at least 10+ zeros before this ending "14007FBAB". &nbsp;I have my laptop set to show error codes on the start up screen, but
 it doesn't show up on login. &nbsp;I've made my notifications last longer but it is not long enough to get the right # of 0s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what this error is? &nbsp;Better yet, does anyone know how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hello Christy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me a few hours to finally get mine up and running, what a nightmare and I tried so many things not really sure what fixed it. Downloading a recover disk on a memory stick from my working computer started me in the correct direction. That is what
 finally gave me a screen with repair, reset, and additional options. I tried the Start up repair and received the same message you did, also tried going to previous builds, starting points and whatever other options were available and got to the point where
 I didn't care about recovering my files. I believe what helped me was I had a back up hard drive I could connect to a usb port and tried doing an image copy (Called something like that), but ended up doing a reset I believe it was called that would save personal
 files but I lost some programs like my office 365 and that process it a while and woke up middle of the night and it was successful, haven't had a chance to look at it yet today to see what all is there still. But I did keep trying several of the options until
 it finally took.&nbsp; Note: The reset option(not sure that is even the correct term but close I believe) wasn't even one of the original options that I noticed at first, it seem like all of a sudden that became an option and I tried it, it probably was hidden
 somewhere I didn't notice right away. More of a hack here and been a long time since I've had to mess with a computer system that deep. Just home from work and I need a beer just thinking about this night from a damn system update (Windows 10) free upgrade
 I had for the ASUS.&nbsp; Hope it helps somewhat, I also googled different questions and searched this community thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Best of Luck!!&nbsp; Tim</p>

    <title>Find and Replace in FOLDER names&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> canvasshoes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Find and Replace in FOLDER names&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there any sort of tool within Windows that allows you to do a find and replace on Folder names?&nbsp; That is, similar to the way you do it in Excel and Word?&nbsp; I have several thousand files which contain (just for example and to keep it anonymous).</p>
<p>
</p><p>303_Work Station_12345_ACME27</p>
<p>304_Work Station_12346_ACME27</p>
<p>305_Work Station_12347_ACME27</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to remove all of the _ACME27s from the Folder names, and leave the rest alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as I said, there are several THOUSAND of these folders that have ACME27 as part of their filename.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot use any third party software (or believe me, I would, as MS seems to never think of these things), no downloads of that sort are allowed at my company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw an earlier thread on this, but the person answering didn't actually provide name changes within the Folders, and never came back and answered the original poster, though that person tried several times to get better information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>There's no automatic thing like that, but you can definitely accomplish it by writing a few commands at the command prompt (batch file) or PowerShell.&nbsp; I&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=powershell+batch+rename+folders&amp;src=IE-TopResult&amp;FORM=IETR02&amp;conversationid=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ran
 this search</a> and found some great info about it.&nbsp; Including <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/scriptcenter/en-US/d570eb73-8a4b-424e-91ad-6bca9120d889/batch-rename-folders?forum=ITCG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
batch rename folders here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's also another way that I've used myself. It's definitely the lazy way, and most programmers or experienced PowerShell users would likely shake their head at me, but here's how I did it.</p>
<ol>
<li>I <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/how-do-i-get-a-list-of-jpeg-file-titles-on-the/183553d5-50d6-4062-a276-a8b28301debd">
ran these commands</a> to copy a list of all folder names into Excel in column A.<br />
<br />
</li><li>In column B, I used a formula to write out a rename command for each row.&nbsp; So at this point, I have something like this.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c1ba191-4b11-4e28-bcb6-e320f691f162" /><br />
<br />
</li><li>Now every line in column B is a command to rename the folder in column B (replacing ACME27 with ""&nbsp;as a blank).<br />
<br />
</li><li>Copy everything in column B, paste it into notepad.&nbsp; Save it as a .bat batch file and double-click it.&nbsp; Command prompt will run every command and rename all your folders quickly.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Again, not the most "awesome code solution", but it gets the job done quickly. And that's what it's all about right?</p>

            <p>I like the belt and braces approach....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like its flexibility. &nbsp; I am going to use the technique to create a set of folders with a standard structure for my lesson plans using Mkdir</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I'll get a directory stem by copying the path name from the regular &nbsp;file manager window</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I'll create a column with lesson numbers e.g. L1, L2, L3</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I'll get a document with the list of of my lesson topic headings and paste it into another column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I'll construct the folder name &nbsp;as a combo of the columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for each lesson I will need 4 folders:</p>
<p>Powerpoint</p>
<p>Printing</p>
<p>Sources</p>
<p>Backup</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I'll add the necessary commands &nbsp;pre-pending the "Mkdir " in separate columns.</p>

<p>But, VernierSlake's earlier post is correct. It's possible the Gamertag name you are wanting is already in use as a Zune Tag or a Gamertag for Games for Windows-LIVE.</p>

<h2>            Cannot Activate Windows 8 - Product Key Blocked</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a relatively new HP Envy TS 15 Notebook which initially came with Windows 8 pre-installed.&nbsp; While performing regular Windows Updates, I noticed that there was a prompt to install Windows 8.1, so I went ahead with it.&nbsp; After the install, I just didn't
 like the way 8.1&nbsp;was running&nbsp;so I decided to reformat (using Recovery Manager with HP) because I couldn't revert back to Windows 8.&nbsp; Since reformatting, my laptop keeps asking me to activate Windows 8 and my product key is blocked every time I try to enter
 it.&nbsp; I paid over $1,000 for this laptop so to have a blocked product key show up constantly is pretty frustrating.&nbsp; I've had other laptops before and any time I performed a reformat on it, I never had a problem.&nbsp; This must be a new Windows 8 feature or something
 but I would like to get this resolved because I am entitled to keep my product key.&nbsp; I have proof of purchase and also have my serial/product/PCID numbers all handy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am only using one laptop and would like to know what I can/should do to resolve this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            I did the same thing, reformatted to factory settings and default using recovery to Windows 8 from 8.1. When I called Microsoft, they told me my Product has been blocked also, but due to excessive usage of the product key (even though I only reformatted
 it once) so they refused to let me use that key. They informed me to contact HP to provide a new key since they are the ones who paid for the key and "injected" them into their computer through the BIOS and Microsoft cannot provide me with a key because I
 did not buy from them directly. I've been on the phone with both companies back and forth, but it comes down to HP needing to fix that issue I guess. If Andre's method did not work for you, try calling HP Support to see if they can provide you a new key without
 returning your computer. They are sending me a new restore flash drive to reinstall windows 8 which i presume has new key on it. Good luck!

</p><p>My staff at my University want to use visual studio 2015 community with visual C++ .&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>All of our users are either academic research or non-enterprise as described in section 1.b.</span></p>
<p><span>They are concern that whether the visual C++ components which are not installed by default belong to the
</span></p>
<p><span>section 2(d) Developer Resources as:</span></p>
<strong>Licenses for other components.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developer resources.</strong>&nbsp;The software includes compilers, languages, runtimes, environments, and other resources. These components may be governed by separate agreements and have their own product
 support policies. A list of these other components is located at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx</a>.</li></ul>
<p><span>In short we want to know if our users belong to section 1.b then can they install and use visual C++ components freely as using visual studio 2015 community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards</span></p>

<p>Hey,</p>

            Usually the area code is automatically chosen in a drop-down menu, is that the case?
<br />Are you entering the phone number without the first digit - usually a 0?
<br />01234567 you should enter 1234567.

<h2>            my computer keeps trying to read my disc drive</h2>
                    i recently bought my computer with windows 7 installed.&nbsp; when i have a disc in my disc drive every minute, literally, my disc drive spins up for about 15 secs and i can hear it trying to read the disc when i am not using it.&nbsp; it happens for software, games
 and dvd's.&nbsp; the disc drive works fine, i just don't want to hear it spin up every minute.&nbsp; i contacted dell support and they told me it was the functionality of my operating system.&nbsp; personally it sounds like ____ to me because never before in my 28 yrs of
 using a computer has this happened before.&nbsp; does anyone know anything about this?

<p><span>Hey nfiumara82,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Under normal circumstance DVD drive shouldn’t spin like you described.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are few instances wherein Dell DataSafe caused constant access to the drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Say for instance:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/forums/t/19313262.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://en.community.dell.com/forums/t/19313262.aspx</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To determine if this is the case with your computer, stop the service that runs the software or disable the software temporarily and verify the behavior.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There could be other instances where antivirus software or other services running at the background leads to constant optical drive access.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Put your system in clean boot state and monitor the behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer this article for detailed information on how to do this.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<h3> regsiler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failure to install device driver for iPhone on Windows 7 - computer doesn&#39;t recognize iPhone is plugged in</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 and suddenly my iPhone 3G will not sync with my laptop.&nbsp; The computer has stopped recognizing the phone being plugged in at all, yet it is recognized in iTunes.&nbsp; When I plug the phone in it gives me the message...device driver failed to
 install.&nbsp; I realize it's a compatibility issue and have searched through the forums and been on the phone with Apple support for FOUR hours and nothing has worked.&nbsp; They even sent a new phone and it still doesn't work.&nbsp; HOW do I find the driver that needs
 to be updated?&nbsp; I've checked under device manager under the Universal Bus Port and it says the Apple driver is up to date.&nbsp; It will occasionally let me sync my contacts and&nbsp;calendar with errors...but no music, photos, ringtones, etc.&nbsp; Please help...I've wasted
 tons of time on this!!

<p>Hi regsiler,</p>
<p>I suggest&nbsp;opening&nbsp;the Device Manager and in the View tab, click Show hidden devices. Remove any instances of the device, then restart.</p>
<p>Does the phone start to change when connected to the computer?</p>

 is permanently resolving the issue. This is the case in several different locations. Home and work . Dirving me insane, especially if i am midway editing a sharepoint doc&nbsp;

<h2>            Does Windows 8 support the ASUS P5GC-MX&#47;1333 motherboard&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to update the driver for my ASUS P5GC-MX/1333 motherboard because "update your motherboard driver" is one of the options available for repairing a problem I have with my gaming experience.<br />
<br />
When I play World of Warcraft, my game drops and I receive a message from the Action Center that says "The video driver stopped functioning and has repaired itself." (Something very similar to that, anyway.) It's been happening more and more recently.<br />
<br />
I installed a new hard drive and upgraded to Windows 8 about 2 months ago. I had the problem intermittently until a few days ago. Now the problem surfaces quite often, sometimes to the point where my game drops, I wait, it comes back and then drops immediately
 again, and again, and again.<br />
<br />
My video card driver is up to date. I know that.<br />
<br />
I've been searching for the driver for my motherboard -- ASUS P5GC-MX/1333 -- but it appears there are only drivers available for Vista and Windows 7. (I upgraded from XP to Windows 8).<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any advice you have.<br />

<p>Put my brand new nba2k15 xb1 disk into console, installed and tried to play. Once clicked at the game, it refused to load and says error code 800706f4. (Now I can memorize it). Checked on the forum that there are people having this same issue and no official
 solution other than trying your luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>please advise me what should I do here....</p>
<p>I mi bought my Xbox one two months ago and I can't believe this is my second time desperately asking for help here....the first time was the August update thanks to which that our console won't load any game disk that we had to ship back and exchange. I
 bought the console mainly to play nba2k and now I got this again... Not the same problem but just another new issue that prevent it from loading a game. the hell man, Microsoft you really

<p>To resolve this issue please follow these steps for Xbox One users</p>
<p>1) Disconnect from network</p>
<p>2) Hold power button 10-15 seconds.</p>
<p>3) Unplug everything from the back of the console.</p>
<p>4) Separate the pieces of the power supply</p>
<p>5) Wait for LED (Orange / White) on PSU to no longer be illuminated</p>
<p>6) Wait 1 minutes time</p>
<p>7) Plug in console</p>
<p>8) Once powered on go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Clear local save data</p>
<p>9) When console has restarted reconnect to network for digital versions so that it allows you to verify licensing for that gamertag / console.</p>
<p>Once loaded you should be able to access full game with no further issues.</p>

            I'm using Windows Live<br />
<br />
Server is methownet.com<br />
<br />
Don't know my limit but I confirmed with methownet that there was ample space. This is a small (-500) rural community where personal assistance is the norm.<br />
<br />
I thought the problem might be with the senders' server but the three latest bounced messages were from different sources - metrocast.net, methow.com and earthlink.net<br />
<br />
This problem has been occurring off and on for a year or so - possibly since I switched from XP to Windows 7.&nbsp; I don't have a bounced message but in the past relayed one to my server and that did not help them finding any problem from our end.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>When people get a bounced message when they send you mail, the message is coming from either their ISP, yours, or possibly a relay in-between ISPs. Windows Live Mail does not have the capacity to bounce a message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this happen all the time for some senders? What happens if you send them a message and they
<strong>Reply</strong> to it. Do you get that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you leaving messages on the server? Is there any message there that has not downloaded? A corrupt or very large message in the server's Inbox could be blocking newer messages from downloading to WLMail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without the bounce message, one can only guess at what the problem is.</p>

            It does not happen all the time for any sender.<br />
<br />
Often times when they <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply</span> to me I do not get the message<br />
<br />
I don't leave messages on the server and there are no messages not downloaded.<br />
<br />
Just as I say that I realize I often do not open messages that I know are junk and put them in the deleted or junk file. Could that be part of the problem?&nbsp; I empty both files on a pretty regular basis.<br />
<br />
I'll see if anyone still has the bounce message.<br />

            <p>I can't see how this is an issue with Windows Live Mail then. You can download another e-mail client like Thunderbird and run the two programs side by side to see if the issue is present in both. Just make sure they are both set to leave a copy of messages
 on the server for X days so messages can be downloaded to both programs.</p>

            <p>This being a Microsoft device (surface pro 3) that I am maybe errently assuming receives all of it's updates from Microsoft, do I still follow this same course of action?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. &nbsp;I am used to building my own machines and am comfortable with the process you prescribed. &nbsp;Having my tablet PC that is branded by the "mother ship" with no replaceable internals, I have been a little more cautious. &nbsp;Will start mavking through
 your suggested course of action and see how far I can get.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you managed to resolve this issue? We're seeing the same thing but a different model of DL dock and saw the KB on the DL explaining the USB 3.0 fault but for some reason it doesn't seem right.</p>

The same issue here and I do not have a USB 3 cable! &nbsp;Al I want is sound and after taking the upgrade route my sound has disappeared and I have tried all ways to recover it but no joy. &nbsp;Back to Windows 7 I think!

            <p style="text-align: justify">Well, this issue is caused by problematic USB 3.0 driver in Windows and it is found that using USB 2.0 cable to connect the docking station to the PC help to fix the issue. USB 2.0 port can be used instead of USB 2.0 cable.</p>
