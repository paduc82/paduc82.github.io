<h2>            Windows Update KB3035583 download&#47;installed successfully but being told &#34;it hasn&#39;t run&#47;ran yet&#34; by trouble shooter</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>For reference I use windows 7 pro, 32bit and have Norton Internet Security
<br />
<br />
I have&nbsp;</span>KB3035583<span> update successfully installed and according to my computer/windows, and I know its in relation to windows 10 upgrade/app?
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>I ran Windows Trouble shooter? to see if I have everything for the free upgrade and it informed me that KB3035583, which is for the app which does not appear in my tool bar; which IS already installed on my computer, HAS NOT&nbsp; Run/Ran.&nbsp; I did what
 it told me "reboot, wait a couple of hours...retry" same thing.&nbsp; Don't know what to do or if I need to do anything.&nbsp; In my update history I see that W10 keeps trying to download/install un-successfully.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Try running this Windows troubleshooter to resolve the issue. <br />

</p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>How did you get your KB303558 to run? <br />
<br />
Did you have to reinstall it if so how?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm in no rush to get windows 10, but I just want things to work properly.&nbsp; Also when I do download install, should I download the new program to a USB stick or directly onto my computer as I might want to go back to 7pro&nbsp;

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The clean boot process worked however now my Ipod is not actually showing up in itunes even though it is showing up in Windows. This is apparently also a known issue. I cannot format it or anything. Any advice?</p>
<p>It's an Ipod Classic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            KB3206632 causes STOP CODE BAD POOL HEADER on reboot</h2>
                    <p>KB3206632 causes STOP CODE BAD POOL HEADER on reboot after it installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through the Advanced Repair Menu I was able to restore the PC to the time just prior to the time KB3206632 was installed and the PC booted fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon shut down KB3206632 installed itself once again and I was back to a crash on restart with the same STOP CODE BAD POOL HEADER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeated this 5 times with exactly the same results. KB3206632 installs PC boots to STOP CODE BAD POOL HEADER. Take out KB3206632 &nbsp;via the restore point, PC boots and runs perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a fix fast or my PC is toast.</p>

            <p>Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping with this but at first I &nbsp;couldn't comply because I can't get past the blue screen with the BAD POOL HEADER.</p>
<p>Finally did a restore to an older date and I did defer the updates but Win 10 ignores it and installs the update on every reboot.</p>
<p>After the restore I can get it to reboot and even though updates are defered we chase our tail in and endless circle.</p>
<p>There are a few oddities that I think are adding to this mess. After the restore to an earlier date when I check the updates it tells me the problem update was already installed sucessfuly a few days prior.</p>
<p>Win 1O Pro by the way also keeps trying to install a new nvidia driver 342.00 when I &nbsp;already have the newer 342.01 inastalled. It also installs the older driver regardless of the deferred updates being checked. So it looks like I'm getting beat up by Win
 10 ignoring the defer updates, the bad security update as well as forcing an older nvidia driver down my throat.</p>
<p>Ran the minidump and there isn't a single entry.</p>
<p>So I &nbsp;can't provide that to your either.</p>
<p>So right now I &nbsp;do a restore to an earlier date use my PC. Shut down for the night. Reboot the next day into the BLUE SCREEN BAD POOL HEADER, restore it to an older date by clinking F8 to get into the Advanced menu, workforce the day and repeat the same
 scenario day after day unable to prevent Win 10 Pro from reinstalling the errant updates with each restart.</p>

            <p>Just received this I'll from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Not going to try it until I have all all my Christmas photos uploaded the my three harddrives and know they're safe.</p>
<p>Not worth trouble of multiple system restores when I have work to do.</p>
<p>Because this still doesn't deal with the issue of Win 10 is installing nVidia driver 342.00 over the latest 342.01 that I have installed and you can't prevent it.</p>
<p>Here is the response supposedly dealing with the cumulative update at least:</p>

<p>I &nbsp;don't want anyone other than myself installing video drivers for me because I'm always ahead of MS on that. Worse yet you install an older driver over the latest one causing more problems problems.</p>

            Hi Robbie,<br />
<br />
A surface is automatically closing an app after they have not been used for awhile.but there are some reasons you might want to manually go back in and close them yourself. To do so, you may follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: Dragging the app window down from the top of the screen</strong><br />
<br />
• In tablet mode, apps run fullscreen so you don't get the "X" in the top right-hand corner you might usually use to close it. To do it, simply drag your finger from the top of the screen down to the bottom. Halfway the app window will shrink right down, just
 keep dragging until an animation pulls it off the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: Through Task Manager</strong><br />
<br />
• Firstly, you'll need to open up the Windows Task Manager by pressing CTRL + ALT + DELETE. From there, simply find your unresponsive program, right-click and select Go To Progress (not End Task). The Processes tab will open and your program should be highlighted.
 Now, press the End Process button and select Yes.<br />
<br />
Let us know if the above resolution answers your query.

<p>Thanks indeed. But all Dell drivers etc are updated and I regularly use support assist. The only possible problem is the Intel Graphics driver Win 64 because Dell does not allow me to install the latest version from the Intel site. Hope the computer does
 not lock up again before you get this. Updating the bios would certainly provoke lockup.</p>

Thanks E for Excel. I had already updated mouse and keyboard drivers. The problem seems to be that Windows 10 has trouble with a graphics card. But because investigations also disclosed trouble with the computer fan, the computer has to go back to Dell for
 repair.

<p>BIOS fortunately was up-to-date. In the meantime I had trouble with the computer fan so the computer has anyway to go back to Dell and they will presumably check the video card drivers. Logitech brought out new drivers too. drivers are very annoying things
 but vitally important. </p>

<p>Actually your reply would have been very helpful but Logitech the next day possibly solved the software problem by updating drivers and setpoint. Apart from the fan, the mouse and keyboard did not lock up yesterday.</p>

            Hello kwamectc,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine which files could not be repaired by the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. </li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>findstr /C:"[SR] Cannot repair member file" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt</span></div>
<strong>Note</strong> The Sfcdetails.txt file contains details from every time that the System File Checker tool has been run on the computer. The file includes information about files that were not repaired by the System File Checker tool. Verify the date
 and time entries to determine the problem files that were found the last time that you ran the System File Checker tool.
</li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>edit sfcdetails.txt</span></div>
The Sfcdetails.txt file uses the following format:
<div>Date/Time SFC detail<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To fix/replace follow steps below:</div>
</li></ol>
<ol>
<li>At an elevated command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>takeown /f Path_And_File_Name</span></div>
For example, type <span>takeown /f E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll</span>.
</li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER to grant administrators full access to the file:
<div><span>icacls Path_And_File_Name /GRANT ADMINISTRATORS:F</span></div>
For example, type <span>icacls E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll /grant administrators:F</span>.
</li><li>Type the following command to replace the file with a known good copy of the file:
<div><span>Copy Path_And_File_Name_Of_Source_File Path_And_File_Name_Of_Destination</span></div>
For example, type <span>copy E:\temp\jscript.dll E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll</span>.
</li></ol>
<p><br />
<br />
Since you have already did a scan find the file manually and replace it with the correct one. You can copy and post your log here too. Let us know either way if you need further assistance. Make it a great day!<br />

<h2>            Patching Visual Runtime Library C&#43;&#43; Error message</h2>
                    I have been having an issue with runtime errors when I try to install a simple game (Fishdom).&nbsp; Someone on this forum recommended I reinstall the Visual C++ Runtime Library and provided the following link:<br />
<br />

<p><b><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84</span></a></span></b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>I down</span><span>loaded it but when I tried to install it I received the following error message:</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><i><span>Repair did not succeed.</span></i></p>

Microsoft Visual C++ 2010&nbsp; x86&nbsp; Redistributable&nbsp; 10.0.30319</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Of course the REAL problem is the runtime error I get when I try to install Fishdom.&nbsp; (I get the "program asked to terminate in unusual way" message.)&nbsp; SO, could I have another problem -- not the C++ Library at all?&nbsp; Or should I be upgrading to 2012?&nbsp; Playrix
 has been no help at all in figuring this out.</p>

            Thank you so much for your help.<br />
<br />
When I went to add/remove programs and tried to remove Microsoft Visual C++ 2010&nbsp; x86&nbsp; Redistributable&nbsp; 10.0.30319, I got the error message:<br />
<br />
<i><span>This patch package could not be opened.&nbsp; Verify that the patch package exists and that you can access it, or contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer patch package.<br />
<br />
</span></i><span>I tried it twice.</span><i><span><br />
<br />
</span></i><span>I had already downloaded (but not run) the new version.&nbsp; Could that be preventing the deletion of the old one?<br />

<h2>            Xbox one doesn&#39;t see my wireless network</h2>
                    <p>My Xbox one doesn't see my wireless network. It didn't connect to my network the last time turned it on despite having the correct settings. I removed the network and attempted to bed it back but there are no networks listed when the Xbox looks for them. Even if I manually add the SSID it doesn't find it. Wired works but I don't have a spare wired connection to use.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The topic I chose is random because none of the listed ones fitted my problem. I'm using a Talk Talk router which I believe is manufactured by Huawei</p>

<p>Hello, thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I think it could be my hard drive or Windows 7.&nbsp; I have a Dell Inspiron 1750.&nbsp; It's 9 years old.&nbsp; I works well apart from not allowing certain programs to open such as Norton and all Microsoft updates have failed over the past
 few months so nothing is updating. Norton Support gave me the diagnosis and told me to contact Microsoft.&nbsp; A friend suggested I re-install my Windows 7 from the original disc.&nbsp; I am a complete novice at this so would really appreciate any advice.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Statistically speaking, it is a wonder your laptop hard drive even works at all at its age.&nbsp; Yes you need&nbsp; to re-install Windows, but do not waste your time doing it on a drive that is likely already beginning to fail.&nbsp; They are not that expensive or difficult

You should read this discussion first to decide how you will deal with the Windows Update mess:
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/windows-7-updating-in-2018/291a9582-17a7-4942-8145-8d9f68265189?messageId=2f46cef5-da27-431d-8c6f-b5e7b2b89246">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/windows-7-updating-in-2018/291a9582-17a7-4942-8145-8d9f68265189?messageId=2f46cef5-da27-431d-8c6f-b5e7b2b89246</a></p>
New Hard Drive
<div style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<ol>
<li>
The hard drive&nbsp;has failed.&nbsp; You will have to replace it.&nbsp; Replace with a 500 G or more rotating 7200rpm drive.&nbsp; 500G drives can be found for around $70.&nbsp; Typically quite easy to replace.&nbsp; Now you will need a complete Windows 7 install.</li><li>
I do this all the time.&nbsp; I have done hundreds.&nbsp; This is likely to take an elapsed time of around 12 hours.</li><li>
First go to your computer’s OEM support site and find and download the drivers for your computer and store them on a USB stick.</li><li>
From this point onward, I am providing you with the process to install Windows 7.</li><li>
You&nbsp;<strong>may&nbsp;</strong>be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the failing&nbsp;hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC,
 copy the data off.&nbsp; You may need a friend to do this part for you, but the rest is not really very technical or difficult for most people.</li><li>
Install the new hard drive.</li><li>
Do not do any formatting or partitioning.</li><li>
If you made a set of disks for recovery or an image copy&nbsp;at the time your computer was new.&nbsp; This is the time you need them.</li><li>
Start your computer on the first of the disks as instructed and in an hour or so, your computer will look exactly as it did then.</li><li>
If you do not have that set of disks. You will need a legal reusable&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Product&nbsp;Key.&nbsp; You will need a Windows 7 install disk. The win7 disk must match the edition of your product key, and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows
 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; Hopefully, the disk you use will be labeled SP1 (Service Pack 1), because that will save you an additional 4 hours or so.</li><li>
Place the Windows 7 install disk in the disk reader and start your computer.</li><li>
Once the install process is started, choose CUSTOM.&nbsp; Ignore the check box about drivers, unless you can not proceed further.</li><li>
If this is not a brand new hard drive, when you get to the place where it asks you where to put the installation, click Advanced and delete all partitions.</li><li>
When the installer asks about Windows update, choose Ask me later</li><li>
Reset Windows Update setting to Never….</li><li>
<strong>Do NOT install any program</strong></li><li>
Hopefully, you started with a Win7 install disk that was SP1 (Service Pack 1). If not, run Windows Update until you get to the point that SP1 has installed itself as part of this procedure.&nbsp; It entails multiple Windows Update passes and restarts&nbsp;which you keep
 updating until you get there.</li><li>
Once Windows 7 SP1 is installed, install the following:</li><li>

Open Windows Update, change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates</li><li>
<strong>Do not install anything else at this point – NOTHING.&nbsp; Not even an antivirus program</strong></li><li>
Start&nbsp;the update process.&nbsp; It is likely to include about 200. It will take some time.</li><li>
Install all offered security updates.&nbsp; Install .net, but do not install any updates that do not come pre-checked.&nbsp; Do not install any “Optional” updates.</li><li>
Once you have a list of updates, you need to prevent certain specific updates from being installed to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.</li><li>
Click once on each Windows Update that is NOT labeled SECURITY and check the date of issue on the right.&nbsp; If that date is after January 1, 2015, Right-click on it and hide.</li><li>
Click install updates and wait for it to finish.&nbsp; Restart when asked to do so.</li><li>
After re-start is complete and you see a desktop, start Task manager – Right-click on task bar. Look at the % at the bottom.&nbsp; Do NOT attempt to use the computer for any purpose until you see that % fall to and stay at 10% or less.&nbsp; Windows Update is still working
 and has a lot of work to do.</li><li>
Keep running Windows Update again and again till it offers no new ones.</li><li>
Start Internet Explorer, click the gear (upper right)&nbsp;in IE11 and select Compatibility settings and enter&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft.com</strong>&nbsp;in the list</li><li>
Reset Windows Update to Never….</li><li>
Start Windows Update and click the link to include updates for other Microsoft software.</li><li>
Run Windows Update again and again until you are satisfied you have all the updates you want.</li><li>
After the install is complete, check Device Manager. Type&nbsp;<strong>device</strong>&nbsp;in the text box above the start globe when you click it and choose Device manager
 from the list&nbsp;to find out if Win7 was able to supply the drivers you need.&nbsp; You should get drivers only from the maker of your computer or Intel.&nbsp; Its best to get all the drivers at this point.&nbsp; Win7 install may have installed all of them or nearly. Do NOT
 use any of those driver download sites.&nbsp; They are all bogus, have bad drivers, and install malware.</li><li>
Install your Microsoft Office software and then run Windows Update again and again till no more are proposed.</li><li>
Defragment your drive.&nbsp; Type&nbsp;<strong>defragment</strong>&nbsp;in the text box above the start globe when you click it once.&nbsp; Choose the Defragmentation link.&nbsp; Wait till
 it completes all passes..</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><em>New
 install tip:</em></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and&nbsp;<strong><em>before</em></strong>&nbsp;any
 (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at this point.&nbsp; You can
 restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time, and you will have saved yourself all the
 time you put in this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

<h2>            Marvel Avengers Battle For Earth Travando</h2>
                    
<p>Fala galera! Estou postando um problema aqui na esperança de conseguir um help de alguém que já tenha tido este tipo de problema com este ou outro jogo qualquer.</p>
<p>Comprei o Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth Kinect na marketplace já a algum tempo e quando foi comprado ele funcionou normal sem nenhum problema. Fiquei um bom tempo sem jogá-lo e esses dias quando fui tentar jogá-lo novamente ele trava/congela todo o Xbox
 após alguns segundos iniciados, ainda no menu principal do jogo. Só enfiando o dedão na console para desligar.</p>
<p>Alguns testes que já fiz:</p>
<p>- Apaguei o jogo e a DLC de personagens e baixei tudo de novo.<br />
- Ele estava armazenado no HD interno do Xbox. Baixei para um HD externo USB.<br />
- Entrei no jogo com outro perfil Silver que tenho no Xbox.<br />
- Nenhum outro jogo instalado (mais de 60) apresenta este problema.<br />
- Nenhum outro jogo do Kinect apresenta este problema. Kinect funciona normal.<br />
- Este foi o último jogo que comprei no marketplace, depois dele só os Games with Gold.<br />
- Minha conta é BR e semprei foi. Nunca foi migrada.<br />
<br />
Rapaziada, qualquer idéia ou sugestão é bem vinda. Ainda não cheguei a entrar em contato com o suporte técnico porque, de repente pode ser algo simples de resolver e que eu não tenho conhecimento. Se alguém já tiver passado por isso, mesmo que com outro jogo,
 por favor me dê uma luz.</p>
<p>Valeu!</p>

<p>Paloo, abri um ticket no suporte técnico da Ubisoft mas ainda estou aguardando respostas. Qualquer novidade eu posto aqui.</p>
<p>Ainda não encontrei uma solução na internet, somente mais usuários com o mesmo problema. Entretanto, após realizar diversas tentativas descobri uma coisa:</p>
<p>Tenho duas contas no Xbox, a minha e a da minha esposa. As duas contas já tinham jogado o jogo antes dele dar esse problema, ou seja, antes de outubro de 2015 (quando começou a dar problema para mim). Essas duas contas travam da mesma maneira.</p>
<p>Ao baixar uma terceira conta (não precisa ser Gold) mas uma conta que nunca tinha jogado o jogo no meu console, o jogo funcionou normalmente. Aí o que eu fazia: entrava com essa conta e depois que o jogo iniciava eu mudava para a minha conta principal sem
 desconectar a conta nova. Consegui até desbloquear algumas conquistas mas não consegui salvar o jogo na minha conta principal.</p>

<p>Olha a resposta ridícula que recebi do suporte da Ubisoft:</p>
<p>"Sua melhor opção neste momento é a de limpar o cache do disco rígido do Xbox 360. Isso irá limpar as atualizações do titulo no partir do sistema.
</p>
<p>1 Começando no painel do Xbox 360, pressione o botão guia da Xbox. </p>
<p>2 Escolha "Configurações do Sistema" na extrema-direita. </p>
<p>3 Selecione "Armazenamento". </p>
<p>4 Destaque o seu disco rígido e pressione "Y" para Opções do dispositivo. </p>
<p>5 Selecione "Clear System Cache". </p>
<p>Depois de fazer isso, tente iniciar o jogo novamente para ver se o problema persiste.
</p>
<p>Se você continuar a ter problemas, por favor, instale o disco do jogo para seu disco rígido usando os passos abaixo.
</p>
<p>1 Insira o disco do jogo na unidade. Uma vez inserido, telha destaque o jogo e pressione "X" para obter mais detalhes do jogo.
</p>
<p>2 Você deve ver uma opção "Instalar a unidade de disco rígido". </p>
<p>Em seguida, tente ajustar seu console configurações de exibição com os passos abaixo.
</p>
<p>1 Começando no painel do Xbox 360, pressione o botão guia da Xbox. </p>
<p>2 Vá até "Configurações do Sistema" de extrema-direita e escolher. </p>
<p>3 Escolha "Configurações do Console". </p>
<p>4 Escolha "Display". </p>
<p>5 Selecione "Configurações de HDTV". </p>
<p>6 Tente ajustar as configurações de vídeo até 720p e tente novamente. </p>
<p>Em alguns casos, você pode ter um disco de jogo ruim. Por favor, tente testar seu jogo em um segundo console para determinar se você tem os mesmos resultados.</p>
<p>Se você tem o mesmo problema em um segundo console, por favor, tente trocar o seu disco de jogo no varejista para uma nova cópia.</p>
<p>Por favor, deixe-nos saber se você tiver quaisquer outras questões."</p>
<p>É óbvio que eles nem se deram o trabalho de ler o que eu escrevi e mandaram eu fazer o que eu já disse que tinha feito.</p>

<p>dna heineken, sugiro abrir uma solicitação de suporte no site da Ubisoft informando o problema. Os caras me trataram como se o problema fosse o meu console e insistiam para eu verificar se meu disco não estava arranhado (apesar de informar um zilhão de vezes
 que tenho a cópia digital do jogo). Questionei a eles como se tenta limpar ou testar na console de um amigo um disco invisível!</p>
<p>Enfim, não resolveram meu problema, mas quem sabe se mais pessoas reportarem a eles esse problema eles realmente verifiquem o que está acontecendo e parem de botar a culpa nos consoles.</p>
<p>Boa sorte e qualquer coisa dá um alô pra gente aqui.</p>

 So the answer is: If you use such programs you will need it; and if you don't you don't, but I would imagine that any well written application that does need Adobe Air will advise you if you need to install it, just as they do if you need to install a particular

<p>I have the latest version of Adobe Air and the programs ran prior to the installation of WIN 10. That is why I am asking if the current version of Adobe Air is incompatible with WIN 10</p>

<p>I have the same problem, but only after a Windows 10 insider group update, and the latest insider update did not solve it.</p>
<p>Prior to those two upgrades, Icecast's Adobe Air app worked perfectly. Now it will only display title and artist but not play. Also, my Shoutcast streams no longer are playable by TuneIn. Even Shoutcast can only play one of the two streams.</p>
<p>I have completely deleted those programs and associated data, and reinstalled, but it did not help. Even the Shoutcast setup will not work in this build of Windows 10. Does anyone know what is going on?&nbsp;</p>

            I did an SFC scan and it found no integrity issues. I haven't been playing any games downloaded from the windows<br />
store recently.&nbsp; I am having issues with other programs freezing on me. When the error occurs I just have a black blank screen.

            <p><span>Hi Andrew,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for updating the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since <strong>SFC scan</strong> was not able to find any system file corruption, b</span><span>oot the computer in
<strong>Safe mode</strong> by following the steps from the link below and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Expand the options to boot into
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span> the PC to exit from
<strong>Safe mode</strong> and start the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To know more about
<strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on <strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)
</strong>(Applies to Windows 10 also)<strong>:</strong></span></p>

<strong>Windows 8.1</strong> applies to <strong>Windows 10</strong> also.</span></p>

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<h2>            Skype Number useage</h2>
                    If I get a US based 'SKYPE NUMBER',&nbsp; will SMS 'texts'&nbsp; to that number appear when I open up my Skype App,&nbsp; on my Mac computer or iPhone, using Wi Fi, wherever I am in the world?&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask this because various Banks ask to send a 'Security Code' text message

<h2>            Driver installation re HP Photosmart c 5180</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10 our printer an HP C5180 was working fine from the preview upgrade until two days ago. We went to scan a document and Windows and other programs did not see the scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is through USB and we even went and purchased a new USB cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We uninstalled and tried to reinstall the driver with no success for the last two days. Running as admin does not even work. It gets so far and throws errors. First it was this driver requires an interactive window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the most aggravating after it gets past the interactive window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is access is denied. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver is not being allowed to write where it has to go. What is the problem with this? We even went in and changed permissions MANUALLY throughout the main drive and STILL Access denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No this is not a virus or malware. All AV programs we have tried detect nothing.</p>
<p>

            I found an article on HP that states this printer has been discontinued.&nbsp; My question mine still works (mechanically) so is HP making it difficult to download updated drivers deliberately so we have to go buy another printer that won't last as long?&nbsp; I
 believe I purchased this one in the 90s.&nbsp; A product that has quality behind it.&nbsp; Yes the ink isn't cheap but I got my best photos from this printer and my money's worth.&nbsp; Now if the company would just produce a proper program so it will work again I'd be a
 very happy camper.&nbsp; Unfortunately they must be going for more money :-(.&nbsp; They must not want the praise and new customers I've sent their way.???

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am also getting this issue. I am using MDT 2012 to image a laptop with Windows 7.&nbsp; After I have imaged a Dell E7440 I get this error "Invalid Partition Table!"&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;My Boot Sequence is set to Legacy with 1) CD\DVD,&nbsp; 2)&nbsp;Internal HDD</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, If I go in the BIOS and switch from Legacy Boot option&nbsp;to UEFI, my laptop boots right up to Windows just fine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>why is that?</p>
        </p>

</p><p>I know this is a very old thread, but anyone doing a search on Internet for Invalid Partition Table! will come accross this posting as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I had this problem as well and found the solution on:</p>
<p>http://www.intowindows.com/install-windows-8-from-external-hard-drive/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think specifically the below section is very important..<br />
<br />
-<br />
Go to Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories. Right-click on Command Prompt entry and select Run as administrator option.<br />
<br />
In the Command Prompt, type-in the following commands and hit Enter key after typing each command.<br />
<br />
x:<br />
cd/boot<br />
bootsect x:<br />
<br />
(where “x” is your external hard drive’s drive letter)<br />
-<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently this bootsect&nbsp;&nbsp; command does the trick, at least with me.</p>
<p>Of course in BIOS you have to set the USB drive as 1st boot device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can recommend to follow the steps on that site.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

            <p>My solution (tested on Gigabyte GA-P965-s3, Award bios, Windows 10 installation):<br />
1. from Windows format your USB stick to FAT32 (default allocation size)<br />
2. paste your Windows 10 image in UltraISO, choose "USB-HDD+" as writing method<br />
Notice: I got Windows 10 image via Media Creation Tool wherein I chose exactly single bit edition (x64 in my case) instead of "both x64/x86 edition", thereby created ISO weighs less than 4gb so it doesn't create any problems for old motherboards<br />
3. after successful writing plug your USB stick into the rear usb port of your motherboard instead of usb port on front panel<br />
4. enter BIOS settings -&gt; Advanced BIOS settings -&gt; Hard disk boot priority, move USB-HDD to the top of the list, save changes<br />
5. exit bios, press F12 to enter list of boot sources, select "USB-HDD"<br />
6. after installation your PC will reboot automatically, after then go to bios settings -&gt; Hard disk boot priority, move your normal HDD to the top of list, save changes and exit bios, installation will be automatically continued from your normal HDD

            As the message says: The file might be damaged. Get a fresh copy and/or test it on a different machine. If still unsuccessful, remove, then re-install Adobe Acrobat Reader. If still unsuccessful, repost your query in an Outlook forum. The current forum
 deals with Windows Security which is not really related to Acrobat or to Outlook.<br />
