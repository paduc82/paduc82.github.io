<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Sorry, but once points expire they are not able to be added back. You are able to see when points are expiring (within 30 days) on the Microsoft Billing site
<strong><a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. They cannot be re-added once they expire.<br />
<br />
<strong>When do Microsoft Points expire?<br />
</strong><br />
Purchased points don't expire. Any points you get through promotions can have expiration dates. Typically, points expire within thirty days of the date you get them. To view any points in your account that have expiration dates,
<strong><a href="http://g.msn.com/0HE_TRACKSTAR_ENUS9/29016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">go to the Billing and Account Management page</a></strong>, sign in with your Windows Live ID, and then click
<strong>Microsoft Points</strong> under <strong>Stored Credits</strong>. If you have points that are expiring in the next thirty days, you can click
<strong>View expiring points</strong> to view the points and their expiration dates.</p>

<p>Thats a bummer had I known they would have expired I would have spent them. &nbsp;I was never notified when they were about to expire or was told that they would expire when I had obtained them. &nbsp;I assure you this would have made a difference on my holding on
 to them. &nbsp;I know they were "free" but it still hurts I assumed they were my points, my points which I had not spent on anything.</p>

<p>I can understand that, but they do indeed list that promotional points expire when you earn them on each and every promotion you participate in. It's in the fine print :(.</p>

<p>Hey sagtogi, I am sorry to hear about this, I'd feel the same way! So I can understand but unfortunately as Hassassinade has mentioned, when promotional points expire we cannot extend the expiration. In the future, make sure to note which points are promotional
 points so this won't happen again. :)</p>

<div><br />
Issues which affect IE also affect Windows Explorer as they are closely related so please use the<br />
methods below to try to solve this issue.<br />
<br />
Often BEX errors are caused by Toolbars such as Google, TrendMicro and others. Are you using any<br />
3rd party toolbars in IE? Cause and fix is same for Vista and Windows 7.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which causes issues).<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore&nbsp;Advanced Settings&nbsp;and then click<br />
RESET - APPLY /&nbsp;OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;- click Reset all zones - APPLY / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still<br />
installs it and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other<br />
possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right.<br />
Permitted are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about<br />
it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download, UnZip&nbsp;and run.<br />
Also not all BHO's are bad, some run toolbars and features you have added.<br />
<a href="http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php</span></a><br />
<br />
Startup Programs<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware&nbsp;UPDATE it and then run<br />
it as a scanner. <br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />

<p>The cause is the file <strong><span>hxmedpltfm.dll</span></strong>. From what I see, this file is part of
<strong>Real Player.</strong> So update to the newest version. If this doesn't work, remove the Real Player completely.</p>

<h2>            cng.sys driver missing error - windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have windows 8 running on a laptop but for as long as i can remember it always fail to do windows update - it will go through the whole windows update motion only to fail at the end and says windows update cannot be completed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I got the blue screen of error while booting up, and automatic repair doesn't work and just loops forever. I went online and tried to play around with command prompt - nothing really worked, but I did manage to disable the automatic repair, so
 now when I boot up, I get the blue screen saying:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery</p>
<p>Your PC needs to be repaired</p>
<p>The operating system couldn't be loaded because a critical system driver is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>File:\Windows\System32\Drivers\cng.sys</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc000007b</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the options that follow these lines work merely loops again for no resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise how I can fix this - since I can't even start up and I don't know command prompt well I'm not sure what to do.</p>
<p>Secondly, once this is fixed, how can i get windows update to work properly - my guess is that this issue is caused by the lack of windows update / patches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HI At Rom, </p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your response. However I cannot go beyond the blue screens - nothing seems to work so far - I can't start any of the safe mode or other options offered, there seem to be no restore points to go back to - the command line does load up but I tried
 a few generic suggested fixes found online but they have not worked either... so please kindly advise further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Blu Ray and CD discs won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play offline</h2>
                    I raised this in support but thought I'd make people aware of this here as well. Thanks to the current issue surrounding profiles I found Blu Ray and CDs are unplayable offline. Anyone else able to confirm this? Disconnect your Xbox One from any wired
 and wireless networks, then try and play a disc. I tried two Rihanna CDs, a Moving Shadow CD, Avengers Assemble and Pandorum Blu Ray. It wouldn't allow me to play them when signed into my profile offline. Instead Xbox One tells me to insert the correct type
 of disc. Always online for physical media? WTF?

I am raising this here as I'd like others to test and see if they have the same issue also. If they do then Microsoft are in for serious backlash.

<p>Had to check this out...I'd be tweaked if my internet went out and couldn't play my games or AT LEAST watch a movie.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>First tried watching without signing in; no problem. Then disconnected the internet; no problem.

<p>
Hello,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I have a Lenovo B40-80. &nbsp;The internal microphone is not working. &nbsp;I originally bought the laptop with Windows 7 in 2015. &nbsp;I upgraded to Windows 10 (probably the Anniversary update??) shortly after purchasing the laptop. &nbsp;I have never attempted to use the internal
 microphone or webcam until yesterday. &nbsp;Neither the webcam or the internal mic was working. &nbsp;I was successfully able to fix the driver for the webcam and now I can record video and pictures, but it cannot record audio. &nbsp;I have tried updating the driver for
 the microphone without success. &nbsp;Yes, the microphone is set as default and it is enabled. &nbsp;There is no external mic plugged in. &nbsp;Please help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to verify, has the internal mic ever worked after upgrading your computer to Windows 10? If so, we recommend uninstalling the driver with the option to "<strong>delete the driver software for this device</strong>" and restart your PC to have it reinstalled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, if the issue has started after the upgrade, we recommend checking the driver compatibility on your device manufacturer's website for information about Windows compatibility. Make sure that your computer is using the latest/updated drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further help.</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that in Windows Explorer, some of the files are displaying false file details. In particular, I set WE to display the number of pages in a file (Word documents). Many show&nbsp;as having 1 page, but I open them might find 82 pages.&nbsp; The page count
 is a filter I use for targeting certain files. Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Xbox is slow.DLC and installed games freeze.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey. So whenever I install a game on my HDD it freezes at an exact point and never works untill I uninstall it.vIt keeps saying the disk is not readable but if I uninstall it it will work again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also recently downloaded the Annihilation map-pack. Whenever I try to play a map it freezes at the load screen with the white bar&nbsp;at the bottom (and always at the exact same place)&nbsp;or it takes so long to load the map that I get kicked out of the lobby.
 I've tried deleting and reloading the map-pack, I've tried deleting the map-pack, clearing the cache and then reinstalling but it hasn't worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've also noticed my Xbox is a lot slower than my friends. Whenever I play a game it will take twice as long as any other people I know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would like to know the best things to do. Most of the problems occured when playing Call of Duty: Black Ops so I was wondering if I should maybe go get the disk buffed and then see if &nbsp;the problems remain and if I should send my Xbox in for a repair or
 something. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To assist your map-pack/speed problem, you should check out this helpful resource:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/pages/xbox-live/troubleshoot/connection-issues/performance.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../performance.aspx</a></p>
<p>It may be your wireless router acting up and it may just need to be reset.</p>
<p>As for your game, it may just be your wireless connection is not as strong so it is slower.
</p>
<p>I hope this helps resolve your issue!</p>

<p>Hey mate, this actually sounds a lot more like a memory issue than a network issue. For starters, can you please remove your HDD, to see if there's any difference in the freezing/slowness issues?

<p>Yeh, so, restarting my network devices didn't work but when I took out my HDD everything went a lot faster (starting COD:Black Ops went from a minute and a half to a few seconds). As soon as I put it back in everything goes to being slow again. So what's
 the next course of action?</p>

<p>As clearing the cache didn't resolve the issue, the next step would be formatting the drive. This will remove all of the data on the drive, however. You can back up your files on a USB drive configured for use with Xbox 360, and then try formatting the drive.
 The option is listed in the same menu as clearing the cache. </p>

<p>If that's the case, the drive will likely need to be replaced. Buying an official transfer cable will be the easiest way to transfer your saves to the new drive.

    <title>Issue with dual boot DOS and Win7. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danjaroch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with dual boot DOS and Win7.</h2>
                    I have been trying to setup a machine as follows: drive 0= 250G SATA with 512byte sectors DOS 6.22, boots fine alone. Drive 1= 500G SATA with 4K sectors with Win 7. When installing Win 7 on drive 1, it ignores the C: drive on drive 0 and assigns drive
 letter C: to the windows partition. Because the C: drive on drive 0 no longer a drive letter designation no boot loader is installed. I cannot change the windows system drive letter, in disk manager, and as such cannot get DOS to boot as anything but the C:
 drive. This is new behavior, I have been doing installs like this on NT 3.5 thru XP on the same drive or different drives without fail. Is Win 7 always going to capture the C drive letter for the system drive? If so I will have to revert to XP for dual boot
 installs. I get this same behavior on a single drive with both OS. If nobody has an answer I guess the next option may be a third party boot loader.<br />

            I need a DOS boot too , the only way for me to do it is to install DOS first , then XP and then win7<br />
<br />
after that it starts on win7 , select xp (earlier version of windows) and from there select DOS .<br />
<br />
it's 2 steps instead on 1 step :) but it works<br />

<h3> aliciaferndz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 hangs at start-up, hangs in safe mode, hangs with usb boot, hangs with CD boot, all because of classpnp.sys</h2>
                    
<p>Because of the many posts, I wil get straight to the point:</p>
<p>Windows 7 hangs on start-up, on the animation "starting windows" screen<br />
- System repair - hangs at the repair screen<br />
- Start normally - hangs at the starting windows screen<br />
- Start in safe mode - hangs at the classpnp.sys file<br />
- Start in safe mode with command prompt - hangs at the classpnp.sys file<br />
- start in safe mode with networking - hangs at the classpnp.sys file<br />
- start with a&nbsp; bootable usb with windows 7 - hangs at the starting screen<br />
- start with a bootable CD with windows 7 - hangs at the starting screen<br />
- start with a bootable usb with windows xp - hangs after loading files bar completes<br />
- there are or never have been any external devices, new hardware, etc. (it is a laptop)</p>
<p>The so-called "solutions" or "answers" so far seem unrealted to this situation as I cannot access any comand prompts, launch any sort of CD or usb, which is what these "solutions" require.&nbsp; I doubt it is the hardware because I have not installed or removed
 or touched.&nbsp; The computer just stopped working all of a sudden.</p>
<p>My computer is a Dell Latitude D420 laptop, although I am not sure if this is relevant.&nbsp; There are other users that are in this exact situation with different computers, and I have seen no proper solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I am quoting the post from catwb, who has the exact same problem:<br />
"&nbsp; this problem can't be solved by the rote answer of doing a system restore or start up repair . We can't even get to those options! My retail Windows 7 Ultimate install hangs on the logo/"Starting Windows" screen but no amount of waiting (even over night)
 gets it to move any further. When trying to access the system through safe mode I get a stop at "classpnp.sys". If I boot from the disc, try to do a system restore, startup repair, or even try just to completely reinstall the OS, it says it is "loading files"
 above a growing white progress bar and then just goes to a blank screen.... Every tech support forum has someone who has had the same problem and the system restore/startup repair is the first and only suggestion offered followed by a whole host of people
 saying that it's not even possible."</p>
<p>As you can see, I have described the situation in detail and woudl a appreciate a solution to this problem, not a solution to a similar problem.&nbsp; Please help!!</p>
<p>Have any solutions been provided for this exact situation/probem?&nbsp; Please let me know.</p>

            I had the same problem, I disconnected all the HD and even tried to just boot from CD rom with Windows 7 Disk in. and got same symptoms. Ive read where some ppl have replaced the hard drive but if i disconnected them that would rule them out right? I updated
 my Bios that did'nt &nbsp;work. &nbsp;So.....
<div>I had a spare Main Board lying around so i tried that. And it seemed to work. It does'nt make any sense either because my last Main posted ok . But when Windows tried to do anything it would feeze on the logo screen. &nbsp;The next big question is. Was it a
 virus or hardware malfunction?</div>

            <p>I'm having the same problem with my wife's Dell Inspiron Lapton running Windows 7.&nbsp;She didn't load any new software or hardware.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Dell Diagnostics and it says everything is fine. System fine, Hard disk fine, Memory fine.&nbsp; Nice to know everything's good (except for the fact that the machine won't start).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Diagnostics exited to reboot, but changed nothing:</p>
<p>Safe mode still freezes with this classpnp.sys file</p>
<p>Startup Repair, loads a couple of little items, bars filling up, then the screen goes blank.&nbsp; After a couple of minutes, no sign of activity.&nbsp; No lights, nothing.&nbsp; I tried AndrewAttic's solution, but it's a Dell and doesn't have a &lt;break&gt; key.&nbsp; I tried the
 20 or 30 alternatives suggested by Dell/others, but no go.&nbsp; Can't get the string to end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't really run anything, because I don't know how to get a command prompt.</p>
<p>I'm guessing it's a Windows 7 problem, but I have no idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to start from last known configuration, but that just gave me a blank screen too.</p>
<p>I don't have a Windows Installation disk.&nbsp; It's a Dell and come with Windows installed.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>When I woke up, my computer was on hibernation mode, then when I turned it on, everything was different including my personal settings. Then I started downloading my themes because I couldn't find my personal stuff. Then I managed to get my themes, then
 I rebooted my computer then all my personal stuff was back to normal. I had downloaded a log on screen softwear before rebooting the PC.</p>
<p>After the reboot, everything was working fine. Then I decided to reboot it just to be certain that everything is fine, then it starts normally and loads normally as well, but after that, the screen is black, no log on screen for face detection or password.
 I've been shutting down and turning on my PC for the past two hours and nothing has changed, please help, I have an application that I have to submit and I need your help</p>
        </p>

<h2>            I am have the same problems with windows 10. My windows 7 is now not genuine. Help</h2>
                    <p>i have a sticker that came on my laptop with the key code for Microsoft 7&nbsp;I think. but on my laptop next to my mouse pad i factory stickers and one of them is windows vista.
</p>
<p>I never had a Microsoft 7 disk because it came pre installed on my computer but i do have key code like i said&nbsp;stuck to the bottom of my computer.</p>
<p>my computer was running slow so i thought that i needed to upgrade to windows 10. well now my computer is telling me in the right bottom corner that my Microsoft 7 is not genuine. I tried to validate but no use.
</p>
<p>How can I create a disk using my key code that came with my computer?</p>
<p>How do&nbsp;I fix this? I did create a system back up, per best buy. They said I had to reset my computer to factory but&nbsp;I need to Back up my system. They said they would charge me extra to back up so i did myself.
</p>
<p>Before i go and pay them to fix this since i don't have any money to do so right now i need to try to do it myself. Please help me.</p>

            <p>You have a non-genuine copy of Windows 7 Ultimate installed. </p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>You need to purchase a genuine Windows 7 license. The copy of Windows 7 Ultimate you have installed is an OEM SLP license that should only come preloaded with a new PC. You seem to have installed a copy of Windows 7 Ultimate that uses an activation exploit
 that circumvents product activation.</p>
<p>The reason we know this is because your BIOS date does not match up:</p>
<p>20070329000000.000000+000</p>
<p>Windows 7 was released in 2009, your BIOS date says 2008, which likely means your system either came with Windows Vista or Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, this is a well known Windows 7 Ultimate license that has been used all over the web:</p>
<p>Windows Product Key: *****-*****-X92GV-V7DCV-P4K27</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a web search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you either need to reload the copy of Windows that came on your computer (Vista or XP) or consider purchasing a genuine Windows 7 license or purchase a full copy of Windows 10:</p>

</p><p>If you want to upgrade from Windows 7 Ultimate, you will need to purchase Windows 10 Pro. If you don't need or cannot afford Windows 10 Pro, then you will need to purchase Windows 10 Home, but you will have to perform a custom install.</p>

</p><p>HP did not preinstall Windows 7 on this computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You referred to a Certificate of authenticity label that is stuck on the computer. - this label contains a product key and it also identifies the version &amp; edition of Windows for which it is valid [For example, Windows 7 Home premium].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here&nbsp;are two&nbsp;example CoA labels</p>

 states windows vista. I have all receipts and booklets on this computer. i have never placed another sticker on my computer. Can i insert a copy of the original sticker on my computer so you can see it?&nbsp;i just don't want to throw my key code out there. what

            <p>You can take &amp; post a photo of your Certificate of authenticity if you want but make sure that you edit it first to remove the product key [as posting a product key online means it will be stolen and misused].</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the label next to the touchpad refers to Vista then we can safely assume that it came with Vista pre-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the label on the computer that looks like the example CoAs that I posted above is so worn that you can read neither the Windows version nor its edition then you will not be able to get a licensed-activated installation of Windows unless the manufacturer
 [HP] is still prepared to sell you a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">re</span>-installation disk [possibly called a "recovery disk" but this vague term might also mean something else].&nbsp; I doubt that they have any copies left in stock for your model.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you happen to know somebody who bought the same model computer as yours then find out if they have a
 then&nbsp;and there is no telling what any other model's reinstallation disk would do on your system.</li><li>Any other type of Vista installation disk or reinstallation disk&nbsp;would also&nbsp;need the product key from the label you have already described as unreadable.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The only remaining possibility is that HP installed a "restore-to-factory" partition that has not been overwritten by the Windows 7 installation.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>You could check the HDD in Disk management [type <em>disk management</em> into your Start menu search box] to see if there is a small partition [probably 16GB or less] that you do not know the purpose of.&nbsp;
</li><li>If it exists then look up <em>restore-to-factory</em> in your computer manual, in the HP support site &amp; in the HP user forums.&nbsp;
</li><li>If this procedure works then you can end up with a fully licensed &amp; self-activated installation of Windows Vista.&nbsp; No product key will be required.&nbsp;
</li><li>You would first need to backup all your own files and any applications' installation files that you have onto an external drive.</li><li>You could use your Vista until its extended support ends on 11 April 2017, after which its vulnerabilities will not get patched and it will become a target for hackers.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Other courses of action:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Other than that, I'd say that your best bet would be to avoid spending any more money on your computer and to consider buying&nbsp;a replacement by 11 April 2017.&nbsp; Alternatively, if you are confident that it runs properly with Windows 7 then you could buy an
 "OEM" or "System builder" copy of Windows 7 to install on it as that would last until 14 January 2020.&nbsp;
</li><li>If you are not sure about how best to spend your money then find somebody with a fairly new Windows 7 or Windows 10 computer and watch a few of your own common tasks being run.&nbsp; You might be so impressed with the improved performance of a recent computer
 that you decide that saving up for a new one is the best thing to do.</li><li>If you do decide to spend money upgrading to Windows 7 then you will be faced with a Windows 10 decision [before 29 July 2016].&nbsp;
</li><li>Windows 7 computers can run the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/C/8/0/C8007C4E-D1DD-4922-A966-3A927E86A033/GWXWebWindows.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 upgrade checker</a> but do not accept that as the last word on the matter - there are plenty of threads in this forum from users who upgraded only to find out that their older computers cannot perform decently.&nbsp; Hardware drivers can be a particular
 problem - see <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/96eddd4e-4b0a-46f1-8c71-96ff380ad272?threadId=03aef37a-f353-4449-89b4-37f417c8a102">

Disable Windows 10 update</a></li></ul>
<p>

<h2>            System stuck at login screen and then shuts down.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Verify Error</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, I've been having this problem when i start up.</p>
<p>When i start my laptop (toshiba satellite windows 10), it says the normal "Toshiba Leading Lnnovation' then goes to a page that says enter password with a password box just below (like normal), but when i put in my password, it turns the box red and says
 "verify error!! Press ENTER To Continue" i try twice more (does the same, turn red thing) then says "verify error!! system is shutting down" and shuts down, I've tried a lot of times to get passed this but it keeps failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>based on the time i woke up the problem started roughly at 7am on the 24th of december.</p>
<p>between when i first got the apps as follows (minus the Bluestacks program) I've downloaded some apps using Bluestacks&nbsp;</p>
<p>the apps are "lucky patcherCM" "lucky patcher" "fallout shelter" "hill climb races" "Free War Thunder Eagles" "Police Radio scanner". i got most of these yesterday, and I've had blue stacks for a while, i think the problem started when i installed one of
 these programs.</p>
<p>also i remember some one saying in a youtube video that i need to use the right Lucky Patcher app, because there is a lot of fake ones that just have malware. i think thats where the problem started from.</p>

<h2>            My Android phone doesn&#39;t ring when receiving a Skype call</h2>
                    <p>My Samsung phone used to work well with Skype, but recently the phone doesn't ring when there's an incoming Skype call, however somehow the phone actually accepts the call and makes a connection without my knowing.</p>
<p>I've checked all the sound settings on my phone which hasn't helped and I've checked my settings on Skype, which also hasn't helped. Looking on Youtube I find solutions for iPhones, but nothing for Android.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I resolved the problem myself before receiving this helpful reply.</p>
<p>1. I uninstalled Skype and installed a new Skype installation. Looking on the settings of the new installed Skype I found</p>
<p>an option to automatically answer incoming calls. I disabled this. I don't think this option was shown in the settings of the former Skype installation. This solved the problem of&nbsp; calls being answered without my knowledge.</p>
<p>2. Found on the pull down settings on my Samsung Android phone that the sound button was changed to vibrate. When setting was changed from vibrate to sound the 2nd problem was solved.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Now the phone is ringing on Skype calls and doesn't answer automatically.</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind help.</p>

<p>I had/have an Xbox 360 S 4GB internal memory, and it recently stopped working. I have important game files on it and it won't turn on anymore (I've checked the power strip and it makes the sound like it will turn on but no light comes on) It had the red
 ring of death but then stopped working completely. Is there a way to get my game files back without having to get it repaired?</p>

<p>if you look up the 'RROD Towel Method" on youtube, you can find a way to get your console to turn back on, albeit not for very long. &nbsp;After it turns on, dump all your save games etc onto the cloud.</p>
<p>basically you wrap the console in a thick towel and turn it on (hopefully it turns back on). &nbsp;You then leave it on for a prolonged period of time so that it super overheats, which then makes the console reset itself. &nbsp;This WILL NOT permanently fix the console
 however, but again, should give you enough time to snag your saves.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>The towel method might have helped when it had the RROD, but it doesn't even have a light on it anymore. When I touch the power button it makes the sound like it will turn on, but it won't no light or anything. :/</p>

            <p>Hey there Cloora!<br /><br />If your console won't turn on at all, I'm sorry to say there's no way to retrieve you files without sending it in for a repair. Since the 4gb of internal memory is just flash memory that can't be removed, you won't be able to use a Hard Drive transfer cable to transfer your save data to a new hard drive.<br /><br />It sounds like the best course of action would be to get the repair process started through our website. Here's a link on <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how to get your Xbox product repaired</a>.<br /><br />I hope that helps!</p>

            Did you unhide Quick Access which is not included as a default in Windows 10?   The reason I ask is that I've had reports here lately that it's distorting Taskbar so wanted to ask you about your experience with it.  
<br />
<br />Normally you'd just right click to Pin To Taskbar.  
<br />
<br />Either way, Let us know if there's anything else.  
<br />
<br />If not then you can mark the post which helped most as the Answer, to help others.

            Hi Ashu 
<br />
<br />Windows cannot find your Bluetooth radio on your PC . .. 
<br />
<br />Re-installing the Bluetooth device driver from the support page for your PC on the manufacturers website, should resolve this . .. 
<br />
<br />If you have any difficulty finding that support page, what is the Make and exact Model No. of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . .
