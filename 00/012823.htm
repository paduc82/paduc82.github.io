<h2>            Adwords import to Bing&#58; no keywords &#38; ads imported</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to use my Adwords campaings into the Bing editor. After the Adwords log in, the campaigns and ad groups are downloaded to Bing but unfortunately no keywords and ads at all. The Bing support adviced that the target language of the AW campaigns must
 be ONE languauge (like only English, etc) instead of all languages. So I adjusted that but still I get no ads and keywords when downloading the campaigns of AW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know the solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Good Morning TSBE,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can give you some general knowledge on this, but I must say this could be a complicated issue as it is not a known global issue, so contacting customer support is going to be your best option. Here is the link&nbsp;<a href="http://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/bing-ads-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact
 Us</a>. Additional country and language options are available in the drop down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will start with a link to the import <a href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/5/en/14023/0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Bing Ads Editor - Importing from Google Ad Words</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not all labels and types of campaigns that Ad Words offers are going to be 100 % compatible with Bing Ads, this is why during the import you have the option to check your labels to ensure that the headings are matching up with what you want to import. If
 the system is unable to match up a label (if a column&nbsp;has a different name than what we commonly use), that column will be skipped. For instance we only offer CPC, so the column bid&nbsp;type would be skipped. At the end of every import you have the option to review
 skipped item, but changing the column headings happen&nbsp;after you have selected the campaigns and before you begin the download.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based upon your description there may be a few factors that are causing the issue, so it would be great to take a look at the raw data to see how the Keywords are labeled and what type of campaign that it is. Please do not post this in the forum, but contact
 our support team for a deeper look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We support several languages, but not all as well, so if the language has characters not recognized by the system, it may also be causing trouble on the import. For more information on Languages that we support please see

<p>Hi United1010,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want users to delete their conversation history, you can place their mailbox on hold. For your reference:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Build 10130 Can&#39;t Update-Stuck at 0&#37;</h2>
                    Hi all, I've seen some other issues similar to this posted but none of them fixed my problem. I recently installed Windows 10 10130 via .iso files on a USB and started installing all the updates. Some of them did install, but now any time I open the updater,
 it just sits at 0%. I've left it on for hours and nothing happens. Before it is suggested, let it be known that I have already tried the automatic troubleshooter and it just told it could not be automatic fixed... any ideas? Thanks!

            I much more digging and have finally fixed the problem (Nothing feels much better than resolving a problem after hours of work!). I found that my BITS service and Windows Update Service were stuck in a state of "Stopping". I looked up how to stop them
 but they could not be, since they were trying to stop in the first place. I tried to force kill each of them and this method worked with BITS, not the Windows Update Service. I ended up find this:
<span>
<p>http://www.examiner.com/list/how-to-kill-a-windows-service-that-s-stuck-on-stopping-or-starting
</p>
<p>which tells how to force kill a task by using its' PID, which worked for me. If anyone else has this issue, or similar, I would be very happy to help them out since I found many unanswered threads with this problem out there. Thanks much!</p>

<h2>            Lost Hotmail account</h2>
                    When Hotmail switched over to Outlook I lost an important account.
<div>When they told us that if we had two Hotmail accounts linked to each other that they wouldn't be accessible through the other account anymore - I didn't know that meant they would just get rid of one.</div>
<div>I can not find a way to contact outlook and get them to give me my account back - it uses my name and has important information that I used for work.</div>
<div>Does anyone know what to do?</div>
<div>Is there any way to call someone at Outlook? or Hotmail?</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<div>I understand you have lost an email account. &nbsp;Let me help you.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just to clarify, when Hotmail transitioned to Outlook.com, it only changed the platform. &nbsp;That didn't mean accounts would be deleted. &nbsp;Furthermore, when the linked accounts feature was retired, that did not delete the accounts either, it just separated
 them. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Kindly provide us your affected email address so we can investigate.&nbsp;</div>

            Thanks for your response. Yes, I did follow the instructions to completely remove Office 2011 prior to attempting the reinstall, and then did the auto update. That did not resolve the issue. Per your instructions, I just went through the font book and
 removed a few problematic ones, emptied the trash, and restarted. Unfortunately, this has not resolved the issue either. &nbsp;

<h2>            OneDrive taking up too much space on my laptop</h2>
                    I'm trying to keep my laptop storage space as free as possible.&nbsp; Is there a process to automatically send my photos on my phone's micro-sd directly to One Drive instead of importing the photos to the laptop when I insert my card reader?&nbsp; I keep getting
 duplicate photos which are taking up all of the space on my laptop.

    <title>Office 365 2016 Outlook on Yosemite error 1001 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alicekarolina  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 2016 Outlook on Yosemite error 1001</h2>
                    <p>I have a Mac with Yosemite 10.10.5. I recently bought Office 365 Personal 2016 to replace my Office 2011 which was giving me grief. I am trying to connect my Gmail account with Outlook, which was working fine at first, but now I keep having errors sending
 emails.<br />
<br />
I had Office 2011 on my computer when I downloaded the new Office, which might have screwed things up. However, it was a student version without Outlook...? Threw 2011 in the trash (and emptied ;), connected my Gmail account again and deleted the old one. Two
 emails went out, but then I got error -1001. <br />
<br />
Now I am at a loss - should I re-install Office 2016 again somehow? What is the best way to 'repair' it? Or are there still 2011 parts floating around?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

                    Using Outlook 2016 desktop client, I routinely have email messages for which the "message preview" line does not reflect the latest content in the thread.&nbsp; Often it seems "stuck" on the original message rather than displaying the content of the most recent
 reply.&nbsp; I haven't been able to nail down any commonality (internal, external email, etc).

<p>Hi Julianna,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook is configured by default to block automatic download of pictures from the Internet. This is to help you avoid viewing
<span>potentially</span> offensive material and keep malicious code from damaging your data. However, you can unblock images that you think are safe to download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned that you’ve already tried all the online recommendations, we would like to confirm if you’ve already tried the instructions provided in this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Block-or-unblock-automatic-picture-downloads-in-email-messages-15e08854-6808-49b1-9a0a-50b81f2d617a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes and you’re still unable to download the pictures, we need additional details to address your concern. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Which Windows build and version are you using? Click <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Here’s a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> that would walk you through the steps on how to open Outlook in safe mode.</li><li>Is your computer connected to a domain?</li><li>Which email protocol are you using, POP3, IMAP, or Exchange?</li><li>Did you make any changes before this issue happened?</li></ul>

            <p>I have the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the app on Xbox one. It freezes frequently when trying to add a song.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like the app gets slower and slower as you create more playlists. I mean, I have 20 playlists, and I am forced to restart the app at least once per evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any changes planned when it comes to speeding up the app? It takes sometimes a few seconds to go from one screen to another e.g. I go to Top Music Videos - all i can see is a white page and "Top Music Videos" header. After ~20 sec I can finally
 see the videos. Same applies to my own playlists.</p>

            I'm having a similar problem. Not when adding songs, but just freezes at 10 seconds in during play. Randomly does this daily. I'm using groove app on Android with a strong WiFi. It doesn't do it as bad on my Xbox but still freezes occasionally. Irratating!!!!
 Please fix this Microsoft. <br />
My Spotify account didn't do that. Maybe time to go back. :(

            <p>Groove locks up when it tries to load my library effectively making the player unusable (because it is). &nbsp;If it can't index and play files locally it's useless to me (and to be critical, it's 2016, indexing files and loading them quickly should be trivial
 to the company that wrote the OS and languages used to create this app). &nbsp;This has to be one of the most used and most basic use cases for this software. &nbsp;Did anyone test with a library of more than 10 files?</p>

    <title>Contacts not in PST file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roxandnate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contacts not in PST file</h2>
                    Before leaving my job, I backed up my PST file from Outlook 2003 at work, in two separate locations (a flash drive and a hard drive), to make sure that I could access my contacts. Unfortunately, when I open either PST file using Outlook 2003 at home, while
 email archives open with no problem, there is no contacts folder. I no longer have access to my work computer or files. However, it seems inexplicable that these PST files did not contain contact information. Is there a way to determine if the contact information
 is truly in the PST file and, if so, is there a way to access it? I have seen some reports of this on the web but no real solutions offered. Any help would be fantastic.

            If you were using an Exchange account as it is normally used, then your Contacts folder was in your Exchange mailbox and not in any PST.&nbsp; The same would be true for any mail, calendar, task, and notes data as well.&nbsp; A PST would contain only those messages
 or other data that you explicitly added to it, either my moving or copying it or by using Autoarchive.&nbsp; Under typical conditons with Exchange, the delivery location (where your default fodlers are) is not a PST.

<h2>            HELP&#33; Thisworkbook.close crashes all excel files and closes them</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have a userform in excel which students use to submit their quiz answers. Once they click "Submit" on the form I want to close the form. I use "ThisWorkbook.close" statement to close that workbook. But this crashes&nbsp; and closes all open excel files.</p>
<p>Is there any other way to close this workbook only? which has the form and not all other workbooks?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>This worked for me:</p>
<p>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
Unload UserForm1<br />
ThisWorkbook.Close True<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>If you want to also close excel you could also add additional code to do that as well, but you would want it to close only if there were no other workbooks open.</p>

            <p>Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials?
</p>
<p>You have posted to a forum for users of
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials.</a></p>
<p>If so, you must remove either Norton of Microsoft Security Essentials. You should never have more than one security product installed on the PC providing active protection/scanning. This
 can cause performance issues, system instability, and can hinder the effectiveness of both products at providing protection.</p>
<p>If you choose to remove Norton:</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove Norton:</p>

<h3> grenoblefrance  say:</h3>
<h2>            continuous System_Service_Exception BSOD at 65&#37; of installation of W10 Pro build 17074 from 17063</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have had more than 8 Blue Screen of Death today and in the past days when installing Windows 10 Pro build&nbsp;17074 from build&nbsp;17063 (not when the PC reboots but when it says "installing" in Windows Update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime it is around 65% of installation</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At restart, Windows Update always tries to install build 17074 and the install crashes into a BSOD all the time at 65~66% and reboots</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't use the PC anymore...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know where does it come from?</p>
<p>- Driver issue?</p>
<p>- not enough space on C: drive?</p>
<p>(I only have around 20 GB of free space on this drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can I install directly build&nbsp;<span>17083?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your help,</p>

            If you are stuck in a loop you could try booting to Recovery Mode and select Troubleshoot then Advanced then Go back to previous build to see if the Windows.old is working.

<p>If you made a Windows install USB key it is a little easier to get to Recovery mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have the USB key then you can use the manual way to get in Recovery Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Power button to boot when it gets to the Mother board or manufacture Screen Press and hold the Power button to force shut down. do this 3 times should boot you to Recovery mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Recovery Mode select Troubleshoot then Advanced then Startup options and you should see the Option to enable Safe Mode.</p>

</p><p>Do you think safe mode will be helpful?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Isn't there anything else I can do to avoid BSOD?</p>
<p>

            If none of the Options in Recovery Mode or Safe Mode work the only way to recover would be&nbsp; a New Install with one of the ISO Files or a System Backup you made encase something like this happened.
