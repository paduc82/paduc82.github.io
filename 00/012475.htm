<h2>            Do not have the new Office 2016 features and cannot login to Office Insider.</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office ProPlus account which I got from my school. As you probably know recently Office 2016 for ProPlus came out and I was really excited as I was looking forward to the new features. But when I installed it I couldn't find any of the new features
 such as Morph Transition and Designer. I tried updating but that did not work, I have version&nbsp;<em>16.0.6001.1061.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;So after some Googling I saw somebody giving the advice to subscribe for 'Office Insider' to get all features early. So I tried logging in using the account I got from my school but I got this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5330d63-5551-4a69-bf55-296f041e16e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5330d63-5551-4a69-bf55-296f041e16e8" /></a>Which
 probably is true, it's an Office account. Not a Microsoft account.<br />
<strong>BUT I WANT TO SUBSCRIBE FOR&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">OFFICE</span>&nbsp;</em>INSIDER!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>But anyways, I tried logging in to my Microsoft account. Then I got this:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6880ac34-66e5-4c90-9fc8-3ead977c5552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6880ac34-66e5-4c90-9fc8-3ead977c5552" /></a></p>
<p>I'm getting pretty tired of this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there anyone who can either tell me how to get the new features on my account or can explain to me how to subscribe for Office insider?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Timeijs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can reach out to your IT admins, since they are the ones who configure how and when end users get Office 365 feature updates. Or, you can just&nbsp;follow the&nbsp;steps in

this article</a>&nbsp;to get a First Release build for Office 365. This gives you early access to the new features of Office 2016 and is the same as the Office Insider build.

<h2>            Relative cell reference for a formula&#63;</h2>
                    I realize that with a relative cell reference, Excel will automatically adjust the address if I insert columns/rows, etc.
<br />
<br />
But I'm trying to accomplish something different than that. <br />

Say that I have two cells H10 and H11, and currently I have a formula in H11 like this: =IF(H10=0, "this", "that").
<br />
<br />
But I want to write a formula that translates to something like "If the cell 1 to the left of this current cell and in this current row is 0, then "this", otherwise "that.""
<br />

How do I do that?

 enabled. PLease assist me on this matter. This predicament started only a few days ago, I was able to use this phone for 3 years now. Is it possible that there might be a software problem?<br />

            A software problem is always possible, but before that I'd look and see if your message centre is set correctly.<br />
<br />
Not sure where this is on a 1112 but it'll most likely be in your messaging. There will be the wherewithall to change the settings for messaging, you want to look at the text message settings and see what number you have for the message centre. Then call your
 operator and ask if that number is correct. If it isn't you can change it and you should be good to go.

checked sms settings its correct (message ctr number: +639220001501 [sun cellular], messages sent as:text, message validity:maximum). transferred my sim to another phone and its working. tried to use a different sim in my 1112 and it cant send sms as well :-(

            In that case it does look more like a fault with the phone.<br />
<br />
Take it in to a Nokia Care Point for them to reset it (you can't do that yourself). Note that any and all data on that phone will be lost.<br />
<br />
If a reset doesn't cure the problem then I suggest you purchase a new phone SIM-free. The price of a 1112 doesn't justify repairs.

            Most likely , you may have to re subscribe for that other phone too for the text service. Or just maybe your subscription has expired on that phone. Try subscribing again and if you get a message ' you are already subscribed than it must be something to
 do with the settings.

    <title>Reinstalling Office 2013 ProPlus, with double pc license - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riccardomm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling Office 2013 ProPlus, with double pc license</h2>
                    <p>HI there!</p>
<p>I have a problem with reinstalling Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013.</p>
<p>In 2014 I bought a 2pc license (SKU: MSO13PROPLUS) and with them I installed Microsoft Office on two laptops (names: Dell and Sony).</p>
<p>Now, as I bought another laptop (name: Lenovo), and I wanted to move one of the licenses from Sony to Lenovo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Office from Sony, and installed it on Lenovo.However, the License Key won't work on Lenovo.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just formatted Sony (system restore to factory default), installed Office, but the License Key won't work on it anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It boils down to the fact that I currently have a double license, but only one active installation (on Dell).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In due time, I had got in touch with the Microsoft Telephone Activation staff; they told me that Microsoft needs to be notified by the original seller of the licenses, for me to be able to re-use the License Key themselves.</p>
<p>I tried to get in touch with the sellers, but they sold the business to a new company, who won't really help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions therefore are:</p>
<p>1) Is there any way of letting Microsoft know that I want to transfer the License Key to another computer?</p>
<p>2) Is there any way of checking the current status of the 2PC license I bought?</p>
<p />

            <p>Exactly how did you qualify to buy Pro Plus. It is a limited distribution bundle with very strict purchase restrictions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never seen a license requirement to notify MS about licenses being sold ... I need more detail from them to understand what they are saying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process of transferring an installation is simple enough:</p>
<ol>
<li>You uninstall from the old machine, or the old machine is "dead" and therefore Office can no longer run on that machine.
</li><li>Install on the new machine</li><li>attempt internet activation</li><li>If internet activation fails, do phone activation</li><li>if that fails, do phone activation again. This time wait until you are offered the option of talking to a live service rep.</li><li>as long as you have a license type that allows license transfers the rep will allow the activation to complete.
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note on </strong><strong>#1:</strong> the "uninstall" process does not contact the MS activation system to it has no way of knowing exactly how many machines are using that license.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note on #6</strong>: next time, ask the service rep exactly what type of license you have.&nbsp; What is the 3 letter code!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one type of Pro Plus license that is commonly resold illegally.&nbsp; People will buy Pro Plus on a "volume" license then resell the keys to other people which is a violation of the license terms.&nbsp; One of the specific license types is setup to allow
 a limited number of activations. Once the activations are used up the user is hooped!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, the activation system is a black hole as far as users are concerned. Information goes in, but nothing comes out. There is no way for users to find out what type of license they have, or the license terms on it or the status of their license ... &lt;big
 sigh!&gt;</p>

            <p>Hi Praveen, thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>I bought the double-license Office 2013 Pro Plus on its own, in November 2014.</p>
<p>It is a retail version, therefore, not an OEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the article you linked: it confirms that the licenses are transferable. However it does not state how one can do it, and that is my problem... How do I transfer a license?</p>
<p>
</p><p>remark: the once-in-90-days limit for transferring the licenses does not seem to be the problem; the first installation on the two laptops (Vaio and Dell) took place in November 2014), and the transfer attempt was done in March 2016 without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Rohn007,</p>
<p>thanks for taking the time to reply to my question.</p>
<p>-- How do I qualify to buy Pro Plus? That is a good question, and I don't know the answer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>--&nbsp;As to "notifying MS about the sold license": a few months ago, when I saw that transferring the license was more complicated than simply uninstalling and installing, I tried the phone activation; I eventually got through to a MS representative who said
 to me that the license key I had could not be used unless the original retailer got in touch with Microsoft. I emailed the retailer, but apparently they sold the business to a new company that won't really take too much time to help.</p>

</p><p>-- As to the 3-letters code: I guess you mean "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SKU: MSO13PROPLUS", and more precisely the "SKU" bit... The whole thing was in the email I received from the retailer with the license
 key. I assumed that this was the identifier of the Office edition I was talking about, but it might not be. SKU seems to stand for "</span><span>Store-Keeping
 Unit".</span></p>

            <p>If you don't know how you qualify for Pro Plus, you almost certainly don't.&nbsp; That is the long way of saying I suspect you have a bootleg copy ... &lt;oops&gt; in which case you have to buy a new copy of Office ... &lt;boo&gt;

</p><p>The three letter code I am looking for is FPP or MAK or KMS or OEM or PKC.&nbsp; FPP is good for you, the others are not so much.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>#1 mean "Retail" license that allows install on 2 machines and <strong>can</strong> transfer</li><li>#2 and 3 mean you probably have a bootleg copy </li><li>#4 and 5 mean you can only install on one machine and <strong>CANNOT </strong>

            <p>Hi JackPula,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me assist you with managing the frequent contacts list of your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By design, you cannot manually add a contact to the list. Contacts will be automatically added to the list if you send emails to that contact often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can delete contacts from the list by clicking on the X button next to the contact name on the list. The X button will show up once you point the mouse cursor to the contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have more question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Johan</p>

<p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>From the description, the emails in a specific period are moved/deleted.<br />
To clarify the situation, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. Is the user able to search the email in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a>?<br />
2. Is there any inbox rule to delete or redirect these emails?<br />
3. Are you able to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/dd353189(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create an eDiscovery search</a> to find the emails between 11-20-15 and 4-15-15?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            OneNote storage issue on IPad</h2>
                    <p>So I have OneNote files on my desktop which is fine, on OneDrive, and on my tablet. &nbsp;That last is not good as it’s killing a huge amount of my tablet storage.</p>

            Its the basic concept of OneNote (on any system) to hold all files in an offline cache copy. This is important for offline availability and the sync protocol.
<br />That cache is cleared when a notebook is closed (it's "main version" still saved on OneDrive). So the only way to prevent OneNote from using up to much memory is to close all notebooks you do not need in constant access. 
<br />Maybe you could consider a change in your notes organisation; having just one (or few) notebook(s) which need(s) to be available all the time on your mobile devices.

<h2>            Teams - Conversation thread order - can it be locked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I see that the order of a conversation is determined by latest post on the bottom; is there a way for an owner to lock the order of their posts? For example, I have some content I need my group to see in a particular order and i don't want to put it in one
 long post. So I have it several posts. I don't want to lock members fully from posting (and there isn't a way (I think) to make member ability to post on some pages but not others); so if a member posts about one of my posts it would change the order of my
 content such that it might not make sense. I need it to display in a proper sequence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can i do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or do you have other suggestions other than locking out member creating posts altogether?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I put the content in another type of tab?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hi Linsenmayer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, it is infeasible for us to change the conversation order or lock the conversation in Teams. If you have some information to share with the team member, I suggest you put the content into a file and upload it to the channel(under the File
 tab in the channel &gt; New).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any further concern about locking or customizing the order of the conversation, I suggest you submit your feedback via the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public</a></p>

<p>Many features of current programs have been designed and upgraded based on customers’ feedback.</p>

</p><p>From IE&gt; Tools (or Alt + t)&gt; Compatibility View Settings, verify that the site is not in the list, that "Use Microsoft compatibility lists" is unchecked and that "Display Intranet Sites in Compatibility View" is unchecked.</p>

 the default colour keeps changing back to red for some reason.</p>

<p><span>Was there any updates installed.</span></p>
<p><span>What is the edition and version of Office installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>To find out, open word or OneNote ---File----Account---next to the update option icon you see the Office build.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you get any error messages?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Harsha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to assist me with my problem :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am using OneNote 2016 as part of the Office 365 Personal package suite.</p>
<p>Version 16.0.6868.2060</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling the suite off both my computers and then reinstalling to see if it would work but it didn't so I can only assume that I have the latest updated version of the Office 365 suite.</p>
<p>I don't get any error messages with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that when I choose the font in OneNote 2016, it simply types in another font instead (usually Calibri). I've been using this font on OneNote for over a month now but suddenly yesterday it stopped working all of a sudden. What's strange as
 well is the font works fine on the other Office programmes. Selecting it as a default font yields the same problem as well, it simply types in another font.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried setting a different default printer on both computers but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Dean</p>

            <p><span>Hello Dean,</span></p>
<p><span>I am from the OneNote product team.
</span></p>
<p><span>Can you share with me the font that you are using?</span></p>
<p><span>Also, are you on Win7?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suspect this is the same issue you saw in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-onenote/third-party-fonts-not-working-in-onenote-2016/809af12a-cb24-4f46-a87e-f14f22176f69?auth=1">
</span></p>
<p><span>For the font that I debugged with for that case, I saw that the font was missing values in one of the font tables that lets us know what languages the font supports. Because of that missing
 info, one of the components we rely on decided the font should not be used. That component is being updated to work around the missing font information, but it is a fairly large change, so we are rolling it out carefully to make sure we don’t break other things,
 and I am not sure when exactly it will be generally available. We will update the other thread when it should be available.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Greg</span></p>

            <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your interest and assistance in the issue :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, its not just a specific font that isn't working, its any font that I have downloaded and installed on the system. However if you wanted to work around the font that I am having trouble with, here is a download link.
</p>
<p>http://www.meda302.medadada.net/2014/10/07/flamauow-font/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 as well by the way. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I did notice the other thread as well, in fact I am subscribed to it. In contrast to his problem however, my third party fonts were working on OneNote 2016 until a couple days ago. What's strange as well is I was using OneNote the whole morning with
 the third party fonts working until I quit out of it. I remembered I wanted to add something to my notes so I quickly went back in and all of a sudden the fonts weren't working anymore :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very strange to say the least. I have the upmost confidence you guys can fix it though :)</p>

            <p>Just a small update: I can’t give you an exact date for the fix availability because of the staggered way in which we roll out Office feature updates. We have the fix built, but there are a few other fixes in the Office suite that need to go out at the same
 time that have not been checked in yet and have to go through testing. So&nbsp;the fix&nbsp;wont be out as soon as I had hoped (For context, I was kind of hoping it would maybe be available this week, but no.) I will be sure to let you know as soon as the fix is out
 though. Thanks for your patience!</p>

<h2>            MSE will not finish running due to too many content.ie5 files in various temporary folders</h2>
                    <p>I've tried to run a full system scan in MSE, but after 5 hours, the indicator bar&nbsp;appears to have only&nbsp;run about 5%. It's running through millions of files in the following directories:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Windows\sysWOW64\config\systemprofile\appdata\local\microsoft\windows\temporary internetfiles\content.IE5
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system is&nbsp;Windows 7 Professional 64 bit, running IE10. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted all temporary internet files, cookies, etc,&nbsp;via the standard&nbsp;Internet Options tab in IE10. I have even&nbsp;tried to use CC Cleaner and other 3rd party programs to delete temporary files, but none will delete these hidden folders of temporary content.IE5
 files. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've seen on another thread where a&nbsp;Microsoft MVP said to forget about content.IE5 files, as they are a normal part of&nbsp;Internet Explorer. However, I find it hard to believe that Microsoft will allow this to be "normal" behavior for a system - temporary files
 that will not delete upon command, and I can't even run Microsoft's own security program because the temporary file folders are too big and won't delete. Why would Microsoft design&nbsp;the program take up so much space in those folders, and can't be&nbsp;deleted?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 If it's a temporary file, then&nbsp;I assume Windows doesn't really need&nbsp;it, or it can&nbsp;be created by the system again if it is needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I had Windows XP years ago, I could manually go into these folders and delete these files content.IE5 files.&nbsp;It seems I'm unable to do this in&nbsp;Windows 7.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These files are hogging up my system, and it's kind of frustrating that no one (MVPs/techs) can seem to figure out how to delete them, for my system to run more efficiently.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried running Malwarebyes, and the same thing happened....it self-aborted after about 3 hours, the scan was still in the same content.IE5 folder, endlessly going through millions of&nbsp;temporary files.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!! What can I do to clear my system of these files, so I can a run a full MSE&nbsp;scan?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are two other threads (one is mine), talking about the content.IE5 files. Can't tech support help us with this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_7/how-can-i-delete-all-contentie5-files/3c0bc563-c9c5-48f6-a7c9-86e863ba1554">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_7/how-can-i-delete-all-contentie5-files/3c0bc563-c9c5-48f6-a7c9-86e863ba1554</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_7/explorer-10-downloading-massive-number-of-files/1b51fbf8-9cc2-4ed2-a150-947d7e02bb5f?page=2">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_7/explorer-10-downloading-massive-number-of-files/1b51fbf8-9cc2-4ed2-a150-947d7e02bb5f?page=2</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I posted this in the Virus and Malware section since this also concerns MSE not being able to completely scan.&nbsp;The&nbsp;two above posts are in the&nbsp;other tech support categories, but since we really didn't get an answer there, maybe someone in this section can
 provide some help. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We just need to figure out how to delete&nbsp;all these files. It's okay if they build up again over time. But there&nbsp;needs to be a&nbsp;way&nbsp;for a user to delete them 'now', to clear up&nbsp;drive space, and run scans &amp; such.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to keep IE10. Overall,&nbsp;it has run much smoother than IE9 did for me,&nbsp;and I like IE better than Chrome or Firefox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks Steve! Your link provided&nbsp;the solution of going into&nbsp;Safe Mode and deleting those&nbsp;folders. I've finally&nbsp;rid my system of the pesky content.ie5 files!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were over 5 million files, totaling about 160GB of space!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran MSE in full scan mode&nbsp;afterwards,&nbsp;and it only took about an hour. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Rob. I did have the Alueron, but was able to get rid of it a few months ago using TDSS killer and Windows Defender offline. My system ran much smoother afterwards, and IE wasn't as sluggish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For anyone else experiencing a problem with not being able to delete content.IE5 files, this folder was the culprit on my machine:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Windows\sysWOW64\config\systemprofile\appdata\local\microsoft\windows\temporaryinternetfiles\content.IE5
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can't access this folder in&nbsp;regular mode. Go into safe mode (press F8 while booting the system). When there, click on "computer" and follow the folder path above to get to the sysWOW64, content.IE5 files.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I tried to highlight all the files and delete; however, after&nbsp;9 hours the system still indicated it was still "preparing" the files to be recycled, and froze up. Obviously, these are too many files for it to handle at once. So I rebooted, followed
 the path to the&nbsp;'temporaryinternetfiles' folder,&nbsp;right clicked on the "content.IE5" folder, and deleted it. It took about an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two folders seem to be the primary culprit for content.IE5. The path (see above)&nbsp;for both are the same except for the second folder in the path:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Windows\sysWOW64\...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Windows\system32\...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The content.IE5 folder in the System32 was empty after I deleted the Temporary Internet Files via Disc Cleanup. However, the sysWOW64 folder was full. There must be some sort of glitch in&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;7 Pro 64 bit, that this folder won't&nbsp;clear out properly....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps those others who are having this problem. From now on, I'll just&nbsp;periodically&nbsp;delete that folder in safe mode, since Windows won't do it.</p>

<p>Hi Yakov,</p>
<p>In Office 365, it is not feasible to have the <b>Unread Mail </b>folder in Outlook Web App (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa</a>).</p>
<p>I understand it would be nice if such feature is available in Outlook Web App as well. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:</p>

<h2>            Not getting mobile points when searching with Bing</h2>
                    I have no idea what I am doing wrong!! I always used Bing and as soon as they get a point program I signed up. I upgraded my cellphone and decided to get a Windows phone since I always use Bing as my homepage on the internet when I had my Android. I was
 so happy to see that I can get mobile points but when using my Windows phone it keeps using my PC searches instead. I looked and looked and saw it said to install the Bing app and go on your dashboard. I did all that and it still using my PC searches! Its
 been a couple of months now and its still doing it. I even tried searching on my PC first then going on my phone to search for the other things I didn't get to so I can see if my mobile point would be counted instead. NOPE!! Today I did 20 searches on my phone
 (through the app) and nothing!! WHAT AM I DOING WRONG!!!

            Of course, that was one of the first things I did. Every time I search on my phone it's not reading it as mobile. It reads and uses my PC searches. It's a cellphone, how is it using PC searches.

<h2>            Issues with new Skype Version 8.15.0.4</h2>
                    Since updating I've had ongoing issues with video calling. When I video chat with a contact, they appear but I initally appear only as the Cyberlink logo (in reverse!) My picture will then come up, flipped horizontally and the picture lags to the audio.
 I'm aware I can change the settings to flip it back as per normal, which also corrects the lagging as well, somehow, but this doesn't remain when I'm on the video call. Within in seconds it's flipped again and lagging. So frustrating!

    <title>How to get messages in shared inbox subfolder to show - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cvoice official  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get messages in shared inbox subfolder to show</h2>
                    <p>So I have my personal account and its showing up the shared inboxes fine. However, I had folders created from when I merged my company email to Microsoft365 from godaddy. Certain subfolders show that there are 100+ emails unread. Which is what it should
 be doing. However, when I click on the subfolder it just says we couldn't find anything here. What can I do to fix this?</p>

<p>Hello Cvoice,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to make sure that we are on the same page, we'd like to clarify a few items:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the issue that you are having with the subfolders, occurring on a 3rd party email account?</li><li>Is the said 3rd party email account used to signed up for Office 365? If so, is it Office 365 for business or Office 365 Home?</li><li>Would you be able to send us the exact steps that you did to configure the said email account to the Outlook application?</li><li>Can you also provide us a screenshot of when you are seeing the emails on their respective subfolders via browser?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<ul>
<li>I again, I am now using Microsoft 365. This is a Microsoft product. If you are not aware, this is basically Office 365 for business but with more features. It is not the @company.onmicrosoft,com email address if that is what you are asking. Godaddy and
 Microsoft are partners and so I have a domain name through Godaddy.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>My email is set up with Microsoft 365. I did the exact steps that are in the instructions here.&nbsp;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/dns/create-dns-records-at-godaddy?view=o365-worldwide , to set it up.
<br />
<br />
Before I did those instructions, I created a .pst file of the godaddy emails I had before so that I could import them into outlook.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>That is a severe privacy concern to request someone to send you a screenshot of their emails. This is not necessary. The emails are showing up when I am in Outlook online. I see the emails when I click on the folder. I do not understand what you are asking.
 Outlook online does not appear to be the issue so why would you possibly need a screenshot of my emails through outlook online?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Again, I do not see any of these emails, when I am the desktop outlook. It literally pulls up no emails and just says "we didn't find anything to show here". Again, there are clearly emails in this folder as outlook.com is actually pulling them up. So it
 is not a glitch in the sense that there are actually no emails there. There are.</li></ul>

<p>Hi CVoice Official,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting in our forum. For your problem, may I know if the shared folder you mentioned in your post is a shared mailbox? If so, can you successfully see the emails in the folders of your primary mailbox or in the other folders expect for the specific
 subfolders in the shared mailbox? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, as you said that it works fine in Outlook web app, I suggest you try to disable the cache mode of the Shard mailbox if you added the shared folder as an additional mailbox to Outlook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Settings…&gt; double click on your Exchange account &gt; button: More Settings &gt; tab Advanced &gt; Untick Use Cached Exchange Mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, you can also try to re-add your account to Outlook and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, to better help you, I’d like to collect some detailed information as below for further investigation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What's the version of your Outlook? You can provide us a screenshot about your product information. (File &gt; Office Account &gt; Product Information)</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What’s your current environment, exchange hybrid, on-premises exchange or Office 365 pure cloud?</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How did you add the shared mailbox to Outlook? (additional mailbox/separate account/auto mapping)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Huni</p>

<p>My mistake, yes it is a shared mailbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is only in specific folders of the shared mailbox</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the suggestions yet issues are still present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Version 1904 (Build 11601.20144 Click-to-Run). Monthly Channel</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. My subscription is Microsoft 365 for Business. The only thing set up on my computer are the office products that come with the subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. As per the instructions, the shared mailboxes got added themselves upon me adding the account. If you mean how did I online, I only know one method by using the admin center under groups and shared mailboxes..</p>

<p>Hi CVoice Official,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, the shared mailbox was auto mapped to your Outlook. In this situation, I suggest you try to add it as an additional mailbox to Outlook and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the article for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-outlook-d94a8e9e-21f1-4240-808b-de9c9c088afd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi CVoice Official,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After adding the shared mailbox as an additional mailbox to Outlook, please untick the Download shared folders option by following the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>File &gt; Account settings &gt; Account settings &gt; double click the primary account of the shared mailbox &gt; &gt; More settings &gt; Advanced &gt; untick the Download shared folders option</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, you can also try to create a new profile and see if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Re-Installing sound driver after New Build</h2>
                    Every time I update to a new Build, I need to re-install my sound driver for my motherboard. &nbsp;Everything else works except my sound. &nbsp;Is anyone else having this issue? &nbsp;Is there any way around having to re-install the driver after each update?

            <p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now since windows 10 is in developing stage and there will be no specific drivers available for this operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to download the drivers from Manufacturer’s website and install them in compatibility mode. Make sure you install the drivers according to the bit version of your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps to install a driver in compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>Right click</strong> on the setup file of the driver and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> Tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Let the driver to install and then check the functionality. </p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
Hope this helps. Keep us posted so that we can assist you further.

    <title>Pivot Table Disappears - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pivot Table Disappears</h2>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have a pivot table that summarizes data from one of the sheets in the worksheet. Every month, I download the data from another website and copy it to the source sheet
 and then change the data range for the pivot table. I used to be able to do this without any problem. However, recently, now when I change the data in the source sheet the pivot table disappears&nbsp;completely and I have to rebuild the pivot table again. What's
 causing this behavior and how can I fix it?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Tina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue has been resolved. What I had to do is whenever I create a new pivot table I have to&nbsp;turn off the option "Add this data to the Data Model". See below. Once I did that, I could change data source without having to rebuild the pivot table.

            <p>that means you are typing in the signature block, not in the message. </p>
