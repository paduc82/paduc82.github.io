<p>Hi, I am signed into the Outlook app on my Office account on my PC, I can sign into my Microsoft account through my browser but my iPhone has been asking for my password for Outlook and I can't use my phone at all as the window asking for the password won't
 go away.</p>
<p>I have had to remove Outlook from my phone altogether so I can use the phone.</p>
<p>My first thought was to log into my Microsoft account and reset my password but it won;t let me re-enter the password to do this and says that 'This Microsoft account doesn't exist' - while I am logged into mail on the next tab in my browser.</p>
<p>I am in a chat queue with Microsoft Support at the moment, I'm 12th in the queue and waiting...</p>

            <p>Hi David,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I understand that you are having an issue regarding Outlook appointments. This issue might occur due to corrupted reminder folder.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When you update any information in outlook, you need to synchronize manually to update the same in iPhone.
</p>
<p>Press <strong>Windows key + R </strong>to open the <strong>Run</strong> dialog window.
<br />
Type outlook /cleanreminders and click on OK. (There is a space between Outlook and the forward slash).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>To clear reminders from the IPhone:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Launch the Reminders app from the Home screen of your iPhone or iPad. <br />
2. Find the task that you need to completely delete. <br />
3. Swipe left or right on the task or item name.<br />
4. You'll now see a delete button appear to the right of the task name. <br />
5. Tap on Delete to remove it from the list completely. <br />
6. The task will now be deleted instead of moved to the completed section as if you were to mark it as complete to get rid of it.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are using the Office Outlook app on your IPhone, refer to iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch section in the link below:</p>

    <title>Can I link multiple tables in Access to a single pivot chart or pivot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessie_eth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I link multiple tables in Access to a single pivot chart or pivot table in Excel&#63;</h2>
                    First off, I'm very new to Access. So apologies in advance if any of these questions are naive...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have several tables with data from different project, but all tables are organized by Month/Year and District, with the same District IDs in each table (to analyze trends over time in different programs). Normally I use each table to store data (had
 previously been stored in Excel, which was unsustainable), and I access each table separately in Excel and create pivot charts/tables to analyze and depict the data graphically. I do though, sometimes need to show data from multiple tables (e.g. multiple projects).
 Is it possible with Access 2010 to access data from multiple tables into one pivot table in Excel if the "row" is always month/year (time), which is consistent throughout each table and filtering can be done by district (which is also consistent throughout
 each table).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd rather create the graphics in Excel because the interface is much better (why do Access graphics look so dated?), and inserting slicers with the pivot charts makes it more user friendly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any advice/tips would be extremely appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

            <p>I would first create a union query, then base my graph on that:</p>
<p>select myfield1, myfield2, ...&nbsp;from table1</p>

<p>union all</p>
<p>select myfield1, myfield2, ...&nbsp;from table3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or better yet, first normalize the database design so all this similar data is in one table.</p>

            Hi Tom,
<div><br />
<div>First off, thanks for your reply. And please forgive my ignorance, but I'm not entirely sure how to create a union query. When I click on "Union" in the query tab it just gives me a blank white worksheet, and I'm not sure what to do with it then.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ideally, I want to keep the data in separate tables as each program has data dating back to 2008 with around 800 districts. So in each table, there is information listed for each of the 800 districts, with each district having around 60+ rows of data (and
 counting). And each table contains different fields (some around 30 fields). I'm afraid having it all in one table would get messy.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So if I can create this Union Query ,would I then be able to access that query in Excel to create a pivot table/chart?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again, I'm a new Access user and just getting my head around it all.</div>
        </p>

            That's right, Access does not have a designer for union queries, nor do many other tools. Rather you are supposed to know a little bit about query syntax and type in your sql statement. I gave you an example that's pretty close. The Help file also has
 info on this type of query.<br />
<br />
I understand the desire to keep data separate, but that's an Excel-way of thinking and not at all a Relational Database way of thinking. As an example think of teh Northwind sample application which is about customers and their orders. Some business owner might
 say "I want an order table for each customer so we can keep them apart". Database designers would say LUDICROUS, you just add a CustomerID field to the Orders table, and if you want to see the orders for customer 5 you query: select * from Orders where CustomerID
 = 5. Some might say: but I'm going to have SO many rows, that must be slow. Again the database designer would (with a sense for drama :-)) say LUDICROUS: the power of indexing GUARANTEES very fast queries.<br />
<br />
Your situation is a bit different if I understand you correctly, because you would say: the fields in each Order table are different. In your case in each District. So you have 800 tables, each with different fields. Well, perhaps not THAT bad, I'm sure SOME
 fields occur in most or all, like DistrictID (autonumber, PK) and ZipCode (text5, required, duplicate index).<br />
<br />
There are two ways to solve this:<br />
1. (if there are certain patterns that arise, with groups of districts having more or less the same fields) Have a Districts table with the main fields that everyone has, and one table per group with the additional fields. They would be linked 1:1 (in a one-to-one
 relation) to the main table.<br />
<br />
2. (if there are no discernible patterns) the classic solution is to create a M:M (many-to-many) relation with 3 tables: Districts as above with the common fields. Attributes (AttributeID autonumber PK; AttributeName text50 required uniqueindex), and AttributesForDistricts
 (DistrictID long int required PK; AttributeID long int required PK, TheValue long int required). The Attributes table would have one row for each field you have today, probably things like 1=PopulationCount, 2=RestaurantCount, 3=ParticipantsInProgramXCount,
 etc. Then in what's often called the "junction" table AttributesForDistrict you would put things like:<br />
District=1, Attribute=1, TheValue=5000<br />
District=1, Attribute=3, TheValue=20<br />
District=2, Attribute=1, TheValue=4000<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Believe me, this is the relational way, and it has proven over 50 years to be superior to any other organization of data. It will pay dividends every time, whereas your solution is going to be one big struggle.<br />
<br />
One more example: how do you enter your data, or report on it? Surely you don't want to create 800 forms with 800 different sets of fields. In my example there is one form and one subform.<br />
<br />

            Hi Tom,
<div><br />
<div>I may not have been entirely clear in my previous explanation, 800 tables would be a nightmare! I actually have three main tables, one for each program we run. Each table has the following consistent information: District and month/year. So since most
 of the programs started in Jan 2008, each of the 800 districts has a row for every month between Jan 2008 and now. We set it up this way to the x-axis in graphing is month/year so we can show trends in the project overtime within the districts.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Example:</div>
<div><br />
<div>District &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Month/Year &nbsp; &nbsp;Info1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Info2....</div>
<div>District 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jan-08 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10</div>
<div>District 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Feb-08 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;11</div>
<div>District 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mar-08 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10</div>
<div>.....</div>
<div>District 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May-13 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12</div>
<div>District 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jan-08 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17</div>
<div>District 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Feb-08 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 16 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12</div>
<div>.....</div>
<div>District 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May-13 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;21</div>
<div>.....</div>
<div>District 800 &nbsp; &nbsp; Jan-08 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Each program though, is different, and thus we collect different information/indicators for them, which is why they are in separate tables, and we mostly only access information by program. Sometimes though, we need to triangulate the data to see if all
 of the programs are showing similar trends for early warning for emergencies, etc. We still show the data overtime, and simply overlay indicators from separate tables to look for similar trends (each program targets different aspects of malnutrition).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It IS possible to put all the information into one giant merged table, but, if there is another way around this by keeping the tables (programs) separate, I think that may be the preferable option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I see what you mean with the syntax for the union query. This shouldn't be a problem, I write syntax all day long using Stata! I can learn this particular syntax, I believe. But I also want to make accessing this data relatively easy for my colleagues
 who are not data savy, but know how to create excel graphs by linking to Access tables.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So if I can manage a union query, would it be possible to create a union query that can be access by Excel?</div>

<h2>            How can I save a document in .PDF format from Microsoft Word 2000&#63;</h2>
                    Word 2000 still works under Windows 7, but it doesn't have native .PDF creation abillities as do the latest versions. Is there any plug-in, add-on, or external utility that can let me create a .PDF file from a Word 2000 document? Thanks!

<p>I would add that for the type of files can I insert as printing, the progress bar is not even visible so it's fast, it is instantaneous. I just try it with a "large" file PDF (10 MB) operation lasted barely two seconds. A Word file from a few KB file never
 ends.<br />
<br />
I can insert a Word file as an attachment and double click works very well. Only insert Word files as printout (or old Word files (before Office 2010), rtf or odt) as printout is impossible and only with these type of files.</p>

            Unfortunately, this approach is not going to work. The problem is occasional and I can't run in safe mode on an ongoing basis. I can run for a week with no issues and receive all attachments. Then a few don't come through (and there is no option in the
 client to try to download them a second time so I can't get those on the client). Then attachments start to download again.&nbsp;

            Having the exact same issue. I actually just setup Outlook 2016 for the first time, and it's not even done with the initial sync. Already, though, there are three attachment sync errors (17890) and it doesn't give a single bit of info on which emails they're
 from, and since I've had this account for maybe 8 or so years now, I can't just quickly go check which emails are missing attachments. Considering it's a Microsoft client hooked up to a Microsoft service, this is pretty damn annoying. You'd think it'd just
 work.

            Would be nice if Microsoft, as the owner of this software, stepped in to comment here. I have seen similar issues posted on various forums but no suitable answer provided on any of them. It appears to be a bug. Microsoft, could you step in here to comment
 and provide guidance on how/when this could be addressed?

<h2>            I can not call Skype for the web and can not login to skype &#40;use WindowsÐ¥Ð &#41;</h2>
                    <p>(I took advantage of the Ukrainian-English translator, so I'm sorry if something is not clear).<br />
</p>
<p>I am using the WindowsXP system. From 30/12/2018 I can not log in to Skype 7.36.(Update does not help).<br />
After entering the password:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
"We can't sign you in<br />
JavaScript is required to sign in. Your browser either does not support JavaScript or it is being blocked.<br />
Enable JavaScript in your browser or use one which supports it."<br />
<br />
JavaScript in my web browser is turned on (Firefox, Internet Explorer)<br />
<br />
I took Skype for the web, but I can not make a call, just write a message. <br />
<br />
</p>
<p>What to do to call Skype for the web or can I do something to use Skype in Windows XP?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you mentioned you are trying to use the Skype app on your Windows XP. I&nbsp;must express my regret to inform you that Skype for Windows XP is not supported anymore. Which is why you are not able to sign in using the app. In regards to using Skype Web,
 the minimum requirements of using that will be on the latest version of Google Chrome or using Microsoft Edge. Further information about the Skype requirements is in this FAQ:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?q=requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What are the system requirements for Skype</a>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, we would like to hear more about getting Skype on the older version of Windows. I highly suggest to forward this feedback to our developers in our User Voice site in this link:

            <p>sounds like the phone is stuck in a bootloader mode. kind of similar to BIOS on a PC. it's usually acessed by holding down other buttons when switching on - you might have a button stuck down. I'm not sure what the HD7 combination is, but given your low
 volume - start with the volume down button.</p>
<p>Try giving all the buttons a good excercise, maybe blow some compressed air around them, or a small paintbrush, and you might be able to work it free, otherwise maybe see if there is a button combination for a hard reset. if none of the above helps, it's
 time for warranty repair I'm afraid.</p>

<p>There only other option would be using an Exchange Server. Outlook sync does not happen via cable at all.

            It's from the message source - part of the style sheet. It's in every HTML message.
<br />
<br />I would look at templates or security scanners corrupting messages, but it should be on all messages (except plain text), not just internal messages.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/646b8a33-49eb-4704-afa2-d8016589fa15?upload=true" />

<p>Thank you,&nbsp; can you tell me where in McAfee I can find the "disable the outgoing mail",&nbsp; It now seems to also ask me if I really&nbsp; want to send an email to certain people, even inter office so it makes sense it is McAfee causing the issues,&nbsp; I hope so!!&nbsp;
 Thank you so much</p>

            Do the labels print correctly on plain paper? Often the problem is a printer paper-handling issue? If that's the case, there's not a lot you can do about it in Word. If not, have you added a header to the Normal template? That will throw off the formatting
 of labels.

<p>After I log in to Ovi Nokia I try to download apps like Facebook, Snaptu and others, but I receive a message error that says "no valid certificate" and download doesn't begin. What's the problem? Is it my phone? It's true it isn't an Eseries or Cseries,
 but it is a cute Nokia from 2007. I also have an internet connection, so this isn't a problem.</p>
<p>Anyone, please? Thank you.</p>

            certificate means the securities on your phone. Try setting back the date to Jan 1 of this year and install. Also, try reinstalling firmware.

    <title>Activation Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khu_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation Issue</h2>
                    <p>I seem to be unable to activate my office license because "specified Product Key has already been activated the maximum number of times." This is rich considering the last 4 re-installs were due to a problems with microsoft products (dead surface, corrupted
 windows user profile, and then battling install issues with an older access runtime which apparently has to be installed in exactly the right order). So after this extended nightmare I am supposed to buy another license?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great business model Microsoft, build terrible products that requires constant reinstall of operating system and/or software, and then ask customer to purchase more licenses because they have exceed the number of allowed actications?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got nowhere with phone support and was disconnected from chat. I really wish there was a good alternative to Office because I hate to give Microsoft another cent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had any luck getting a product activated after exceeding number of allowed activations? How?</p>

            This is a new install on my new computer.&nbsp; Office 2016 Pro Plus, all applications continuously ask for activation code on each opening.&nbsp; I've entered it each time...yet it does it again...as if I'm on a trial.&nbsp; Must I Uninstall and Re-Install the software?&nbsp;
 I used my b/u disc for the original installation and it never asked me for my activation code on the Install.

                    <p>This is an ongoing issue I have also heard from many other people both online and offline concerning Windows Defender, even with ALL current updates downloaded and applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender keeps saying my computer is "potentially unprotected", anywhere from 1 to 3 days at any given time because it "hasn't been scanned in a while".&nbsp; Once I do a scan it goes back to the regular green, saying protected, but then at any given
 random time shortly after, it goes back to the same message and yellow and orange border/boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have inserted a screen shot showing what I mean. I need anyone to help me with this problem. I have spoken to Microsoft online tech support numerous times about this, and it still is doing this with Windows Defender. It is also doing it on my laptop, both
 with Windows 10, anniversary update and all current patches and security updates downloaded and applied. All my drivers are also updated.</p>

<p>I have the same issue as Ernie, but do not have CCleaner installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like the issue started after getting the Windows 10 Anniversary update. Now every day Windows Defender complains it's potentially unprotected. It also seems it's stopped automatically scanning as the last scan date is 22nd September, which is when
 I did a manual quick scan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I also just noticed I got the Anniversary update (v1607) on the 21st September, so exactly when I started getting the notifications and did the manual scan.</p>

<h2>            I have installed Visioviewer2010 in IE8 with Win7 now the Cntrl&#43;F isn&#39;t working. What&#39;s wrong&#63;</h2>
                    Can anybody advise me on how to solve the problem with the Find (Cntrl+F) in visioviewer2010.<br />
In Win XP with IE7 everything was working fine with visioviewer 2007 but on my new installation it's not working.<br />
<br />
I have tried several things,<br />
<ul>
<li>Tried the Find on a normal webpage is working fine.</li><li>Installed SP1 from here <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2460065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2460065</a> no result.</li></ul>
On the Office forum they advised me to post my question over here because they belief it's an explorer issue.<br />
<br />
I hope there is someone who can tell me how to get this working. It means a lot to me so I can get my work done.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jan Willem<br />

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Even your first post in this thread suggested the problem was in Visio Viewer, not Internet Explorer, Jan.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;reference&nbsp;to your WinXP computer &amp; IE7 in your first post confused me, too.</p>
<p>That being said...</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Please answer&nbsp;<em>each&nbsp;of the following diagnostic questions</em> in a numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>1b. Did Win7 come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7, or did you upgrade from Vista to Win7?
</p>
<p>2a. Is Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (already) installed? See...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ Which version of the Windows operating system am I running?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/which-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-am-i-running" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/which-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-am-i-running</a>
</p>
<p>2b. Is it a Win7 64-bit computer?&nbsp; See...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</a>
</p>
<p>3. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed
<em>on the computer?</em></p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on
<em>the computer</em> when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>6. Are ALL of the following updates listed in <strong>View installed updates</strong> (<em>not</em> Update History)? [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ KB2618444, KB2639417, KB2620712, KB2619339; KB2641690, KB2588516, KB2544521&nbsp;&amp;
<em><strong>KB2633171 or KB2556532</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ KB2572076 <em>or KB2572077</em> [&lt;=TELL ME WHICH ONE]</p>
<p>7. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>8. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; CCleaner)?</p>
<p>9. You were <em>not</em> having any problems using <strong>CTRL+F</strong> in IE8&nbsp;<em>before</em> you installed Visio Viewer 2010, is that correct?</p>
<p>10. Open Favorites Center [<strong>ALT+C</strong>] and tell me if the <strong>
Favorites</strong>, <strong>Feeds</strong> and/or <strong>History</strong> tabs are missing?</p>
<p>11. Finally, does the Win7 computer belong to you or your employer, Jan?</p>

            <p>I <em>think</em> I may have figured out what you're referring to, Jan.</p>
<p>Are you accessing a Visio diagram or drawing (e.g., a <strong>VSD</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>VSS</strong> file) via Internet Explorer and finding that
<strong>CTRL+F </strong>is not working (i.e.,&nbsp;when you attempt to search the shape data for, e.g., a word)?</p>
<p>If you download the <strong>VSD </strong>or <strong>VSS</strong> file to, e.g., your desktop and then open the file in Visio Viewer, do you have the same problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Q: ...does the Win7 computer belong to you or your employer...?<br />
A: It's a [company-owned] laptop<br />

<p>Have you consulted your company's IT Department or SysAdmin about&nbsp;this?</p>

            <p>It's great having you trying to find my problem many thanks in advance this for the record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VSD file is on my local disk (My Documents) when I open the file automatically visio viewer is started which opens the VSD file in IE. After agreeing with some warnings my file is opened in IE. Indeed you can pan and zoom but if you are searching for
<p>When I do a search on a webpage for "Customer" then all words beginning with C then u, etc are highlighted yellow. What isn't happening within the VSD file.</p>
<p>Indeed I have consulted my IT department but they couldn't find out the reason why this is working inside XP IE7 and not within Win7 IE8.</p>
<p>If you like I can send you a VSD file for testing just let me know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no difference between the file on my desktop or in my documents.</p>

<strong>Visio Viewer</strong> &amp; check the "Always open with..." option | OK your way out &amp; test by using CTRL+F in Visio Viewer standalone.</p>
<p>2. If search results on a webpage (i.e., <em>not </em>Visio Viewer loaded in an instance of Internet Explorer) are highlighted in yellow, that highlighting is done by an Add-on you have installed (e.g., Google Toolbar). Such highlighting is not default behavior
 in any version of Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>3. Per my follow-up&nbsp;post&nbsp;in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-visio/is-there-somebody-who-can-tell-me-how-to-find/b92b76f3-7ffe-46e5-aeb5-abaf164054a6">
your Visio 2010 forum&nbsp;thread</a> (to which no one has replied&nbsp;as yet), my research suggests that while one can pan &amp; zoom a figure and some rendering&nbsp;&amp; display settings are available, one cannot search&nbsp;text data (e.g., words or numbers)&nbsp;in a figure accessed&nbsp;via
 Visio Viewer (whether displayed in Visio Viewer or Visio Viewer loaded in an instance of&nbsp;Internet Explorer).</p>
<p>If that is <em>not </em>true AND such searches <em>do work</em> in Visio Viewer
<em><u>2010</u></em> loaded in an instance of IE7 on your WinXP computer, one or more of your IE8-in-Win7 Add-ons
<em>could be</em> causing the behavior.</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>Yes, this is somewhat complicated...especially since I'm not at all familiar with any version of Visio Viewer!</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp;I'm sure the experts in&nbsp;this Office IT Pro forum would know much more about this than I do&nbsp;=&gt;

            <p>Yes you are opening my eyes with you second explenation, in my IE is Bing my default search engine. In my former OS and IE installation this was not the case. So combining point 2 and 3 are telling me to remove Bing.</p>
<p>Now I am trying to remove Bing as an Add-on but this is not easy becaue the remove button is greyed out.</p>
<p>Do I have to install an other search engine before this removal is possible?</p>
<p>Your right on the issue visio viewer is an stand-alone application which uses IE as a medium to display the drawing by Active X.</p>
<p>Indeed I have set the VSD files to open always with this is done automatically with the installation of visio viewer.</p>
<p>Your a great help so far !!!</p>
<p>I'am sorting out how to remove Bing and executing a search.</p>

<p>2. As I said earlier, I've never used Visio Viewer. Have VSD files (i.e., ones that you already saved to your hard-drive)&nbsp;<em>ever</em> opened in a standalone Visio Viewer window or do they always open in Visio Viewer embedded in an IE window?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Is Visio Viewer <em><u>2010</u></em> (SP1) installed on the WinXP computer?</p>
<p>4a. What's the full name of the installed McAfee application (e.g., McAfee VirusScan Enterprise; McAfee Total Protection; McAfee Antivirus Plus; McAfee Security Center)?</p>
<p>4b. Is the very same McAfee application installed on the WinXP computer?</p>

    <title>Sum Data Based on Drop Down Selection Beside it. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elizabeth97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sum Data Based on Drop Down Selection Beside it.</h2>
                    <p>So I'm in the process of updating my budgeting spreadsheet, and I'd like to be able to add together the spendings/savings I've categorised as such, in overall totals underneath that weeks table, but I'm not sure how to go about it. (Bonus if pie or bar graph
 can contain said data too, but not necessary).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got 3 columns, the one on the left for the description/place of purchase (or if it's savings set aside). The middle one for the amount (negative if spending, positive if paid or transferred). and the one on the right with the drop down boxes with the
 type of spending it was. eg. groceries, bills, gifts, entertainment, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every 5 or so rows I have a row containing the date to help track spendings that way too, that interrupts the flow of drop down boxes, if that makes sense. (4 boxes, then date, then 4 boxes then date, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's any more information needed, I'd be happy to provide, as I'd just like to get this working, haha :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa1a160e-157c-4be7-ae19-803cf6cd21f5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa1a160e-157c-4be7-ae19-803cf6cd21f5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>(The brightly coloured cells are the drop down boxes, they change colour depending on the category chosen.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c385b0c5-089b-4e8c-b4d1-b68cc826b045?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c385b0c5-089b-4e8c-b4d1-b68cc826b045?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Where I want the data to go) The cells on the right in their colours automatically add up the cells in the relevant categories when manually input there, I just want it automated.</p>

            Hi SanjV, sadly there isn't a way to transfer purchases made under one Xbox to another Xbox Account. To let someone else use the content license, you must download your Xbox Live profile to their Xbox 360 console. Then, transfer your content licenses to that Xbox 360 console.
<br />See 'Can I transfer content from one Xbox Live account to another?'

<h2>            Windows Mobile 10 - How to turn off voice notifications while listening to a bluetooth speaker</h2>
                    <p>When listening to music over Bluetooth, a voice notification inturupts the music to ask if you would like to ignore the message. It seemed that in earlier WP versions, this was in the voice/speech or Bluetooth settings? Can anyone repo?</p>

            <p>To fix this it appears as though one has to mute each conversation individually.&nbsp; Bring up the conversation, you want to mute.</p>
<p>Look for the 3 dots on the lower right of your screen.</p>
<p>Tap on&nbsp;that menu &amp; select mute conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That worked for me.</p>
