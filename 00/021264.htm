    <title>Strange From Address When Using Outlook 2016 Desktop App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeyg_45m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange From Address When Using Outlook 2016 Desktop App</h2>
                    <p>I've just been upgraded to the new outlook.com on my office 365 personal subscription. As part of this I had to setup a new mail profile and re-download all of my mail to my desktop, no major problem so far but.....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's now something very funky going on. When I send a message from the DESKTOP application, the default 'from' address is outlook_&lt;16 or so random characters&gt;@outlook.com.
<br />
As a result, unless I remember to change the from address manually to my normal *** Email address is removed for privacy *** address when it's received at the other end, it looks like a very poorly constructed scam.<br />
Worst if the recipient then replies directly to the 'from' address of outlook_&lt;16 or so random characters&gt;@outlook.com it just disappears, I never receive it!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even weirder, if the recipient opens the email from me using live.outlook.com, they actually see it as being all correctly formatted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just a nightmare! What's going on with the newly upgraded exchange server interface to the desktop client. I have no faith that my emails are being sent properly.

            <p>Hi Mikey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve your concern, we suggest that you <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">repair</a></strong> your Outlook 2016 application.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion. I've performed the full repair and there's no improvement it's exactly as it was.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not really that surprised, I think this is a back-end issue for the Microsoft exchange as it doesn't handle my connected account properly now either. If I receive an email from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (the connected account) it's correctly flagged as coming
 from that account in both the desktop and webclient (a neat new feature) but if I reply to the incoming email from the desktop app, or from my iPhone, it gets flagged as having come from the the funky outlook_&lt;16 or so random characters&gt;@outlook.com address.
 If I reply to the incoming message from the webclient it correctly sends the message, and it even appears to the recipient as though it came from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Annoyingly though when I send a message using outlook (desktop, iPhone or web client) using my connected account, by replying to a message which has been sent to me on *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, no matter what client I use the message I send doesn't get recorded
 in my sent items. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A big shame as it was finally looking like the outlook desktop client was going to correctly allow all of the different connected accounts and aliases used on this account to be handled by picking from the "From" drop down when composing a message (functionality
 which was previously only available from the web-client), but it doesn't look like they've quite got it right.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards Mikey</p>

<p>
</p><p>I also have some outlook-addresses on the same account (you can make those on outlook.com). When I send emails I can choose these. The default remains the random address. It also seems this address doesnt work, at least so I heared form people who replied.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Regrettably I wouldn't hold out too much hope that the Answer Desk will be able to do anything for you. I've spent 4 hours on line with these guys. They barely understood the problem and kept generating incoherent explanations as to why it was doing what
 it was doing. </p>
<p>I was elevated to Level 2 support - all the fun of repeating all the information and issues again - but no more knowledgeable.
</p>
<p>I was refused to Level 3 support as "they won't accept the issue". </p>
<p>&lt;Rant&gt;</p>
<p>Perhaps this could be referred internally by Microsoft to someone who understands the problem and has some chance of fixing it rather than requesting users waste their time banging on the door with tech support who can't do anything - or even better perhaps
 Microsoft could manage their own migration issues better so that the functionality they're rolling out actually works.
</p>
<p>Long live the cloud - it's really is so much better when other professionals manage your infrastructure competently for you.
</p>
<p>&lt;/Rant&gt;</p>

            <p>OK</p>
<p>So i've been through to the answer desk people again today. After a lot of time explaining the problems
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>again</em></span></strong>,&nbsp; I was eventually told that this is not something that normal office 365 home help can provide assistance with, as the desktop application is connected via Exchange.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was eventually put through to pro support who told me they can't help as I'm a home user and not entitled to the support. Also they told me that they don't recommend connecting to the office 365 home using exchange - but I can't change this as it's configured
 automatically when I add the account through the desktop outlook application. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So essentially Microsoft have upgraded my account to a pro service, without me requesting it, broken it and now refusing to provide support.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do I turn to now?</p>
<p />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>So it gets better. Microsoft support now tell me that because its connected via exchange, that I have to go to pro support.</p>
<p>After another 45 minutes discussing this with pro support admin, I'm told that I need to go through to a technician (who would have though that when talking to support, you wouldn't be talking to a technician). But to be put through to a technician there
 is an up front charge of $499! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I refused to pay (remember I'm paying about £80 / year for my home subscription, which before Microsoft did an internal upgrade worked just fine) I get put through to standard installation and download support again, who after 10 minutes simply went
 quiet then hung up one me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft - something has gone seriously wrong with the account upgrade migration you performed. Your support teams seem incapable of understanding there's a problem or notifying anyone of it. Please get someone who can understand the problem, and who can
 do something about it, to get in touch. You're putting home users onto Exchange and then refusing to provide us with any support.</p>
<p>It just doesn't make any sense.<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As MS partners we had an Office 365 Entreprise E3 plan for a year on domainonmicrosoft.com. This year we brought the 5 users in our domain from domainonmicrosoft.com.</p>
<p>The problem is that the outlook which was installed from the old plan's user is no more valid and if I install the offline office 2016 from the users site, I get errors in outlook. I tried this:</p>

<p><span>Even with </span>Option 3 (manual steps to uninstall the office 2016) we have errors in outlook.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi AdmininistratorPPerformance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand your situation, I’d like to collect the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Regarding “<em>if I install the offline office 2016 from the users site, I get errors in outlook</em>”, when did the error messages happen, in installing Office 2016 or using the newly installed one?</li><li>Since the three error screenshots show as German, can you translate them to English or provide the error screenshots with English?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gary </p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The errors come at the <strong>first try to open outlook after reinstalling office 2016</strong> from the users page of office 365.</p>
<p>(there were cases when it worked for a couple of times to open outlook with a different profile, but after that it failed again with the same 3 errors).</p>
<p>2. the 3 errors are:</p>
<p>Err1:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cfcbb90a-3ba5-4b55-a12c-0d580a1490a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cfcbb90a-3ba5-4b55-a12c-0d580a1490a6" /></a></p>
<p>Err2: </p>
<p>"The System resources are very low- Close some windows."</p>
<p>Err3:</p>

            <p>Hi Teo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you the customer “<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b849b78f-66b4-4c27-82bd-dfb2621bf06e" title="admininistratorPPerformance"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>admininistratorPPerformance</strong></span></a>”?
 If yes, according to the screenshots and the video you provided, the issue might be related to the Outlook account that is configured in the client and the profile. Given the situation, have you deleted and created your Office 365 account in the profile or
 created a new profile to fix the issue as the video suggested? If not, please try it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if the issue still exists, please try the following solutions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the Support and Recovery Assistant (<a href="https://diagnostics.office.com/#/?env=Prod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SaRA</a>) tool.</li></ul>
<p>If the issue can’t be fixed, please provide us with the output of SaRA for further troubleshooting.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Please select <strong>Outlook</strong> &gt; <strong>Outlook failed to start</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/beedafe6-eec3-4b57-8624-a93b195810a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/beedafe6-eec3-4b57-8624-a93b195810a3" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the registry keys under:</li></ul>
<p><strong><em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles\Outlook</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a related thread for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook/re-after-upgrade-outlook-2016-will-not-launch/eccaa9bf-e783-47e8-a819-e7306eb12be4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook/re-after-upgrade-outlook-2016-will-not-launch/eccaa9bf-e783-47e8-a819-e7306eb12be4</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, the Outlook client will repopulate the OST data when configuring your Office 365 account in the client.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: deleting the registry keys may cause potential issues, as a result, please back up relevant keys before any action. Moreover, if the profile contains other accounts (like POP account), please also back up the email data before you
 delete the registry key or delete the profile via control panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Gary and thanks for the sugestions.</p>
<p>I am the administratorPPerformance and I'll do what you sugested as soon as I can put my hands on the two computers with the problem - the user is not in office right now...</p>
<p>The video I provided from youtube was not directly related to my problem but had the same errors (1st and 3rd, at least) in English - the fix they sugest did not work in my case. Think I have to try SaRA tool and send the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll come back as soon as I have access to the 2 computers of the user.</p>
<p>Thnx again,</p>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had access to one of the two computers with that user...</p>
<p>I erased from the registry the entry you sugested and ran the SaRA program from the link you provided.</p>
<p>I still have the errs but outlook opens and can be used, so far.</p>
<p>Unfortunately both computers are laptops and are away with the person who works from them. Only at my request in if he can, I can have access to them... like yesterday afternoon, I asked the person to leave one laptop for analyze and tests. This explains
 the slow path in debugging the problem. Today till Monday, I have no access to any of the computers.</p>
<p>The SaRA program gave me a hint - see picture bellow.</p>
<p>I'll also do what they sugest with SRV record in our provider site.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8f0fb06-2f99-4f91-b17f-65290b573575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8f0fb06-2f99-4f91-b17f-65290b573575" /></a></p>
<p>I'll come back with more results as soon as I have again access to the computer - after I delete the entry mentioned in the MS sugestion.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Teo</p>

            <p>Hi Teo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook client uses autodiscover service to get your Office 365 account configuration from Exchange server. If you have added a CNAME record which points to autodoscover.outlook.com to your custom domain, you don’t need to add the extra SRV record.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    How to perform wildcard or partial word search?? <br />
<br />
Not just in the beginning but in the middle or at the end of a word. Doesn't matter if it takes all day, let me decide. Reason why we store info in OneNote - to be able to retrieve it.

Here's my example:<br />

            OneNote 2010 can't do that either. I've seen several threads now that talk about this shortcoming in ON. Hey OneNote developers... are you listening!!??? Why is it so difficult to implement a more robust search??
<br />
<br />
It's not uncommon to look for every occurrence of <span style="font-weight: bold">
2010</span> when you have entries such as...<br />
<br />
dog<span style="font-weight: bold">2010</span><br />

            The lack of the ability to do basic partial or wildcard searches is the ONLY reason I am considering evernote.

I could even live with having it just match the start of words, but it breaks up "words" when there is a period involved.&nbsp; I record ip addresses in a lot of my notes so if you have<br />
<br />
192.168.1.5<br />
<br />
and you want to search for all "192.168" it will give you anything with 192 and 168 but not necessarily "192.168".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So frustrating.&nbsp; It has so many nice features, but is so lacking in something so simple.&nbsp;

            Its already been over several months, and still OneNote developers dont seems to identify this as a VERY important function, which is available in even basic text editors (Free).

<div>If anyone found a solution, (way to do partial search in Onenote) please do share.</div>

<h2>            Error Code 80004005 when I try to log into OneNote</h2>
                    <p>I have OneNote installed on my Android tablet. I am logged into Word, and I logged into OneNote online. I still get the error 80004005 when I try to log in. I un-installed and re-installed to no avail. Most of the answers involve SharePoint ( I am using
 a personal account) or syncing errors, but I cannot log in at all. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to use OneNote as an example to my team at work, but if I cannot even log in, I will never get them to use it. What does the error 80004005 mean?</p>

                    I have double checked the settings on my email and it is correct - it shows my first and last name as I would like it to appear on outgoing emails.&nbsp; A friend informed me that my emails to him were coming in showing "Me" as the sender, instead of my first
 and last name appearing.&nbsp; Any idea on why my name is not showing correctly through outlook?&nbsp; I sent an email using my servers email program and it was sent correctly.

<p>Thank you for the response. It seems that you are using Internet Explorer version 10 or the latest one. If the Content Advisor can't open using the command. Please refer to the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is advisable for Windows 10 pro user, since we need to pull up Group policy Editor.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> and type in <strong>gpedit.msc</strong> then hit Enter.
</li><li>Locate <strong>User Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Internet Explorer -&gt; Internet Control Panel -&gt; Content Page.</strong></li><li>Once you're there, you will see <strong>Show Content Advisor on Internet Options
</strong>on the right pane. </li><li>Click on it and choose <strong>Enabled</strong>. Hit <strong>Apply </strong>and
<strong>Ok</strong>. </li><li>After that, open the run box by pressing <strong>Windows </strong><strong>key
</strong>+ <strong>R</strong>, and type in <strong>inetcpl</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>cpl
</strong>to open Internet Options. </li><li>Go to <strong>Content </strong>tab and enable the <strong>Content Advisor</strong>.
</li></ol>
<p>Let us know if this resolves your concern. </p>

<h2>            Gimp Question</h2>
                    <p>I created xcf files in Gimp.&nbsp; I can convert those to jpg.&nbsp; However, I need to fit the jpg files in a pre-created template.&nbsp; I have to send these to a card company to create cards.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can do this in Word, by saving the template and inserting in the jpg file.&nbsp; However, I have a couple questions.&nbsp; Is the best way to do this in Word or can it be done in Gimp?&nbsp; I don't know how to move a file in Gimp into the Template.&nbsp; Also, I would like
 to create a black border between the red and green lines.&nbsp; Is that possible?&nbsp; Is that easier in Word or Gimp?</p>

<p>Inserting the picture files in Word is not just the best way, it's the only way (unless you have lots of knowledge about Word's extensions of XML and associated programming, but you can't do that in Gimp anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What "red and green lines" are you referring to? It's best to take a screen shot, save it as a file, and use the Insert Image icon in the top line of the reply editor.</p>

                    <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Hey guys,</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Sory if this has been asked before but I could not locate an answer.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Here is my situation,</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I'm in the USAF and deploy down to Antarctica. They do not have access to our home station GAL, so in the past I was told they somehow exported the entire list.. this is not a few contacts, but the entire Air forces address
 list. And uploaded it to the "exchange server" down on the ice. </font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Now I just cross trained into this career field so forgive me if I do not know all the tech terms and workings of outlook yet and I do not know what programs the technician before me used.. Only that he found a way to save
 the Address list and import it to the servers down there.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I work in the shop that manages the servers on base so I imagine admin rights should not be a problem.</font></font></font></p>

            <p>Here are two alternatives</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Option 1 - Part 1 (in current location)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a) Follow the instructions in the article below to move your GAL contacts to a local contact folder</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Exporting the Offline Address Book or GAL<br />
<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msoutlook.info/question/694</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>b) Export the contact folder to a CSV file</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Option 1 - Part 2 (in destination location)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>c) import the CSV file using the Outlook import wizard to a contact folder in a PST file</p>
<p>d) if you want it on the Exchange server there - create a public folder and move the contact items to it</p>
<p>e) designate whichever folder from (d) to show as an Outlook Email Address Book</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Option 2 - using a 3rd party program</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any of the ContactGenie programs with export functionality (for this - either QuickPort or Exporter would suffice) may be of interest</p>
<p><br />

<p><a href="http://www.contactgenie.com/import_overview.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.contactgenie.com/import_overview.htm</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regardless of CG program used</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a) export the GAL to a CSV file (or any supported file format</p>
<p>b) at destination, import the file from step (2a) into any contact folder (local or public) and designate it to be shown as an email address book</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are ways to export the GAL at the server level but assuming you don't have Exchange Server level access and not completely conversant with the options for the various Exchange server versions (which may or may not be the same for all versions of EX)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Contrary to common belief running a macro doesn't clear the undo stack. It's the action of a macro writing to or changing&nbsp;the workbook that clears the stack and while the difference may seem subtle it can be used to advantage.</p>
<p>You can write your own UNDO routine but in my view this is more trouble than it's worth. Have a look here.</p>
<p><a href="http://spreadsheetpage.com/index.php/tip/undoing_a_vba_subroutine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://spreadsheetpage.com/index.php/tip/undoing_a_vba_subroutine/</a></p>
<p>You could output your macro results to another workbook but depending on what your doing this may not be possible. If you do adopt this approach then you can read the result back in using a formula and the undo stack is preserved</p>
<p>'lots of code<br />
myresult = Range("A1") ^ 3 / Range("A2").Value<br />
Workbooks("Results book.xlsx").Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1").Value = myresult</p>
<p>and in the original workbook you read back the value with a formula.</p>
<p>='[results book.xlsx]Sheet1'!$A$1</p>

<h3> jvwilliams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.OST file suddenly renamed by Outlook 2016 - what on earth&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have no idea what happened but this morning my Outlook client refused to connect to Office 365. My laptop was on overnight and my client left running and no reboots or updates seem to have happened overnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning my Outlook was sitting there as "disconnected" and whenever I looked at the Send/Receive progress bar there was nothing. No errors, no status, no anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened Control Panel and tried to see if I could find a problem with the Data Files and that is where things turned very odd indeed. I opened the location of the data files to see my mailbox name (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) was still there along with several new
 files:</p>
<p>
</p><p>email.domain - firstname.ost </p>
<p>email.domain - firstname.nst</p>
<p>email.domain - firstname.ost (2)</p>
<p>email.domain - firstname.ost (3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus several XML files starting with the word "Inferences"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like my Outlook client spontaneously renamed my Outlook data file and added "- firstname to my OST file, then did it a bunch more times and then gave up. I removed all of the odd looking files, started Outlook again and now I have a new email@domain
 - firstname.ost file and my client is now synchronizing my entire damned mailbox to my laptop which is hammering my Internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a private account and it did the same to that: appended '- firstname' to that OST file as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could possibly have caused this? Any ideas? </p>
<p />

            <p>Hi JVWilliams,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, Outlook won<span>’</span>t automatically rename the OST file.</p>
<p>Given the situation, I suggest you check if there is any specific add-ins in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, for the renamed OST files, could you confirm the created time, modified time and Accessed time?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Franky</p>

            <p>It looks like they were all created whenever I tried to start Outlook again. Initially I thought they were all overnight but now from the Time/Date they got created whenever I started Outlook in an attempt to fix the sync issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now things are really odd. I have an *** Email address is removed for privacy *** file plus the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - Firstname.ost that are both clearly being accessed. The latter has a time and date stamp of now and the former from one hour ago. The former file is around 20%
 smaller in size as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am beginning to wonder if Skype for Business is causing some issues here, but this is very very odd.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>And now I understand that Outlook will re-create the OST file when it starts.</p>
<p>Generally, Skype for Business won<span>’</span>t cause such Outlook issues.</p>
<p>I suggest you run <a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant</a> tool and check how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I<span>’</span>d like to confirm the following information:</p>

<li>The detailed version of Outlook.</li><li>Start Outlook in safe mode to check if the issue persists.</li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Perform a clean boot</a> and check again.</li></ol>

            <p>Right now Outlook is behaving and, frankly, I don't want to touch it as it caused a bunch of lost productivity yesterday morning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I fail to understand here is why my O365 account AND my IMAP account have two data files, both with a .ost extension, both being&nbsp;updated (time and date stamps confirmed) and both of which match with the single exception of having '- Firstname' added.
 Even stranger, the files are different sizes to each other. Seriously, has there been a change to the way Outlook stores local data recently?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook version 10.0.6965.2092 if this is any help.</p>

            <p>Hi IlMostro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't received &nbsp;any information that Outlook change the way to store the local data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the accounts configured in Outlook, each account has the .ost file, it's an expected behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, having '- Firstname ' added is not an expected behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you run the SARA tool when you have time and provide the result?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the Outlook version number, could you confirm if it's the correct one as it's not the version number for Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2016?</p>

</p><p>I will run the SARA tool and see what happens and let you know. The Outlook version is, in fact:</p>
<p>
</p><p>2016 MSO (16.0.6925.1041) 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather amusingly the version number I put is the version number of the Office Updates Deferred Channel rather than the "About Outlook".

            The fact that your TOC is hyperlinked probably has something to do with it. As has been pointed out (perhaps in another thread), when the TOC is hyperlinked, the Hyperlink character style (by default blue and underlined)&nbsp;is applied to the entry but suppressed,
 and this seems to result in suppressing both color and underline even when applied as direct formatting.

<h2>            Pasting Tracked Changes in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've been very helpful to me recently. &nbsp;Thank you! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another question. &nbsp;I am cutting and pasting text with tracked changes from a Word doc. (2013) to an Excel doc (2013). &nbsp;Most of the time this has worked fine, however occasionally the text will change when I am not highlighting the relevant cell in
 Excel. &nbsp;When I double click on the cell with tracked changes it has the correct text. &nbsp;Then when I double click on another cell some of the text changes to something completely different. &nbsp;I tried to delete the part that keeps changing and type it out, but
 it continued to change when I double click on other cells. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Laurie&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No, tables in PowerPoint are kind of stupid. &nbsp;The best you can do is create 3 columns where you previously only needed 2. Then select individual pairs of cells, right-click and choose Merge Cells to combine them. If you combine a cell in the new column with
 one to its left, that cell gets wider to the right. Combine a cell in the new column with one to its right and that cell appears to get wider to the left. It's a lot of work for something that should be simple.</p>
<p>

            Further to John's reply, you can use the Draw tool on the Tables tab to create a cell 'wall', then select &amp; merge the cells. The new border also can be adjusted independently.<br />

<h2>            Options for Terminated Employee</h2>
                    
<p>We are using Office 365 and One Drive for Business. An employee is leaving the company, but is allowed to take documents and emails. So, here are a few questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What happens to software loaded on employees laptop? Will the current version continue to work and just not update?</p>
<p>2. Will outlook retain sub-folder design and&nbsp;all previously received emails once email address is deleted? &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Can the employee convert to an individual or family office365/one drive subscription with easy migration?</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>hi patrick,</p>
<p>if the admin doesn’t remove the user account from office 365, available features for the user depends on the licenses or permission he/she has. regarding “an employee is leaving the company, but is allowed to take document and email”, can you help confirm
 his/her current licenses?</p>
<p>an admin can check the user licenses via entering <strong>office 365 admin center &gt; users &gt; active users &gt;</strong> select the user
<strong>&gt; assigned licenses &gt; edit</strong>. if he/she is not assigned the latest version of office (office 365 proplus or office 365 business) license, he/she can’t activate the office downloaded anymore and the office client will goes into

<p>a common user can check his/her current license via clicking the <strong>settings</strong> icon like a gear in the top-right corner of the office 365 portal
<strong>&gt; office 365 settings &gt; edit profile &gt; account info &gt; assigned licenses</strong>.</p>

<p>in addition, to transfer the office 365 services in an office 365 business or enterprise plan to an office 365 home, personal and university plan is not feasible.</p>

<h2>            help with a look up formula</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using the formula below to look for data it works fine it looks at its refernce in cell A3 then finds what im looking for in cells U6:AB1105 column 2 and returns the correct data
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP($A$3,$U$6:$AB$1105,2,FALSE)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem i have is that&nbsp;i have numerous invoices for the vehicle in cell A3 and when i copy the formula down(in cells A7:A35)&nbsp;it returns the same value in each cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way so that when it finds the first value and puts it in cell A7 it will then look down to the next match and put that in cell A8&nbsp;it will then look do</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so if itputs invoice nuumber 1234 in cell A7 it wouldnt put this in cell A8 but would look down column U6 until it finds the next matching value 1235</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>many thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should have pointed out how you change the ranges. From the original (shorter) formula you need to change it in 3 places all underlined below. Bear in mind this will on;y work of the lookup data start in row 6, the -4 bit provides the offset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX(<u>$V$6:$V$20</u>,SMALL(IF<u>($U$6:$U$20</u>=$A$3,ROW(<u>$A$6:$A$20</u>)-ROW($A$1)-4),ROWS(B$1:B1)))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for U6 to V1105 it becomes:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX($V$6:$V$1105,SMALL(IF($U$6:$U$1105=$A$3,ROW($A$6:$A$1105)-ROW($A$1)-4),ROWS(B$1:B1)))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The longer formula is simply</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=iferror(shortformula,"",shortformula)</p>
