            <p>pesky2012,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you open GuideTool and it connects to Media Center it should show you all of your channels in the left hand side. Then you click on the tuner icon in the toolbar which opens a dialog box and then click on the one of the tuners listed. I don't know
 if your Hauppauge device has more than 1 tuner but each of my SiliconDust devices have 3 tuners so you have to add the channel to each tuner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click on a tuner, &nbsp;the button to add a channel becomes enabled. Click that button and another dialog box opens up where you actually add a &nbsp;channel. You have to enter the call sign (e.g. &nbsp;NGCHD, DIYHD, CNNHD, etc), the channel number and the same
 number in the Physical number field . &nbsp;After you have entered the info for all of your tuners close the tuner window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on each channel you have added and in the popup menu click on "Subscribe by call sign". If you added a channel for multiple tuners then shift-click all of the identical channels then right-click and select merge from the popup menu which will
 combine the channels from multiple tuners in your guide channel lineup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also edit an existing channel that shows the wrong call sign and change its call sign then select&nbsp;"Subscribe by call sign". You can also hide or delete a channel that does not exist or that you don't want to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Media Center and you should see the channel(s) you added in the Guide and should be able to view the channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer crashes&#47;resets whenever opening system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jvenus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer crashes&#47;resets whenever opening system properties, among other things</h2>
                    So recently, I've had a whole onslaught of issues arise in windows seven, seemingly at random. It started happening when I disabled Internet Explorer (which I had re-enabled after I noticed the issues coming up) and uninstalled my old antivirus (AVG Free).
 I have also installed some Windows Updates not too long before (after a long period of leaving them off). I think this was about a week and a half ago or so.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First off, I noticed that Windows Photo Viewer wouldn't launch (same with live gallery, haven't really tried other windows live applications). After some investigating, I noticed that the process dllhost.exe would start up when I would try to launch Photo
 Viewer, but would end not too long after. Apparently, I have Live Gallery running at startup (along with something else HP related; it's how the laptop I'm using came), but it doesn't seem to work even then.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Secondly, most of my installed programs (Mumble, the League of Legends Launcher, Steam, Skype, among other things) suddenly needed to be run in compatibility mode for Windows 7....in Windows 7. Otherwise they won't launch/stop working and the like. Clearly,
 that isn't right. I haven't explored the issue too much, so that's all I've got on that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Third, whenever I open the system properties windows, either through my computer&gt;properties or the control panel, windows explorer crashes and restarts. Only that one window.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried running sfc, which yielded no results upon reboot (sans resetting my custom start orb). A second run immediately afterwards said nothing was wrong. I've ran windows in safe mode, which seemed to have solved the windows explorer issue (not too sure
 about photo gallery, since it can't be run in safe mode). Since nothing seemed wrong then, I've tried running in clean boot mode, which brings the explorer issue back, but resolved the Windors Photo Viewer and Live Gallery issue. I've tried numerous system
 restored (one restore prior to the windows update resolved my Photo Viewer issue, but that restore point has long been lost by the time all of this started happening all together). On a side note, I've been having a voip program, Mumble, to run properly after
 all of this is happening, whether I reinstall, repair, or run the program in compatibility mode again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've spent my time recently trying to figure out the windows explorer issue, and all I've got going right now is that it might have something to do with ntdll.dll. Here is the Event Viewer report of the crash and reset:</div>

<div>I've also created a crash dump too, which I have no idea how to read for the life of me. I don't know if this download is going to work or not, but whatever.</div>
<div>https://www.mediafire.com/?d5aidn8qe47id03</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm at a loss right now as to how to fix this. I was considering doing an in-place reinstall, but I don't have a copy of the Windows 7 Disk, nor do I have any spare dvds large enough to make one. I already have to take this laptop in for hinge repairs,
 and I don't want this issue ballooning the cost of repairs on my laptop should I take it to someone to fix for me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've ran my new antivirus (MSE) and MalwareBytes to check for issues, and they did find some (if I recall correctly, it was some potential threats sitting in internet explorer, which I never use, by the way). Upon removal of these issues, everything seemed
 to stay the same.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A quick response would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Trying not to lose sleep trying to fix this,</div>

            <p>Looking at the dump file with WinDbg (Windows Debugger)&nbsp;the module that appears to be causing the crash is the atiumd64.dll which is a component of the AMD graphics driver:</p>
<p><br />

<p>Try uninstalling and then reinstalling the AMD graphics driver using the latest version available.</p>

<div>Whenever I close my laptop and reopen it, the network gets stuck on identifying. I need to restart the computer, and it fixes the problem, but it never made me do this before, because I usually leave windows open. Is there a way that I can fix it so the

    <title>windows build 1709 took out my USB 3.0 controller driver, can&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows build 1709 took out my USB 3.0 controller driver, can&#39;t install&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am running windows 10 Pro on an Alienware 14 and just got the Fall Creators Update. When it finished and rebooted I found out that I no longer had control over any of my USB ports which presents a problem. When I try to reinstall the driver for the 3.0
 controller, it tells me that no driver could be found. It also does not come up on an update when searching from Windows update. I went to Intel and Microsoft and downloaded the most recent driver for it, however it gives me a message that my system does not
 meet the "minimum requirements" to install. Basically, there are no current drivers available from either Microsoft or Intel for the 3.0 extensible host controller beyond windows 7 drivers. I own two other Alienware laptops an 11x R3, and an Alienware 17,
 along with two home brewed desktops. All of these have been upgraded and have no problems as of this date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using SFC /Scannow and Dism programs to correct the issue to no avail. SFC states that there are corrupt files that it cannot repair and DISM says there are no issues with the system. I ran a utility that Alienware includes with the laptop that checks
 all hardware and it came up clean with all USB ports mechanically okay. When I plug in anything like my cell phone, it will identify file sharing on any of the USB ports, however only until Windows starts. Then it just goes into a slow charge mode and loses
 data transfer capability. I know the problem is with this current update of Windows and not something else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my question is: am I going to have to wait until either Intel or Microsoft comes up with an update for the driver?</p>

<p>I could not find a viable answer to this dilemma anywhere on the internet and Microsoft had no real answer outside of doing a total wipe and starting over. As you know, this causes quite a few other problems and the loss of a lot of information, etc...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went old school on this one myself and fixed the problem without doing a fresh install of windows. The following is a brief description of what I went through to make this happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first used a known good laptop with working drivers for the USB. This other computer was using the same version of Windows. It helps to own more than one!!</p>
<p>I did a search for all USB driver files in Windows explorer. I made copies of these files and put them on a CD that I set up to store and move files. I made note of where all of them came from so I could put them in their proper place in my Alienware 14.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I had to gain special permission for the Windows system 32 and Windows SxS files on my broken laptop. If you do not do this, you cannot gain access to the proper files that must be replaced. Once I had done this, I inserted the CD with the files on
 it and placed those files in their proper locations in my Alienware 14. After this I went into Device Manager and clicked on update Drivers for the USB that was not working. I clicked on search for drivers on my computer and directed it to look in the Windows
 System 32 files for the drivers. Note: I have done this for other problems in the past and sometimes you will have to look in Windows SxS for the files. I then let the computer find the drivers and install them and presto!!! You are back up and running.I also
 used SFC /Scannow to see if I had any problems after doing all this and it came back with a clean bill of health.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this work that I have done to fix this issue will be of benefit to others who have gone through so much aggravation to correct what Microsoft has obviously caused. The 1709 update corrupted the driver files for the USB to the point that Windows was
 confused about where to find the drivers and would not recognize any attempts to restore them. As a side note: I have a friends M15x that has a similar problem with the drivers for the Infrared USB controller. This driver controls the lights on these older
 Alienware laptops. When I can find another one that has good drivers in it, I will be trying this out to see if I can correct it the same way.</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>Hi Scorpionking40,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Are you using a Secondary hard drive or Windows is installed on this Hard drive?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Do you receive any error messages?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If it is your primary hard drive, then you won't be able to delete or shrink the hard drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You need to either make it has the secondary hard drive or try to boot from the Windows disc and from Windows receovery environment
 try to delete it ot shrink it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer the following KB article and try the Method 8 to Use the Diskpart.exe utility to clean the disk</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You cannot select or format a hard disk partition when you try to install Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927520</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Use this method only if you want to perform a clean installation of Windows. When you clean the hard disk, it is formatted.
 All partitions and all data on the hard disk are permanently removed. We strongly recommend that you back up the files on the hard disk before you clean the disk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    <title>HP Pavilion Sound Trouble - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sydneypurdom  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Pavilion Sound Trouble</h2>
                    When I go watch a video or play music my sound will be fine for about 10 seconds, and then it will begin to get really quiet to where you cant hear it at all or just barely. When you pause the sound and play it again, the sound will return to normal but
 only for around 10 seconds. Can someone please tell me how to fix this?

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check this - Right Click the little speaker on the lower right of taskbar - Playback devices - double click the speakers - Enhancements tab - Check Disable all sound effects.</p>
<p><br />
Sounds like a driver and/or hardware issue so you need to check with HP Support or a real computer shop (one that works on HP in-shop). Also check with their drivers, documentation, and forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check with your System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems)&nbsp; their&nbsp;on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known&nbsp; issues.&nbsp; Or&nbsp;with the actual audio/sound device makers if a separate card/device.<br />

No sound in Windows - Use the troubleshooters - Control Panel -&nbsp;Troubleshooting&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check to see if you have the latest available driver.&nbsp;Download and&nbsp;install the latest<br />
driver. If you have the latest driver re-install the same one.<br />
<br />
How to manually install&nbsp;drivers.<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate&nbsp;device
<br />
drivers.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without
<br />
Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker, as fallbacks, and the Device Maker's for which <br />
are the most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - <strong>Device Manager - Sound - write down
</strong><br />
<strong>the make and&nbsp;complete model of your&nbsp;sound adapter - double click - Driver's
</strong><br />
<strong>tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do
</strong><br />
<strong>anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
</strong><br />
<strong>REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Display Adapters, Mouse <br />
and Keyboard&nbsp;if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other <br />
major device drivers&nbsp;you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check in Device Manager to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>thank you, got onto xbox telephone support, the conclusion is that the PC and xbox are set up right, there is some sort of conflict because the PC really doesn't like sharing USB stick modems, end result, stop being cheap and get a 2nd line in for a landline
 modem and run the network (3xPC, xbox and phone), off that. l think they mite be right yeah?!</p>

            Hi Billy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If driver will not roll back, did you try uninstalling or Updating driver in Device Manager?
<br />
<br />Update the device driver from the PC or device maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model,  not using the Device Manager/Windows Update which is inadequate to the task in about half of all installed drivers. While there check that you also have the latest chipset, BIOS, display, network, bluetooth, USB and all other drivers, compared to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 8 shows other user when I start up. How do I disable this&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tambamslam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 shows other user when I start up. How do I disable this&#63;</h2>
                    When I start up my computer, I get a screen that says other user. I have to hit enter where the password should go and then I will get the back button that will reveal my user account but the other user account is listed next to it. I do not have a guest
 account active so I am not sure what the other user account means and I cannot disable it. I had my computer set up to just start up and go to my start menu. I am not sure but I think after an update to windows 8 a few weeks ago, it changed. I took shot of
 what it looks like but I am unsure how to upload them to this forum. I have searched to see if anyone else has had a similar problem but I have not seen any. Does anyone know what is going on? Thanks<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Before reinstalling the operating system, I would suggest you to refresh Windows 8. Refer to the link to do so:</div>
<div>"<strong>How to restore, refresh, or reset your PC</strong>"</div>
<div>Follow the section "<strong>Refresh your PC without affecting your files</strong>"</div>

<div><strong>Note:</strong> The apps that came with your PC or you installed from Windows Store will be reinstalled, but any apps you installed from other websites and DVDs will be removed. Windows puts a list of the removed apps on your desktop after refreshing
 your PC.</div>

            Hi wimdekker1939, please try this:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type wsreset and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />When that command completes, check to see if the Store app will open 
<br />
<br />If Not: 
<br />
<br />Click this link to download the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter and run that to see if it can resolve this issue: 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_apps10</a> 
<br />
<br />Again, check to Store App to see if it is functional . . . 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If not: it may be a problem with Windows Update: 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button type services and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />For each of the following services, find them in the list of services, then double click them, if they are not already Started, start them and set their Startup type to Automatic 
<br />
<br />Windows Update 
<br />Background Intelligent Transfer Service 
<br />Cryptographic Service 
<br />
<br />Close the Services App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Please try the below steps:
<br />First of all:
<br />Try clearing the cache:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/15057-clear-reset-store-cache-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/15057-clear...</a>
<br />If that doesn't help, make sure:
<br />You are not using a proxy server/3rd Party Firewall or a VPN.
<br />The next step would be to disable metered connection if you have set so.
<br />If all of these doesn't help, try doing a repair install that keeps everything.

<h2>            win 7 to 10 update, error &#34;80073bc3-20009&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to update windows 7 home premium 64 bit to windows 10 home several times today but encountered an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recieved an option to upgrade to windows 10 (and reserved a couple days ago). Before downloading windows checked for system reqs and for any incompatible programs and everything was perfect (above every recommended spec and 0 bad programs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When downloading (windows update) it was stuck for roughly 30mins or so on 32% if that's relevant but everything went well and without errors.</p>
<p>At reboot it prepared everything for updates normally (there was no interruptions, no shutdowns or anything that I shouldn't do while it's shutting down).</p>
<p>When PC started (went to grub where I selected windows option as usual) it booted into what seems like win10 installation (trapezoid windows logo on a purple background iirc) and shortly went next.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the problem: next step (a circle with a 0% inside) only appeared for a tenth of a second or so, then my screen turned off (and my keyboard lights turned off) and pc rebooted itself. When choosing windows in grub it now went directly to windows 7 loading
 (which loaded longer than usual) and I had to wait on desktop for ~1min beacuse screen was black (no background, no taskbar except for mouse cursor in the middle) but it booted okay in the end (in win7 of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When looking at windows update it said that win10 couldn't be installed and returned error code "80073bc3-20009" (unknown error, when searching for this error it returned no results from that win update link and when googling it found 2 results that were
 not really helpful).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean install would not really be an option since I have roughly 800gb of files I want to keep.</p>
<p>

            <p>I had this problem as well, and a similar setup. &nbsp;I did actually manage to get things working by changing my BIOS settings so I was booting directly from my Windows drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my initial setup was two drives - first with Windows installed, the second with GRUB and linux installed. &nbsp;BIOS was setup to try booting from the second drive. &nbsp;I reconfigured the BIOS to only try booting from the first drive, and then the upgrade proceeded
 normally. &nbsp;I'm not entirely certain if the Windows drive being the first drive on the controller mattered - but certainly it was necessary for me to boot directly off of the Windows drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I probably need to go and reconfigure GRUB.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same exact error for days now and have literally tried every possible solution even doing a system file check. Also kept running the windows update troubleshooter in the 'system and security' menu. Nothing have worked at all and the only difference
 for me is I'm running windows 8.1 and I'm dual booting it from a MacBook Pro 2013. I managed to find a way to run windows on an external 1tb hard drive as the Mac itself only has 250gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even recently the windows 10 update tool on the sidebar keeps prompting me to install windows 10 and when i try to do so most things go fine, from the 2gb download of windows 10 (which it does every single time i try and update windows 10) to the setup process
 asking me to agree to the terms and conditions. Before it reboots, the computer spends some time to configure the update and upon reaching 100% it restarts and does the exact same thing, it boots with the windows 10 logo and the small spinning circle below
 it. Next the big installation circle shows with 0% for a little less than a second &nbsp;(blink and you will miss) and the computer reboots again after a while back into windows 8.1 and displays "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">80073bc3-20009".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It's really frustrating to deal with this especially because there is no solution for this error nor an explanation of what causes it. It seems to me from this thread though, we all
 have 1 thing in common, we are trying to dual boot it with another operating system. Hopefully someone can reply with a solution or a link to the solution soon</span></p>

<p>mbr was on the windows disk. I powered down my pc and unplugged the sata cable on the Ubuntu drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>next got my windows 7 disk and booted to it. choose the language and keyboard. then clicked repair my computer. it asks which os you'd like to repair, windows duh. clicked next. then ran the old cmd. ran
<strong>bootrec.exe /fixboot</strong></p>
<p>and then (still in cmd)<strong> bootrec.exe /fixmbr </strong>then rebooted to my windows drive (removed the windows 7 disk.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>did security updates and turned of Microsoft security essentials. rebooted as needed and then went ahead on the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now I have windows ten. then I had to reinstall grub for Linux/windows dual boot. plugged the Ubuntu drive back in and loaded an installation usb with my Ubuntu version on it. you must use the same version 14.04 drive then 14.04 usb/ 15.04 drive then 15.04
 usb. installed and ran boot repair. followed the steps here </p>
<p>
</p><p>https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the suggestions, I have tried all the suggestions above and even the one suggested by johnockert but nothing seem to work. I end up at the same installation circle that shows for a second and then back in windows 8 with the same error number.
 I do not have any anti virus except windows defender which i did disable too but nothing seems to work at all. Also tried troubleshooting windows update several times but nothing seems to fix that error at all.</p>

<p>
</p><p>try using this tool for install W10</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If this tool fails you will need change your boot and put Windows 8.1 the default OS, maybe then you can install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all methods you posted but nothing worked. What I ended up doing is just reformating the second disk (therefore deleting linux) (NTFS filesystem on 2 partitions now) and setting win disk as the default boot disk. Everything went perfectly and I'm
 enjoying win10 now (but employees should look into this issue and try to fix it ASAP for others).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a side question, if may I ask, what exactly does the third method do? So I'll maybe be able to use it in my further troubleshooting.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2 Pen Lost It&#39;s Magnetic Feel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 2 Pen Lost It&#39;s Magnetic Feel</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what has happened but when I held the pen near the screen of my surface pro 2 you could feel a type of magnetic resistance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't get this resistance anymore yet the pen&nbsp;still works. I noticed the pen tip wasn't loose like it used to be. I pull it but the tip came out fully but it won't sit in like it used to. Is there something i can do? Are the pens covered under warranty?
 It's 7 months old. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance</p>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi MrTunnel,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We value the time you have taken to post and visit the Microsoft Community! I’m sorry to hear the Pro Pen magnet is not working as expected. I certainly appreciate consulting your concern with us and I will do my best to guide you towards the best
 possible solution.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Although I understand the Pen is working properly, we recommend you <span>
check the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Make sure that all <strong>Windows Updates</strong> are installed</span></li><li><span>Attempt a two button restart:</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Power off the Surface Pro </span></p>
<p><span>2. Hold Volume Up and the Power button at the same time for 10-15 seconds</span></p>
<p><span>3. Release buttons</span></p>
<p><span>4. Wait 5-10 seconds</span></p>
<p><span>5. Power on the Surface</span></p>
<p><span>6. Keep the Surface plugged to the power supply for a little while</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>

<p>
</p><p><span>To answer your last question, like the Support article above mentions: “i</span><span style="color: rgba(48, 46, 47, 1)">f you need a new pen because yours has broken, you may be eligible to have it replaced under the Surface warranty.

<h2>            Windows 10 -- Issue&#58; computer randomly restarts on its own</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having trouble with my computer shutting down/restarting randomly. It is an HP Pavilion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This my second computer in two years and this one is starting to do the same thing as the last. The last one would randomly shut off/restart and then as it continued, the hard drive fried itself. This computer is beginning to do the same thing. It is restarting,
 however, it only happens when I'm on certain websites, more specifically, youtube. Please Help. I do not want to have to fix this computer, or buy a new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Hello Benjamin,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To see if any other Third party software&nbsp;is causing the issue,&nbsp;I suggest you to perform the below troubleshooting steps and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run System Maintenance Troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>System Maintenance </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">troubleshooter finds and clean up unused files and shortcuts and performs maintenance tasks.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in the <strong>Search</strong> box from the desktop.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> option.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>View All</strong> option and select the <strong>
System Maintenance</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Next</strong> to perform the <strong>System Maintenance troubleshooter</strong> and follow the steps.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue still persists then,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Start computer in safe </span></strong><span>mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type <strong>Settings</strong> in the search box on the desktop, select
<strong>Settings</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Here select <strong>Change pc settings</strong> and then
<strong>General</strong>.</span></p>

</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Perform <strong>Clean boot</strong> to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Putting your system in <strong>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>

            <p>I had this issue whenever new system updates were downloaded. I found two places where the auto restart behavior could be disabled. Yesterday, my PC restarted while several important documents were open. They were saved, however, I kept them open to remember
 to review them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I went to Windows Update | Advanced Options and the "Choose how updates are installed option" is gone. I am guessing it was removed with the service pack that was just installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand many users don't install updates, which can cause problems down the road. But a simple nag screen would suffice. How many users want to return to their work to find it's all gone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a new way of letting me choose when to restart my PC, please tell me what it is.</p>

<p>Has anyone had luck getting this product to work on windows? Does anyone have an idea how to get it to work?</p>
