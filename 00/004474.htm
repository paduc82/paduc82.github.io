            Your description of your problem is kind of skimpy, but I **think** I may know what you are asking. If I am right, just press the ScrLk (Scroll Lock) key on your keyboard... it is located next to your Page Break and PrtScn (Print Screen) keys... and all
 should be well.

    <title>Spam filter policies with end-user notifications won&#39;t allow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reecedodds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spam filter policies with end-user notifications won&#39;t allow exceptions and ignore priority settings</h2>
                    <p>I have three Spam Filter policies. &nbsp;From highest to lowest priority:</p>
<ol>
<li>Opt-in list for reduced SCL settings (no quarantine or end-user notifications)</li><li>Everyone list (sensitive word list enabled, customs SCL settings with quarantine and end-user notifications)</li><li>Default </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The second policy is one have I've had in place for over 2 years, but due to recent increases in spam, I've increased the bulk-email SCL settings and a few other match settings. &nbsp;The thing is that there a few users who have specifically requested to be excluded
 from this list and will manually manage their own spam and phishing rules in their Outlook (with great vigilance).<br />
<br />
So I created policy number 1 and have applied it to those three users, but they've reported that they're still getting spam quarantine notifications and are frustrated with having to release a dozen or so marketing emails every day. &nbsp;Their efforts to "Report
 as not spam" appear to have no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to add exceptions to policy number 2 because "<span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Policies that have end-user spam
 notifications enabled can only be applied to a domain and may not have exceptions.</span>", and it seems that the priority level of the policy is ignored.<br />
<br />
What can I do here?</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Reece,</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The spam policies can be applied based on the recipient filter. Based on your descirption:</p>
<p><span><em>So I created policy number 1 and have applied it to those three users, but they've reported that they're still getting spam quarantine notifications&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p>in this case, if these three users who send bulk emails to the other users, the rule 01 should not work and the other users will receive notifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the other users send bulk emails and these 3 users receive notifications, please share some screenshots of the two spam policies you had for me to better understand what you did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Alison</p>

    <title>Shared Mailbox search crashing Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim-plimmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared Mailbox search crashing Outlook 2016</h2>
                    
<p>hi,</p>
<p>we currently have 1 user who was running outlook 2013 and had no problems with their emails and shared mailbox etc. however recently when i downloaded and installed skype for business on her computer from (portal.office.com) it seemed to have automatically
 updated her to outlook 2016 as well as install&nbsp;skype for business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>this shouldn't be a problem but however we now have a problem where every-time she accesses her "admin shared mailbox" and does a search for an email it looks like it's searching for about 5 seconds and then outlook totally crashes and freezes with the "not
 responding" error message. this never use to happen to her when she had outlook 2013 a couple of days ago. she's able to search for emails fine on her personal mailbox but the "admin shared mailbox" keeps causing her outlook to freeze when she searches.</p>
<p>i have tried the following troubleshoot methods:</p>
<p>1)uninstall office and then re-install office. <br />
2)control panel &gt; uninstall program &gt; repair &gt; online repair as well as the offline repair<br />
3)started outlook in safe mode and disabled com-addons <br />
4)file&gt;options&gt;search&gt;indexing options &gt;advanced &gt; rebuild index<br />
5)file&gt;options&gt;search&gt;modify and the unticked outlook, closed outlook, re-opened outlook and re-ticked outlook on the "indexed locations"
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/202d97cc-5527-46d5-ac8d-56393040c0fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/202d97cc-5527-46d5-ac8d-56393040c0fa" /></a><br />
after all those troubleshooting methods, this issue is still persisting!<br />
<br />
the user is running windows 8 and has 4g of ram on her computer. <br />
<br />
i hope all these details are useful and please advise the best way to fix this issue. i've thought about downgrading her back to outlook 2013 but our it manager doesn't want to as our company want's everyone to be using the latest software.</p>

<p>hi jim,</p>
<p>i have read through the post and would like to further narrow down the issue with the following details:<br />
1. please help confirm whether cached mode is enabled and <strong>download shared folders</strong> is ticked in<strong> account settings</strong> like the screenshot below. if not, please try enabling the options to check if there is any improvement.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb8e5577-7ba8-442a-84bb-358e71b630d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb8e5577-7ba8-442a-84bb-358e71b630d2" /></a><br />
<br />
2. i have sent you a private message to collect the affected email account (<strong>no password</strong>) for further check. you can access the private message via the link below:<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations<br />
3. what’s the detailed version of her outlook 2016 client? (in <strong>file</strong>&gt;
<strong>office account</strong>&gt; <strong>update options</strong>.)<br />
4. to identify if the issue is related to the shared mailbox, i’d like to confirm whether the issue persists if she performs a search in another shared mailbox. if there are no other ones, you can just create a new one for test. also, can any other users who
 have access to the ‘admin shared mailbox’ search in it normally?<br />
5. to check whether the issue is related to her computer settings, please try setting up her account on a different desktop and check if there is any improvement.<br />
6. can she search for an email in the shared mailbox using outlook web app? for how to access a shared mailbox in owa, please refer to:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-outlook-web-app-bc127866-42be-4de7-92ae-1ef2f787fd5c?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">open

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>1) Thanks for your response and I can confirm that cached mode is enabled and the "Download shared folders" is ticked in the Account Settings.</p>
<p>2)I have sent you the affected email account and shared mailbox via the private message.</p>
<p>3) The detailed version of her Outlook 2016 client: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Version: 16.0.6769.2017</p>
<p>4)I can confirm that when she performs a search in another shared mailbox her Outlook 2016 Client does not freeze or crash at all. She has 4 shared mailboxes on her account and none of them cause her outlook to crash when she does searches except for the
 one we're trying to fix(email address sent to you via private message) </p>
<p>5)I think this issue is related to her computer settings because I set up her account on my Outlook Client on my PC and I can do the searches on the admin mailbox fine with no issues or freezing. Her PC has 4gb of RAM whilst mine has 12gb of RAM.</p>
<p>6) I can confirm that she can search for an email in the shared mailbox using Outlook Web App.

<p>Additional Info:</p>
<p>This issue could potentially be PC related due to what I've stated on "5)" above. However she did not have this issue when she had Outlook 2013 last week, it's only when the skype for business installer automatically updated her Outlook to 2016 this has
 started happening. &nbsp;So I can see why it could be PC related but I can also see why it's something to do with Outlook 2016 Client!</p>
<p>I should also mention that 2 other people on her team experience the same problem when they try to do a search in the admin mailbox and they're both running Outlook 2016. One user has 4gb of RAM on her pc and the other has 6gb of RAM on hers. Just like the
 original user I've reported this issue with, they say that this issue never happened when they were on Outlook 2013, only when they updated to Outlook 2016. There is actually 1 person on their team who's still on Outlook 2013 and he's the only one that can
 do the searches fine on the admin shared mailbox. </p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>I agree with you. The issue is related to her PC since the account works well in your PC, which is better.</p>
<p>Compared with Outlook 2013, Outlook 2016 is a brand new software, which could have higher hardware requirements. Since our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business Online services, you may contact our experts in our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Client Channel</a> for assistance.</p>
<p>Besides that, we suggest upgrade these PCs’ hardware to keep using Outlook 2016 or revert Outlook 2016 back to Outlook 2013. From my experience, there’re a only few differences between the Outlook 2013 and Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Brook</p>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />I suggest you to try the Online archiving that office 365 offers you, you can buy it standalone and is also included in bundles like Office 365 Enterprise E3.
<br />
<br />The emails will move automatically to the online archiving but right now you must have the default retention policy. You just need to learn how to create retention tags and policies and how to apply them to your mailboxes in the Exchange Admin Center, refer to this article and you should be fine.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply but do I really have to go through all that?</p>
<p>It's probably more efficient on the long term but...</p>
<p>I just want too archive some old e-mails (2011 to 2017).</p>
<p>I feel like it slows my outlook and maybe my computer but I'm not even sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you so much for this answer.</p>

            Hi Audrey,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you’d like to archive the emails from 2011 to 2017 in your Outlook for Mac client. And for now, the cached Exchange mode doesn’t support in Outlook for Mac. You can try the following steps to move your emails to
<strong>Archive </strong>folder.<br />
<br />
1. Open Outlook client, click <strong>Edit </strong>&gt; <strong>Find </strong>&gt; <strong>
Advanced Search</strong>.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a932a124-3862-48e1-ac7b-99433c273fe4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a932a124-3862-48e1-ac7b-99433c273fe4?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
2. Under the <strong>Search </strong>tab in the ribbon, select the <strong>Date Received</strong> and<strong> Date Sent
</strong>conditions and change the dates. Then the emails will be listed.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f409f0bb-1db6-4e4d-a9be-97d273fab1a0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f409f0bb-1db6-4e4d-a9be-97d273fab1a0?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
3. Click <strong>Edit </strong>&gt; <strong>Select All</strong> to select all these emails you want to archive.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e3269b9-0e75-44a1-a013-9c1d1ac53647?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e3269b9-0e75-44a1-a013-9c1d1ac53647?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
4. Under <strong>Home </strong>tab, click <strong>Archive </strong>button to move all the emails to
<strong>Archive </strong>folder.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7981af69-b690-4311-b89a-65a3b1302dc9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7981af69-b690-4311-b89a-65a3b1302dc9?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
Besides, you can also use<strong> Time Machine</strong> to backup your emails. Here is the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/automatically-archive-or-back-up-outlook-for-mac-items-441fcce5-2262-4b64-ac8c-fa949df989f5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reference link</a>. And if you have any difficulty in the process, feel free to let me know.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Marvin<br />

<p>Hi Marvin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for this reply but the thing is that I don't have the Archive button. Maybe because it's with Exchange?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/99cedbcf-6301-4622-b628-0f43a5291bef?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/99cedbcf-6301-4622-b628-0f43a5291bef?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Time Machine is not much of an option at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Audrey</p>

<p>Hi Audery LBV,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Archive-messages-in-Outlook-for-Mac-10a5f3f2-1c50-4477-af19-034f09289655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>, this Archive option is feasible to you as you are using an Office 365 account on Outlook 2016 for Mac. To help you fix this issue, I suggest we first try following methods:</p>
<p>1.Create a new folder named Archive and then you can drag and drop your old emails directly into this folder.</p>
<p>2.Download <a href="https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/12/OutlookResetPreferences.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OutlookResetPreference</a> tool to reset all Outlook Preference to default settings and check if this can help you fix this issue.
</p>
<p>3.Moreover, please check if your Outlook for Mac is the latest version, you can find the version information by clicking Outlook &gt; About Outlook. For your reference, the currently version of Outlook for Mac is 16.15 (18070902). If
 your Outlook client is not the latest version, please upgrade it by clicking Help &gt; Check for Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, if the Archive button still missing after you try above methods, for further help, I would like to recommend you contact with our experts team via the in-app support: Click&nbsp;Help&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Contact Support&nbsp;in Outlook for Mac client.</p>
<p>

<p>Jennifer</p>

<h2>            Running Exchange 2013 - OWA does not allow sort by recipient&#40;Sort by To&#41; in Sent Items</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are running Exchange 2013 on-premise with CU13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried running OWA on various browsers (Edge, IE11, Chrome) and all did not give me the option to Sort by To under Sent Items, something available in Exchange 2007 and 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does only allow us to sort by Date, From, Flagged, Size, Subject, Type, Attachments, Importance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning the "Conversations" On or Off does not help either.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9987ae9-ffbc-4d81-bf46-433ad9dcd637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9987ae9-ffbc-4d81-bf46-433ad9dcd637" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Was there a reason for this function to be omitted?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is highly useful for our hundreds of staff who do not carry company devices home, some of whom need to search for mails sent in that order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created this post here since there was one posted on technet in 2015 but ended with an unsatisfactory answer.</p>
<p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/c1b04f4a-f150-447b-9735-483204832e5f/owa-in-exchange-2013-sent-items-cannot-show-sent-to?forum=exchangesvrclients</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be nice if anyone can verify if this is also happening to you on Exchange 2013 OWA, even if you do not have an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Excel Pivot Table Timeline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kennethleng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Pivot Table Timeline</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 questions regarding the Pivot Table Timeline function.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1) Must the dates have information about day, month and year for the function to work? For instance, if my dates are in the form of "March 2017," does the Timeline function work?<br />
<br />
2) Does the Timeline function work if I combine data tables via the relationship function? Let's say 3 tables are related to one another by the "Order Number," and only Table 1 has dates. If I create a timeline with Table 1, the timeline shows. But if I create
 a timeline with the combined pivot table, there will be an error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            1. The pivot table needs to have at least one field which has dates in date format recognized by your Excel. 
<br />How to know what date format is recognized by your Excel - Press Run &gt; Type intl.cpl and Enter &gt; Open the drop down of Short Date. This contains the date formats which are recognized by your Excel.
<br />
<br />2. Your observation is correct.

<h2>            Setting the timezone to be displayed on the Teams Recording title card</h2>
                    <p>When we record a Teams meeting it creates a title card for the first few seconds with details of the meeting name, organiser etc</p>
<p>It shows the time of the event in the UTC timestamp</p>
<p><br />
How do I change this to my timezone?</p>
<p>(without effecting anyone else as we share Teams across a global business)</p>

<h2>            VB&#58;  find next occurance of a text value, whole cell, down a column..  GOTO&#63;</h2>
                    <p>i am re-writing this in trying to combine two posts into one and try to make more legible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hi,&nbsp; am not sure if using best method,&nbsp; am using FIND which seems to be a separate physical step, when added to scroll row to get a destination to top of view, there is an extra screen jump compared to the use of a hyperlink formula for the same thing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the hyperlink version has a number of drawbacks (a volatile function?&nbsp; when cut paste rows the row numbers can get messed up &amp; cause an unsearchable Circular Reference, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>the find method seems to cause a problem in trying to use a wildcard for search for "dn" or ".dn."&nbsp; I get false hits on any cell that has:&nbsp; text dn text.&nbsp; for find wildcard:&nbsp; what:="*dn*"</p>
<p>it also causes the header to flash extraneous to the body flash of a screen update?..&nbsp; (so if using the FIND method, is there a way for EVENTS FALSE to make the flash go away?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>trying to make a 1 line step to find a text, whole cell value for eg:&nbsp; "dn"</p>
<p>for the next value down from the cursor,&nbsp; something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells.find(what:="dn", After:=ActiveCell, LookIn:=xlValues, LookAt:=xlWhole, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; searchorder:=xlByColumns, SearchDirection:=xlNext, MatchCase:=True, SearchFormat:=False).Activate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>which is ok for just searching for "dn",&nbsp; but i have interim lines:&nbsp; ".dn." i want to go to either:&nbsp; ".dn." or "dn"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a wildcard will not work in:&nbsp; FIND&nbsp; for getting false hits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>an example that would need to be corrected, but what trying to do for xlWhole:</p>
<p>&nbsp; (and if cannot stop the header extra screen flashing, might recommend using GOTO method below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells.find(<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">what:="dn" OR what:=".dn."</span></strong>, After:=ActiveCell, LookIn:=xlValues, LookAt:=xlWhole, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; searchorder:=xlByColumns, SearchDirection:=xlNext, MatchCase:=True, SearchFormat:=False).Activate</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>----------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QUESTION:</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there a GOTO method that will:&nbsp; be a remote goto cell, without a physical extra step to:&nbsp; scroll row, which i already have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BEST SPOT,&nbsp; WHAT NEED HELP WITH&nbsp; (if use goto)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Selection.Value = "dn" Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goto next "dn" in a column&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'FIX THIS LINE,&nbsp; reference column in vb,&nbsp; combine with scrollrow if can</p>
<p>
</p><p>elseIf Selection.Value = ".dn." Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goto next "dn" or ".dn." in a column&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'same&nbsp; FIX THIS LINE..&nbsp; can use offset(0,0) if helps as below</p>
<p>end if</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWindow.ScrollRow = ActiveCell.Row - 1&nbsp;&nbsp; '&lt;&lt; SCROLL WORKS!!
<p>
</p><p>IDEA: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Goto RANGE("AB:AB").Value = "dn" or ".dn." &nbsp; 'need to fix this to work</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have an example below that works, but only working from a single work cell with the search word,&nbsp; need to find down a column for,&nbsp; again both:&nbsp; "dn"&nbsp; or&nbsp; ".dn."</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Goto RANGE(RANGE(J8).<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">OFFSET(0, 0))</span></strong>&nbsp; 'WORKS from single cell referenced by J8&nbsp; (BJ17)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWindow.ScrollRow = ActiveCell.Row - 1&nbsp;&nbsp; '&lt;&lt; SCROLL WORKS!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am trying to get the destination to activate remotely (if saying that correctly), as in:&nbsp; without a physical move until the scroll row,&nbsp; in trying to get a more seamless step.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>if it is possible it might help to combine the both items into 1 line?&nbsp; goto &amp; scrollrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>==========&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have checked the screen jump symptom, and what i see is that with the technique of 2 physical? steps to accomplish task in vb,&nbsp; the header also flashes.&nbsp; i guesse it should be possible to get rid of that with a different method, either:&nbsp; GOTO&nbsp; or an OR
 in the FIND for both search items&nbsp; (AND if&nbsp; EVENTS = FALSE fixes the screen jump ??)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>VB method using, causing "header" &amp; body to flash / jump:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Selection.Value = "dn" Then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'match value case cell:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells.find(what:="dn", After:=ActiveCell, LookIn:=xlValues, LookAt:=xlWhole, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; searchorder:=xlByColumns, SearchDirection:=xlNext, MatchCase:=True, SearchFormat:=False).Activate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWindow.ScrollRow = ActiveCell.Row - 1&nbsp;&nbsp; '&lt;&lt; SCROLL WORKS!!<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-----&nbsp;&nbsp; using a hyperlink shows smoother method, but is less desireable:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=HYPERLINK(IF(ISNA(INDEX(ROW(OFFSET($BM629:$BM$1739,3,0))-ROW(OFFSET($BM629,3,0)),MATCH(TRUE,OFFSET($BM629:$BM$1739,3,0)="dn",0))),"","#"&amp;CELL("address",OFFSET(INDIRECT(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(CELL("address",$A629),"$",""),ROW(),"")&amp;INDEX(ROW(OFFSET($BM629:$BM$1739,3,0)),MATCH(TRUE,OFFSET($BM629:$BM$1739,3,0)="dn",0))),$AI$2,0))),"dn")</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            MS Teams locks the file from editing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently created an excel file with some information + empty spaces for people to fill.</p>
<p>Some of the cells (which carry important information) are locked, some are open. The reason for&nbsp;this is the purpose of the file.</p>
<p>We try to track if people meet some criteria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.g.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Topic</td>
<td>Description</td>
<td>Person 1</td>
<td>Person 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The issue 1 (locked cell)</td>
<td>Blah blah blah (locked cell)</td>
<td>x (open cell)</td>
<td>x (open cell)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The issue 2 (locked cell)</td>
<td>Blah blah blah (locked cell)</td>
<td>(open cell)</td>
<td>x (open cell)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>We uploaded this file to teams and distributed a message to all the participants to fill the file. However nobody, except for me (creator of the file and uploader). The Edit in xx only opens the&nbsp;file in read-only format and if they want to adjust anything
 it says "the file is locked by user F".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? What is the solution?</p>

<p>Hi Frederik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you can try to create a new permission level to be given to the users of this item:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/how-to-create-and-edit-permission-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to create and edit Permission Levels</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>By default, a file inherits it's permission from the Document Library, and the Document Library in turn inherits it's permission from the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to use unique permissions for the specific file, you can right-click on the file &gt;
<strong>Sharing </strong>&gt; click on the three elipsis (...) &gt; <strong>Manage Access</strong> &gt;
<strong>Advanced</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will bring you to a new page that shows you the permissions for this file. On the ribbon, click on
<strong>Stop Inheriting Permissions</strong> before giving each user the new permission level you created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if anything is unclear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

</p><p>An issue that has seemingly surfaced out of nowhere. Suspect it might be the result of an Office Update?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my spreadsheet opened ( this in itself needed me to re-input my username twice to get access to the spreadsheet itself, when prior to this week it would have been available immediately ). I then click on a hyperlink to a customer address ( MS Word
 doc in Sharepoint ) in order to modify or do a save as or whatever – prior to this week the doc would have immediately appeared, now, after a good long wait, I get the “Microsoft Excel is waiting for another application to complete an OLE action’ – this is
 an endless loop and the only final way out is to reboot the machine. If I attempt to launch MS Word 2016 directly, I am then prompted to enter my Sharepoint username again, to get to the named file that I had previously been attempting to launch from hyperlink.
 MS Word does not launch and the ‘The server you are trying to access is using an authentication protocol not …….’ message as shown above appears.<br />

            Something doesn't make sense. When you email a hyperlink, the person is simply opening the presentation just as if he/she had navigated there via Windows Explorer. Is the hyperlink being opened on a different machine or by a different user on the same
 machine. I have a hard time believing that it is the hyperlink that is making the difference. Of course, I have a hard time believing a lot of odd things that happen with PowerPoint so it very well could be the hyperlink.<br />

            Exactly--it does not make sense! In answer, the hyperlink may be opened from either the same machine used to create the presentation or from another computer. I have administrator rights on the local drive and the share. If we use the PowerPoint viewer,
 the movies also play with audio. I feel it has something to do with resolving the paths, but what?

happened on our side. No spam sending, no virus infection on any of our clients.<br />
But your RBL banned many IP in our /24 network block again and again and again.....<br />
The most interesting part is that ... some of the IP addresses are used<br />
for system alerting service so they are in the highest security station!<br />
<br />
It's ridiculous, that we blocked again and again without any way to receive<br />
exact information about the reason of the blocking....<br />
<br />
Here is the last block event log:<br />
XXXXXXXXXX = masked information due to privacy policy<br />

<p>Hi Janos，</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the invonvenience caused to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then to better help you, I'd like to know if you have tried delisting the blocked sender via the url provided. If it is helpful, you can refer to the detailed steps here.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt661881(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt661881(v=exchg.150).aspx.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you ( if you are the admin; you can deliver this to your admin if you are not) can check whether there is any domain/IP blocked in&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms.exch.eac.actioncenter(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms.exch.eac.actioncenter(v=exchg.150).aspx</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: It might take 24-72 hours for the performance to take effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, if the issue persists, I'd like to collect the NDR (Non-Delivery Report) while the sender tries sending an email. For protecting your privacy, you can provide the NDR in the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/new">
Private Message (PM)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<p><span>Hi Janos,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, I understand that you think you may have more than one IP blocked by Office 365.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As for checking is an IP is blocked or not, you can try MX Tool box or Spamhaus whitelist site to check it. As for how to prevent the sender's IP from being blocked, we recommend the sender ( I am
 not meaning the sender definitely did send the spam emails) not send the spam emails or not send the emails containing the links (to the promotion commericial business for instance) for improving their sending reputation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the sender was found to be blcoked, the recipient side can try adding the sender's IP into his whitelist to give it a shot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think so this blocking message generated due to the server listed on Spamhaus, Barracuda or Spamcop...<br />
Mostly because I checked on&nbsp;mxtoolbox.com and anti-abuse.org sites and there were no match.<br />
<br />
And this blocking message is from your system:<br />
<span>550 5.7.606 Access denied, banned sending IP [62.BBB.CCC.DDD].<br />
To request removal from this list please visit https://sender.office.com/ and follow the directions.<br />
For more information please go to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526655 (AS16012609)</span><br />
<br />
After self-removing process the the server could send messages to our client...<br />
Some days later they got blocked again..... without the IP got listed on spamhaus, barracuda or other well known public RBL provider.<br />
<br />
I guess this block is in Office365 not on other side...</p>
<p>

            Strange behavior connected to the creation of bulleted and numbered lists may be caused by a corrupt ListGal.dat file (that file stores the settings for the built-in list formats in Word). Do the following: Exit Word. In File Explorer, choose to display
 hidden files and folders and then search for ListGal.dat. Delete the file.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling MSN is on its way out as I'm having problems with it too.&nbsp; What really irks me is Microsoft doesn't have the nerve to come clean and tell us they're phasing MSN out.&nbsp; Plus I just paid for my Home Premium subscription and I want my money
 back as none of my settings will work and it takes absolutely forever for a page to load.&nbsp; I'm getting really tired of Microsoft coming out with these supposedly better new programs; yet they're already phasing out Windows 7.&nbsp; That is pretty much a whole new
 program and they're already getting rid of it.&nbsp; Plus they're pushing too much technical stuff down our throats as I'm not technical at all but worse, when you call a remote tech person, they don't know anything either.&nbsp; I don't understand why they are piling
 on all this new technical junk as it's a battle just to keep malware and vruses at bay.&nbsp; I think they've went too far as I'm NOT a tech person so anymore, I spend a good part of my day trying to figure the latest new problem out.&nbsp; I don't even like to go on

    <title>Nokia 808 &#58; Please advise about FP2 keyboard layout - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 808 &#58; Please advise about FP2 keyboard layout</h2>
                    
<p>FP2 keyboard layout is nice but some apps, for example Foursquare, use the old style keyboard layout &nbsp;(see attached picture), but an app I know ,which is fmobi, provides FP2 keyboard option. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I wonder if there is a way to disable this old style keyboard layout forever, and use FP2 layout by default.<br />
<br />
Please advise. Thank you.<br />
<br />

I think perhaps Nokia may just provide an update to remove the old keyboard layout.<br />
