<h2>            Some Advanced threat protection links not working in IE</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my office has Office 2013 and have been using ATP for our attachments for a few months. Lately I have users stating that some of the links in the in Outlook aren't working in Internet Explorer 11</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, this link came in from a CCH Intelliconnet email. It's a generic link to a news story. If opened in IE, it only opens to a blank page. However in Chrome or Firefox it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fprod.resource.cch.com%2Fresource%2Fscion%2Ftracker%2F821954%3A%2528%2540%2540FTD01%2BP20171130-C.1%2529ftd01b1458c227ce21000a186d8d385ad169402%3Frange%3D1%26d1%3D01-12-2017%26src%3Dml%26cpid%3DWKUS-TAA-IC%26uAppCtx%3DATE&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ckdebruin%40bdo.com%7C789750c61ab34b9085f708d537dbabb4%7C6e57fc1a413e405091da7d2dc8543e3c%7C0%7C0%7C636476338976004583&amp;sdata=KNHe06wH3RolWS%2FVb0QUOCEhGRk3U9wJXEuk%2Fw14Ab4%3D&amp;reserved=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is replicated on multiple computer. It's not all na01 safelinks that do this, which makes me wonder if my Exchange team needs to whitelist more things. Though the fact that it works in Chrome makes me wonder if it's IE related. Cleared the IE cache
 multiple times and still having the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated</p>

<p>Hi JQXJQX,</p>
<p>Based on your description, to fix the issue, we suggest you backup all data for the problematic user mailbox. After that, you can use the attribute filter to filter this user. The user should be deleted in cloud. When you finished that, you need to move
 the problematic user mailbox from on-premise to cloud again.</p>
<p>Meantime, generally, we recommend users move mailboxes from on-premise to cloud or directly create them in Office 365 cloud under the Hybrid environment. Other scenarios may cause some issues.</p>
<p>If anything is unclear or you have any issues when doing that, please feel free to let us know.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

    <title>OneNote Page Locking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christina murray  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Page Locking</h2>
                    <p>I suddenly have a problem that my OneNote class notebook pages lock to students as soon as I write on the page. I am&nbsp;using&nbsp;the OneNote 2016&nbsp;program. I cannot find a setting or work around but automatically locking after I look or write on a page is a functional
 piece for me. This feature would be nice if I can turn it on and off, but totally terrible if I cannot control it.

 then uninstall and reinstalled Office 365.&nbsp; Still same error when I started Outlook.&nbsp; Other office applications work fine.&nbsp; I can use Excel with no issue.&nbsp; Really need to get that fixed, fast.&nbsp; It's very frustrating because we rely on Outlook so much these

<h2>            Issue with leading zeroes in a CSV file while trying to open in excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm facing an issue with one of my CSV formatted file, that when tried to open the CSV in excel, the leading zeroes are getting removed. But the same CSV file while opened in notepad, the leading zeroes are present. So just curious to know whether former
 issue can be resolved by anyways. I have tried options like converting the data to text and then Import to excel and all, those are working, but when i'm trying to save it again as CSV, those format changes are getting lost. Is there some way to sort this
 out, that would help me a lot.</p>
<p>

            Hi Aswin, in Excel, how have you formatted the cells before importing from csv?
<br />
<br />You need to format the cells as Custom - 000000 (depending on how many numbers), the built-in number formats will lose the leading zeros

<p>Aswin wrote:</p>
<p>when i'm trying to save it again as CSV, those format changes are getting lost. Is there some way to sort this out</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, other than the work-arounds that you have already tried (or manually formatting the cells afterwards). That is just the way that Excel processes CSV files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the CSV file is saved, Excel writes the data to the file exactly as they <em>
<p>
</p><p>However, a CSV file is plain text file. It contains no formatting information itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Excel opens the CSV file, normally it interprets the data exactly as it would if you entered it manually. Even putting double-quotes around the data does not matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consequently, most numeric strings are interpreted as numbers, which are entered into a cell formatted as General. There are a few exceptions, just as there are when we&nbsp;enter data manually. For example, data that looks like a percentage (1.23%), currency
 ($1.23) or date (1/23/45) are formatted accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to avoid the interpretation is to import (not open) the CSV file and assign the Text format to the column, as you did. But bear in mind that the type of the data is text, even if looks numeric. In some contexts, Excel treats the text data as
 non-numeric. For example, comparisons with numeric values will have unexpected results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, after opening (or importing) the CSV file, you can assign the appropriate format to the cells.&nbsp; However, beware that if the CSV data includes numeric strings with more than 15 significant digits, Excel will interpret only the first 15 digits,
 substituting zeros for any digits to the right, effectively truncating the numeric value after 15 significant digits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other way to work around this Excel behavior is to write a VBA subroutine to read the CSV file and interpret the data however you wish.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change Skype for web profile picture</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to change my profile picture on Skype for Web, but am unable to do so.&nbsp; I've tried following all the suggestions in the FAQ, but in my profile, and trying to edit my profile, I never see a camera picture or anything that gives an option to change
 the picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the main "My Account" screen, if I click on the large profile picture on the left side, it takes me to my profile.&nbsp; If I click "Edit Profile", the top item is called "profile picture" and it has my picture, but no options to change, and neither the
 text or picture itself are clickable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I don't ever remember applying a profile picture (I generally don't do so) so I'm not sure how it got on there in the first place, although it's definitely a picture from my webcam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing?</p>

    <title>MS Band improvement recommendations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patirckb  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Band improvement recommendations</h2>
                    <p>I have been using the band for 1 month and have been mostly happy with it, but....</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The I used the size guide before purchasing it and now I find out that I must use the limit to get it to fit properly.&nbsp; I should have ordered a size smaller even though it was clear that I needed the larger size from using the sizing guide.&nbsp; Good think
 my wrist does not have fat on it!</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I commute by bike most of the time.&nbsp; I am frustrated with launching the app.&nbsp; I would expect that the app would launch when the icon is touched but no, it wants to know if I REALLY want to start a new ride.&nbsp; What else would I do to launch it?&nbsp; when I
 push the start button, it tells me it needs to find GPS signal and do I want to continue.&nbsp; Of course I do!&nbsp; The GPS is only 2% accurate anyway so by the time you find the GPS signal, I will be within the 2% error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you reduce the 3 HI points to one and have a 10 or 15 second delay to start automatically or cancel.&nbsp; Since I need reading glasses to read the display, this would eliminate time to pull them out and put them back before starting the ride.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have missed 3 rides in my history because I was not able to read the display and I wanted to start my ride.&nbsp; Fortunately I use a cycle computer so the data is not lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I should be able to account for the lost rides or data either on my phone (windows) or the PC.&nbsp; If I miss a ride and don't have the data and it is the same route, etc.&nbsp; Average the last 5 or 6 and use the average data to be included in the monthly report
 only tag it as estimated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; I would like to calibrate the app algorithm to account for my cadence average to be included.&nbsp; Clearly everyone rides a bike with a different cadence.&nbsp; I should be able to account for it as it will impact the equivalent steps and calories. In addition,
 I would like to find a way to calibrate the distance.&nbsp; For a 10.95 mile commute, the Band thinks it is 10.7.&nbsp; When looking at the map on the PC, I can see where the GPS path has me wandering all over the place on the road from one side to another as well as
 taking shortcuts on switch backs.&nbsp; In addition, it tells me I stopped across the street from where I actually did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; I did not realize that I could use the RUN app for walks.&nbsp; You should clarify that as well as the ability to close the band and then "pinch" it tighter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; The problem with GPS is that it does not account for 2 min cross walk signals where you are not moving.&nbsp; Hence the average speed, etc. is in error along with the distance.&nbsp; I have not calculated the difference between my cycle computer data and the Band
 data yet.&nbsp; There is a drastic difference though, almost a 1 mph for my commute.&nbsp; That is a significant number for a Cycle Computer average of 17 with the Band at 16.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, I like it.&nbsp; I wish there was a way to link my Cateye wireless data to the band for actual speed, distance,&nbsp; cadence and time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Added a POP email account on Outlook but emails not showing in date sequence</h2>
                    <p>I am very familiar and comfortable setting up and adding new email accounts from my domains etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added a new one this morning, and at first I thought it wasn't working because I wasn't able to see any sent emails in the "sent" folder. Also none in the "Inbox" folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking further I noticed that they are being sent and received but are not showing&nbsp;up in the right sequence (I have it setup to&nbsp;Date and Newest). If I search for them, I see them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like it to behave the same as all my other email addresses and show in sequence sent and received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What needs to be corrected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Riyaz,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you can specify a specific folder within an existing PST file. In this way, you can set delivery to a single Inbox folder by following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Info</strong> &gt; <strong>Account Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Account Settings…</strong>.<br />
2. Select the POP account you want to change the delivery folder and click <strong>
Change Folder</strong>.<br />
3. Select the folder you want or create a new one and click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
4. Repeat the steps to set for other POP accounts.<br />
<br />
Besides, you can create the message rule to sort your email in Outlook client (For reference:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Manage email messages by using rules</a>).<br />

<h2>            windows updates and I lose my internet connection</h2>
                    I installed windows 10 and after a windows update, I no longer had a way to connect to the internet through my network. Ive tried it twice and the same thing happens. I noticed you cant choose to opt out of updates, but if I update then I no longer have
 internet. Thats kinda a deal breaker for an OS. Anyone have a work around?<br />

<p>It is only subscription based versions of Office that have a Draw tab on the ribbon, so I guess that you must have an MSI installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bring the pen close to the screen, does a Pens tab appear on the ribbon? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi ElevativeEntertainment,</p>
<p>It is not feasible to access the group files in the OneDrive app in the mobile because the OneDrive app can only support the OneDrive for Business library now and the library where the group files store is like a team site library not a OneDrive for Business
 library.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Frank</p>

                    <p>I log in with a Microsoft account. Let's call it *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Windows creates a user based on that. But the name of the user (the name of the folder under C:\users)&nbsp;is determined automatically. In my case it's noch abcde, as you could expect it to
 be, but abc. That's annoying, as you see the user name quite often.</p>
<p>Could you implement a function to let me pick a name myself?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check the profile name of your Microsoft account, the same name would be shown when you use Microsoft account to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Profile name to too long then the display name will be shortened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful, Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I was a bit too unspecific, I guess.</p>
<p>My account is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with my full name entered.</p>
<p>At first I installed Windows 10 in a virtual environment but later installed it on a physical machine.</p>
<p>In the VM the profile folder under "C:\users" was created as "tschy2m" after providing my Microsoft account as a means to log me in.</p>
<p>Now, on the physical machine, this folder is named "tschy", which is quite frustrating.</p>
<p>I would have expected "tschy2m" or my real name to be used.</p>

<p>Hi Iceadmin,</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>Usually, we run the command in Exchange Online PowerShell following the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Click the <strong>Start</strong> icon on your PC and then click the search button on the upper right corner.</p>
<p>2. Type <strong>Windows PowerShell</strong> in the search box, click Windows PowerShell in the search result. If it isn’t in the search list, you may need to install Windows PowerShell by referring to the article below:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847837.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847837.aspx</a></p>
<p>3. Copy the three commands below one by one to connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell:</p>
<p>a. Type<b> $UserCredential = Get-Credential</b>, press <strong>Enter</strong><b>.
</b>In the prompt box, enter your admin user name and password, and then click <b>
OK</b>.</p>
<p>b. Type<b> $Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/</a> -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection</b></p>
<p>c. Type <b>Import-PSSession $Session</b></p>
<p>More information about connecting to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a></p>
<p>4. Type the command below to get the output:</p>
<p><b>Get-StaleMailboxDetailReport</b></p>
<p>In addition, I suggest you also run the following command to get all mailboxes’ last logon and logoff time.</p>
<p><b>Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited | Get-MailboxStatistics | select-object identity,lastlogontime,lastlogofftime,DisplayName</b></p>
<p>If anything is unclear, feel free to let us know.</p>

                    <p>Hello Experts,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Office365 Business Essentials Plan our executive's users are randomly received Phishing email one of the samples is attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we reported these emails to support and blocked on the office365 portal but I am unable to find any preemptive measures to block these emails.</p>

<p>It would unrealistic to be reliant on technology alone to prevent Phishing attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, a particular sender may have his credentials stolen due to poor PC security (eg using jail broken device, using it on compromised public computers..etc). In which case, there is no way for anyone to tell that the sender is really someone else
 with a stolen password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have also seen poorly designed attempts eg Applesupport123(a)gmail.com as a sender email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office365 already has built in anti-spoofing technology, including the use of SPF and DKIM<br />
<br />
In addition if you sign up with Advance Threat Protection (ATP) you get Spoof Intelligence and other advanced capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ATP will also give you additional features like sandboxing and safe links, which will also enhance your corporate protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While ATP will enhance your anti-phishing protection, you will also need to educate your users to -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Always check on who the sender is. This will identify simple attacks that do not modify sender credentials.</p>
<p>2. Always be wary of unsolicited files - double check with sender</p>
<p>3. Always be wary of unsolicited instructions - double check with relevant department</p>
<p>4. Always be wary of unusual requests from management or collegues, especially asking for payment or information - double check with sender</p>

<h2>            Publisher taking too long to print.</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week, my computer's hard drive crashed and had to replace the&nbsp;entire unit. Installed print driver and it appeared to be working fine. However, trying to print mail-merged postcards in Publisher and it is not working as previous. It will print one page,
 waits about a minute or two, then the next one prints. Using 64-bit version of Office 365 on a Windows 8.1 Pro desktop. Connected to printer via network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Corey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the issue might be caused by multiple reasons,</p>
<p>I want to confirm some information with you.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>The issue only occurs on your Publisher or all of the
 Office apps.</span></li><li><span>What's your publisher document's size?</span></li><li><span>The issue occurs on all publisher documents or only mail-merged ones?</span></li><li><span>Your Office 365 Product Version.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could also be caused by the internet problem and physical printer issues.</p>
<p>To rule out these possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Check with your colleague if they can
 print your document without hanging.</span></li><li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Restart your printer and try print a document from USB connection, see if the printer still hangs.</span></li></ol>

<p>Thanks for the reply. With the former (now non-functioning) computer, there was an issue with not printing more than 34 pages of the mail-merge. After some work with Microsoft Support, we moved up to the 64-bit version of Office. I uninstalled all old versions
 of Office on the new machine and installed the 64-bit this week, so the updates should not be an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Document size should not be either, as it is the same document (just different addresses) as I printed each week. I will say a picture is included in the merge, but it always has been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other app is experiencing the issue. Just mail-merged in Publisher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps eliminate some concerns.</p>

<h2>            &#34;View&#34; problem on Word 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    
<p>Loaded Office 2016 yesterday. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When working in Word I tried to adjust the view panel from 100% to higher so I could read the document on the screen. (This functions just fine in 2011 Word.) However in Word 2016 when you go View &gt; Zoom what happens is a pixellation of the document which
 is blurry, hard to read but worst of all, the document cannot be worked on. It freezes, won't respond to mouse clicks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is anyone else experiencing this glitch and able to resolve? Have urgent documents to work on and need an answer. &nbsp;Many thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I connect to my Facebook account&#63;</h2>
                    My phone synced to my Facebook account perfectly when I first received it but recently I had to change the password to my account. When I did this, it logged me out and said that there is a problem with one of my accounts so I tapped on settings to try
 to fix it. However, once I had gotten to it, I entered my password and it wouldn't accept it. I tried this multiple time so then I decided to make an attempt to undo the sync of my Facebook account from my phone and then sync it again. When I tried this, it
 said that they're having trouble deleting Facebook. I checked to make sure I had a connection and tried again multiple times but it just wouldn't work. It gave me the error code 0x80048869. Why is it doing this and how can I fix it?

            <p>Hello Alleycat007:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having with your Facebook account since changing the password.&nbsp; I believe this is something we should be able to get corrected.&nbsp; Follow the upcoming steps and let us know if you have continuing
 issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, uninstall any Facebook applications currently on your phone.&nbsp; You should be able to do this by going to the application &gt; tapping and holding that application &gt; selecting uninstall.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the application is uninstalled go to the following site and sign into your account,
<a href="http://accounts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://accounts.live.com</a>.&nbsp; From here we need to unlink your Facebook account from the Microsoft account.&nbsp; You can do that by going to permissions &gt; manage other accounts &gt; edit &gt; remove this connection completely.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the Facebook account is unlinked from the Microsoft account we should be able to remove the Facebook account.&nbsp; Before trying to delete the account again, go to the phone and tap settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tap and hold the email listed as Windows
 Live &gt; select sync.&nbsp; After the sync completes, tap and hold the Facebook account and delete the account from the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final step in this process would be to try and add the Facebook account back to the phone using the new password.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

            What is copied with the QAT is the row of buttons. Macros are stored in templates. They are stored in the normal.dotm template by default but can be in other templates. See

<h2>            Delays between answering and being able to communicate</h2>
                    <p>Skype has become unusable because when I call or answer a call there is such a long time between answering and being able to communicate people are hanging up. I now have to contact another person to tell them it was not a weird call but from me. This is
 made worse as most often they see the call is from Russia and not the UK</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a group, we are now looking at alternatives because of this. I have a good connection and a good laptop, so it is not an issue with my connection or hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the problem or do I just give in and go elsewhere???</p>

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Any Antivirus on your computer?
<br />
<br />Does your network have a Firewall that might be blocking Skype somehow?
<br />
<br />Have you tried in another network? The speed on Wifi and Ethernet cable is the same?
<br />
<br />Are you connected to a Proxy?
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hi Peter
<br />
<br />It looks like its possibly regional or some server issues depending on where you are.
<br />
<br />I recommend you monitor your Skype Status - Skype Support

            Thanks. There is so much crap on their web site it is difficult to find how to get hold of someone to test my system and find what is wrong. The call test facility works as normal, it is just when I want to talk with people I get this long delay, and as
 I use it for business, it gives a very bad impression and gets people irritated, which is not a good way to start a meeting.

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>Did you ever find a solution for this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am based in Tbilisi and experiencing exactly the same. Service says everything is fine.</p>
<p>I am using Kaspersky Internet Security.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
