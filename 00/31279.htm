<h2>            Laptop resumes playing audio after being opened from sleep mode before I can pause it.</h2>
                    <p>I have an issues with my laptop resuming audio playback before I can actually access anything to pause it. The situation plays out like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am listening to music or watching videos on my laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>I close my laptop to do something else for a while (5 minutes or longer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I return to my laptop and open it</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am greeted by a black screen as my laptop has not finished waking back up</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop resumes the audio/video playback</p>
<p>
</p><p>My screen reactivates and I am able to find whatever program is preforming the playback to pause it</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My issue is the resumption of audio/video playback before I would have an opportunity to pause it. Some times I have music on full blast while I am cleaning then close my laptop to go get food and when I get back and reopen it the music will resume full
 blast as soon as reopen the laptop, which of course I have to do if I want to close out of the music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to automatically mute the speakers or sound on the laptop when it is closed that requires the sounds to be manually reactivated after it is opened? Thanks.</p>

            Why not do that before closing the laptop lid since this seems to be a reoccuring activity?
<br />
<br />Or press Function key + F key for muting volum.

<h2>            Tun miniport adapter &#35;2 missing from Device Manager</h2>
                    
<p>The other day my&nbsp;Ethernet&nbsp;port stopped working. I looked it up in my Device manager and it turned out&nbsp;Tun miniport adapter #2 had an error starting (more specifically error 10). I used "Microsoft Fix It" earlier and it reinstalled the driver. Now miniport
 adapter #2 isn't&nbsp;showing at all in Device Manager. I tried following these steps&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-network-adapter-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-network-adapter-problems</a>&nbsp;.
 But it only gives me the option to update a specific device not network adapter in general and since miniport isn't showing i cant update it.&nbsp;Haven't&nbsp;been able to find anything else that might help so i am posting here. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: Found out how to add back miniport. However i am still getting a "code 10" error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit2: Ethernet port suddenly came back to life. So thats good. Is this miniport connected to it at all?</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I use the suggested method to make the text smaller, the text changes size, then the sticky notes app crashes. When I reopen it, the font is back to the original size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            <p>The spacing issue does not stay. The minute I type text, it goes back to double spacing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also takes a long time to type on the sticky notes. I dont have any problems on any other part of my computer...just when I type on the sticky note. One word takes about 20 seconds.</p>

            While these solutions are helpful for the font size of the text it doesn't remedy the size of the actual note. I keep several on my desktop and they now take up half my desktop. I've shrunk them as far as it will allow but they're still too big. Microsoft
 - if it ain't broke don't fix it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 8 PDF reader</h2>
                    I have a brand new windows 8 computer. While when I used to open pdfs (within the first month of owning the computer) it would open them in the pdf reader. Now when I try to open a pdf it takes me to my computers photos which is full of random things,
 but not the pdf I am trying to open. If that makes sense can anyone help me?

            <p>It's ok, and simple fix.&nbsp; You probably got upgraded to IE 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You just need to go to Adobe.com and download a current .pdf reader, which is by the way only compatible with 32-bit IE.&nbsp; And next, go to Windows Update.&nbsp; You'll have to wait while it scans for updates.&nbsp; They you can use the "set program defaults) on the
 right side of the Update screen to designate Adobe Reader as the default program for .pdf files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, this means you'll also have to use the 32-bit version of IE, not the 64-bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Myself, I had desktop icons for both the 32-bit and 64-bit Explorers, but I had to rename them so I could tell them apart.&nbsp; You do this simply by left clicking on the title under the icon, which will then highlight, typing the new name (like IE 32), and
 hitting enter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 10 doesn't have two different versions anymore. They have been integrated into one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 9 had two versions, and of the two, the best was the 32-bit which had a faster JavaScript engine and was way more compatible generally..

            <p>Good that they integrated them, maybe.&nbsp; I've been off Win 8 for about 3 weeks now.&nbsp; &nbsp;(And no, I emphatically do NOT recommend anyone revert from an OEM to Win 7 if you have any choice about it at all, it's even harder than taming Win 8!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I'm curious.&nbsp; If they're integrated now, can you still install the real Adobe Reader and Adobe Shockwave?&nbsp; And the real Java?&nbsp; I ask because when I had Win 8 and IE 10, some web sites and games didn't function correctly without the real deal.&nbsp; MS's "incorporated"
 versions didn't display corrected, or locked up, or wouldn't play, or produced the dreaded BSOD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the integrated version work properly now?</p>

            <p>Adobe Reader is invasive and slow. I opt for Foxit Reader. Adobe Shockwave install fine, and Java is real, but not downloadable from Sun as a standalone update.</p>

    <title>XBox One w&#47; Receiver Setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gpmic  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox One w&#47; Receiver Setup</h2>
                    Hello all, I have a question about a the setup I have planned for the xbox one and whether it'll work. I have all my consoles/boxes going to a Onkyo 605 receiver which has a 5.1 speaker setup connected along with HDMI out to a projector. Ideally I would
 place the xbox between the 605 and the projector but obviously this would leave the xbox out of the audio loop. I was hoping to overcome this by utilizing the optical audio out on the xbox back to the receiver. However, if I switch the input to the xbox optical
 in, then I'll create a loop with the receivers HDMI audio out...right? Is there any way around this? Also, the 9ft cable on the kinect 2.0 will not be sufficient for my setup and since there is no news on an extender, the only option I can come up with is
 to place the xbox one by the screen and purchase long HDMI cables to run back to the cable box and receiver. Has anyone come up with anything else? Thanks for your help!
                </div>

<p>My set up will be:</p>
<p>Cable Box HDMI out to Xbox One HDMI IN, Xbox One HDMI out to Receiver HDMI In, Receiver HDMI out to TV HDMI in, Receiver Audio out to Speakers</p>
<p>So the Cable audio/video goes to the Xbox One, Xbox One send that and/or it's audio/video to the Receiver, Receiver sends video to TV and audio to Speakers</p>
<p>It seems like that's what you're describing, so I'm not sure why you think audio is being left out anywhere.</p>

<p>Your setup is my backup plan. &nbsp;The setup I'm proposing is cable box/ps3/appleTV-&gt;receiver-&gt;xbox one-&gt;projector. &nbsp;With this setup, I can switch the feed going to the xbox with the receiver but unfortunately, audio needs special consideration.</p>

<p>I'm assuming you want the direct feed to the projector to eliminate input lag from using the receiver? Your projector has two HDMI In ports to achieve this (one for the receiver, one of the Xbox One)?<br />
<br />
Or do you plan to plug the receiver into the Xbox One HDMI In?</p>

<p>No, the main reason for this setup would be to switch peripherals going through the xbox interface. &nbsp;I would be able to have live tv like intended, but then easily switch to ps3 while still maintaining the ability to access the xbox one interface. &nbsp;The xbox
 one would always be in line with the projector so it's functionality is always accessible. &nbsp;The reduction of input lag would be a bonus.

<p>I have a Yamaha, but you'll run into a problem with your solution. &nbsp;When you switch to the Xbox sound out you'll be changing the input the rec is using to the optical out of the Xbox you'll no longer be getting a video feed from the others. &nbsp;Basically passing
 blank video and it's own audio back to self like you said. &nbsp;You have created a repeating loop on audio. &nbsp;CiChild has the cleanest chain solution, but it doesn't allow what you want. &nbsp;Now I'm not sure if all your other devices are HDMI, but you could get a
 simple HDMI switch if they are and then send the output from this into the Xbox and the Xbox one as the only connection to your Onkyo rec; which in turn would split sound out to speakers and video to projector. &nbsp;Another box in front of the Xbox is the only
 solution I can think of to achieve a clean setup of what you are going for; given that the Xbox only has 1 HDMI in. &nbsp;Of course if some of your input devices are not HDMI the solution gets more complex and bulky.</p>
<p>Now I'm not an expert by any means; so there could be better solutions to this. &nbsp;I'm always happy to get educated :)</p>

<p>It might also be a fact that no audio is forwarded if the rec takes it all off (none on output line), but if that's the case you'd be missing layered audio when not set to Xbox. &nbsp;Also you'd still have the problem of not being able to hear 2 audios at once
 for some things (game &amp; TV) without switching the rec source selection. &nbsp;I think you'll just end up with headaches, but just wanted to tack on that bit.</p>

<p>Best choice is to swing all inputs over to a dedicated HDMI switch, then take the HDMI output from the switch and feed it through the Xbox One and then on to one of the receiver inputs. That allows the Xbox One to mix all the audio from whatever second source
 you want to overlay the Xbox One on top of. This won't help with non-HDMI sources that you want to funnel through the Xbox One, though.</p>

<p>It should work. You can change what each source receives. Just set your receiver so that when you select xbox one (whatever inlut you choose) it actually reads just the optical audio. Then when you snap to ps3, youll have to also select the ps3 on the receiver.
 the xbox will still broadcast video to projector and the receiver will do audio. What I want to test is if the hdmi in is 2 way. If it is you just select the OUTPUT on the receiver (usually called tv) and that would do audio out and in and video just goes
 to projectory. Then you select tv for xbox one</p>

<p>If the One does optical out in the same way as the 360 I am pretty sure selecting "Optical Out" will mean no sound is sent via HDMI.</p>
<p>and even if this is not the case specifying "Optical Input" for sound on the Receiver should mean that HDMI sound is disregarded by the Receiver.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 update causing problems with Nvidia geforce gt 630m 2gb</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I updated my laptop to windows 8.1 pro with media center, after which my GPU seems to be underperforming. The system detects the graphics card but during gameplay I'm getting lower frame rates (17-19 fps) as compared to 35-40 fps earlier in windows 8.
 Also after a little bit of mulling through forums online, i found that all 630m owners were having this problem after updating to 8.1.</div>
<div>Please suggest the advised course of action.</div>
<div>Awaiting reply</div>
<div>Yours sincerely</div>

<p>when ever I open the system kernel driver crash only temporary solution is to start with disabled graphics driver. after starting &nbsp;enable and disabled it again other wise system restart with continuous error&nbsp;of driver crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>when internet explorer start with enabled graphics still the same problem so to avoid that only solution works is to use software rendering instead of GPU rendering.</p>

reinstall of the same drivers may help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you try to uninstall the previous version of NVIDIA driver from program list and then try to install the latest driver patch?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to uninstall the previous version of driver, restart the computer and then download and install the latest driver patch.</p>

<p>I have been building and working on computers since 1982 =(TSR 80) so please don't replay back with working around the sys config it's just basic 101&nbsp;jargon, been there done that.&nbsp;My question is when is Microsoft going to release a hotfix for the NVidia
 driver issue and the line of all Nvidia graphics cards. I have upgraded to windows 8.1 and my FPS have dropped by 20 to 30 FPS.&nbsp;Example World of Tanks&nbsp;on windows 8, 60 to 80 fps all the time now Windows 8.1, 18 to 30 fps not good. Now before anyone tells me
 to clean, uninstall etc... I always uninstall and clean the&nbsp;reg out before installing anything into a sys, also I have updated windows.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Go&nbsp;to Start / Control Panel / Mouse and make sure that the scheme you are using is saved and that there is no option checked to revert to the default scheme on startup.&nbsp; If
 there is such an option, make your preferred mouse scheme the default.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search
 box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each
 for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should<strong>do them for at least the mouse</strong> (everything that applies) and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so
 from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If this doesn't work, post back and we'll check out some other options to try to find and resolve the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

After you had picked the customed pointer, make sure you click Apply or OK beffore exiting.<br />
There is no button nor option to " save " your selection. Ignore that advice.</p>

    <title>Taskbar middle click doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zaoshi kaba  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar middle click doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I used to use middle click in the taskbar to close application instances and open new instances, however after resetting Windows 10 (might have happened after 10586 update but I am unable to test that now) this feature partially stopped working. To be exact,
 I can open new instances only for pinned applications, but it does not work for non-pinned applications. Is there a way to change / fix this behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 doesn&#39;t detect my second monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankfazzio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 doesn&#39;t detect my second monitor</h2>
                    <p>I have two notebooks which, when at home, each connect to their own docking stations and the docking stations connect to a KVM switch so I can use one large monitor, a full sized keyboard, and a stationary trackball when at my desk.&nbsp; I installed Windows
 10 upgrade on the older of the two first. It is a Lenovo X220 running Windows 7, fully updated.&nbsp; Taking advantage of the reservation program I installed the 10 upgrade and it was flawless.&nbsp; On this machine, 10 detected and duplicated my desktop on the second
 monitor, which is what I want.&nbsp; My newer notebook is a Lenovo Twist, came with Windows 8 and I upgraded it to 8.1 and all was well.&nbsp; It too is fully updated.&nbsp; But now again using the reservation process, I obtained and installed the 10 upgrade.&nbsp; Seemed to
 go well but my second monitor was never detected.&nbsp; Going into display settings, only one monitor is detected, and telling it to detect fails to get a positive result.&nbsp; Here are some important details.&nbsp; The monitor is a Samsung Syncmaster 210T and the KVM is
 a Starview 8 port USB and Audio KVM switch from Startech. (I've had more than two computers attached to it in the past.)&nbsp; The KVM LED indicator lights clearly show that the KVM is getting a signal from the computer.&nbsp; And the LED indicator on the monitor glows
 green indicating that it is receiving a signal from something (at least the KVM switch).&nbsp; Further, the keyboard and trackball attached to the KVM work fine on this newer notebook after the upgrade to 10.&nbsp; I am a fairly sophisticated computer user but I must
 admit I don't have a lot of ideas about how to trouble shoot this one.&nbsp; Here is what I have tried.&nbsp; First I shut down the computer and re-powered it with the docking station, KVM switch, and monitor already on.&nbsp; Didn't help.&nbsp; So I shut it down again, and this
 time I tried re-powering it with the docking station and monitor powered off.&nbsp; Once booted up, I then re-powered the docking station and monitor in sequence.&nbsp; Didn't help.&nbsp; Device manager does not see the second monitor (no surprise). Does anyone have any
 ideas? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>( I haven't tried switching out the KVM cable from the notebook docking station to that port on the KVM switch or moving the cable to another port on the switch, but it was working fine right up to the moment I started the upgrade to 10, and the mouse and
 keyboard work fine.&nbsp; And it all works fine on the older notebook which means the cables from the KVM to the peripherals are OK.)</p>

            <p>Thank you for your assistance. I reviewed the material at both of the links and it was very general and not helpful with my specific problem.&nbsp; I went to Samsung's website and used online chat with their technical support department.&nbsp; They said two things.&nbsp;
 First, the monitor is plug n play and it should not require the installation of any specific drivers.&nbsp; Second, there are no specific drivers for Windows 10, but they MAY release drivers for Windows 10 in the future ( if the monitor is plug n play, then I don't
 understand why the comment about possibly releasing drivers).&nbsp; Also, I am not sure I know how to install a driver for a device that is not already installed in Windows because you usually need to go into device manager and select the device and update the
 driver from there, but this device does not appear in device manager because it is not being detected!!!</p>
<p>I have done a few other things which I will describe.&nbsp; First I switched out the KVM cable for a new one and connected it to a different port on the KVM switch, but that didn't change anything.&nbsp; I next did something which is quite revealing.&nbsp; The native resolution
 on my laptop screen is 1366 x 768 which is fairly standard.&nbsp; The external monitor likes 1600 x 1200 but will work at 1024 x 768.&nbsp; It is a 4:3 aspect ratio monitor.&nbsp; When I boot up the laptop, the laptop displays on its own screen at 1366 x 768.&nbsp; The LED on
 the external monitor is glowing green which I know to mean that it is receiving input.&nbsp; Otherwise it would either glow yellow, or it would display a notice, "no signal, check cable".&nbsp; When I go into display properties, Windows only sees one monitor and of
 course calls it number "1".&nbsp; When I tell it to "detect", it only finds monitor "1".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So now, I hit the Windows Key with "P" and when the sidebar "Project" menu opens, I tell windows to "duplicate" the display.&nbsp; So Windows does, and then I am looking at a 4:3 aspect desktop on my laptop's screen and in display settings guess what resolution
 is being displayed on my laptop:&nbsp; 1024 x 768.&nbsp; Furthermore, Windows now says there are TWO monitors attached, "1" and "2".&nbsp; It displays 1/2 (the bar is a vertical bar not a slash).&nbsp; And my external monitor is still blank,&nbsp;and the LED is still glowing green.&nbsp;
 And if I tell Windows to "identify" the first thing that happens is that it has a little seizure and closes down the "display properties" dialogue box altogether.&nbsp; So I reopen it and again tell it to "identify", and guess what, it just&nbsp;identifies monitors
 1/2 at the same time again.&nbsp; And if I tell it to "detect" it comes back and says, "Windows did not detect another display".</p>
<p>It seems pretty clear to me that this is a problem with Windows 10 and an incompatibility with the hardware.&nbsp; Since this all works fine on my other Lenovo X220&nbsp;laptop with the same external monitor and the same KVM switch, the only other thing I can think
 of is that there is some incompatibility with the Docking station on the Lenovo twist, which is not an issue with the docking station on the Lenovo X220.&nbsp; I am going to look at Lenovo's website and see if they have drivers for the docking station for Windows
 10.&nbsp; In the meantime, if you or anyone else has any other ideas, please let me know.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>OK.&nbsp; I determined the solution to this problem on my own.&nbsp; I am going to post the short answer first and then I am going to post the long answer, which is the process I used to troubleshoot this problem, in case anyone has a similar problem and could benefit
 from reading about my experience.</p>
<p>Short Answer:&nbsp; I updated the driver software for my Lenovo USB 3.0 Docking Station.</p>
<p>Long Answer:&nbsp; First, I disconnected the docking station which means the KVM switch was also disconnected.&nbsp; Then I pulgged the monitor directly into the mini-display port on the side of the Thinkpad and booted up.&nbsp; The Thinkpad detected the external monitor.&nbsp;
 HOWEVER, it displayed the desktop at 1024x768 on both the external monitor and the notebook monitor and no amount of fiddling could get this changed.&nbsp; I shut down the system and then connected the monitor directly to the USB 3.0 Dock and plugged the USB dock
 back in to the Thinkpad but disconnected it from the KVM switch.&nbsp; On boot up, the Thinkpad failed to detect the external monitor.&nbsp; This pretty much eliminated the KVM switch as part of the problem.&nbsp; And while the system did not seem to work right when the
 monitor was plugged directly into the Thinkpad, at least it was detected.&nbsp; So I reasoned that what was going on here was a hardware problem in either the Thinkpad or more likely the Docking station, or both.&nbsp; First, I went to Windows update and made sure my
 Windows 10 installation was up to date.&nbsp; Then I went to Lenovo Support and updated my Thinkpad, including even a BIOS update.&nbsp; Neither of these things made a difference.&nbsp; So then I went to Lenovo Support and found a driver update for the Lenovo USB 3.0 Dock
 for Windows 10!!!&nbsp; Bingo.&nbsp; After installation the system worked fine.&nbsp; It now detects the external monitor and displays a duplicate desktop on the external monitor and on the notebook monitor.&nbsp; I am not able to display different resolutions on each screen,
 however.&nbsp; I know this can be done, but I think the reason I can't on this system is a limitation with the built in Intel HD graphics 4000 display adapter.&nbsp; With a more high end display adapter such as made by NVidia and others, it would be possible.&nbsp; So I
 am at 13666 x 768 which looks great on the notebook and a little odd on the external monitor, but I will put up with that until a buy a new monitor capable of the more modern aspect ratio.</p>

<p>What do you mean by <em>storage folder</em>? There is a heading <em>Storage folders</em> at the bottom of the folder pane, visible only if it's activated on the
<em>View</em> tab. This contains a number of system folders (<em>Sent items</em>,
<em>Drafts</em> and <em>Deleted items</em>) which are necessary for the program's operation. Any other folders there are either user-created or put there by the program after a message import or a database recovery. Is this where you're seeing deleted items
 brought back? In which folder? Otherwise, is this storage folder under a mail account heading? It would help tremendously if you could

            Yes that's the storage folder I mean. It keeps bring back emails I've already deleted. It is a pop account. I keep turning it off in the view tab but it still keeps coming back. All I want is to be able to shut it off. I have more than one email account
 and also newsgroups that I belong to. The newsgroups are set to load only new messages.

            I have three email accounts and four newsgroup accounts and when the storage folder pops up it's for all the accounts. I don't think having to delete all of them and putting them back is the answer. the storage folder appears to be a part of the email
 program itself but there's no way to shut it off.

<p>Even though it's not highlighted it keeps coming back. See where the arrow is. I keep un-highlighting it but it keeps highlighting itself and showing up bringing with it emails I've already deleted.

<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>This shouldn't happen. The setting is stored in the registry (HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\ShowLocalFolders with value data 1 for
<em>Yes</em> and 0 for <em>No</em>). If the setting isn't sticking, I'd suspect some third-party 'security' application that's reversing changes made to the registry. Do you have anything like this running?</p>

<p>This I just don't understand. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Where</span> are you seeing

            The bottom screen shot didn't show it but when it does this there's another folder called recovered items and that's where the emails show up. When they do I have to delete the recovered folder then empty the deleted folder. They sometimes show up in the
 original folders where I had deleted them from. This is annoying since this can happen several times a day. All I want to do is stop that folder from coming back and bringing back deleted emails.

<h2>            Skype on MAC 10.7.5</h2>
                    <p>Hallo, yesterday I was pushed out of Skype app.</p>
<p>I used always Skype without problems, now if I try to download the version from Skype page it says to me that I should update it and download it again. There is no way to get my app back working.</p>
<p>I use MAC 10.7.5 and I do not want the Skype on Web but the normal Skype application.</p>
<p>I can login in Skype normally on other MAC computers so it is not a question of my account.</p>
<p>Please tell me where can I download a working version, and what should I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is URGENT because I need Skype for my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks,</p>
<p>regards</p>

</p><p>I regret to inform you but Skype&nbsp;is no longer supported&nbsp;for versions Mac OS X 10.8 and lower which is the main reason&nbsp;why you are&nbsp;unable to use it&nbsp;with your current device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype is always making improvements, such as enhanced quality, better reliability, and improved security. Because we want everyone to experience the best Skype has to offer, it's sometimes necessary to retire older versions of Skype, and Skype enabled devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These decisions are hard to make, but are necessary as Skype moves forward so we can deliver new experiences on devices that have the capability to support them and these changes will be implemented over the coming months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to update the OS version on your device to continue running Skype on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            I have an older iMac running OSX Lion, which cannot be upgraded to a new OSX, and so my only other option is to use Apple's Facetime instead. Your actions to totally discontinue support and not offer a solution to your existing customers demonstrates that
 Microsoft really does not care about users. Skype was great when they were a separate company. Since Microsoft bought them they seem to have lost any consideration of what customers want and need. You lost me as a customer again!&nbsp;

<p>Hi Zell_A</p>
<p>I cannot speak with my grand children now. &nbsp;Silva Maselli's question is almost the same as mine except I am handicapped and retired on a limited fixed income, with a mac computer handed down by my children. &nbsp;It works very well, but I cannot afford a newer
 computer and have not received an upgrade from my children.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now Skype has made a regrettable decision to kill my chances to connect with my family. &nbsp;I'm just sad about this. This would make a good tv advertisement with other sad seniors. &nbsp;Sorry I don't really mean that. &nbsp;But I don't understand why the claim of
 making skype better with newer features has anything to do with killing older working versions. &nbsp; It has taken me a few days of confusion and calling my son to get to this point. &nbsp;I don't know what to do.&nbsp;</p>

            There is a similar problem across other versions of Skype for Linux, Android etc. &nbsp;So you are one of millions of families in the same situation. &nbsp;This ignorance on Microsoft's part is surely valid grounds for litigation? &nbsp;After all the EU has massively
 fined Microsoft for their ignorance!

<p>Certainly Microsoft have clearly demonstrated contempt for the Skype user base so far... &nbsp; Frequent assertions on the forum that Microsoft are listening, however:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mac Skype 2.8 replacement was vastly space inefficient, a real pain on smaller screens, leading to threads of over a thousand posts with almost all posters with only a few posts to their name, all complaining about the new version with suggestions about
 greater space efficiency and requesting the separate window for chats please, etc. &nbsp;Microsoft response: close the forum ditching years of help from experienced Skype users;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft asks Linux community for help developing new version, Linux community donate masses of free labour to debug new versions saving Microsoft a fortune, with consistent request for roughly same feature set / controls as old version, Microsoft launch
 skeleton Skype with 80% reduction in features, controls &amp; connectivity then close forum to hide the repeated requests for similar feature set to older version;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Android &amp; iOS Skype video call platforms updated without warning to a SnapChat / WhatsApp copy with reduced video call capability, without any indication of any form of consultation; Android &amp; iOS communities justifiably furious at app degradation with Play
 Store &amp; App Store ratings dropping from 4.5 out of 5 to around 1 out of 5, plus Android &amp; iOS forums attracting masses of negative feedback and requests for reinstatement of blindingly obviously useful features deleted in the new version automatically imposed
 on most phones, new versions described as targeting infant school students and losing useful communication features. &nbsp;With the size of the change to this app imposed without consultation this can justifiably be called a rape of a once elegant and justifiably
 dominant app. &nbsp;Microsoft's response is to redesign the forum removing the option to sort by number of views, so hiding the flood of dissent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty clear demonstration of Microsoft completely ignoring the bulk of the community, although there are very large numbers of Android Skype users that have neither the:</p>
<p>technical skills,</p>
<p>screen space or connectivity (only connection is cellphone network &amp; 5 inch Android screen),</p>
<p>linguistic skills (English is 3rd or 4th language)</p>
<p>to contribute to a forum such as this. &nbsp;My fiancee is an example, tried the new Android Skype over 6 calls with 5 failures, has not been seen on Android Skype since, I think she has uninstalled it as it is so bad and is now using Viber, so will take her
 large well distributed family with her. &nbsp;It will be a major challenge to bring them back to Skype, if possible at all, guess they are not unusual with this response. &nbsp;I hope that the Microsoft Skype developer team are not inspired by the Windows mobile OS
 and phone teams... &nbsp;For a long time Windows cellphone sales were less than the rounding margin of iOS &amp; Android sales, now Windows mobile has been dropped...</p>

            <p>Some downloaded Themes (eg "Panoramic Beaches" from MS themes download) might add their own sound scheme. You can make your own sound scheme pretty much the same way as in previous Windows versions by manually selecting the .WAV sound files you want played
 for any of the&nbsp;Windows actions. Open the Sounds control,&nbsp;select the sound you&nbsp;want to&nbsp;change and Browse to the new &nbsp;.WAV file's location. Change as many as you want and then click "Save as" and name your scheme.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;Hi Jess,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before proceed, please sign out Skype for Business then delete my sign-in info then sign in again and check the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please delete the SIP profile and re-cache it. Navigate to </span><strong><span>%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</span></strong><span> and then delete the sip_username directory that matches the sip address of the user experiencing
 the issues.&nbsp; This directory will be rebuilt when the SFB / Lync client is restarted the next time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please update your Skype for Business to latest version and check the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the steps above cannot solve the problem, please provide more details for us to investigate:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>What’s the detailed version of your Skype for Business? Click setting -&gt; Help -&gt; About Skype for Business.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Are there any other users encountering the same issue? Can the issue be replicated on another device?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Please check your Skype for Business configuration by and send it via <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
Private Message</a>. To access this information, press and hold the Ctrl key while you right-click the Skype for Business icon in the notification area, and then click Configuration Information. Copy it and paste in Private Message.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Do you have your own Skype for Business server or pure Skype for Business online service? If you have your own skype for Business server, what’s its version and if it is hybrid?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>May I know if you are an global admin of your Office 365 organization, if not, please involve your admin to troubleshoot the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Baron</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Jess,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>May I know if you are using Skype for Business on mobile phone or desktop client?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using Skype for Business on desktop client, you can Open File Explorer, then navigate to
<strong>%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>(please note:
<strong>AppData</strong> is hidden by default, please unhidden it)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then delete the
<strong>sip_username</strong> directory that matches the sip address of the user experiencing the issues (If you have more than one SIP profile).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28316b4d-372d-41a1-af63-233e20463fe0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28316b4d-372d-41a1-af63-233e20463fe0" /></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using Skype for Business on mobile client, you can re-install the Skype for Business app and check the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up uninstalling my Jabra headset and reinstalled it and that has seemed to take care of the issue. Now when I log on Business Skype reflects when I am on the phone and when I am not. Today was the first day it worked correctly so will see how things
 go Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jess</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Architecture Change</h2>
                    <p>I am changing my Windows 10 Architecture from 32 bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>to 64 bit, via the media creation tool provided and using a</p>
<p>USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, on rebooting for the clean installation of</p>
<p>Windows 10 64 bit, and then installing it, will my old and</p>
<p>original files and data on the drive remain? or will it be deleted?</p>
<p>

            <p>When you do a clean install of Windows everything gets whipped. </p>
<p>The HDD gets reformatted before reinstalling Windows.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You cannot 'upgrade' from 32 to 64 bit Windows, so a clean install is the only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Old folder is only created when doing a 'repair' reinstall (which overwrites the current Windows),</p>
<p>or an upgrade from one OS to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back up your entire User folder and any other important data that may be elsewhere in your system</p>
<p>to an external HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better yet... If possible, clone your entire current version of&nbsp; Windows to another HDD.
</p>
<p>This way you keep <em>everything</em> in tact.</p>

            <p>The OP references '<em>clean install'</em>.&nbsp; My&nbsp; point was that clean install implies a reformatted HDD,
</p>
<p>and yes, you do have to choose to format. </p>
<p>Any reinstall of Windows without reformatting the HDD is <em>not </em>a clean install.
</p>
<p>Not saying it won't function properly, just that it's is not the same as a fresh as a daisy Windows install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not the 'clean' vs old (repair or upgrade) that is the concern though. It's the change from 32 to 64bit Windows.</p>
<p>Is the Win10 upgrade tool capable of changing the existing Windows from a 32 bit to 64bit without
</p>
<p>reformatting the HDD ?</p>
<p>If you have done this without reformatting then my info is out of date, but doing an install of 64bit Windows
</p>
<p>into the same partition as a 32bit would seem to yield a fairly messy OS . Lots of potential for conflicts.</p>
<p>It has a visit from&nbsp; Murphy's Law written all over it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Regardless of the method of updating from the current Windows to Win10 backups should be made.</p>
<p>There is always a risk of data loss from a borked upgrade. <br />

            <p>Hi Andre -</p>
<p><span>I admit I have not read all of the linked post (feeling lazy atm), but are you verifying that it is possible to
</span></p>
<p><span>change from</span><span> 32 to 64 bit without doing a proper reformat clean install ?</span></p>
<p>Can you 'upgrade' to Win10 64bit in the same partition as an existing 32bit Windows with no stability</p>
<p>issues, or conflicts ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that upgrading an old Win7 (mine was six years old when I did the Win10 upgrade) can work well,</p>
but was of the impression that going from 32 to 64 bit was an exception.
<p>Is it desirable or advisable to 'upgrade' from a 32bit Windows to Win10 64bit without reformatting the</p>
<p>HDD/Partition and installing the 64bit Windows 'clean' ?</p>
<br />
<p>- In one of your linked posts you say -&nbsp; <span><em>"...we take a look at how to recover your files
<p>This seems to confirm one thing that has been suggested earlier, and a key question in the OP.
<p>There are no guarantees your data will be preserved otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for clarifying these points.</p>
<p>Cheers - BD</p>

    <title>Windows update problem makes giant CBS.log probably languagepacks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markantnl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update problem makes giant CBS.log probably languagepacks involved</h2>
                    <blockquote>
<p>From the explosive growth of my CBS.log file it turned out that something goes wrong with finding or installing (window) updates
</p>
<p>The cbslog grows above 1 GB, sometimes within some hours, even if a new one is made (and the old one stored as CBSpersist_date). It seems to be caused bij some specific language modules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer is a desktop, W8 on SSD (64GB), factory installed, HDD 2TB, memory 8 GB, core i7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If i run SFC, than a set of files of 6 languages (packages in various KBupdates) is repaired. After that, the problems is away for some hours or a day, with only small additions to CBS.log. But then it explodes again, and grows within short time by 100's
 of MB.&nbsp; It seems to be related to new updates, which seem to be installed succesfully. Maybe the cbs explosion starts just by some routine check&nbsp;by the system (CBS?). The pc also seems to adjust windows during restart more than usual, not only after an update
 or SFC. But not always, so at some moments all seems to be ok. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks as if&nbsp; SFC must repair some language-specific components, i think even always the same languages (hu, fr, da, es , fi, nb). (SFC finishes all these repairs succesfully) .</p>
<p>You see these languages also appear frequently in the CBS.log -lines of before the SFC-run.
</p>
<p>I don't know the exact procedures, but it seems that a number&nbsp;(or all) of the language-specific components or files for a task are checked one by one, to see if there's something new about them and if&nbsp;packages or maps to copy them from are present.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the 6 languages that later sfc must repair, you often see a line parent found for (name file or map), State: absent.</p>
<p>For the other languages (if checked) the corresponding line is "no parent found, go absent".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updatenames are also mentioned; during one and the same CSB.log explosion several KBnumber are mentioned, although it seems KB2756872 is always involved, also when the event starts again some time after an&nbsp;SFC run. This KB2756872&nbsp;is -according to update
 history, already installed since october 2012, so in the factory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is: does someone recognize this&nbsp; (kind of) problem, and what is the solution?
</p>
<p>Because as long as this is not solved, i can not make a basic image to restore to, as&nbsp;the underlying problem&nbsp;will be inhereted forever then...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not install any personal software yet, only the programs originally installed by the factory (as is W8, OEM, with recovery partition on hard disk).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Underneath I add some lines from the CBS.log. First the repairmessage of SFC (for 1 language, for the other 5 languages it is similar patron).</p>
<p>Then an axample of the 2 lines from CBS.log before running SFC, for one of the problem-languages.&nbsp; For comparition, also the same line for a correct' language.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end some lines about an invalid package, that are quite in the beginning of an "explosive" cbs-run.</p>
<p>(HResult= 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE).&nbsp; Could this have to do with the problem, or can i neglect it?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SFC in CBS.log:</p>
<p><em>CSI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 000006e9 [SR] Repairing corrupted file [ml:60{30},l:58{29}]"\??\C:\windows\SysWOW64\hu-HU"\[l:46{23}]"windows.ui.xaml.dll.mui" from store</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in the CBS.log,&nbsp;first 2 lines of a check for package 15&nbsp;(fat is where the 2nd lines is different from the other ("good") languages):
</p>
<p><em>(...) CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appl: detect Parent, Package: Package_15_for_KB2779562~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.2.1.1, Parent: Microsoft-Windows-CoreSystem-Base-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~hu-HU~6.2.9200.16384, Disposition = Detect, VersionComp: EQ, ServiceComp: EQ,
 BuildComp: EQ, DistributionComp: GE, RevisionComp: GE, Exist: present</em></p>
<p><em>(... ) CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appl: detectParent: package: Package_15_for_KB2779562~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.2.1.1,
<strong>parent found</strong>: Microsoft-Windows-CoreSystem-Base-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~hu-HU~6.2.9200.16384,
<strong>state: Absent</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the correctly working languages (obviously...)&nbsp;e.g. package 14) the first line is similar, but the 2nd says:
</p>
<p><em>(...) CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appl: detectParent: package: Package_14_for_KB2779562~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.2.1.1,
<strong>no parent found, go absent</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 3rd, fth and 5th lines per package are the same for fault and correct tested languages / packages:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>(...) CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appl: detect Parent, Package: Package_15_for_KB2779562~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.2.1.1, disposition state from detectParent: Absent</em></p>
<p><em>(...) CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appl: Evaluating package applicability for package Package_15_for_KB2779562~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.2.1.1, applicable state: Absent</em></p>
<p><em>(...) CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EvaluateApplicability, package: Package_15_for_KB2779562~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.2.1.1, Package applicability: Absent.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To finish my post, the lines about the ïnvalid package: </p>
<p><em>CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Session: 30279046_1308985532 initialized by client WindowsUpdateAgent.<br />
CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed to internally open package. [HRESULT = 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE]<br />
CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed to OpenPackage using worker session [HRESULT = 0x800f0805]</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone knows a bit more about the CBS processes and can lead me to some solution to the problem, or can tell me how to find out more myself....</p>

            <p>Thank you Shawn. Indeed, when I open defrag, the media type states: Solid State Drives (on all drives).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, please let me know a couple of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a: Why was I able to defrag on Windows 7, and not on 10?</p>
<p>b: How can I "Trim" (optimize) my drives now that I'm using Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>Hmm I see, well that sort of depends on the capabilities of the drive, but if it was working before surely it could work again.&nbsp; Perhaps Windows 10 is just missing your drive controller.&nbsp; Some handle their own optimization transparently. Or maybe just need
 an update from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you care to try initiating a TRIM from the command-line version of Defrag?&nbsp; It uses the /L switch on the command, and it's outlined here:

<p>Before we can provide a solution we would need to have the following information:</p>
<p>1. The exact Skype version you're running.</p>
<p>2. Your platform [Windows, Mac, device, other].</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

</span></blockquote>
<br />
Windows DVD Maker is available in Windows Vista Home Premium and Windows Vista Ultimate only.<br />
<br />
To my understanding, other versions of Vista will have to resort to 3rd party dvd maker.<br />
There are a few of them in the web. <br />
Here is one called Sothink DVD maker. It has either a paid version or a free version. The free version is &nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong> a trial version.<br />
I have it together with my Windows DVD Maker.
