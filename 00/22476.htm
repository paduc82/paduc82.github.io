<h2>            Get and Transform not in Data tab on Excel 2016 on Mac</h2>
                    <p>I came across an Excel&nbsp;2016 feature called Get &amp; Transform on a youtube video, however when I check the Data tab in Excel 2016 on my Mac it doesn't show up.&nbsp; Does anyone know why this wouldn't show up on a Mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong><span>a.</span></strong><span> The post content is similar for different categories of Windows apps where one is for Mail app and the
 other, Calendar app. The apps are inter linked as one app i.e., if you open either of the app (Mail or Calendar), you will be able to access the other app in the same window. The articles are written and posted in Community forum if there are any major changes
 made along with the released updates to the app. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since Bing is a web engine developed by Microsoft, if you search for resolution on any issue, you will first get to Microsoft support forum pages and later to the other party pages. So, when

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both IE11 and Edge are built-in to Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the basic differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edge cannot use add-ons (except the built-in Flash Player) so it will not work with sites that need Silverlight, Java, etc. You also won't be able to install 3rd party toolbars.</li><li>Edge only has a favorites bar built-in - there is no Menu bar, Command bar, or Status bar.</li><li>Organising favorites in Edge is a pain at the moment.</li><li>Edge is, in my experience, quicker than IE11.</li><li>Edge is, in my experience so far, more stable than IE has been for me in the past. This may be at least in part due to the lack of add-ons which can be incompatible, corrupted, etc.</li><li>Edge currently has fewer options and settings compared to IE11.</li><li>Lack of add-ons may help with security. See also: <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/05/11/microsoft-edge-building-a-safer-browser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/05/11/microsoft-edge-building-a-safer-browser/</a> .</li><li>Edge will be regularly updated so the days of upgrading from a major IE version to the next will hopefully not be such an issue - see:
<a href="http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/09/21/understanding-versions-in-an-evergreen-browser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/09/21/understanding-versions-in-an-evergreen-browser/</a>
</li></ul>
<p>If you use Edge, you can select the 3 dots <strong>... </strong>near the top right corner then
<strong>Open with Internet Explorer</strong> if you find a site won't work with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I think that Edge needs more polish particularly with regard to organising favorites and opening tab before I'll use it as my main browser. It does look very promising to me though. The choice is yours.</p>

            <p>Jetta48,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciated your reply. When I realized I could not right click on the back arrow, I switched back to IE. Missing a feature like that reminds me of how many times I use that right click button. It's an automatic thing for me, but surprising how many pc
 users don't know it's there.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>"Lack of add-ons may help with security"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it was a pretty serious thing when Dept. of Homeland Security releases a statement to businesses and home users to&nbsp;avoid using Java.&nbsp; Still, I've always considered IE to be safer than Chrome or other browsers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also enjoyed that an update to the flash player came in with Windows Update.&nbsp; Too much software is installed, browsers and tool bars and such, when you don't want them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> How to change front size in Skype in latest version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are two latest versions available for Windows Desktop, Classic
<em>(7.40)</em> and New Skype <em>(8.12). </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">For Classic Skype, you can change the font size with these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In the menu bar, select <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>IM &amp; SMS</strong> and select <strong>IM appearance</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Change font</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">On the other hand, changing of font size in New Skype is not yet possible.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">

If you were doing this from Word as a mailmerge with an Excel database it would be easier but. . . . .</p>

<br />
Each type of account has it's own rules. Click on the correct tab to create your rules. POP, IMAP, Exchange, Outgoing<br />
<br />
<br />
RULE BASICS<br />
<br />
There are 3 different kind of rules:<br />
<br />
Mailing List Manager (MLM) <br />
Junk Mail Filter <br />
Rules (custom rules you create)<br />
<br />
They run in the order listed above. The custom rules also run in the order they are listed. (top runs first)<br />
<br />
1) POP Rules act on a message ONLY when it first arrives in the Inbox (On My Computer), NOT when it arrives in any other folder. Once it's moved to another folder it won't be seen by rules.<br />
<br />
2) IMAP Rules are meant to act on a message ONLY when it first arrives in the IMAP INBOX, not when moved to another IMAP folder.<br />
<br />
3) Exchange Rules act on a message ONLY when it first arrives in the Exchange Inbox.<br />
<br />

            Yes, it is. I tried to call from notebook with XP to my smartphone. No ring, no call. In another direction the same result. Skype says the computer with XP is using older version of Skype so the connection had not to be succesfull. But when I check last
 updates on Skype it says I have the newest version installed.... I tried to reinstall Skype. No success.

<p>Make sure you are on the "classic" version of skype, https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-windows/downloading/
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new version of skype is not supported on WinXP SP3, though I would think it would say that when trying to install it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, you should move away from WinXP as more and more software will be unsupported and Microsoft is not issuing security fixes for XP.</p>

    <title>Importing a CSV file with minutes and seconds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ljgbronxny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing a CSV file with minutes and seconds</h2>
                    <p>Here's the challenge: I'm importing a list of phone numbers from my cable company that formats like this (giving headers and two sample rows from CSV, phone numbers redacted as x's for privacy):</p>
<p>
</p><p>#,"Date &amp; Time",Type,Number,Location,Mins<br />
1,2017/06/26 03:19 PM,Inbound,(347) xxx-xxxx,"Queens Nyc, NY",12:54</p>
<p>4,2017/06/26 01:16 AM,Inbound,(203) xxx-xxxx,"Stamford, CT",47:30</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is the use of minutes:seconds for the call duration. I would love it if the cable company would use separate columns but they don't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the CSV directly, it serializes it as if it was the time of day rather than duration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, using the CSV import wizard I could mark the column in the CSV import wizard to use the colon as a separator.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No more. In Excel 2016 it automatically imports the list as xx:yy which is not seen as a number. There is a way to get the seconds which works consistently: =MINUTE([@Min}) which tells me that again the number has been serialized. Using =HOUR([@Min]) doesn't
 work in many cases. The problem I think is that it insists on seeing the number as time of day and serializing it rather than letting me separate the two sets of values into separate columns. Perhaps there's a way to use Custom formatting but there's NO documentation
 on this new Wizard; the online documentation seems to put Excel 2007, 2013 and 2016 into the same category and it just doesn't work that way anymore (the page I'm referring to is: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Text-Import-Wizard-c5b02af6-fda1-4440-899f-f78bafe41857).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone who can help with this.</p>

<p>...and I just solved the problem for myself.</p>
<p>The answer is in Data|Text to Columns which allows choosing the problem column, choosing Text to Columns, Delimited Text and then adding the colon as the delimiter which will then place the data in two columns to the right of the one with the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Insider program</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have considered joining the insider program attempted to weigh up the pros and cons. Would really like to contribute in any way possible but no#1 I do not like the sound of probable crashes and errors as this is my primary device /rig and I have
 important files. that has happened to me in the past lost everything a few times in different circumstances bottom line how likely are there to be serious errors/bugs in the developing software and how catastrophic could it become. worst example total melt
 down and a black screen with a white flashing white dash at the top left of the screen best case a day uninstalling and reinstalling, restoring and re configuring to personal settings. any one with any experience/knowledge of this scenario tips and indeed
 if possible answers would be much obliged.</p>

            <p>The Insider site covers a lot of that and the main thing that is mentioned is do not do it on your production computer.&nbsp; When this started in 2014 I went to eBay&nbsp; and got me 3 Lenovo R500 laptops.&nbsp; $56, $104, and $285.&nbsp; The $285 has a camera.&nbsp; Also got cheap
 Windows 7 and upgraded to Windows 10 for free.</p>
<p>I did some upgrading to larger drives. 250GB and 500GB SSDs&nbsp; Have had a ball since I am retired and have the time.</p>
<p>I also have other computers that are not testing like my primary desktop and a laptop that handles the watering of the yard.</p>
<p>All are on Windows 10 as is my wife's laptop.</p>

            <p>Good for you for asking about it, first! &nbsp;A lot of people dive right in without thinking about the possibility of things not going so well, and it's very likely to not go perfectly whenever you are beta testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You definitely don't want to use your primary system to test unless you have time to rebuild if needed. &nbsp;There's never any guarantee that a build won't go sideways with your particular combination of hardware and software, if it happens to be a combination
 that wasn't in the Microsoft test labs. &nbsp;I've done testing with my primary system on occasion, but I have known-good, current backups of the entire drive where my operating system lives before I do it, so I could always roll back if I had to. &nbsp;Even that has
 its risks, though - while it's not terribly likely by the time it gets to us, it's possible for more serious problems to occur that take out the data on other connected hard drives, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could possibly try the virtual machine approach, if you were interested in testing with lower risk to your machine, though. &nbsp;That would let the version of Windows you're testing be separate and "sandboxed" from your main operating system. &nbsp;The chances
 of something causing damage to your primary machine are *very* small at that point, but it does require additional work and if you aren't already familiar with virtual machines, there is a little bit of a learning curve.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>"Download</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>install</strong> <strong>
the</strong> <strong>preview</strong> <strong>only</strong> <strong>if</strong> <strong>
you:</strong><br />
Want to try out software that‚Äôs still in development and like sharing your opinion about it.<br />
Don‚Äôt mind lots of updates or a UI design that might change significantly over time.<br />
Really know your way around a PC and feel comfortable troubleshooting problems, backing up data, formatting a hard drive, installing an operating system from scratch, or restoring your old one if necessary.<br />
Know what an ISO file is and how to use it.<br />
<strong>Aren't</strong> <strong>installing</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>on</strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in design mode for my report.&nbsp; I select the field in question, right click and chose properties.&nbsp; The field was already assigned to Can Shrink (and Grow) to yes.&nbsp; Keep in mind that these are memo fields and not text fields.&nbsp; Does this matter?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to print preview, it still shows a blank line where the memo field is located.&nbsp; I want this blank line to go away if there is no data in it.</p>

Does it go in the actually control box?<br />

And should I remove the labels or just change them to text only?&nbsp; When I change them to text only, they change to "unbound".&nbsp; Very confused.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have a label entitled "Face to Face" that is attached to a control box called "Face to Face".<br />
<br />
I am running a report and I have setting's for the control box to shrink but because I have a label, it won't shrink.&nbsp; How do I get the actual label to print in front of the actual "Face to Face" properties without causing it to not shrink?<br />

            I had to turn off the "User Account Control" (UAC).&nbsp; Once I turned it off, all 4 of these updates installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the following:<br />
<br />
If in Vista view:<br />
<br />
1.) Go to Start; Control Panel; "User Accounts and Family Saftey"; User Accounts.<br />
2.) Click on "Turn User Account Control on or off" (last item on page)<br />
3.) Uncheck the box "Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer" and click "OK".<br />
4.) Restart computer then run the installs and they should work.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are in Classic View:<br />
<br />
1.) Go to Start; Control Panel; Security Center<br />
2.) In the "Windows Security Center" screen, go to the last item "User Account Control" and click the button to turn off.<br />
<br />
You might also see the security shield on your start-up menu.&nbsp; You can access the UAC via this also.<br />
<br />
After the installs have been updated, make sure you go back in and turn the UAC back "on" then restart your computer so that unauthorized updates do not occur.&nbsp;&nbsp; Always try turning this off if installs don't work.<br />

                    After the most recent Windows update this morning and the required restart my Outlook 2013 starts but then closes with no suggested solution. I see all my accounts and folders for a brief second and then it closes. I can start it in safe mode. I see this
 problem reported back in 2013 so obviously something in this most recent update is causing the same problem again.&nbsp;

            <p>Presumably you scanned the application as a picture, so these are your options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't try to fill it out in Word. If it was given to you as hard copy, the intention was probably for you to fill it out by hand or with a typewriter. Some employers judge your handwriting as well as the content of
 your entries. </li><li>You can convert the scanned picture to editable text using an OCR application. Some such was probably supplied with your scanner, but you may need to rescan the document, specifying that it be scanned as text, which
 will perform the OCR before creating the file. The results, however, are unlikely to be usable, since forms are notoriously difficult to OCR accurately.
</li><li>You can insert the picture in your document (cropping the white space around the edge to make it fit properly within your margins) and then add text boxes (No Line, No Fill) where you need to add text.
</li><li>You can insert the picture as a background to a Word document and then type on it. The best approach is to open the header and insert the picture; format it as Behind Text and resize it to fill the page. Then use "Click and type" to insert text in the desired
 locations. This last option is the most likely to be satisfactory if you don't use option 1.</li></ol>

            How are you trying to back up your phone? <br />
<br />
As you are using Mac you will need to use Windows Phone 7 Connector for Mac, download it from here:<br />
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/mac-connector" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/mac-connector</a><br />
<br />
If you have it installed already, remove it and reinstall it. Then try importing your media from the phone to your computer again.<br />
<br />
Contacts and app purchases are linked to your Primary Windows Live account, so just use the same live id if you need to set up your phone again.<br />

<h2>            &#34;we&#39;re sorry onenote is cleaning up from the last time it was open&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen several posts regarding similar issues about this topic, but I am not having any trouble with my stylus, or a problem similar to the ones posted. I have a Surface Pro 3 and am brand new to windows 8.1. I use Office 2013's onenote program daily
 for graduate school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least once a day, I begin to have general troubles with the program, each time the small problem is a bit different. Sometimes, it is a problem with the mouse click or scroll commands doing something different (zooming instead of scrolling, right clicking
 when I am just tapping the screen); the images that are printed to onenote disappear if I zoom too close; and re-appearing when I zoom out; not focusing the images to the proper quality upon zooming in (after waiting a considerable amount of time); and yes,
 sometimes, the computer does not respond to the stylus when I switch from onenote to another program, and use the stylus to "click" . It will only resume acknowledging the stylus commands once I repeatedly tap the screen with my finger first.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these problems do not occur at the same time, it is usually one or another, but none simultaneously. And when any of these problems do happen I will close and reopen the Onenote program. After, I am given the&nbsp;"we're sorry onenote is cleaning up from
 the last time it was open" and then it re-opens and functions with no problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to optimize onenote and prevent this nuisance from continuing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your input!</p>

            I am having the same problem. The only solution I have found, because Microsoft&nbsp;never states a solutions, is to work off the cloud and keep the notebook off line. The cloud which should mean that ever thing moves from all my computer instantly is a lie
 and Microsoft has lied about the software working. This is my first day of grad school and over half of it has been trying to get one note to sync. I gave up and now just export the notebook as a OneNote&nbsp;file to open on other devices. This has removed the
 freezes and the cache problems.&nbsp;

            <p>Just updated to Office 2016 and now every time I open OneNote I get this "We're Sorry. OneNote is cleaning up from the last time..." message. It takes anywhere from a 20 seconds to 5 minutes" to complete and sometimes never finishes at all forcing me to
 hit cancel and try again. Microsoft is just begging people to look elsewhere for their OS and office software at this point. Its bad enough that I am forced to use this Office 365 junk, which means I can hardly use any add-ins and am way overpaying for my
 license, and now the base software itself isn't even working. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh this is rich, now it is just hung on this message with the bar completely filled. It won't finish and I can't cancel or close it. Great just great.</p>
