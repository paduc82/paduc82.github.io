<h2>            Installed printer not showing in Devices and Printers folder, and old printers unable to be deleted.</h2>
                    <p>I installed a Canon MFP on a customer's network, and used the Canon Driver install pack for Windows 8.1 (Home Edition) . &nbsp;One computer install was successful, but they have another one that is giving me fits. (There's also have a Windows 7 unit on the network
 that works fine.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The newly installed printer does NOT show in "Devices and Printers", but it IS listed in any print profiles for Word/Quickbooks/etc. &nbsp;Everything prints to the unit correctly, but I'm unable to change any default settings on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also a couple of older printers listed in the folder that the computer will not let me remove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spooler service is Automatic</p>
<p>SFC /scannow found no errors</p>
<p>Bluetooth is on &nbsp;(although what this would have to do with a wired Network printer, I don't know... just following the troubleshooting steps in the forums)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can offer a suggestion, I'm more than happy to listen.</p>

            <p>Several things to check--each computer must have the drivers and software installed. If the printer is wireless, it must be connected to the router either wirelessly or by ethernet, not to any one computer on the network. If it is a wired printer connected
 to a single computer and shared, every computer on the network must recognize the network computers and the win 8 computer must allow file and printer access on the private network. The wired printer is not connected to the network, just shared on the network
 and win 8 does not allow that unless specifically selected in Network and Sharing Center, Advance Sharing settings.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>All computers on the network have drivers installed.&nbsp; The MFP is set up on a static IP address and is wired on the network.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network is configured as Workgroup, and all the File and Printer sharing settings are configured to allow Windows SMB scanning to each desktop through the firewall.&nbsp; They're in an office environment, so that's how I configure it every time I do an installation.&nbsp;
 (I'm a Service Manager for a Canon copier dealer, so I do network configurations every week.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is with ONE of the Windows 8 computers.&nbsp; The printer IS installed, and working correctly... it's just not VISIBLE in Devices and Printers... which doesn't allow me to set any of the Printer Properties or Printing Preferences as default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The extra (older) printers in Devices and Printers on that computer will not delete either.&nbsp; I even attempted stopping and then restarting Spooler Service, but the same devices came back as were there before... even after a cold boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other 2 computers on the network are issue-free, so I know everything was installed and set up correctly.&nbsp; I did nothing different on this one... it's just got an issue I'm having a problem resolving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions though...</p>

            <p>Still looking for some help on this one.&nbsp; I tried a "Fix-It" but that gave no solution to my problem either.&nbsp; There are now 4 computers on the customer's network... one Windows 7 box, and three Windows 8.1 units.&nbsp; All of the computers are working as they
 should, except for just ONE Windows 8.1 unit.<br />
<br />
The Canon MFP is installed and works correctly, but because it doesn't show in Devices and Printers, I am unable to check or change any of the default settings.&nbsp; Because this is a color printer, the customer needs to go into the Printing Preferences on&nbsp;EACH
 document to change color mode, and convert to single-sided printing.&nbsp; It's more of a nuisance than an actual problem... but they're a new customer for us and I'd like to resolve it as quickly as I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really like to avoid telling them they need to reinstall Windows to correct this problem if at all possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions are welcome... and thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I haven't tried using Powershell.&nbsp; The thing that concerns me about it is I installed the printer on 2 other Windows 8.1 exactly the same way (home edition by the way), and have zero issues with wither one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also a couple of old printers listed in the folder that are no longer connected... or even in the building, and this computer will not let me remove them from Devices and Printers folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After digging in some of the other online forums, I'm going to look in the "Apps" folder and see if the printer is listed there.... otherwise I'm more or less at a standstill on this computer.</p>

            OK...this is getting silly. &nbsp;I had a new install today with three Windows 8.1 computers, and two of them are doing the exact same thing!!<br />
<br />
Why can't someone give me a reason for this, or a fix to help resolve this issue?? &nbsp;I've seen the same problems on other tech message boards, and NOBODY seems to know why this is happening or how to fix it!<br />
<br />
I'm going to stick with Windows 7 on any personal computers I work on, because Windows 8 seems to be utterly useless on anything other than a tablet!!

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Your Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC, builds on Windows 10 Pro, version 1809 adding premium features designed to address the needs of large and mid-size organizations. 
<br />
<br />Your edition is not Windows 10 IoT,
<br />as winver has listed Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC.
<br />
<br />You can check with Systen info:
<br />1. Open Settings, and click/tap on the System icon.
<br />2. Click/tap on About on the left side. Under PC on the right side, look to see what your Edition is. 
<br />
<br />Other ways to check: 
<br />1. Open Settings, and click/tap on the System icon
<br />2. Press the Windows + Pause/Break keys
<br />3. Open the Control Panel (icons view), click/tap on the System icon
<br />4. Open the Win+X power user tasks menu, click/tap on System
<br />5. You can see your Windows edition  
<br />
<br />Thanks to: tenforums.com 
<br />
<br />IoT - this edition is designed for low-cost devices like Raspberry Pi and specialized machines, like robots, ATMs, POS terminals, barcode scanners and so on. There are three editions of Windows 10 IoT: IoT Enterprise, IoT Mobile Enterprise, and IoT Core.
<br />

<p>Hi Ganesh,</p>
<p>I downloaded the iot LTSC 2019 from MSDN, and installed on two computers.&nbsp; But on both computers, the winver shows "Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC" only, so my question is how to find the version is iot. Because there is another version called Windows 10 Enterprise
 LTSC.</p>
<p>My another question is how&nbsp;I can&nbsp;find the Windows Version from ProductID, rather how to find ProductID? E.g.&nbsp;one product ID is 00424-90330-48190-XXXXX, it is iot LTSC or pure LTSC?</p>

            Windows 10 IoT Enterprise is Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC. The IoT is just a marketing spin to align with IoT Mobile and IoT Core. 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 IoT Enterprise 2019 LTSC makes sense for all new developments. It includes all the features that were added to Windows 10 IoT in recent years and is completely up to date in terms of security.

<p>Hi Ganesh,</p>
<p>Does it mean Windows 10 enterprise LTSC 2019 is equal to Windows 10 iot enterprise LTSC 2019, and they have same Winver output of "Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC"?</p>
<p>If so, why there is a very big size difference between their installation files?</p>

</p><p>When receiving inbound calls on the Skype phone, the telephone number of the caller flashes on the screen but once the call is answered- the phone number is not displayed on the "in call" pop-up. My partners Skype shows the inbound callers phone number on

    <title>Minecraft wont load with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asakpla7s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft wont load with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So this morning I updated to Windows 10 by downloading it from the Microsoft Official Download Link. I got Windows, and it worked fine. For a while. I have tried playing different games, Like Warframe and TF2. Warframe was a bit laggy, but it was the same
 with Win7. TF2 ran fine but when I opened Minecraft, it didn't load. I would click play and it would show me this error message</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>EDIT #2: I found another thread (</div>
<span>
<span>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/require-update-for-mobile-intel-4-series-express/96cd8ecf-ae75-4295-99a5-7ea2e27d54f5?auth=1)&nbsp; which gave me my answer of why I cant launch Minecraft. Its because I need OpenGL Version 1.3
 when Intel stopped making OpenGL cause it was such an old version. It had the answer for Windows 8, but Since I got windows 10 I need an updated fix for the driver. Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Extra Info: Moble Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family)</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>It says I might need to find Drivers for it, and since I'm running Intel I went to their website to download Intel Driver Update Utility. I started searching for avalible Drivers for my system. Once it finished searching, it said no Drivers available. I'm
 not a big tech guy, But I have a feeling this has something to do with Windows, other then just Windows 10. Anyone know how to fix it? I have Intel i5 Dual Core CPU and Intel HD Graphics&nbsp;3200. Anyone have a fix for this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: I looked up what drivers I have. Here it is-</p>

            <p>I have had a problem like this with windows 10</p>
<p>The problem is your graphics card doesn't support OpenGL. Unfortunately you need a new GPU. One that supports OpenGL 2.0. These can cost around 20$ at minimum.

<p>Q. Are use by the operating systems to do its tasks&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>By default, certain files are hidden.&nbsp; If some of these files are edited, moved, renamed, or deleted, you could damage your operating system. They are hidden for a reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q. Hidden files or folders cannot be seen by any user?</p>
<p>A. You can see the hidden files if you wish. Here's how to view them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go the start menu and type <strong>folder options</strong>.</li><li>Hit enter or click on the result.</li><li>Go to the <em>View </em>tab.</li><li>Under <em>Hidden files and folders</em>, select <em>Show hidden files, folders, and drives</em>.</li><li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Optional:</span> If you want, you can uncheck
<em>Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)</em>.&nbsp; I would keep that checked if I were you.</li><li>At the bottom, hit <em>Apply </em>or <em>OK</em>.</li></ol>
<p>Q. Can only be seen by the main user</p>
<p>A. If the user follows the instructions above, they can see it.&nbsp; So the answer is no, anybody can see hidden files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q. Are use by the operating systems to do its tasks</p>
<p>A. Most of them are.&nbsp; E.g. If you delete one of your hidden personal documents, the file is not critical to the OS.&nbsp; If you however delete system32
<strong>(don't delete it!)</strong>, Windows will stop working immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q. Are not usually edited directly</p>
<p>A. Personal files (pictures, documents, videos, etc.) can be edited.&nbsp; Operating System files cannot be edited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that clears any misunderstandings.&nbsp; Please let me know if you have any other questions.</p>

            <p>You might try disconnecting your computer from the internet for a day or two and see if that stops the spam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding another antivirus program without first uninstalling your current antivirus program is NOT recommended - antivirus problems tend to see many parts of other antivirus programs as similar enough to viruses that they should treat them as viruses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there's another class of programs known as antispyware programs that you may want to try.&nbsp; Windows Defender is one of them, so you may want to try it first.&nbsp; Programs in this class seldom interfere with each other, so you can safely have more than
 one installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three&nbsp;other possibilities to check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; A spammer might have found your login information for your email account, and started sending the spam using your account but without using your computer at all.&nbsp; In this case, changing the password on your email account is often enough, so try that.&nbsp;
 Make sure that your new password is near the maximum length the email server allows, to make it&nbsp;very slow&nbsp;for computer programs to run through all the possible guesses of what it could be.&nbsp; Also, try to make it&nbsp;include all the classes or characters allowed
 (often lower case letters, UPPER CASE LETTERS, numerals, and special characters) to slow down such a program even more.&nbsp; In this case, you'll probably also need to contact the people running that server to make sure they don't disable your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A spammer might have found just your email address and started using it on the spam without sending it to the same email server you use.&nbsp; In this case, you'll need the headers of a few of the spam messages to do much.&nbsp; Most of the header lines aren't
 normally shown when you look at the email; the extra steps needed to show them depend heavily on which email program you want to show them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; If your computer allows remote logins, the spammer may have guessed your username and password for your computer.&nbsp; In that case, a password change, but on your computer instead, is likely to be needed.&nbsp; You may also want to look up remote logins and
 how to disable them in the help file for your computer.&nbsp; Some of the email programs have a Sent folder, so you may want to check for spam messages there.&nbsp; Also, the spammer might have created an extra account on your computer, so find the full list of accounts,
 and check the Sent folder for every account.on that list.</p>

            <p>Hi edwardturner281,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We sincerely apologize for not being able to answer your concern in a timely manner. We are experiencing high contact volume at this time which has caused our delayed response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on the error code you provided, there are&nbsp;two possible causes why your Windows Live Mail throw an error message. Please refer below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. <strong>Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP)</strong> â Kindly check with provider if it is required or not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. <strong>Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25)</strong> â It could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As our initial troubleshooting step, I recommend that you reconfigure your account by removing and adding it again to your Live Mail. For more information regarding adding an account, please refer to the link below:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>For firewall issue, you can try to disable the Security Software/ Firewall to isolate the issue Please refer to the link below for more details.</span></p>

            <p>I did search for answers before contacting you. The computer was using Windows Firewall and Microsoft security Essentials so there should have been no problem there. However I did disable both firewall and anti virus just in case but i still had the same
 result. I have made a new account but the same problem now applies to this account also. I have checked the setting under the account which are exactly the same as mine on a different laptop and they are all correct. I even tried it using the ssl but it made
 no difference. &nbsp;The email provider is Tiscali and I have been into the emails within Tiscali web page and I had no problem sending the emails from there which would indicate that the problem is within Windows Live Mail set up.</p>
<p>I have deleted all mail from the out basket &nbsp;but whenever we try to send we get the same error message. The only solutions I can see at the moment is 1: use restore to go back to a time when it was working 2: backup the mail, delete the program and reinstall
 unless you have any mor ideas.</p>
<p>Please advise.&nbsp;</p>

            Well, after further testing, I did Method 1 &amp; 2. I have realized that it's not an issue of WOL, but it's simply coming back from Sleep.
<div><br />
<div>It does the same thing if I try to power it from the power button after sleep. Blank Screen, I have to eventually reboot.</div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying with the status. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's check if the following settings are configured correctly.</p>
<p><br />
1. Make sure you are using the latest motherboard chip set driver, and the latest display card driver.<br />
2. Check the M/B BIOS setup if there is something like "reboot video on resume" or "Run VGABIOS if S3 Resume"? Try enabling it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may update the chipset drivers and latest display drivers from Manufacturer website and check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

<br />
Original Title: trying to install turbotax because it won't launch. disc says to click Start on taskbar, click Run then OK but the window has CMD in it (I'm guessing for the command prompt). What should be in here instead of CMD? Help!

2. What steps have you tried to install Turbo Tax? <br />

Basically, cmd in Run box should not interfere with the installation. </span></span></p>

<p>Hello diverdown136,</p>
<p>You can get to the run command from several different places. <br />
You can press the Windows key +R as this is a shortcut key that will bring up the Run command.<br />
They you can browse to find the setup.exe file or the msi file for Turbo Tax.</p>
<p>Let us know if you still have questions.</p>

<p>Hi Bobby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several factors that might cause issues when starting your computer. For isolation purposes, we advise that you start your computer in

safe mode</a> to troubleshoot problems on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were able to start your computer in safe mode, we suggest that you check if you have a restore point on the time before the issue occurred.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a restore point, we recommend that you perform a system restore on your computer. You may refer to the section
<strong>Restore from a system restore point</strong> provided in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> ligela  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fable the Lost Chapters for XP is incompatible with Win7 -- is there a way to fix it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just bought the XP edition of the game&nbsp;and expected a lot of fun&nbsp;on my new 17 in. Inspiron R with all the trimmings, only to be told that FtLC for XP is incompatible with Win7.</p>
<p>The problem is that the graphics are like seeing double, literally two headmasters who half-merge the closer you get to them; they never fully merge, and most stuff, except the background, is very blurry.&nbsp; I've already got bad eyesight; I'd like a clean
 game.</p>
<p>I've tried setting the game to play in the minimalized window, but it only stays minimalized until the credits have finished running.&nbsp; Then the game returns to the full, wide screen and I think it's the wide screen that's causing the problem; the credits
 are fine!</p>
<p>Did MS actually bring out a duded up game in advance of Fable 4 only to have it be unplayable on pc's with the newest Windows OS?&nbsp; Or is there some way to work things so the game is actually playable and you can&nbsp;use a bow without guessing where the target
 is?</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Accidentally, I reinstalled this game (which I hadn't played for a long time) on Windows 7 x64 some weeks ago. Guess what? It works without too much fiddling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be that you'll get&nbsp;a screen which declares "known incompatibilities with this version of Windows" at every start (just click it away), and most probably you will run into an idle process "fable.exe" which must be ended before you start the game a
 second time (happens only once per Windows session). The second start will look as idle as the first one but after some time, the game will come up.</p>
<p>Things to do during installation: Run "setup" as administrator (don't use the "autorun" option) with the following compatibility setttings "XP SP3", "Disable visual themes", "Disable desktop arrangement" (this avoids some flickering). Run the game with the
 same settings. If you are given a choice of setting up your video adapter (the game doesn't identify it because it uses a completely outdated XML list of stone-age video cards), select "Primary, no TnL". Resolution of 1024x768x32 is fine.</p>
<p>Note that the game will scale to full screen even if your screen size is bigger than 1024x768 but it will keep the old 4:3 aspect ratio, so you'll have black borders on both sides of the screen.</p>

<p>OS: Windows 10 64 Bit (Upgraded)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated to Windows 10 with zero problems (yes true!). No issues with WiFi until recently. One minute everything is fine and then the next the WiFi icon in the tray has the 'X' indicating that it isnt working. When you click on 'Network Settings'
 and then 'Wi-Fi' it will not connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried un-installing and re-installing drivers automatically through Windows, HP and various Atheros driver websites to no avail. When I check the 'Device Status' it says the driver is working properly, so doubt the card is burnt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the internet for remedies to my problem however nothing has worked including these 'sure fixes':</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jase,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's follow the methods below and check if the issue can be fixed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>A</strong>. Restart your modem or Wi-Fi adapter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. In some cases, even restarting your networking device can solve the problem. To restart your modem, or Wi-Fi adapter, do the following:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type <strong>device manager </strong>
in the search bar&nbsp;and press Enter</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Find your networking device, right click on it and click
<strong>Disable</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart your computer</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Go to Device Manager again, and enable the networking device the same way you disabled it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Maybe resetting the TCP connection will bring your internet connection back. To reset the TCP connection, youâll have to enter a few lines into the Command Prompt, and your connection should work again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>B</strong>. Hereâs exactly what you need to do:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong><span>Right-click </span></strong><span>on the Start Menu button and open
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Enter the following lines or&nbsp;copy&nbsp;and paste&nbsp;and press Enter after entering each one:</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><em><span>netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled</span></em></strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><em><span>netsh int tcp set global rss=enabled</span></em></strong></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now enter this command to verify that previous functions were disabled:
</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>netsh int tcp show global</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt window.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>C</strong>. Run the Windows network troubleshooter and check.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Go to Search and type troubleshooter</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open Troubleshooting</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on Connect to Internet, under Network and internet&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow on-screen instructions.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this post helps. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help!</span></p>

            <p>Joy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for the assistance. I tried the options you sent but unfortunately it still will not connect to WiFi. The Troubleshooting is stating the following problems;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Wireless capability is turned off (Its impossible to turn it on)</p>
<p>2) A network cable is not properly plugged in or maybe broken (I have no problem when LAN is connected)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems bizarre and certainly a software issue. Could it be a virus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

    <title>Mouse and keyboard freeze - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse and keyboard freeze</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Windows 10 my wireless mouse and keyboard freeze up after a series of dings from the speakers.&nbsp; A restart fixes things until the next freeze.&nbsp; Sometimes if I wait a long time they will unfreeze for awhile and freeze again later.&nbsp; Fortunately,
 the onscreen keyboard and touchscreen gets my out of serious trouble but it is a nuisance.&nbsp; I've checked with Logitech who says it not their problem.&nbsp;

            <p>I have the same problem as ptknapp2 but&nbsp;using a Dell Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; The duration of the freezes tends to vary, sometimes only a minute or two, sometimes many times longer!&nbsp; It does always seem to come back eventually though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed Sagnik's advice, having first determined I had to select <strong>
Hardware and Sound</strong> on Control Panel after <strong>System and Maintenance</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers were said to be up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver under <strong>Keyboards</strong> was for an HID Keyboard device with a Microsoft driver version 10.0.10240.16384 dated 21 June 2006.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under <strong>Bluetooth</strong> I also checked the following devices, Del BT Keyboard and Dell BT Mouse.</p>
<p>Both were also said to be up to date, but used a Microsoft driver, with a different version number, 10.0.10240.16515 also dated 21 June 2006.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what to do next!&nbsp; Any suggestions anyone?</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro Pen - No presure in Photoshop CS6</h2>
                    <p>Installed CS6 Design and Web Premium on my Surface Pro today.&nbsp; The Pen does work, however the pressure sensitivity does not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Does anyone know how to correct this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Will installing my Wacom Tablet mess up the imbedded software?</p>

            Hello&nbsp;Heather1841,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Surface Pro uses Windows Inbox Drivers and APIs for the Surface pen, which support advanced features such as pressure sensitivity and eraser functionality. There are a number of apps in the Store that leverage these new Windows APIs and
 can take advantage of all that the Surface pen has to offer. The Surface pen does work with Photoshop, which runs on Surface Pro, though advanced features such as pressure sensitivity and eraser functionality may not be available at this time. Microsoft is
 working with the necessary partners to make advanced features of the Surface pen available across a number of applications in the near future.</p>
<div><br />
<div>Installing Wacom Drivers should not cause issues.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div><br />
<div>*Edited to add updated information*</div>

            <p>So even though Wacom makes the Digitizer for the Surface Pro, it is using different APIs then their own products?&nbsp; Silly, but Ok.....&nbsp; I will give Wacom's Software a shot and see what happens.</p>

            <div>Hello Hugo,</div>
<div>Why can't Microsoft customize a wintab driver for Surface Pro? Seems like asking</div>
<div>a vendor to change their methodology is more of a standard war than an effort to</div>
<div>win and keep customers. From what I see, the wintab method has far more</div>
<div>functionality than the new API. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can keep posting your statement about Adobe being the one needing to change,</div>
<div>but this is not customer service. Please address the question of producing a</div>
<div>proper wintab driver and making it available for legacy design creation apps. </div>

<h2>            Black screen before USB Disconnect Sound.</h2>
                    Hi, I got my computer a week or so ago. For some reason the screen goes black 3-5 times a day and turns on about 5 secs later. When it turns on it makes a sound saying a USB Device was disconnected but I look around and nothing was disconnected.&nbsp;
<div>
<ul>
<li>There is no error message.</li><li>I use Windows 7 Home Premium</li><li>My browser is Google Chrome</li><li>I have installed Kaspersky and Steam recently but my old computer has these and is fine</li><li>I have tried to fiddle around with some Intel Core HD Graphics options and check my power settings.</li></ul>
