<h2>            Skype Web SDK Integration</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to integrate skype web sdk in a web application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done few things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Generate Skype Meeting URI.</p>
<p>2. Create Audio, Video and&nbsp; Chat services.</p>
<p>3. Join Meeting as a organizer using SIP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to login through Anonymous user in Skype for business I have followed this blog<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/Skype/WebSDK/docs/anonymousmeetingjoin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/Skype/WebSDK/docs/anonymousmeetingjoin</a></p>
<p>According to it we can login through generated URI. I have successfully login from the licence account and generated the URI<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>but when I am using the login through the anonymous user as defined I am getting error COMMAND DISABLED</strong></p>
<p>

    <title>Buggy Windows 10 &#34;Night Light&#34; feature. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phestermcs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Buggy Windows 10 &#34;Night Light&#34; feature.</h2>
                    <p>I was playing a game, an received and email. I then tried to alt tab to the Email but the game was full screen, and Email didn't show. Somehow, the Window setting dialog also opened, and I have no idea how, but whatever keypresses I was making, with the
 game still running, resulted in a couple of my system settings changing. Like "Airplane Mode" was turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, the monitor's (I have two) "white level" started oscillating between white (like it's always been) to rather quite off-white, like following a sine wave. Eventually it stopped, but "white level" was left at an obvious off-white level. Interestingly,
 the mouse was a the original white level, and made it obvious just by holding over other "white" areas, like a web page, that something was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched all over, and could only find things regards Windows 10 color calibration dialog/wizard. Tried that, didn't fix. Restart, didn't fix. Tried changing color profiles, didn't fix. Reinstalled display driver (NVIDIA 1080), didn't fix. Tried screwing
 with NVIDIA's control panel, didn't fix. Restarting and running "safe mode" did have the correct white level, but going back to normal startup, and problem still remained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, after poking all around the Windows 10 Display settings, under the 'Color' section, I came across the "Night light" switch (never heard of this "feature"), which was in the off position. I then clicked on the "Night light settings" link directly
 underneath, and low-and-behold I saw the "Color temperature at night" slider, and it was on the left side from the middle. I slid it back and forth and the white level went from off white to the original white. So I was able to find the cause and fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, as the "Night light" switch was Off, the white level should have nothing to do with whatever is set with the slider and so forth. I consider this a bug, and one that's likely sent many off on a wild goose chase with Color Calibration, and so forth.</p>

            Hi Phester.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />Glad you found the night light.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            windows 10 drag and drop and multiple selections.</h2>
                    Since going from 8.0 to10 I've lost the ability to drag and drop and do multiple selections in Thunderbird.&nbsp; I'm using a Surface Pro so I wasn't expecting any probes.&nbsp; It seems that this is a recurrent theme from the users.&nbsp; What's going on?&nbsp; As a side
 issue I've also lost the single letter capitalise feature when hitting the shift key.

            &nbsp;Neither those two options worked.&nbsp; I eventually found the solution.&nbsp; Calling up the full keyboard and using that.&nbsp; The issue seems to be an issue with Thunderbird and a lack of general support for windows 10 in the apps sector.&nbsp; I think that you need
 to accept that your OS is a distant third in the race with Apple, Android And Linux and do something about that.

<h2>            Mouse Lag 2016 Fix</h2>
                    <p>I just got an HP Notebook, already upgraded to Windows 10, as well as updated.</p>
<p>I noticed that this PC had the same annoying feature that the last one had when upgrading-- The touchpad will freeze whenever I type. I went to fix it the way that I fixed the last one, where I went to the additional settings for the mouse. This time, there
 was no clickpad, and when I searched, there was absolutely no palmcheck mentioned.</p>
<p>I searched multiple forums, I have been searching since last night, but all solutions appear to be from 2015, using the solution that I already knew and couldn't use. Here is what I have done:</p>
<p>Settings&gt;Devices&gt;Mouse&amp;Touchpad [Turned Touchpad: Short delay to Touchpad: No delay (always on)] -- No effect</p>
<p>Settings&gt;Devices&gt;Mouse&amp;Touchpad&gt;Additional Mouse Options [Included the tabs: Buttons, Pointers, Pointer Options, Wheel, Hardware, and Device Settings]</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, there was no palmcheck. After clicking on multiple settings options from Mouse Properties, I was left stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do?</p>

<p>Que tal Amigos tengo una duda, quiero hacer una compra de una membresia por un mes a xbox live gold por medio de Paypal en la pagina de Xbox.com, el costo que me indica es de 89 pesos, pero mi duda es, si hago el pago por medio de Paypal, realmente cuanto
 me costaria, ya contando comisiones y todos los gastos que se lleven, les comento que soy de Mexico. Me interesa saberlo ya que a futurio quiero hacer compras de videojuegos y futuras membersias y tener una idea de los costos totales.</p>

<p>los RATAS de paypal te cobran $20.00 de comisión o 15.00 USD si la compra es en dolares para que no te cobren comisión necesitas hacer una compra de $1,500.00 o mas:.... yo tuve una desagradable experiencia con los de paypal por lo tanto mejor te recomiendo
 que compres microsoft points y los cambies por dinero en efectivo 1500 MS points te cuestan $289.00 y al cambiarlos te abonan $258.40 y 4500 MS points te cuesta $799.00 y te abonan $768.40 ... apartir de enero en algunas tiendas ya puedes comprar fichas de
 $150.00 los cuales según se te abonan la misma cantidad SUERTE con tus compras espero te haya sido útil esta información y no tengas experiencias desagradables con paypal como yo</p>

<p>Hola.</p>
<p>Te contaré que no hace mucho compré algo en el bazar de accesorios para el avatar que costaba 13 varos, y eso fue lo que pague con PayPal. Al contrario, creo que he tenido menos problemas al pagar con PayPal (Xbox Live por alguna razón discrimina mi tarjeta
 de débito). PayPal solo te cobra comisión cuando es cambio de divisas (Tienes pesos, quieres comprar en dolares, se hace el cambio de divisa) aunque los precios y los pagos se manejan concretamente en pesos. No recomiendo comprar en una divisa diferente al
 peso. Jejeje</p>

<h3> shih-hungchang  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to transfer Windows 8 OS from an old hard drive to a new computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an&nbsp;Dell desktop with XP OEM installed. Later on&nbsp;I upgraded it to Windows 7 and then to&nbsp;Windows 8. The Dell computer is very slow so I just built a brand new computer from scratch. Since I will not be using the Dell computer anymore, can I do&nbsp;one of
 the following?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Move the operating system from the Dell computer to the blank hard drive on the newly-built computer. So I do not have to buy a Windows 8 builder copy.</p>
<p>2. Or, reuse the boot drive from the Dell computer and install it on the newly-built computer as a bootable drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, kindly please provide step-by-step instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank,</p>
<p>Greg Chang</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, you won't be able to do that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install an upgrade version of Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. For help with the activation process, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=260480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u><font color="#0000ff">contact support</font></u></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One work around, is to use the Windows 7 upgrade disc and do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Accept License Agreement</p>
<p>When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>Click Drive Options</p>
<p>Select the drive/s click Delete</p>
<p>Click New</p>
<p>Click Apply</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation</p>
<p>Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.</p>
</font>
<p>-------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proceed to do the upgrade to Windows 8 again on the new computer and reactivate by telephone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Press <b>Windows key + X</b> then click<b>Run</b>, then type: <b>slui.exe 4</b></p>
<p>2. Next press the 'ENTER' key</p>
<p>3. Select your 'Country' from the list.</p>
<p>4. Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.</p>
<p>5. Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.</p>
<p>6. Explain your problem clearly to the support person.</p>

<p>I am trying to install the update on a Compaq CQ2009F which was upgraded from Window 7 PRO to Windows 10 PRO last year and updated to the Anniversary Update a while back.
</p>
<p>I have started&nbsp;for the 4th time trying to install this update&nbsp;and thought I should notify you about it, since I see that some others are also having some problems with the Update too.</p>
<p>Please advise as soon as possible. </p>

    <title>Streetfighter X Tekken DLC Details - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Streetfighter X Tekken DLC Details</h2>
                    
<p>Word from <a href="http://www.capcom-unity.com/brelston/blog/2012/03/16/new_costumes,_gems,_patches_and_more_coming_to_street_fighter_x_tekken" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Capcom</a> is that the DLC existing already on the disc will be unlocked soon, and you can bet your hard-earned beans that they will feature additional characters and gems. The controversy of Capcom's questionable decision notwithstanding, Street Fighter X
 Tekken will soon be updated with the following (written in purported chronological sequence):</p>
<p>-</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting April 3rd, Swap Costumes takes the idea of alternate costumes to another level. This allows you to outfit characters with the costume of another character. Cammy can dress as King, for example. Each costume will run for $1.00, or buy the whole
 package for either Street Fighter or Tekken for $13.00. Each pack contains 19 Swap Costumes, thereby saving you $6.00 for buying the pack rather than each costume individually.
</li><li>Along with the April 3rd update, there will be three free color packs that each add four new additions to the palette for more customization. As well, the addition of 3 new combos will bring the total of pre-programmed attack patterns to a total of 5.
</li></ul>
<p>-</p>
<ul>
<li>A new tournament title update will feature an improved <a href="http://uk.ign.com/wikis/street-fighter-x-tekken/Gems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
gem-swapping</a> system on the versus screen. </li><li>A title update after the tournament one will bring three new Assist <a href="http://uk.ign.com/wikis/street-fighter-x-tekken/Gems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Gems</a> packs and six new Boost <a href="http://uk.ign.com/wikis/street-fighter-x-tekken/Gems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
gem</a> packs, both ultimately adding 60 new <a href="http://uk.ign.com/wikis/street-fighter-x-tekken/Gems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Gems</a>. </li><li>More gems means more gem slots. Players will get three new gem slots per character.
</li><li>Free replay analyzer that allows the player to get into the real nitty-gritty intricacies of analyzing opponents.
</li></ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>A DLC character pack to add the 12 new characters from PlayStation Vita's roster to PS3 and 360 console versions will cost $20.00, to come shortly after the release of SFxTekken on Vita.
</li></ul>

<p>Too kind of Capcom to charge loyal customers/fans an extra 33% of the RRP for content which is already on the disc. Scandalous. As for the alternate costumes.....pfft.</p>

<p>As of right now, hackers are playing online with the locked characters. [View:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txYg7FLKzFQ]</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>What's funny is that a lot of people are defending Capcom on the grounds that if they didn't include the characters on the disc, there would be compatibility problems online. I have a great solution for that.. include the characters on the disc for FREE.
 Or just leave them out altogether until the obligatory SFxT: Arcade upgrade download. That way people with DLC and people without will at least be broken up so no problems there.</p>

<p>SSFIV, when they started to release the character alt outfit packs, allowed all players to download the packs so the online would be compatible for those who bough the packs and for those who didnt. To use the contents you had to purchase the "DLC"</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So using this as the reason for having the content already on the disc is plausible, but I think we all know how "unlocks" now work in games..if you can charge for it, charge for it</p>

<p>Developers develop DLC alongside the main game, so what?! &nbsp;In one camp you have people who are desperate for DLC in order to provide longevity and more entertainment. &nbsp;In the other camp you have people like Strangeotron who believe everybody is being fleeced.
 &nbsp;Developers tread a thin line. &nbsp;Some of you don't understand the meaning of budgets. &nbsp;A game has a budget and time constraints when being developed, as does DLC. &nbsp;Just because the DLC is included on the disc and developed at the same time, it doesn't mean
 that it should belong to everybody for free! &nbsp;Some of you are just so simple, it defies belief. &nbsp;Capcom could have been crafty and held back the DLC, and not even placed it on the disk. &nbsp;None of you would have been any the wiser. &nbsp;I'm sure developers do that
 already, do they tell you about it... haha hell no. &nbsp;</p>

<p>No one these days can really expect that games are developed, released and only then is any additional content created for the title</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>DLC is optional, you dont have to buy it......for some reason there is a culture of entitlement now in gaming, "if its on the disc it should be mine"...but the problem with that is, you dont actually own the game, just the license to play the game, and the
 version of the license you paid for is limited to what the publishers have decided the final game is</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I understand the feeling from both camps, but its a part of modern gaming now, has been for a few years now from multiple publishers and multiple genres of gaming....its all a business, you can spend your money or not</p>

<p>I have no gripes with DLC, especially when it is quality DLC&nbsp;which prolongs the life of a game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do however, have major issues with day 1 DLC and withheld content DLC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Streefighter x Tekken - The alternate costume packs we'll ignore because only people with more money than sense or die hard fans will purchase those. The $20, or whatever our conversion will be, really annoys me. Games usually retail for $60 in America,
 so that is an extra 33% of the price for 12 characters which are already on the disc and withheld because of the exclusivity for the PS Vita. Its a con and I find it difficult to find any justification for it. I'd actually rather they released an Super/Ultra/Arcade
 edition further down the line for a marked down price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mass Effect 3 - The 800msp Javik DLC. Again, has to be already on the disc and withheld as&nbsp;an exclusive for those who purchased the CE. Bad form imo and as much as I'm loving ME3 I can't bring myself to buy it. On the upside, I imagine there will be some
 fantastic DLC later down the line.....or will there? Lets see if the game is milked seeing as this game (apparently) brings closure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TW13 - Expect day 1 extra courses DLC. Won't be going there again!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just an example of 3 recent/forthcoming games. Its becoming an all too familiar trend, a trend which fleeces consumers. I know I'm not at liberty to buy any of this DLC before anybody points that out to me. I'm just giving my opinion of why its a con and
 as for developers having to meet budgets etc, thats all well and good but these 12 SFxT characters were created within the budget schedule. They must have been coded for the 360 too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Terms of the Mass Effect 3 DLC, in all honesty all they did was take the Cerberus network pass from ME2, which gave you more content if you bought new, and simply changed it into the standard online pass for its tagged on MP</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So you would either of gotten that content free as in ME2 and pay for the MP side which would probably have cost more then 800MSP or have it the other way round</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Alt Costumes for fighting games are optional, but the locked characters...that I do have an issue with. Because they are ready and good to go, whatever happened to the old school thought of "complete this game with so and so and unlock this other character
 to use"</p>

<p>Even if you find justification in the fact that a separate budget is committed to DLC, the price of the 12 characters is insane. There's something like 40 or 42 characters in vanilla SFxT, so if you were to calculate backwards, the RRP of the game &nbsp;should
 be about $70. And that's not including all the other assets like stages and modes and music and whatnot.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I still believe that the DLC business model has lead to a situation where we as gamers are getting less and less with each new game release rather than more. It's not just bratty 'entitled' gamers. You can see it in JRPGs as well, where the 'superbosses'
 for FFXIII-2 are bought in a separate download. Imagine if FFVII came out today. Would secret characters like Vincent Valentine and bosses like Emerald Weapon be disc locked? Probably.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>At least Bethesda and Rockstar are still making expansions for their games. Can't wait to see what GTA V will have.</p>

<p>I agree with your 'old school' school of thought complete with x character to unlock y character.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>As for ME. The Cerberus Network Pass was 1200msp (I think) and all you got was Zaeed and his mission. The pass obviously came free with the game. ME3 has an online pass AND this 800msp Javik DLC on top. Could EA not have included the Javik DLC with brand
 new copies, a la Zaeed?</p>

<h2>            HDMI Windows 10</h2>
                    Hi, my laptop originally came with Windows 7 and I could duplicate the screen in my TV, ever since I got Windows 10 my TV doesn't recognize my laptop connected throughout the HDMI cable. When my brother connects his laptop the&nbsp; cable and TV work perfectly,
 so I'm sure the problema is my laptop, I updated the controller AMD Radeon HD 5000 series already, but I still unable to duplicate my screen, please help guys!

            Hi there,<br /><br />When you plug the HDMI cable into the laptop, are you able to go into the display settings and hit the detect button, does this detect the second screen?

            Hi Daniela, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />What steps are you taking to attempt to mirror the screen? See if these steps work:
<br />
<br />- Press the keyboard shortcut Windows Key+P to open the external display panel.
<br />- Choose Duplicate.
<br />
<br />See if that works. I'd also recommend updating your graphics drivers:
<br />
<br />AMD Radeon:

<br />Once you've tried the above, let me know how you go! Thanks!

<p>Hello! When I bought xbox one I used an old e-mail to create my first profile. But now I got a new e-mail and I don't want to use the old anymore. So I have 2 xbox accounts and I want to delete the old one. The problem is I bought games like Rocksmith, Dance
 Central and some songs, and I first need to move these games to the new account to be able to delete the old one. How can I do it? Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Reducing minimum laptop backlight brightness on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that my brightness in windows cannot get as low as it can in other operating systems on the same exact device. The 0% brightness setting seems to be artificially
<em>higher</em> in windows than the actual brightness values sent to control the backlight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, where the `0` brightness setting is <em>usually</em> and <em>should be</em> resulting in a switched-off backlight, as per the standard behavior of the ACPI backlight my laptop has, windows' 0% setting seems to be somewhere around the regular
 `25` brightness value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I force Windows 10 to give me control over the actual, raw brightness values that are used to control the backlight? Or at least, force it to map '0%' to a
<em>lower</em> value?</p>

</p><p><strong>In case it matters, here is my display hardware information: </strong>
My display adapter is an Intel HD Graphics 620 (plus an NVIDIA GeForce 940MX), and I am unsure of the backlight controller's model, though I know it is an ACPI-controlled device that accepts a numerical input level between 1 and somewhere around 200. The laptop's
 display itself is simply identified as a "Generic PnP Monitor", with no identifiable manufacturer or model information.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>And also, to clarify, because I have seen other questions like this dismissed with some sort of copy-pasted set of instructions on how to change the brightness setting:
</strong>That is NOT what I need, I already know how to use the windows settings to change the brightness percentage. My problem, as with others that have been poorly answered or dismissed on here for no good reason, is that
<em>the 0% brightness level is still too high</em>, NOT that I don't know how to change my brightness setting.</p>

            If you go to nVidia control Panel, it should offer you to adjust brightness appropriately. This brightness problem generally happens due to nVidia who takes control of Windows brightness setting from Windows' default display adapter.

E for Excel, unfortunately, my NVIDIA card has no control over my display's brightness. It is the secondary discrete card, and so the NVIDIA control panel only offers me DirectX, OpenGL, and PhysX-related settings - nothing relating to my actual display hardware.
 I have also checked the Intel GPU settings, for good measure, and it also lacks a brightness control tool. I think this issue is related more to the way Windows itself gives a percentage abstraction over top of actual display brightness levels used by the
 laptop hardware, and the minimum setting is simply too high for my liking. Thank you for your suggestion, though.<br />
