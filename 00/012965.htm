<h2>            Facebook in text only&#63;</h2>
                    When I try to access Facebook via Internet Explorer, I can see text only. It's unusable.<br />
<br />
Has anyone any ideas about what may be wrong and what i can do about it? No other sites seem to have problems.<br />

    <title>USB 3.0 external drive disconnection after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> notorious tre&#96;  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB 3.0 external drive disconnection after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>What with the annoying little pop-up, I decided to get ready for the windows 10 upgrade. I had been putting off getting drives for a raid enclosure I had waiting for drive prices to fall but finally popped for two 3Tb drives (only to learn the enclosure
 only supports 2Tb drives, so I ended up buying another enclosure as well).<br />
<br />
Ultimately I got the drives up and working just fine with a cavalry USB 3.0 raid enclosure and configured it for raid 1 mirroring to back up my pc in preparation for the upgrade to Windows 10. Mind you, I left it plugged in for 2 days straight as I ran a compressed,
 full-system back-up on a 580Gb drive that took over 40 hours. So the drive enclosure and the USB connection are working just fine - or were under Windows 7 on my HP laptop.<br />
<br />
Then I did the upgrade a few days later. Now the USB 3.0 raid disconnects and re-connects every 2-3 minutes. Not only is this annoying as all hell, it also creates a problem with encrypted file containers I was hoping to access off of the drive in that they
 disconnect and risk corruption any time a drive is pre-maturely disconnected.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I did see one other post that suggested disabling a USB power setting and just did this remotely but I'm at work so I can't power the raid on from here and won't know if it fixes the issue until I get home. I just figured I'd post the problem in case
 there are other things I might be able to look at in the event that doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tre`<br />
<br />
P.S. One other annoying issue - my screen saver doesn't turn on.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>wait what? You refer me to a screen saver thread where 4 out of every 5 people posting is saying "the solution doesn't work"? Seriously!?!?!?<br />
<br />
I have also tried every suggestion I have seen listed thus far in that thread and I've gone through the first screen and a half. I have tried:<br />
<br />
- changing power settings</p>
<p>- changing screen savers</p>
<p>- changing the delay for both screen saver and screen off</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the USB drivers, that is the first thing I checked. It's a laptop so it's an amd integrated usb 3.0 controller. The driver was updated just prior to upgrading to 10, and using the windows 'update driver' says it is the latest driver installed.
 I re-ran the AMD installer again but it just re-installed the existing driver and did not solve the problem. I have tried disabling the power settings for USB, it did not solve the problem. It worked fine under windows 7 on any port, it works fine under 10
 on the USB 2.0 port. Windows 10 broke something in the 3.0 usb.</p>

            Guruprasad - how is this supposed to help?&nbsp; Opening these *.lit files requires the Reader installation to be activated.&nbsp; http://www.microsoft.com/reader/info/activation.aspx points to http://das.microsoft.com/activate/default.asp - which is not accessible.&nbsp;
 I also never received any notification that Reader was being retired, so that I could have potentially done something to save my purchased books.&nbsp; (Microsoft had my email address on my registered Passport account, after all...)<br />
<br />
If there is someone that I could please speak to concerning this, please reply here, or PM me, etc.<br />

            In some countries it's stated by law that you have to have sound on the camera when taking pictures. I guess that may apply to you? On my E7 which is a Norwegian country variant, I can turn it off. Its not illegal in Norway. Don't remember if my 5800 had
 that option though, but I think it may have had that. Have you tried setting your phone to silent profile? Check that out.

<p>Well, then I guess it's nothing I can do to help you. As I mentioned, in some parts of the world it's illegal to have a cell phone which takes pictures silently. They believe that people should have a chance to be aware of if someone takes pictures of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try to disable warning tones, but I cannot remember if that has turned off the camera sound with any device before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, you will have to accept it.</p>

<p>of course for my self i am aware i am talking about me myself and not other people my concern is too have that silent mode when taking pictures did you get my point? did you make a study which phones have silent mode or no shutter sound when taking a picture
 i think some phones have this even with those country's banned from not having this option?.</p>

            That might be, but if you cannot turn it off, you cannot turn it off how matter how much you want it.<br />

You don't need to be rude towards me.<br />

    <title>How to get firmware for 6500c with support for Danish - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kongstad---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get firmware for 6500c with support for Danish</h2>
                    
<p>I just updated my wifes 6500c to the latest firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used the Danish version of the Nokia software updater, and backed up the phone as recommended before updating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 9.45 installed without a hitch, but its only in English, and some languages with a non latin typeset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does 9.45 not support Danish?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possibleto downgrade to a version that supports Danish?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the language on the phone differs from the backup the backup won't restore on the phone,so now my wife has an empty calendar, contact book etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets say I'm not popular at this moment ;(</p>

</p><p>I've just had an email from Microsoft asking me to make changes to my outlook account:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"In the next few weeks we’ll be making some updates that will impact your @outlook.com, @hotmail, @live or @msn email account. Those changes will prevent your email from getting delivered to

<p>
</p><p>This is a really badly worded, confusing and ambiguous email from Microsoft.</p>

</p><p><span>" When you notice that you stop receiving messages, simply follow these two steps: "</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So........am I supposed to hang around waiting for a quiet day of email and then get suspicious??</p>
<p>
</p><p>How will I know exactly when this will happen?....apart from asking someone to send me test emails? ( like we've all got time for that kind of stuff )</p>
<p>
</p><p>What will happen to the &nbsp;'stopped' emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will doing the &nbsp;"simple steps" retrieve the 'stopped emails"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I do it early? What are the implications if I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bulletin is wishy washy, unacceptable and Microsoft can surely do better than this? Really poor</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When your account transitions from the current Outlook.com platform to the Office 365 platform (what is now the "Outlook Mail Preview"), your Outlook Connector account will stop working. When that happens,
 simply switch from the Outlook Connector account to an Exchange account. You'll have access to your data just as you did through the Connector. Exchange is a full two-way sync account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Outlook 2003 won't be able to use an Exchange account. For that version of Outlook, you'll have to connect to&nbsp;<a href="http://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://people.live.com/</a>, export your contacts, them import them locally
 in Outlook 2003 or, while the Outlook Connector still works, copy the contacts to a local Contacts folder in a PST data file. The same applies to the Calendar. You can configure an IMAP account in Outlook 2003, but that syncs only mail, not non-mail folders
 like Calendar and Contacts.</p>

 never an issue until Sunday the 13th at 8:37PM CST was the last email I received from several of those forums. &nbsp;Keep in mind, these are NOT spam generating forums but instead forums where you as a user MUST SPECIFICALLY sign up to receive their email notifications.
 &nbsp;I'm an admin on a couple of those forums so I was fortunate enough to see what was going on.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">So after talking with MS about this issue it turns out they, in all their infinite wisdom simply decided to start blacklisting domains/IP ranges that NO ONE else in the world is blacklisting. &nbsp;Way to go MS! &nbsp;Keep up that wonderful
 work on PAID email accounts that I've used for years and now appear to have to be changing so as not to have to put up with such nonsense in what you think is best for me. &nbsp;How dare you think you know who I should and should not receive emails from.</p>

<h2>            Cannot insert object error using Power View in Excel 2013</h2>
                    I created a short table in Excel 2013, positioned the cursor in the table and clicked Inset/Power View Report. I get a status window saying Excel is opening a Power View sheet but then I get a Power View error: Cannot Insert Object. I am able to insert
 new tabs in the workbook. When I try the insert again, I just get the Power View error. Any help is appreciated.

            <p>That IS strange!&nbsp; This is a long shot, but maybe the problem is with your ActiveX Filtering or the graphic accelerators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Open IE on the Desktop</u></p>
<p>Tools</p>
<p>On the drop down menu, (If <u>ActiveX&nbsp;Filtering</u> is checked, UNCHECK it).</p>
<p><strong>then........</strong></p>
<p>Manage Add-ons</p>
<p>Accelerators (left pane)</p>
<p>Is" E-mail w/windows live" set as default?&nbsp; <br />
If not, set it as default and close the window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>then.........</strong></p>
<p>Tools</p>
<p>Internet Options</p>

<p>CHECK the box "Use Software Rendering Instead of GPU Rendering"</p>
<p>APPLY</p>

<p><strong>restart your computer</strong> for these changes to take effect.</p>

<h2>            How to autopopulate a row of information based on a column value from another worksheet</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to make a master fabrication worksheet with information from multiple worksheets in the same workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9065428-e766-48f5-8534-027c6e4bd5bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9065428-e766-48f5-8534-027c6e4bd5bb" height="449" width="836" /></a></p>
<p>In the above screen shot, I'm looking at the value in H2 (which is a drop down list with two selection, INPROGRESS or COMPLETE).&nbsp; If the value is INPROGRESS, I want to take the values from cells A2 through G2 and populate my worksheet MASTER FABRICATION
 LIST (see below sheet).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df0114b2-d33e-4ab9-8bf0-a67293e7814d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df0114b2-d33e-4ab9-8bf0-a67293e7814d" height="461" width="857" /></a></p>
<p>I want to do this function for multiple worksheets.&nbsp; So each worksheet corresponds to a different project but I want to populate the master worksheet with the information from all of the project worksheets based on a column value in each worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First post so not sure if this is enough info or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            It's generally not a good idea to separate data like that, as it makes it difficult to summarize. If possible, you're much better off thinking in database terms, and keeping everything in one place. Make sure that each row has the Project #, then you can
 use PivotTables to summarize by Project/Date/Status, etc.

<h2>            Outlook Live&#47;Hotmail - Cannot see emails older than one week in Inbox</h2>
                    <p>I notices recently that there has been a change to my inbox. I used to be able to see all my email in my inbox. Even ones that were a couple year old. If I did not delete them or move them to a folder, then I scroll through the pages and find it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe within the last month I have noticed that I can only see a weeks worth of emails and I cannot find the other emails. Where did they go? Surely there are settings to change this but I can't find any!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

    <title>column number&#47;cell location of last non-blank cell in a row - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> external202  say:</h3>
<h2>            column number&#47;cell location of last non-blank cell in a row</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I am trying to make a formula that returns the column number or cell location of the last non-blank cell in a row. I found a formula online that returns the last non-blank
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">value</span>:<br />
=LOOKUP(2,1/(B14:NC14&lt;&gt;""),B14:NC14)</p>
<p>Let this formula be defined as ~<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might think that I could just use the index + match function together to return the cell location, and then do:
</p>
<p>=column(index(b14:NC14,match(~,index(............</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not necessarily work for me as my data row does not contain unique numbers. If my LOOKUP function returns a 10 as the last non-blank value, trying to find its cell location and column with the column+index+match returns the first 10 it finds, and
 there are multiple 10's within B14:NC14.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to find the column number of the last non-blank value because I need to see if the column number matches the column number of another data row.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ANSWERED:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Ashish Mathur and E for Excel both provided working solutions to my problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The difference between their two formulas is that Ashish's formula returns the column number relative to col A, while E's formula returns the column number relative to the first column specified in the formula, in my case column B, such that Ashish's formula
 returns a column number of 32 and E's formula returns a column number of 31. Both work and can easily be manipulated to the user's needs by an addition of a plus or minus 1 at the end of the respective formulas.<br />

<h2>            Howto batch compare Word documents - excluding metadata</h2>
                    Hi.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to do a comparison of hundreds of Word documents to see if I have any duplicates. &nbsp;What makes this trickier is that I want to exclude metadata - if someone has opened a document and saved a new copy without changing the contents, I still want this
 to get flagged as a duplicate.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, what is the best approach?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>#1. &nbsp;Is this functionality built into Word? &nbsp;I know that Word has sophisticated document comparison features for doing comparison manually, but I need to do this as a batch process on hundreds of documents - I don't think Word has this functionality.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>#2. &nbsp;Is there a macro that automates the functionality that is already in Word? &nbsp;Would it be easy for me to write one?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>#3. &nbsp;Does Microsoft provide some sort of Office Tools package that includes this sort of functionality?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>#4. &nbsp;If none of the others then I will buy a 3rd party app. &nbsp;I've done a search and I see that there are many options for this - any suggestions are welcome.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            Batch processing of any sort is not really built into Word. You can do it with VBA, but it's not easy.&nbsp; These tips are examples of batch processing in VBA:<br />

            Hi Karen,
<br />
<br />If you could open another new file in Powerpoint, copy all the slides of the current Powerpoint that could not be saved &amp; paste to the new file.
<br />
<br />Try to save the new file.
<br />
<br />PowerPoint may fail to save any document by displaying error messages like:
<br />
<br />File is corrupt and cannot be saved
<br />PowerPoint found an error that it can’t correct. You should save presentations, quit, and then restart PowerPoint
<br />Filename is currently in use. PowerPoint can’t modify it at this time
<br />This behavior can make users to lose data from edited PowerPoint presentation files as it avoids them from saving. However, error when saving PowerPoint documents can be solved by following any of these methods:
<br />

<p><span>Dear Karen,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When did the issue happen? If you open a new PowerPoint file, can you save the file? If yes, I suggest you check if you can copy the data from the affected file to the
 newly created file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, check if the Office 2016 for Mac application is fully activated with your account. If no, activate it and then do a test to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version information of the PowerPoint 2016 for Mac application you are using. You can access the page via
 PowerPoint&gt;About PowerPoint. Do you also see some error messages when you can’t save the PowerPoint file? If yes, upload some related screenshots as well for our clarification.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<h2>            On Hold mailbox size question - Quota</h2>
                    
<p>Hello&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know what would be the space consumption or Quota usage when the Legal hold is enabled on the mailbox, i understand that when the legal hold is enabled none of the emails would be deleted - if so, how does the 50GB quota will be utilized.</p>
<p>regards</p>

<p>Hi Revenge,</p>
<p>Litigation hold can’t enlarge or decrease the mailbox’s quota and it&nbsp;is to keep your email items without a loss and it.</p>
<p>When an item is moved to the Recoverable Items folder, its size is deducted from the mailbox quota and added to the size of the Recoverable Items folder.<br />
The default limits for the Recoverable Items quota are a soft limit of 20 GB and a hard limit of 30 GB.when you place a mailbox on Litigation Hold or In-Place Hold,the quotas for the Recoverable Items folder are automatically increased to 90 GB and 100 GB.<br />

<h2>            Builds 10532, ..., 10166&#58;  &#34;Optimize Drives&#34; Doesn&#39;t Follow Schedule</h2>
                    <p>I've got my "Scheduled Optimization" set to Daily under "Optimize Drives." &nbsp;Yet, my two internal SSD drives (C: and D:) aren't being optimized daily. &nbsp;I'm assuming this is an issue with maintenance being scheduled to run while my computer is off. &nbsp;But, still,
 it should run once the computer is turned on following a scheduled time. &nbsp;Also, and this again might be timing, under "Change Settings" for "Scheduled Optimization," I've got the box checked for "Notify me if three consecutive scheduled runs are missed." &nbsp;Since
 my schedule is to optimize daily, and my D: drive shows as "3 days since last run," I'd expect a notification. &nbsp;I haven't gotten one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, this could all be semantics. &nbsp;Even though it's saying "x days since last run," it also says "OK." &nbsp;So, maybe it considers an OK status to be a run. &nbsp;If so, the wording needs to be changed somewhere.</p>

<h2>            Onenote for Android won&#39;t open after October 12th 2015 update to version 15.1.6319.4426</h2>
                    <p>I'm on a HTC One S with Android 4.1.1, and OneNote for Android has been working just fine up until the last update to version 15.1.6319.4426. Is it possible to find the previous version of OneNote somewhere and install that? Microsoft support already spent
 40 minutes with me trying to help, but they don't have .apk files at hand of older versions for Android, and all other suggestions didn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;This issue should obviously be under "Mobile Devices" instead of "Office", but there isn't an option for Android there. Who can make that happen?</p>

            <p>Fixed my problem with the September update causing OneNote to stop working on my Android tablet. I found this excellent website where you can download and install earlier versions. The fix was easy to apply and I'm now back in business with the
 August release which works perfectly. You can find this at:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/microsoft-corporation/onenote/onenote-15-1-6027-1008-android-apk-download/</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will be useful in case you download another wounded future release from Microsoft and need to get your notes back quickly.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Undefined Function OpenRecordset SQL Function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> icccapital  say:</h3>
<h2>            Undefined Function OpenRecordset SQL Function</h2>
                    
<p>I am working toward porting my backend from Access 2007 to SQL Express.&nbsp; One of my queries for a recordset is</p>
<p>currentdb.openrecordset(strSELECT, dbOpenDynaset, dbSQLPassThrough)</p>
<p>Where in strSelect I first had something like myDate &lt;= Date(), when I took a look at what got sent to SQL Express in sqlout.txt, it showed a ? where Date() was.&nbsp; So i looked up the current date function for SQL Express, replaced Date() with GETDATE(), the
 query works fine on SQL Express, but now the VB code in Access gives an undefined function error.</p>
<p>Front end is Access 2007, and at the moment the tables are linked since that seemed to be the easiest solution for the porting.&nbsp; I am new to the connection between Access and SQL Express, please help and direct with any thoughts that are relevant, thanks.</p>

            You could avoid the need to cater for Nulls by disallowing Null in each address line column in the table by setting the column's Required property to True, its AllowZeroLength property to True, and giving it a DefaultValue property of a zero-length string.&nbsp;
 You'll need to execute an update query to convert any Nulls to a zero-length string first, before changing the Required property.
