<h2>            Word 2007&#58; Network template always &#34;locked for editing&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>We store our user guide templates on a network share, but normally I am the only one who makes changes to them. However, it appears that templates are locked when users are editing guides based on these templates - is this correct? Most of the time I try
 to edit the template, I get the error message "&lt;template&gt; is locked for editing by 'another user'". (Unfortunately it never tells me which user it is.) I never get any response if I check "Receive notification".</p>
<p>I've also tried renaming or moving the template without any luck.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a way around this, as I'm unable to keep the templates updated.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>That behavior is normal.</p>
<p>You should follow the practice in the article "Distributing macros to other users” at:</p>

<p>for distributing and updating of your templates.</p>
<p>The following post from a few years back may be of use to you as well:</p>

<blockquote>Colleen,
<p>Using a logon script to copy latest version of add-in templates to StartUp <br />
folder is probably the best solution for the templates containing <br />
autotext, <br />
macros, etc.&nbsp; However, I would answer your objection to using the <br />
Workgroup <br />
Templates location for the other templates with this:</p>
<p>When a user has a document created from one of those templates open and <br />
they <br />
are connected to the network, a file lock is in fact created that prevents <br />
the template itself from being opened with Modify access.&nbsp; However, these <br />
file locks can be released, with no adverse affect to the end users who <br />
created them, by using any of a number of standard utilities that close <br />
open <br />
resources on a network.&nbsp; The only catch is that the person using the <br />
utility <br />
must have adequate permissions on both the network share and the Workgroup <br />
Templates folder itself, in other words Admin rights.&nbsp; On my Windows 2000 <br />
box, I can do this through the UI with Start&gt;Settings&gt;Control <br />
Panel&gt;Administrative Tools&gt;Computer Management&gt;Action&gt;Connect to another<br />
computer... type name of network server&gt;System Tools&gt;Shared Folders&gt;Open<br />
Files, find any open resources for that template, right-click and select <br />
'Close open file'.&nbsp; Even easier is to use the command line utility OFL, <br />
which when used with the right switches will automatically close any open <br />
resources connected to a specified template.</p>
<p>Regards, <br />

<p>Sorry: The article that you pointed to is not helpful and does not seem to address the question at hand.</p>
<p>I too have created a nice template in Word 2007 (no macros in it) and want to share it with my department. It is saved on a network share. I also am the only one who makes (or should make) changes to the template.</p>
<p>When I open a doc based on the template, I sometimes get a warning message that the template is in use. Sometimes when I save a doc based on the template, I get a prompt asking me whether I want to change the template. (I don't, and I don't want others in
 the department changing the template.)</p>
<p>I want everybody to be able to use the template so that the styles are available to them, but they should be free to put in whatever content they want. And they should be free to tweak the styles, but the tweaks they make should NOT be saved to the template.</p>
<p>I want to be able to open (not just use) the template regardless of what documents that are based on the template are open.</p>
<p>How can I get the template to behave as I want?</p>
<p>In another place I worked I had a nice template in Word 2003 (with macros, no log-in script required) that worked just fine from a network share. Users just double-clicked the template and could do as they pleased with the content and styles without affecting
 the template itself.</p>

<div>
<div>Is the Template Write Protected? Is it in a shared network Workgroup folder? Have all users got their Workgroup paths set to point at that folder?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Have you had the system admin (of the server) look to see what/who is locking the template?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My guess is that someone is opening the template instead of using File, New to open a new document from the template. If you write protect it, that cannot happen.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, if anyone has opened a document from the template, you will not be able to open to edit the template whilst any user has a document opened that is linked to it. The solution is to edit a copy of the template, write protect it and then when everyone
 is off the template, substitute with the new template.</div>

<p>I have been unable to determine from the Help file how to write-protect a Word 2007 template and still allow users to edit the documents that they create from that template. How do I do so?</p>
<p>The template is saved on a network share that is accessible to all members of the team. I don't know whether that is a "workgroup folder." I'm unfamiliar with that term. Please explain.</p>
<p>I don't know what a workgroup path is. Please explain.</p>

<div>
<div>File Locations settings are found in Word Options, Advanced tab at the very bottom. Your template should be in a Work Group folder on the server (the folder can be called anything you like, but Workgroup Templates or something similar is an obvious choice).
 All the users should point their File Locations, Workgroup Templates to the location on the server. When they start Word and go to File New, the templates in that folder will be available to them in the same way that their local templates are available.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When a user opens a new document from the template, the template will be locked for access on the server. This will not stop other users from opening a new document from the template, but it will stop anyone from editing the template. There is no reason
 for anyone to want to open the template, but making it write protected will ensure that no one accidentally alters it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To write protect the template is the same as write protecting any document you create in Word. File, SaveAs (F12) slick on Tools, General Options and add a password in the Modify box.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But as I said before, you will not be able to edit the template if anyone on the network has a document open that was created from the template. So you need to edit a copy of the template and then quickly substitute when everyone is not using the template.</div>

<p>Terry, I do appreciate the time that you're taking with my questions. Thank you.</p>
<p>I find, however, that there is no Tools &gt; General Options menu or tab in Word 2007 as your answer above suggests. (Word 2003 has a Tools &gt; Options menu. And to protect a document in Word 2003, one would select Tools &gt; Protect Document, make desired selections,
 and enter a password. Perhaps that's what you were thinking of.)&nbsp;If there's a protection feature on the Word Options button or in the Save As dialog box&nbsp;in Word 2007, I don't see it. I'm wonderi</p>
<p>The nearest thing I find to being able to write protect a document in Word 2007 is on the Review tab in the Protect group. When I restrict formatting and editing on my template, I find that I cannot manipulate the formatting on the documents that are created
 from that template.</p>
<p>I want to protect formatting in and content of&nbsp;my template, but not in the documents that are created from that template. Is that possible in Word 2007? If so, can you provide instructions?</p>
<p>As a stop-gap, I've changed the doc properties to read-only, which will help prevent accidental changes.</p>
<p>Again, thank you for the time you're taking.</p>

<div>you said and i quote&nbsp;"But as I said before, you will not be able to edit the template if anyone on the network has a document open that was created from the template. So you need to edit a copy of the template and then quickly substitute when everyone
 is not using the template."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is a pretty retarded way of handling this with many users. isnt there a smarter method to this madness by now?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>couldnt you just set a property on the file, so that when a user opens a template, it doesnt lock the original template, but instead creates a 'local file' on their own computer? this seems like a much easier solution than quickly substituing the file
 when everyone is not using the template. </div>

            <p>Revisiting this topic after 4 years and an upgrade from 2007 to 2010. Word _still_ displays the same problem; templates in the Workgroup Templates location get locked if only a single user has a document open that uses that template. This makes it impossible
 to make changes to the template unless all users are booted off the system somehow.</p>

            Hi Jude,
<br />
<br />I am Wilfredo an Independent advisor And I'm here to help you !!
<br />
<br />If you are using 2-step verification, I recommend checking your phone number with the Office 365 administrator to know that it is the correct one
<br />
<br />You can also check the notification settings on your mobile phone and enable phone calls, messaging applications and authentication applications to send alerts. Push notifications are not accurate, but they help you complete the faster check method
<br />
<br />This link will help you understand what the 2-step verification is about <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-2-step-verification-for-office-365-ace1d096-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up...</a> 61e5-449b-a875-58eb3d74de14?

<h2>            Ovi maps on the C2-02</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm looking for a new mobile and I like the look of the C2-02 slider phone. I'm not interesting in using applications like facebook or twitter on my phone, however I am interested to see that this phone comes with maps loaded on it -- this is certainly true
 of these phones sold by the Carphone Warehouse in the UK. I have a number of questions relating to the use of these maps, please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could someone please explain how the maps work on a 'phone like this without any GPS hardware. First of all can I use the maps sensibly without a connection to the Internet? Secondly can I use the phone/maps to get an idea of my position, and if so does
 this cost anything and if so does this require a connection to the Internet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards -- David.</p>

<p>You might like to look at this Nokia resource:<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/maps-support/how-to/how-to-use-maps-for-s40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/maps-support/how-to/how-to-use-maps-for-s40</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia Maps using network based GPS is pretty miserable relying upon cell tower triangulation and you would probably need to invest in a Bluetooth GPS receiver to get the best of this application.</p>

<h2>            Exchange Hybrid and Distribution Groups</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have Exchange 2010 based hybrid setup. We need to create new dynamic distribution groups. We noticed that these dynamic distribution groups do not sync to Office 365 when created in on premises Exchange. Microsoft recommendation is to make matching cloud
 only contacts in Exchange Online to workaround this issue. But because all of our mailboxes are already moved to Exchange online is there any problems if we create these dynamic distribution groups direclty in Exchange Online?</p>

<p>Hi DamonW,</p>
<p>You can create a DDG directly which includes all moved mailboxes in Office 365(without any issue).

<p><span>I have some Questions regarding the code:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>In line nos. 16 &amp; 24, only “Next” key word has been used where generally the “NEXT” key word is used along with the loop counter i.e. Next i (as per line 45 ). IS there any special reason
 for using this expression ? Looking for clarification.</span></li><li><span>Line No. 25: The UpperLeft Object Variable receives the address of top left cell. Here are two confusions :</span>
<ol>
<li><em><span>What is the end value of UpperLeft Object Variable</span></em><span> ? &nbsp;: because each time the loop counter is incremented,
 the row number and column number of upper left cell in each selection also change.</span>
<ol>
<li><em><span>What is the reason of using the UpperLeft Object Variable</span></em><span> ? : Because the variable is being used only
 once in the code.</span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li><li><span>Line no. 42 &amp; 43 : WHAT IS THE REASON OF SUBTRACTING THE TOPROW AND LEFTCOL : From line no. 22 &amp; 23 we have seen that TopRow = SelAreas(i).Row – which is row number of upper left cell in
 each selection areas and&nbsp; LeftCol = SelAreas(i).Column – which is column number of upper left cell in each selection areas. In my understanding, one thing is being subtracted from the same thing in line 42 &amp; 43, which gives zero (0) result. Looking forward
 to hear from you in respect of the proper clarification if any .</span></li></ol>

            <p>Why is Next used without a reference?</p>
<p>This is actually a way to improve performance.&nbsp; The VBA engine keeps track internally of the sequence of such loops and it can actually more rapidly find the appropriate value for Next if it is not referenced than if it is.&nbsp; If you do reference it, then
 the engine has to look it up in the internal table and apply the appropriate value.</p>
<p>I normally leave the reference off of them but will add a comment at the Next line to help with examining or debugging the code later; for example:</p>
<p>For X = 1 To 100</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For Y = 23 To 2 Step -1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'do some work</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next ' end Y loop</p>
<p>Next ' end X loop</p>
<p>
</p><p>The UpperLeft object: this does seem to be a left-over, unused variable in the code.&nbsp; Perhaps from an earlier version of the code where it was used.&nbsp; I suspect that it may have been used to determine where to paste the selection to be copied in an exact
 fashion.&nbsp; It ends where it begins: it was a one-cell reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for the subtraction is to get the positioning for the paste correct.&nbsp; But you are correct, 10-10 = 0 just as 44-44 = 0.&nbsp;&nbsp;You could test this theory by changing line 44 to become simply:</p>
<p>SelAreas(i).Copy PasteRange&nbsp; (but I don't think that'll work properly - see next paragraph).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But we need to look closer at what TopRow and LeftCol actually are when the loop begins, as earlier in the code those are gradually set to the top-most and left-most row/column of any of the selected ranges - in effect giving you the UpperLeft location of
 where any given selection is to be pasted, combined with the offset it will position each individual copied selection to the right and below that location by some number of rows/columns.</p>

            <p>Can you post a copy of the data (or an example of the data) you want to copy and paste and how you intend identify the ranges to be copied?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without this&nbsp; is only guessing&nbsp;as to how to achieve what you require. If you can use AutoFilter to identify the ranges in rows then the code is relatively simple.</p>

<p>A suitable starting point might be the code which you posted yesterday:</p>

<p>
</p><p>In that thread, I note that JL Latham has responded to your specific code queries. Perhaps it would be appropriate to acknowledge that response and to indicate the perceived shortcomings of the reported code. &nbsp;This would also enable you to request any necessary

<div>Is there anyway I can change this so they stay there forever?</div>

<p>Both apps uses A-GPS chip the A is for assisted, which means that uses the tower cells locations to make the first position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that google uses its own database and Nokia uses other, Google has a better database. You can change which database to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case only the first time I use OVI maps took a lot to find me, but after that it was very fast, less than 10 seconds. But still Google wins with almost instant location.</p>

<p>No they are not, it will cache some info but not the whole map of a region so you can be landed with a big data bill. This one of the best features with OVI Maps being able to load the maps of any region you want.</p>

<p>My opinion of the Nokia free maps has improved. Just a shame it doesn't (yet?) work on either of my Nokia GPS phones.</p>

<p>I've always been a big fan of Nokia/OVI Maps, and now that you get free navigation on certain models I think blows Google maps out of the water.</p>

<p>Hey CoolGrammie!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know of many news websites that are covered in advertisements, and that require you to subscribe to them to continue reading. But that is the news provider's fault, not Bing's. Bing itself is completely free, and has no advertisements on the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bing is just a search engine that scans the internet for News Articles, and places them in a News tab. Bing does not create any news at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, I do understand your frustration with ads. There are two main Microsoft solutions to that:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You could start using Reading View in Microsoft Edge.&nbsp;</em>Reading View doesn't work on all of the news sites, but when it does, it is worth it. It clears away all of the ads and toolbars, keeping only the text, headings, and pictures. To get Reading
 View in Microsoft Edge (no, Chrome doesn't have it):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You can click the Reading View button on the URL bar (or press Ctrl+Shift+R)</li><li>You can put "read:" in front of the URL of your news site.</li></ul>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bd819c4-2b80-4a76-8e0b-d3cfa4de77d5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bd819c4-2b80-4a76-8e0b-d3cfa4de77d5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Remember, this won't prevent site from demanding a subscription, but it will clear away the ads.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You could download the Microsoft News app.&nbsp;</em>I personally use the Microsoft News app as my primary news source. It is absolutely free, and the news articles are beautifully formatted to include no ads.<em>
</em>To download the Microsoft news app:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open the Microsoft Store, search for Microsoft News, and select "Get".</li></ul>
<p>Remember, this won't give you points for using it, but it is free of charge and ads.</p>
<p>

    <title>Problems with Windows home Insider Preview&#58; Build 10074 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with Windows home Insider Preview&#58; Build 10074</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Windows 10 for about three days now and I just want it gone. Windows 10 so far have broken my games, programs, and overall my laptop by making it slow all around here are the following problems I have been having.</p>
<ul>
<li>cannot open modern apps thus can't go to update and recovery option in settings.</li><li>Explorer.exe "Element not found" error.</li><li>breaks my graphic drivers.&nbsp;</li><li>cannot play my games anymore often crashing (exp: GW2.exe has stopped working) or not starting up at all.</li><li>(recent) internet connection in the search box doesn't work.</li><li>have to restart my computer multiple times because of windows button is stuck along with the search bar.</li></ul>
<p>I have tried everything in the book to get rid of buggy build and I hope Microsoft finds some way to uninstall it I don't want it anymore and I am not paying over the top just to be hit in the face with "you can't install this program because of the windows
 10 technical&nbsp;preview " it'll just be wasted money and time. The vast internet world doesn't really offer that many solutions that I haven't seen before such as&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>booting my computer in safe mode (doesn't work).</li><li>holding down/spamming the shift key on startup (doesn't&nbsp;work).</li><li>typing explorer.exe in task manager&nbsp;(doesn't work) .</li><li>using the media creation tool ( what???)-tried this but cannot figure out &nbsp;how to use it plus need a USB&nbsp;with 4GB or more currently have a 512M USB stick.</li><li>trying to open the settings in windows 10 (nope..doesn't work).</li></ul>
<p>If anyone can give some insight on the best way to fix this problem it would be greatly appreciated with open arms&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I have spoken to a Microsoft technician who got into my computer and pretty much the problem remain unsolved, but he did all he could to fix the issue telling me I have to get a USB stick.</li><li>I have spoken multiple times to the dedicated windows 10 tech support team and pretty much I have to buy new software.</li><li>I have spoken to my manufacturer (Lenovo) for further detail.</li></ul>

            <p>It seems quite likely that malware has been&nbsp;your core&nbsp;issue.&nbsp; Even Malwarebytes doesn't always find it all and/or may need several scans and reboots to fix things.&nbsp; Internet Explorer may need to be reset to absolute defaults, losing all plugins, cookies,
 etc.&nbsp; I have had to do this for family when Malwarebytes did not remove all issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way into Safe Mode is to power off your PC during a reboot, immediately after the BIOS screen switches to Windows starting to load.&nbsp; Hold the power button in if necessary until it powers off.&nbsp; Doing this twice should result in Windows Repair starting
 at the next power-up.&nbsp; One choice ought to be to go back to your previous OS install (which likely still has malware to clear up).</p>
<p>
</p><p>RecoveryDrive.exe in Windows does need a USB flash drive of at least 512MB (which you have)&nbsp;but it is basically the same as what you get through the power-off method.&nbsp; USB flash drives are very inexpensive now, so getting one a bit larger may be easy and
 inexpensive if you are wanting to reinstall Windows 10 from USB.</p>

            <p>I was suggesting that you get to the "Rollback to the previous build" screen (just by powering off quickly right after power-up a couple of times)&nbsp;to recover your previous Windows 8.1 instead of needing a larger USB flash drive to re-install it again --
 But that if you ever did want a bigger USB flash drive, they are not too expensive these days.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with Excel for Mac 16.7 that is not an issue in 15.38; I can no longer open up a password protected file correctly. &nbsp; &nbsp;When I open it, I I can type the password, but the file immediately goes into &nbsp;'hidden mode'. &nbsp;When I click Unhide...,
 it asks me for a password again and it doesn't work. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to easily downgrade back to 15.38? &nbsp;I use this file frequently.</p>

            As a follow-up, it seems that 16.8 works. &nbsp; Overall the components of this release seem more stable (i.e. no hangs) in general. &nbsp; Cheers and thanks.

<p>
</p><p>My postfix email server when trying to deliver messages to recipients in with outlook.com or hotmail.com is having those messages rejected supposedly because my email server is on some blacklist - despite the fact it is a legitimate domain, and my company

            Go to https://mx****/ - enter your domain name then click the MX lookup button. Then after it finds the MX, click the link to the right of the MX record to do a blacklist check. Are you on any of the blacklists? If not, its an internal blacklist, possibly caused by someone who is on the same server.  See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/SecurityCompliance/use-the-delist-portal-to-remove-yourself-from-the-office-365-blocked-senders-lis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/Secu...</a> for information on the internal list and how to get off it. 
<br />
<br />BTW if you don't have dkim, dmarc and spf records set up, you should add them to your dns records - it can help you with some spam filters.

    <title>Signature and spell check issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tdagusa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Signature and spell check issue</h2>
                    <p>Currently I have our signature block setup as follows:</p>
<p>ABC Co. Logo </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>ABC Co</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the space in between is where the body of the email is.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I have it set like this Outlook believes the body is also part of the signature and does not spell check it.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I leave the logo towards the top of the email (header?) and still be
 able to spell check? </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess that the VLOOKUP is returning text.</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>b</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>c</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>I first created this simple table and formatted the cell containing 5 as text.</p>
<p>The VLOOKUP of "a" returns 5 as figure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clear the contents of the cell containing 5 and re-enter a value. VLOOKUP retruns now a text string.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=MIN(&lt;the result of the VLOOKUP&gt;, 6) returns 6. After convertnig the 5 back to a figure, MIN returns 5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So try this:</p>
<p>=MIN(D6,--AC6)</p>
<p />

 saved document, and from there I can create a blank document without any problems.</div>

    <title>Several MS Office 365 installed instances - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> webfairyjo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Several MS Office 365 installed instances</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that I have Office 365 installed several times on my Windows 10 computer (see image below). I have a subscription for Office 365 Personal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Avast, it's telling me that Microsoft Office 365 - de-de is slowing down my computer, even though I have not opened any Microsoft document today since I switched on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: </p>
<p><strong>Should I keep all those instances</strong>, do they work together, or <strong>
can I remove at least the "it-it" and "nl-nl"</strong>, which I don't use nor speak?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your support and advice, sincerely,</p>
<p>Joanie</p>

<p>Hi Webfairyjo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>First, if you open OneDrive, I suggest you close it to check if the list has any changing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it has no efforts, I suggest you open Task Manage to check if there is any app is related to Office.</p>
<p>If so, please close it to check if the list changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I would like to explain that as the list displayed on Avast, I suggest you post on Avast forum to check if the issue is related to the avast app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

<p>My daughter is locked out of her Word, even though program was purchased with her laptop. I am locked out of Word on my PC even though the program was purchased for my PC. Two separate purchases, and it seems that because we both allowed auto-updates, we
 are both locked out of using our documents. Online fixes do not work.</p>

<h2>            How to access search term reports for Shopping campaigns&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, this might be an incredibly stupid question, but I can't find any answer. How do I access the search term report for my Shopping campaign? We've received the first clicks and I thought I'd check out what people are looking for, but clicking on "Keywords"
 only takes me to the Negative Keywords without a way to open the search term report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I look into the users' search queries?</p>
<p>
</p><p>/e: Okay, got it, it's via the "Reports" button at the top of the page.</p>

<p><span>Hi Jarhe,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Great question, thank you for reaching out to us!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike regular campaigns, shopping campaigns with product ads do not have a regular keyword list. As a result, you are not able to access the search term report for shopping campaigns using the keyword
 list the same way you are able to with a regular campaign. Below, I have listed the steps you will need to follow to access a search term report for your shopping campaign via the dimensions tab, as well as a screenshot:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click on the campaign and ad group you would like to run the report for</span></li><li>
<span>Click on the dimensions tab (located on the bar under the ad group name)</span></li><li>
<span>Once you click on the dimensions tab, there will be a drop down for which kind of report you would like to run. Click on ‘Search Term’</span></li><li>
<span>Ensure the date range is the correct date range for the data you would like to retrieve</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f93f728-47c9-4c40-af88-ec44808065a4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f93f728-47c9-4c40-af88-ec44808065a4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Upon completing these steps, the report should load immediately, and it is also available for download. In addition, you can run this same report using the reporting tab, which can be found at the
 top of the page on the UI. For more information about running search term reports, please see our Bing Ads
</span><a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56670/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Run a search term report help article</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may notice that on the drop down in the dimensions tab, there is an entire section for reports available for you to run for your shopping campaign which may be helpful in the future. I have provided
 another screenshot below: </span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87a4c24e-fc5c-49f2-a4c9-8b831b059f61?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87a4c24e-fc5c-49f2-a4c9-8b831b059f61?upload=true" /></a></p>

                    <p>Hello everybody!! I wish to everyone on this forum a happy and creative new year!!! I own a brand new Lumia 640 Dual device with Windows 8.1 update 2 fully updated (version 8.10.15148.160). The phone works pretty fine (including all , however I experience
 a problem viewing my Outlook emails. When I manually add my email account, I get the message "There's already an account on this phone using *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, called Outlook". I have added my MS account when I opened the device for the first time. Subsequently,
 I have also performed a factory reset already but the problem still remains. I would appreciate any help provided.&nbsp;</p>

Blerina1986</a>. Lets check if that account that you're trying to add is existing. Go to Settings&gt;email+account, did you see an email under the Microsoft account? Is it the one you're trying to add? If yes, then there is no need for you to re setup that email.
 If no&nbsp;email is in there, but you're getting that error message, try using the Windows Device Recovery Tool. Be sure to have a backup to avoid data loss.

</p><p>We switched Office 365 accounts so now we have a new login. I can't seem to switch the Onedrive account. I have entered the new account information through Word for the other Office products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something? I don't have a "settings" option after right-clicking on the system tray icon.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2fe8f851-1833-4372-93a9-45f00e33654d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2fe8f851-1833-4372-93a9-45f00e33654d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">How do I get the new account information into Onedrive? Thank you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have both personal and business OD running.</p>
<p>I am signed into my computer with my personal Microsoft Outlook.com account. I am signed into Office 365 with the new Office 365 account. My personal OD account is logged-in using the personal outlook.com account. This leaves the OD Business account
 that needs updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes a pop-up appears to sign into Sharepoint (not sure if this is relevant, or what it even is), but I've tried signing in with the new Office 365 account info, but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Dncasey,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Given to the screenshot, it’s the legacy OneDrive for Business sync client, so you cannot find “settings”. To learn more, see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-OneDrive-sync-client-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Which OneDrive sync client am I using?</a> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please check if there is another blue OneDrive for Business icon on the task bar. If yes, right-click it&gt;Settings&gt;Account&gt;Unlink this account&gt;enter your new work/school account in the sing in pop-up.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you only can see a white OneDrive icon on your task bar, you may right-click it&gt;Settings&gt;Account&gt;Add a business account&gt;enter your new work/school account. &nbsp;<br />
Moreover, the legacy sync client uses the credential from other Office applications. The new sync client has its own credentials. We can directly sign into the next generation sync client with both Microsoft and work/school account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim

                    <p><span>&nbsp;Hello, one of our adminstrators credentials got compromised (via a phishing email) for only about 20 minutes until we detected it and her password was changed. I checked the audit log for anything done via her acct. All were done via the
 local IP except for one where the IP address showed &lt;NULL&gt; and the activity was "Set Company Information". I don't know what this is. Looking thru the details I see the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"Name": "targetUpdatedProperties",<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Value": "[{\"Name\":\"Included Updated Properties\",\"OldValue\":null,\"NewValue\":\"\"}]"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is this something meaningful to anyone? We were hacked before and really need to make sure we are not exposed again. Can anyone help us decode this information?<br />

<h2>            Outlook will not save new server incoming&#47;outgoing details</h2>
                    <p>Help! Have changed servers for email coming into outlook (running office 365 version). Exported old account contents and imported to new 'email account'. Managed to negotiate round new style setting up of inserting incoming outgoing server details, ports
 etc. Finish, test email fine all working. Then receive message re email sent - not received. Check via web host, it is there in inbox, but not forwarded. Check of 'new account' incoming / outgoing servers shows old server details logged there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Replace with new details, test message sent, fine, email in web inbox appears also.</p>
<p>Re-check some time later to find incoming/outgoing servers again changed to old server details.</p>
<p>Now repeated process 4 times and old details continue to re-appear.</p>
<p>How do I get outlook to retain my new server details. FRUSTRATED!</p>

<p>Hi Shyamal,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. Outlook 365 version being run is&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2c8a49a-4bdb-44b7-b0fc-99df7b60e0a5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2c8a49a-4bdb-44b7-b0fc-99df7b60e0a5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Mailbox set up on outlook manually (as have done previously)</p>
<p>Tried 4 times to create new account, but still kept getting same replacement of old mail server details replacing new ones I had inserted... Frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have left all alone now for 36 hours and as we speak, test messages are being sent received ok. Machine has been shut down (twice) as that also appeared to re-install old settings) but, all appears to be working correctly... Have done nothing
 different to account, so still not sure why this was happening. But grateful for your reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>
