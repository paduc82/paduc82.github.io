<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Recent Address Database not working.</h2>
                    <p><span>We have an issue where Outlook 2016 recent address database is becoming corrupted on a large percentage of our Macs.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Macs run OSX 10.5 and rebuilding the identity does not fix the issue. If we delete the database file at \Users\&lt;username&gt;\Library\Group Containers\UBF8T346G9.Office\Outlook\Outlook 15 Profiles\&lt;Profiles
 name&gt;\Data\Recent Addresses we are able to add new addresses. The issue we have is the problem is so widespread we cannot just delete everyone's database file, they would lose all their recent addresses and so far has not proved a guaranteed fix.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Creating a new database file and then copying all information form the old database file does not allow us to add any additional addresses but the old ones do show. The recent address show fine in
 Office 365 Web App. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When using a new Mac entirely the database file is created new but new addresses are not picked up as they should be, according to the below article, when emails are sent to new addresses on a different
 machine. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2768735
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If there are any suggestions other than rebuild machine or rebuild identity I'd love to hear them.
</span></p>

            Apparently there is a maximum size the nickname file on a Mac can be. From memory once it goes over that no more names are added. Pretty poor. Ill try and find the exact answer that MS gave and post.

            <p>I have had to revert back to my winpro8.1 installation on a seperate hdd due to the TP system having a major foobar with the screen even under safe mode constantly flickering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was working nicely up until this update was applied then all went to the ****, I can not even go into 10 TP to uninstall and reload my video drivers to see if this fixes the issues due to the constant screen flickering and what appears to be
 a complete lockup of the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not even use System Restore due to the whole system foobar'd so again another complete failure as Restore is there for this kind of thing and yet is 110% inaccessible, including even sending in any system crash reports due to the same issue above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sad to think this is the kind of quality control that people have towards their own work nowadays, sad indeed, not a very good sign for w10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will attempt a full fresh reload of w10 TP later, maybe, perhaps.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 and Address Book Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alanbunting  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 and Address Book Issues</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Office 2016 on a Widows 10 Pc a few months ago and everything was working fine. Within Outlook If I selected the Address Book tab, the whole of my contacts within My People was displayed and I could select from that list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could also use the To or CC box within the email option and the complete My People contact&nbsp;list would be there to select from. However a few days ago for no apparent reason these options no longer work and all that I get is the Search option box. All of
 my contacts are still in My People but I cannot find anyway to display the complete listing within either Address Book or new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only changes that I am aware of with my PC&nbsp;are the regular weekly, or so, updates that automatically come from Microsoft. I have not knowingly added or removed any software or file locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be gratefully received in order to restore the facility that I have always had with all previous versions of Outlook.</p>
<p>

            Hi RandySoto
<br />
<br />I currently have Office 365 Version 1904 (Build 11601.20072) and have received these. Not sure which version of Office 365 you are on. 
<br />
<br />However something interesting I have noted. Even through these appear in the Start menu and in the Task Bar when an Office Application File is open, any custom pinned tiles within the stat menu are the same.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

<h2>            Start Menu Not Working</h2>
                    i have been on the phone with Microsoft Tech for almost 7 hours!&nbsp; This tech installed Windows 10 TWICE and no go.&nbsp; Then he started another program which I waited 1.23 hours...THEN HE LEFT THE PHONE CALL AND REMOTE SESSION!&nbsp; The first tech hung up on me
 as well as ending our remote access in the middle of some sort of download (upload?; I had no idea of what or how!.&nbsp; I called back and never got a "sorry".&nbsp; I was meant to feel that it was my fault.&nbsp; So, I get a new tech...who never tried to find out the other
 tech (RODRIGO)!&nbsp; She then did the same processes as the first tech,,,my problem HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED!&nbsp; I am now going to switch to Apple!

<h2>            Outlook vs Time Warner email</h2>
                    I recently changed from Windows Vista desktop to Windows 10 desktop. I have used Microsoft Outlook for YEARS with my road runner account!&nbsp; Now road runner won't work and Time Warner tells me it is because I have Time Warner email and Outlook is not compatible.
 Well, it has been compatible for as many years as I have had a computer. Does anyone else have that problem? Thanks in advance for any advice you can give.

            <p>I looked at the release notes and am puzzled by one statement:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
Supports more than one account in one Inbox</p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
Yes</p>
For Outlook 2016 For Mac</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When the last update went in it removed the ability for users to use one Inbox/Sent/Trash and have multiple acts as folders in that box. I was told by Support "<span style="color: rgba(67, 71, 81, 1)">Hi Joseph, the option
 Group similar folders, such as Inboxes, from different accounts is now replaced with Show all accounts folder</span><span style="color: rgba(67, 71, 81, 1)">" which is not an acceptable solution since the Show All Accounts Folder Inbox mixes emails from all&nbsp;accts configured
 for that user. Is this what the release notes refer to as supporting more than one acct in one inbox?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(67, 71, 81, 1)">It does not appear that the user has the option either to create a sub-folder (like to put a rule in to move messages to a specific address to a sub-folder)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(67, 71, 81, 1)">It appears to me that the users have had a choice removed as to how they want their display structured and the Release Notes for Mac do not appear correct or are somewhat misleading.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the post, JoeB_KC. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The new sidebar in Insider Fast has an "All Accounts" area which has one Inbox folder only, where in the old sidebar design there was separate Inbox folders under the Inbox for each account added in Outlook. The same applies for other special folders like
 Sent, Drafts, and Trash. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We've heard a lot of feedback on this design, so appreciate the post here and also contacting support (did you use "Contact Support" within the app?). We'll continue to iterate on the new sidebar design in Insider Fast, so look for changes in upcoming updates.
 One of the goals of Insider Fast is to gather feedback from users like you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below the "All Accounts" area there is still separate nodes for each account added in Outlook, each with its own Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc. This is where you can view the Inbox for just one account without seeing the "Unified Inbox" of all accounts. This

<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Compare-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-with-Outlook-2016-for-Windows-bd54cb79-d367-4c2f-89c7-3e5d16618f87?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Compare Outlook 2016 for Mac with Outlook 2016 for Windows">
article</a> is referencing having more than one account added in the same profile. (I think it means "profile" when it says "inbox") There is a separate row for "Unified Inbox" which is the feature that places all of the messages from across accounts into the
 single Inbox in "All Accounts" which is what we're discussing here. </p>

</p><p>If this forced combined everything comes into reality Outlook for Mac is gone. Even now it is hard enough to choose what I want to view from 4 different private and business accounts I have currently configured for it forcing me to have lots of open tree
 nodes open to see all new mails.</p>

            <p>You are correct I did contact support using the Contact Support feature from within the app. Chat dialogue launched as expected and received an answer within 48hrs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your statement "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">there is still separate nodes for each account added in Outlook, each with its own Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc</span>" that is the issue I am addressing here. I use a number of "Filed"
 folders to archive messages and move them out of the way after addressing them to deal with Outlook Bloat. In the current design I have to scroll all the way to the bottom of that grouping of files to see an Inbox for the second account configured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was much more convenient to be able to see the Inboxes of both accounts in one folder and then only scroll down if there was something that had to be pulled from my archives or archived with a drag and drop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that the users could have the option use the Sidebar as it is right now or to use the legacy view that we had prior to this "upgrade?"</p>

 other inboxes as I can't see the number of unread emails in them any more.</p>

<h2>            Display captions in SWAY</h2>
                    I have image cards and have made a group with the grouptype slideshow. I want the caption to display next to the pictures but it's only a small icon at the top left of the image, and the viwers have to click the caption thumbnail to reveal the caption.
 How can I make the captions bigger and stay constant, not just appear by clicking them?

<p>Hi Martine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For slideshow, comparison, and stack groups, captions are always hidden behind a button like this and there is no way to set them to be constantly shown.&nbsp; If you need that to happen, you should consider putting the text in a text card and grouping that with
 the slideshow.</p>

<p>Got the same problem; updated my device after a failure as recommended with that Nokia Suite; now it won't push anymore! Colleague got an E72-1 too; didn't update, and yes, his E72-1 is still pushin. Settings are the same on both devices. So it might be
 that update...</p>

<p>to:</p>
<p>.Format = True</p>
<p>.Find.Font.Bold = False</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re 2. The code doesn't create any bookmarks; it simply assumes they're there and inserts a hyperlink to those assumed bookmarks. What would you have&nbsp;the code&nbsp;do if the bookmark doesn't exist, given that you've included the string as one of your Find parameters?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re 3. Change:</p>
<p>ActiveDocument.Hyperlinks.Add .Duplicate, SubAddress:=ArrTerms(i) &amp; "_Details", TextToDisplay:=ArrTerms(i)</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Query could not be started</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm trying to import data in Excel 2016 using Microsoft Query.</p>
<p>So click on data tab/from other sources/from microsoft query, the microsoft query aplication opens and I choose the data I want to import (an xls file). Then when I close Microsoft Query the data should be imported in Excel, but it isn't. In stead I get
 a message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft Query could not be started because it isn't installed. You can install Query by running the installation program you used to install Office or Excel. The Query option is in the Office Tools category.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So the solution looks simple I just need to install Query, but the problem is I that can't choose what to install. One click on the installation kit and Office installs.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can open with Excel 2016 an older workbook with a table created with microsoft query and it will be added to the data menu (but not to the PowerPivot).</p>
