<h2>            how to save a self-made cover sheet in Word&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got Office 2016 for Mac and I would like to create a document with a cover sheet, table and contents etc. Before I had Office 2010 on a Windows laptop.
</p>
<p>Unfortunatly I do not like the new cover sheets given by Word 2016 for Mac at all. Thus, I created my own based on an old one from Word 2010 as a template. Now I would like to save it as a template. Sadly, I just cannot find any possibility to do so. If
 I open the tag "insert" (no idea whether it's called like this in English, in German it's called "Einfügen") and "cover sheets" the only option I get is "delete cover sheet". No "add to catalog" or "save as a template".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already looked for tutorials on the internet but they either apply to older versions and thus do not work on Office 2016 or they only explain how to insert one of the given (not plain at all) cover sheets to your document. That I figured out myself as
 it is quite intuitive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be a possibility to save a salf-made cover sheet for later usage as a template...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

            <p>You can quickly add your cover sheet to any existing document if you place it in AutoText:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Word, choose <strong>Word&gt;Preferences&gt;View</strong> and under the <em>Show Non-Printing Characters</em> section, check
<strong>All</strong>. <strong>OK</strong> out. This makes breaks visible on-screen.</li><li>Create your cover page and end the page with a Page Break (<strong>Insert&gt;Break&gt;Page Break</strong>).</li><li>Select the page, including the Page Break, but nothing after the Page Break.</li><li>Choose <strong>Insert&gt;AutoText&gt;AutoText</strong>.</li><li>Give the entry a suitable name like <em>CoverPage</em> in the <strong>Enter AutoText entries here:</strong> field.</li><li>Very important: click on <strong>Add</strong>. The AutoText is added to the template attached to your document, usually Normal.dotm.
<strong>OK</strong> out.</li></ol>
<p>Then when you want to insert the cover:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click just to the left of the first character on the first page.</li><li>Choose <strong>Insert&gt;AutoText&gt;Autotext</strong>.</li><li>Choose <em>CoverPage</em> and click on <strong>Insert</strong>. The cover page is added to the beginning of your document.</li></ol>
<p>To streamline this further, you can give the entry a keyboard shortcut:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Tools&gt;Customize Keyboard</strong>.</li><li>In the Categories list, scroll down to <strong>AutoText</strong> and select it.</li><li>In the Commands list, find <em>CoverPage</em> and select it.</li><li>Click in the <strong>Press new keyboard shortcut</strong> field and enter your preferred keyboard shortcut.
<strong>Control + Option + C</strong> is one that's not assigned to anything else.</li><li>Very important: click on the <strong>Assign</strong> button. <strong>OK</strong> out.</li></ol>
<p>Now you can insert a cover in any document created from the same template by clicking before the first character and pressing Control + Option + C at the same time.</p>

<h2>            Please Help&#58;  Can&#39;t fill in a 2010 Word Form Fields</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone</p>
<p>I have created forms in MS Word 2003 with great success and locked them so that only the form fields can be filled in.&nbsp; However, I have not longer ago started using 2010, and have watched the tutorials, read the instructions on how to create them in 2010.</p>
<p>I created a template, then&nbsp;added the Developer tab, and have made sure I was in developer mode to enter the form fields, however when I lock the document (protection with a password&nbsp;&gt; only only allow filling in forms), I cannot fill in any text fields, check
 any checkboxes, select any drop down menus, etc...&nbsp;&nbsp;Worth noting:</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Before locking the document I can check the checkboxes and select the date field which brings up the calendar.</p>
<p>I am sure it is a setting or something which needs tweaking.&nbsp; I have watched all of the tutorial videos (although the first one cut out before it was finished - I did try to watch it twice - is it just my connection? The others I watched fine).</p>
<p>Please help me as I have work to complete and my searching for an answer has come up blank.</p>
<p>Denene</p>
<p>OKAY DON'T WORRY - HERE IS THE FIX &amp; WHAT I WAS DOING WRONG!)&nbsp; I created the form fields in a text box which it obviously did not like, so I created the form fields outside of the text box, locked it (so people can only fill in the form) and hey presto!!
 I can now edit the fields.... only took me a couple of hours to figure it out!</p>

    <title>Unfinished Full System Scan - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> welch103  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unfinished Full System Scan</h2>
                    <p>I am running Microsoft Security Essentials for Windows 7 on a Dell Inspiron laptop. I have had Security Essentials on it for several years. I routinely run a Full System Scan; in addition to my weekly scheduled Quick Scans. Just recently; after updating
 the program, I have found that the Full System Scan stops and hangs up on the following:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\Installer\$PatchCache$\Managed\00004119110000000100000000F01FEC\14.0.4763\FL_MSVSTOExcelImpl_GAC_nomaf_runtime_amd64</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had any problems running the Full System Scan until now. I searched for this file but it does not appear in the "Start", "Search programs and files". Any idea why this is happening and how I can get Security Essentials to again run the Full
 scan? It runs the Quick Scan just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>I am not sure what you want, the full scan of Microsoft Essentials starting hanging up over last weekend and it freezes about 40 minutes into the scan (about 90percent) on many different files each time I try to do a full scan. &nbsp; It has always worked before
 don't know what happened and how to fix it. &nbsp;The Quick scan works by the way. &nbsp;When you click on the X to stop it appears to close but is still running on the task manager. &nbsp;I had to click on end task on task manager to get it to stop. &nbsp;Any suggestions? The
 files it stops running on are so long I have forgotten all the numbers and letters and what the file even is, too long to type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone has the answer.</p>

            <p>My reply tells you that Microsoft wants to know what is happening, too. Hence the request for support logs. If you choose to not send them, don't run a full scan for now. Microsoft will eventually identify the cause and resolve it.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Making sure you&#39;re ready to install&#34; hung for 10&#43; hours</h2>
                    <p>On the most recent TP iso, when executing setup on the Windows 8 host, the wizard gets to the "Making sure you're ready to install" screen and then spins on this ad infinitum. &nbsp;It simply does not ever get past this point. &nbsp;I have attempted this multiple
 times now from this particular test workstation to no avail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a logging option that can be turned on in order to see what is really going on at the point of apparent failure? &nbsp;No command line flags are offering any kind of options for `setup.exe`... Would certainly recommend you guys enable higher verbosity
 for this since setup problems are a pretty common issue I hear about!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that the computer is updated and disconnect any external devices before installation/upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the methods below and check if it works.</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><strong><span>:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Uninstall
</span><span>security software and then try to upgrade. Check if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
On the search field, type command prompt.&nbsp;Right click on command prompt and run as administrator.<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: <strong>chkdsk /r /f</strong><br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.

            <p>I appreciate your reply. &nbsp;I am certainly disappointed that there simply is not more clarity with regards to a verbose log output to a console to review everything that is going on at the point of failure. &nbsp;Hopefully you will see that these are the kinds
 of problems (not giving clear and verbose feedback to users when they need to understand precisely what is going on) that cause a lot of headaches for MS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be wise and a big self-help move if MS would simply give logging switches on everything that they do with varying levels of verbosity. &nbsp;Wouldn't it be nice to run `setup.exe /log output.log /vvv` to output level 3 verbosity to a file in the current
 working directory names "output.log"? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the kind of stuff that makes so many Unix tools and utilities ultimately more user friendly than what so many others (such as MS) do at the moment, BECAUSE they actually give actionable output that will help resolve issues. &nbsp;Please definitely put
 this into the setup app and anything else that you can because it really helps.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Office 365 Excel - Add comment to cell</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>In office 365 excel to add a new note I "right click" then select "new comment" or under the review tab select "insert comment". This is how I add a new (yellow) note to any given cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there is no option for adding a "comment box" for myself and other users to add multiple comments to a cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to follow the instructions at https://support.office.com/en-us/article/threaded-comments-and-notes-75a51eec-4092-42ab-abf8-7669077b7be3</p>
<p>for adding notes and comments but as stated above, I can only add a note by selecting either "new comment" or "insert comment". There is no way that I know how to add a comment. This seems very strange. Any help is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>David.</p>

    <title>Direct Push offline re-send algorithm - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Direct Push offline re-send algorithm</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider Outlook running on a Windows Mobile device (6 or 6.1), configured to use Exchange (2003) ActiveSync (Direct Push).<br />
<br />
A number of emails build up in the "outbox" of the device while there is no mobile data signal. When the device comes back into the range of a mobile data signal, how are the emails in the Outbox processed?<br />
<br />
It seems that they are not processed in submission order, and I wonder if there is a similar mechanism to "full" Outlook on a slow connection - where larger items are sent last etc.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Many thanks for your reply Linley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I actually want to understand is how Outlook mobile processes items in the outbox, once a mobile data signal has been re-established.&nbsp; It seems that they are not processed in submission order.&nbsp; I need to know if there is any calculated
 algorithm in the way that they are sent.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not after configuration options, I just want ot understand how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apologies if I didn't make it clear what I was after first time round.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for any further input.</p>

Kind regards.

            the only possible fixes are a *¤7370¤ reset, or a firmware reinstallation using the computer. whatever you do, you'll probably keep facing isues with your device. new issues will pop up a few days after reset, and you'd need to reset again. and the cycle
 would keep repeatin. the N97 and the N97 mini, both suck big time. i'm so **bleep** off with my N97 32GB. i think nokia should apolgise to everyone they sold an N97 varient, and offer a full refund, and recall all N97s, or else they'll risk their reputation.
 I'm looking forward to an android. Nokia can't fool me again.

 Teams is the sole exception.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>We've attempted the following solutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using different browsers (Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Google Chrome)</li><li>Clearing browser history, cookies, saved passwords and cache</li><li>Using incognito browser tab</li><li>Uninstalling and re-installing Teams Desktop client</li><li>Resetting the account password</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Details of Error encountered:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Teams Desktop Client: Loads for a couple of seconds then reverts back to the log-in page.</li><li>Teams on Browser: Loads "Checking your credentials" then reverts to log-in page displaying: "We couldn't sign you in. Please try again."</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The only successful login has been on the Teams Mobile app, and by logging in on a different PC. Solutions are appreciated. We need to have Teams working on the account owner's PC workstation ASAP. We have already reached out multiple times to Office Support
 &amp; contacted an agent but received no answers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Kyla,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the updated information. Since you can login to Microsoft Teams in a different pc, the issue is related to the specific pc. Following are my suggestions, please take a check and
 let me know the outcome.</p>
<p>1. Check whether the network environment between two pcs is different, try to change another network for test.</p>
<p>2. To avoid the interference of other programs, please force quit other programs except Microsoft Teams, then see whether the issue disappears.</p>
<p>3. Please verify that the necessary URLs, IP addresses and ports are opened in your firewall or proxy. Reference:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252fOffice-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 URLs and IP Address</a>.</p>
<p><span>4. If the issue persists, I recommend you to
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>perform a clean boot</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, please offer me the related
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/log-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooting logs</a>&nbsp;in private message for further analysis.</p>
<p>1. In Teams client, press "<span style="font-weight: bold">Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1</span>" to get debug log.</p>
<p>2. Paste "<span style="font-weight: bold">%appdata%\Microsoft\Teams\logs.txt</span>" in File Explorer to get the desktop log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, may I know whether you have proxy in the problematic pc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

    <title>Lync for Mac calls fail when connected to VPN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lync for Mac calls fail when connected to VPN</h2>
                    <p>I've seen this question answered before in regards to self-hosted Lync, but we're using 365 servers. The scenario is as follows.</p>
<p>1) User A on Lync for Mac is connected to some internal resources over VPN using VPN Tracker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) User B is either on Windows or Mac, internal network or external network; either still has this issue.</p>
<p>3) User A sends a call to User B, and User B is unable to answer the call. Likewise, if User B calls User A, User A cannot answer the call either.</p>
<p>4) Disconnecting from the VPN immediately resolves the issue.</p>
<p>We've reproduced this issue on a Mac separate from the device that the original issue-reporter in our company has.</p>
<p>I've turned on logging, and I can see that it sees both interfaces, the virtual VPN interface and the wifi interface. If User B is on the internal network, I can see that a peer-to-peer connection attempts to be established from User A's machine to User
 B's, however for security we do not allow data to transfer across.</p>
<p>We're unsure if this is an issue in Lync, Mac OS, VPN Tracker, or the VPN configuration. Any assistance I can get troubleshooting this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

Create a new standard module. and add the code for the subroutine, CloseAllExcept, into it.&nbsp; Save that module and call it "modCloseAll".&nbsp; That's an arbitrary name; it could be named anything except the same name as any other object or any procedure it contains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the module for the form, where you created the event procedure shell, change that procedure to read as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'----- start of code -----</p>
<div>Private Sub Command2_Click() </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CloseAllExcept acForm, "Switchboard"<br />
<div>End Sub</div>
<div>'----- end of code -----</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But replace (if necessary) "Switchboard" with the name (in quotes) of the form you want to leave open.</div>

            The new version doesn't offer the option to adjust webcam settings. However, if you want this settings, then you can install Skype Classic.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />However, users have reported that this Classic version doesn't stay very long and gets replaced by new Skype.

<p>So Skype is taking away useful controls. Do Microsoft really want to stop people using Skye? In its latest iteration Skype has become ridiculously tortuous. Why are they turning out such an obviously bad product ? there was not much wrong with the previous
 version. It is very arrogant of them not to allow you to reinstall a previous version!!</p>

            You can install previous version but any Windows update may turn this into new version. Hence, you will have to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Go ahead and use Classic Skype.

<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. Very glad to reply to your case here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better help you, I'd like to confirm what notification about "verifying your account" you received. It would be better if you can upload a screenshot about it for checking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Supposing you are receiving the emails about "verifying your account", then it should be a phishing email only if you have confirmed your account/service&nbsp;has no problem. About the phishing email, you can try blocking the sender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

</p><p><span>As for my understanding, I can think over one scenario, that is you are adding the hotmail account as your Office 365 connected account. For more information, you can refer to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connect-email-accounts-in-outlook-on-the-web-office-365-d7012ff0-924f-4f78-8aca-c3912d886c4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connect-email-accounts-in-outlook-on-the-web-office-365-d7012ff0-924f-4f78-8aca-c3912d886c4d</a>.
 If it is the scenario, the notification message is about the credential of hotmail account. You can try signing into Hotmail account side to check the settings.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook on Windows 10 Creates Account</h2>
                    <p>Outlook creates an account on my Lumina 925 that starts with $$VVM*98 and continues for a very long string. It defaults to this account and although I have another account, I can't get it to switch from this one. In the past I was able to delete this phantom
 account but now I can't find a way to delete it. The notifications come in for my other account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My outlook account is a Office365 Small Business Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions: live tile for Outlook, spell check and ability to search email not just contacts when typing an address in the To and cc fields.</p>

<h2>            Windows July Updates - Hanging   - Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB3172985&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can you not give us the option to download individual fixes / updates</p>
<p>The above update is hanging and therefore stopping the other downloaded updates from installing</p>
<p>If you reset the system up on restart it will download ALL the updates again and hang on the update for KB3172985</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot even reject the update to enable rest to install</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insiders have been asking for near on 12 months for you to sort this out. This request via feedback is ignored</p>
<p>
</p><p>So come on guys. Sort this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope i am not alone with the July update issues</p>

            <p>A lot were commenting on how slow the July Updates installed today, so saying that it is "hanging" could just be that&nbsp;July's updates&nbsp;take an extremely long time to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.Net Framework updates have always taken an extremely long time to install, so reports of the delays today prompted me to check to see&nbsp;if .Net was involved, and it is.&nbsp; In fact, the .Net portion is only a part of what is in the Cumulative Update.</p>

            Hello William,<br />
<br />
<br />
Keys such as the tab key may not be available on iOS. However, you can just tap on the cell or column that you want to select. Also, you may contact Apple to check if there is an alternative or substitute for the tab key.<br />
<br />
Feel free to reach out if you require further assistance.

</p><p>I have a Windows 8.1 installed on one partition and Windows 10 Preview Build 10130 installed on another partition. I understand the install of final Windows 10 will replace my Windows 8.1 and I will basically exchange my 8.1 for the 10 registration. Where
 will the auto update install - which partition in other words? Should I go to the Win 8.1 partition and make sure I have it registered for the Win 10 upgrade for July 29?

<p>If you are signed in with your Microsoft account to the latest test build and it is the same as account that you used to register for the insider program, you will be updated to the final release with working genuine key no watermark on desktop and you can
 use it to reinstall from your gamma (final release) media. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion: in this scenario you can keep your dual boot configuration!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An account can only have one profile name. If you want you can create an email address alias
</p>
<p>that can be used as sending address instead of her orginal email address. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the steps on how to create an alias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Access your account from this
</span><a href="http://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>link</span></b></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the
<strong><span>Notifications</span></strong> link at the left side of the page, and click
<strong><span>Manage email preferences.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;Under
<strong><span>Other email addresses</span></strong>,&nbsp;click
<strong><span>Add an email addresses</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. You can choose your preferred setting either&nbsp;of the two options below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Create a new Microsoft account to add to your account</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Add your own email address&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click
<strong><span>Add</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For more information about alias, please refer to the links below.</span></p>

<p>Any progress on this topic? I have several Alias but can use just one name.</p>
<p>But, it would be great to send out e-mails in my name and also in the name of my family with separate alias. Otherwise, I have to creat a new account.</p>
        </p>

    <title>Can&#39;t see sent items on Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yrg00  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t see sent items on Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've recently added 2 new IMAP email accounts to my Outlook.</p>
<p>All the correct boxes are ticked to request the sent items to be shown, however there is no sent items for either of these accounts, and as soon as it leaves the outbox it's gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to log in to webmail in order to see the sent items which are for my business and it's highly inconvenient.</p>
<p>Sent items work fine for my POP account, but not for these IMAP ones. I feel like it may be something to do with icloud, but I'm not sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There seemed to be a number of people having this issue with Outlook 2010, but those solutions don't work with this version.</p>
<p>Any help greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>
</p><div>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's check if "Do not save copies of sent items" is unchecked in the Account properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Click on the IMAP account and select change. Go to More settings and click Advanced tab. Check if Do not save copies of sent items is unchecked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also remove and re-add the email account and check if&nbsp;it helps.</p>

<p>I am unable to open my freeslots.com.&nbsp; I can get the homepage put as soon as I click on a particular game, IE 8 stops working.&nbsp; The message is:&nbsp; IE has stopped working.&nbsp; A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close the program
 and notify you if a solution is available.&nbsp; I close the program and then a window pops up stating that DEP has shut down the program.&nbsp; What do I do to bypass this problem as my program is internet based.&nbsp; The info that is given to change the DEP settings does
 not work for this.&nbsp; I have tried resetting IE 8 settings and it does not work.&nbsp; I would appreciate any help with this problem.</p>

            Ok...<br />
Basically this issue could be because of any of the Addons...<br />
When Typing Internet explorer on the start search ... You would have noticed an option Internet explorer (no Addons).<br />
Try to open the website in No addons and Check whether it works for you. <br />
i believe it should be an Addon. If it works. <br />
<br />
We need to navigate into the Tools&nbsp; and Manage Addons on the internet explorer and We need to disable the addon which is causing the issue.<br />
<br />
We need to enable and disable the addon one by one to check this.<br />
<br />
If these steps does not work.<br />
Click on Start on Start Search, Type Problem. It will bring up Problem reports and solutions.<br />
<br />
On the Left hand side you will have View Problem History, Click on that Scroll down for Internet explorer Category and Select the Recent one (you will have the Date Column which will help you identify, Today's Date and recent time). Open it and Copy that information
 and paste it here. It will be helpful for us to Identify the faulty module name.<br />
<br />
And we can find out the root cause of this issue.<br />

<p>View the TIF (Temporary Internet Files), there is a column for it. In case <br />

<p>Ok. how can I view the expiration date of cookie?</p>

Where is the expiration date?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Cookies\index.dat&nbsp; but it is binary in there so there isn't something you could read.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. Run...&nbsp; shell:Cookies&nbsp; to find the path and then open its index.dat in Notepad and you can see what I mean.</p>
<p>There may be an API to access it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In which case you could perhaps execute a script which displayed it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps then even via PowerShell...&nbsp;&nbsp; Must check.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>When the OS is XP you can use the TIF Viewer&nbsp; (e.g. from IE, press Alt-T,O,Alt-S,V) to see both TIF and Cookie data extracted and displayed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't remember if XP has a separate&nbsp; desktop.ini&nbsp; file for Cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it does you
 might even be able to see it displayed as a special folder even with the above&nbsp; shell:Cookies&nbsp; command.</p>
<p>Hmm...&nbsp; I'm so used to seeing nothing useful in W7's TIF Viewer that I just surprised myself and noted that some Cookies are still being displayed that way in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knew?&nbsp;&nbsp; So, even if you don't have it in Details view, with
 the Expires column enabled you can at least right-click Properties on Cookies there and see Expires:&nbsp; that way.</p>

            What country are you in?&nbsp; Are you able to stream it?&nbsp; Try going in and restoring your purchases within the settings menu of the app and try downloading it again as well.

            This is odd.&nbsp; It seems like it's behaving like it's a rental, but we didn't offer this as a rental in the UK.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I'd ask that you contact customer service directly to see if they can get it sorted for you since they'll be able to take a look
 at your account.&nbsp; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-GB/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-GB/contactus/</a>
