    <title>Custom search field on pivot table - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Custom search field on pivot table</h2>
                    <p>Hi I wonder if someone can help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running analysis on enquiry levels with a view of comparing results both yoy and ytd. The master spreadsheet contains all enquiries from 2012 to 2014 by day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I've created my pivot table and first off would like to run an annual count so I drop my date of enquiry field into the report filter and it gives me the dropdown box. Problem is that it gives me the option of&nbsp;filtering dates individually i.e 1/1/2012,
 02/01/2012 etc. Is there any way to search on the year only. I appreciate that it gives me a checkbox to select multiple dates but I'm not prepared to go through and highlight them one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, dependant on what's needed to make the above&nbsp;happen can it also be turned off again so I can run the YTD analysis using months and years?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution I can think of is to manually edit the data prior to putting it into&nbsp;the pivot but that seems a bit counterintuitive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>

            <p>The reason its not showing or greyed out is your date filed is in report filter. I will suggest first you take your date field either row or column field, right click on any date in pivot table, you will find the group field active, Just click it and select
 year and month both. Now you will see report converted in to year and month field. Now take your this year and date field to Report area. &nbsp;Now you should be able to see month and year in drop downs at report filter.</p>
<p>These sequential screen shots will help you out to understand it better.</p>
<p>Assume first you make your pivot table on dummy data like this, and date field is in column area, showing all individual dates, Now click on any date and now click group and choose month/year</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now you will see your report like this, also in column labels you will find year and date field.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now drag your year and date field to report area, and you will be able to see the year and month in drop down.</p>

<h2>            Rule to delete messages based on age</h2>
                    I want to delete files from my Delete folder based on their age. For example, delete (not archive) anything 6 months or older. What is the process for doing that? I tried to use the clean up option, but it seems that will archive rather than permanently
 delete.<br />
Thanks!<br />

            not realy, u should be asking a pro. But i preffer to break up the movie into 3parts to ensure that the N97 deosn't get stuck. When choosing a movie always check the ratio cuz larger screen ratio will not work in N97(not sure of exact figures) but if i
 was u i won't waste time watching a movie on a phone unless i'm on da move. :D

            The N97 should play MP4-H.264 and MP4-VSP files.

<p>Ok. Then as long as it has a supported codec (h.264) and is within the screens resolution (640x360) the movie should play no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this correct</p>

<p>Don't know why anyone says it will as H.264 is NOT supported!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technically the phone can do it, but REAL Player can't. &nbsp;I think they were too cheap to pay the licencing fees for H.264.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to think that a .mp4 extension is the same as H.264, however it is not. There is also a lot of verbiage on the Net that says that the N97 plays h.264&nbsp;natively, all of which is a lie. &nbsp; You can purchase Core Player that might do it -
 however I think it is silly to pay for an app that the phone should be able to do on its own. &nbsp;That is the same as paying for a Dialer that you need to dial long distance numbers. &nbsp;It doesn't make any sense at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its sad that this is the case, and I hope it is rectified, but I doubt it will be. &nbsp;There are some guys working on porting VLC to&nbsp;Symbian&nbsp;that should fix everything, as it plays every codec under the sun - this might take some time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know why Nokia put Real Player on its phone - it is the worst player ever in&nbsp;existence, which means that your cool phone really can't play anything cool unless you have a lot of videos from 1998.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The n900 based on Linux has none of these issues as there are so many playback options for linux, FFPLAY, VLC, Mplayer, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fix this NOKIA!&nbsp;</p>

            @rasmus - What are you talking about? I've been using xilisoft to convert videos into an mp4 container with h.264 video and mp3 audio and they all work fine on the s60v5 video player.

<p>Thanks for your input guys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just for your info, the above file (when downloaded) would not play. After an hour or so, I&nbsp;took the plunge and downloaded Mediacoder (freeware) and converted my first film to mp4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Converted file to Mpeg4, 624x352 resolution, 1151 Bitrate, 128kbps mp3 sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire movies plays flawlessly, with no macroblocking or audio/visual sync issues (even when fast forwarded)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turns out i know a thing or two about video and I would testify in a court of law that there is not H.264 support - matter of fact I tried it again last night to 100% CONFIRM that it does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>MPEG-4 is a patented suite of standards which has many "parts", where each part standardizes various entities related to multimedia, such as audio, video, and file formats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#FF0000">H.264</font>/AVC/<font color="#FF0000">MPEG-4 Part 10</font> contains a number of new features that allow it to compress video much more effectively than older standards and to provide more flexibility
 for application to a wide variety of network environments.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So while some Mpeg-4 will play (.mp4) H.264 will NOT play - i.e. Mpeg-4 Part 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that you claim you are converting h.264 with mp3 audio shows you are not too technical on the video front - typically you would do you audio in AAC not mp3 - that is just not cool. &nbsp;So my guess is you are actually converting to plain old Mpeg-4
 which works on your phone, and that is indeed cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AAC = advanced audio codec (this is supported on the n97)</p>
<p>AVC = Advanced video codec =&nbsp;usually&nbsp;refers to h.264&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ross Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We appreciate it that you post your inquiry here in the Microsoft Community forum.&nbsp;<font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I’m here to help you with your concern regarding the adding of Outlook.com contact through the native
 Android "contacts" interface/app.</span></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to gather additional information for us to determine the cause of the issue. Can you please confirm if your account contacts synchronized successfully&nbsp;using your device's Outlook.com application? It is possible that they are not properly synchronized
 that's why your phone cannot detect if contacts that you're about to add can be created&nbsp;for Outlook.com. You can try reinstall the application for us to make sure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, they sync fine.&nbsp; I'm simply unable to add them from my phone.&nbsp; If I add them through the web at
<a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a> they add fine and also sync down to my phone just fine.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the latest version of the Outlook.com app for Android.&nbsp; All contacts sync just fine, I just cant add a new one from the phone.&nbsp; Get a phone and try it yourself and you'll see the issue on the native Contact app for Android.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for providing additional information. I apologize of the delayed response though.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before&nbsp;we proceed on our next action on the issue, can you please provide the exact steps on how you try to add contacts using the&nbsp;native Contact app for Android? Also, have you already tried reinstalling the Outlook.com app? It's possible that there are
 some application components that are contributing to the issue.</p>

            Every Android OS has a native "Contacts" application. &nbsp;Go to the Apps menu from the main screen of an Android phone. &nbsp;This will list all programs installed on your phone. &nbsp;In this list is one called "Contacts". &nbsp;This is the native Android contact manager
 program. &nbsp;Go into this "Contacts" application and it will list all your saved contacts. &nbsp;On the Galaxy S4 and S3 you can save contacts to different accounts like gmail, samsung account or the device itself. &nbsp;When adding a new contact I can choose which of
 these accounts to save the contact too. &nbsp;It is here, where there should be an option to save a new contact to my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account but this option does not exist. &nbsp;For this reason the Outlook.com Android application is lacking on basic functionality.
 &nbsp;To be a full featured app you should be able to do all things a user could do in the web such as email, people, calendar and skydrive. &nbsp;All of these are wor

<div>I don't understand what you mean or where to perform this action in the Outlook.com app. &nbsp;Yes, of course I've enabled sync'ing in the Outlook.com app for both contacts and calendar. &nbsp;I can also add contacts just fine in the web, just not in the Outlook.com

            OMG. &nbsp;Yes, I've installed the Outlook.com app from Google Play. &nbsp;I've setup my account and can successfully sync email, calendaring and contacts. &nbsp;There is no way that I know of to add contacts to my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account via the Outlook.com
 app. &nbsp;Nor is there (my main question) a way to add a NEW contact to my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account using the native "Contacts" app which is part of the Android OS. &nbsp;There is no way to add a new contact using Outlook.com Android app nor the native "Contacts"
 app. &nbsp;It's all in the thread above and I wish people would just read the thread and submit a support ticket to make the Outlook.com android app fully featured.

<h2>            Attachments are not showing up in my email</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I ordered some etickets earlier in the week and I received a confirmation email with the attachment paperclip icon on it. I saw this and waited till today to open and print the tickets even though the event is tomorrow, this has turned out to be a bad move
 as the attachments aren't showing up in the email. Thus meaning I can't access the etickets which a bit of a panic now. How casn I gain access to them to print them off?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10.10122&#58;  Some Issues</h2>
                    <p>So I got hold of 10122 earlier today, and as expected Microsoft has made a lot of nice aesthetic changes to the OS from the last build.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some gremlins seem to have hitched a ride.&nbsp; Anyone else experiencing any of the following?&nbsp; (This is on
 my Surface Pro 3.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start menu:</strong>&nbsp; in fullscreen mode, it presents all of my groups of tiles in a single column (they're still grouped as they should be, but the groups are presented one right after the other).&nbsp; If I deactivate fullscreen mode, the groups are
 arranged side by side like they should be.</li><li><strong>Start menu:</strong>&nbsp; it won't pin the Windows Feedback app to the Start menu, and it took multiple tries to get Search/Cortana pinned there.</li><li><strong>Store Beta:</strong>&nbsp; will not open.&nbsp; The splash screen appears, then disappears just as quickly.</li><li><strong>OneNote Preview:</strong>&nbsp; also will not open.&nbsp; It appears, gives me the "Welcome to OneNote preview build" message, and when I click "OK," it disappears.</li><li><strong>Windows Feedback:</strong>&nbsp; once the app is open, if I try to enter feedback using the on-screen keyboard, it takes multiple tries to get the keyboard to appear.</li><li><strong>Orphan app in "All Apps" list:</strong>&nbsp; for the last two builds in a row, there's been what looks to be an orphan entry in the Start menu's "All Apps" list:&nbsp; @{Microsoft.BingTravel_3.0 etc., that I can't seem to get rid of.&nbsp; (EDIT:&nbsp; it's happening
 with a different app on another computer, see screencap below.)<br />
</li></ul>
<p>Also, just a general observation about Project Spartan.&nbsp; I really want to use it to add markup to PDFs, but it doesn't seem quite capable of handling them properly just yet.&nbsp; If I activate the stylus input function, it will only edit what's on screen; I
 can't scroll farther up or down into the document.&nbsp; Is this how it's intended to work, or is scrolling simply something that's not perfected yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I will note that I really like the new quirk to the Feedback app, which offers to let us recreate the problem while it watches, so it can send precise telemetry to Microsoft to help solve the problem.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since posting I have found that (apparently) they have removed the previous Expand/Collapse button and instead added an (unsearchable) option in Personalization Start.&nbsp; So, if you wanted you could have your Start Menu Fullscreen but not have to have everything
 else Fullscreen (as implied by using Tablet mode).</p>

<p>Like Roy has replied, the 1320 is among the phones that are excluded from getting the Windos 10 mobile upgrade.</p>
<p>It has been excluded allready since the first official release back in 2015, the 1320 does not have the minimum needed specs to run windows 10 mobile.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I was trying to work on the MS Agent, and encounter the problem when VBA is trying to parse the text in power point's slid notes region.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is trying to find line feed, and the original code use Chr(10) as follow...</strong></p>
<p><strong>iEOL = InStr(iCurrentPos, strScript, Chr(10)) - iCurrentPos + 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>It doesn't seem working, and when I try to debug the string,&nbsp;strScript, and copy paste to Ultraedit, it does show new line, but with "0x0D 0x0A" with the binary view.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I tried&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>VbCrLf &amp; VbCrLf, and Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10), but can't work neither.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>iEOL = InStr(iCurrentPos, strScript,&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10))</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;- iCurrentPos + 1</strong></span></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It appears that you are using a sample project that was designed to run on PPT 2000.</p>
<p>You will have to replace all chr(10) with chr(13) if you are using this code in PPT 2007. Also, you when ^*#{}#*^", is removed what is the 1st character in strScript. My guess is that it will chr(13) which will mess up the parsing the way it is, so remove
 that 1st chr(13) before this routine is called.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Windows Defender should be turned off, or uninstalled if using Windows XP and could be causing the update issue. See this post -

            <p>Hi Delyan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using MSE, if you have XP, Windows defender must be uninstalled. If you have Vista or W7, it&nbsp;must be disabled (not just off) as it cannot be uninstalled. Here's more information about that:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/windows-defender-and-microsoft-security-essentials/5309cb8d-02e1-40e8-974f-0dcedb9ab9fd">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/windows-defender-and-microsoft-security-essentials/5309cb8d-02e1-40e8-974f-0dcedb9ab9fd</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you currently have both running or both enabled (or in XP, if Defender is still installed), that could easily be the reason you're having troubles with the system and with MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that's the case and the above resolves the problem, all is well. If after uninstalling or disabling Defender as the case may be you still have troubles with MSE&nbsp;or freezing or that error&nbsp;(and I assume it doesn't start about 10 minutes later on its own
 - that would be the service set to Automatic (delayed) insead of Automatic - and that it starts when you open MSE and click on Start and everything goes green and you are protected and it's updating fine and running scheduled scans and manual scans fine -
 in effect, everything else is working), then we need to get to the bottom of the problem. It could be a number of things. This may seem long, but most probably won't be needed and many are quick and I just want you to have everything you need to resolve the
 problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that Windows Defender is uninstalled (if XP), or Disabled (if Vista/W7).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE).</span></strong><strong><span>Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are using version 2.0.657.0 or 2.1.1116.0 of MSE.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>. If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once done be sure to
 reset Vista back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
 and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full Safety Scan from Microsoft:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx</span></a>. These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair
 any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first
 or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>***************************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When that is done if you still have a problem, it may be your installation of MSE or perhaps due to what was required to clean any malware, so there is a chance MSE may be corrupt or non-functional.<span>
</span>If so, proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on languages and locales at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the
 desktop (rather than running it). When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; If the issue with wanting to use Defender concerns&nbsp;controlling Start-up programs, see the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can't run MSE and Defender at the same time or it will cause conflicts, crashes, freezes, and all sorts of problems, and there's no need to use Defender for Protection since MSE completely covers that and many options for startup-program control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are at least three ways to manage start-up programs (possibly more, but these are enough). I use all three depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Run and type msconfig.exe and enter. Go to the Startup Tab and you can check or uncheck the programs you want to run at startup. The two drawbacks are that you get little information about the programs and you
 can't add programs that aren't already there to the listing. Also, items blocked by Defender sometimes do not appear in msconfig as they are stored elsewhere in the registry. And this one is not as easy on the eyes as Defender either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Download the free WinPatrol: <a href="http://www.winpatrol.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.winpatrol.com/download.html</a> and you will not only have control over those programs, but you can also add new ones AND, what I like best, you can allow it to run in the background and it will alert you if anything tries to add itself to the startup
 menu without your knowledge (as sometimes happens with some downloads and installations). You don't have to use that feature if you don't want, but I find it convenient. It also provides more information than msconfig. I find it better than Defender and would
 use for startup-program control it even if it were possible to run Defender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Download the free Autoruns: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>. This is the gold standard for controlling startup programs and everything else at startup with loads of details and options and different views. The danger here is that it is so good and powerful,
 that if you're not careful, you can remove something you really don't want to remove and hose your system (but if you pay attention and show use caution and don't change anything unless you know EXACTLY what you are doing and the ramifications of doing it,
 you'll be fine).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rarely use msconfig. I mostly use WinPatrol. When I'm really into cleaning things up and need to know exactly what is happening a boot and startup, then I go to Autoruns to get all the details I need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will cover managing start-up and boot programs and processes and everything related much better than Defender ever did. And if you choose to run WinPatrol only on-demand and not with real-time scanning, then none of them will take up any resources unless
 you are using them.</p>

<p>This is a 500+ piece mailer and the envelopes only load 7-10 at a time into the Xerox 5325 so the extra blank is extremely painful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop this blank envelope after each printed envelope?</p>

<h2>            No incoming calls on 3G &#40;N95-3&#41;</h2>
                    My phone, N95-3, worked pretty well on the Fido 3G network in Canada. Recently, since dec 24, my phone can no longer receive calls ou SMS over the 3G network ??!! :-(<br />
<br />
I did the new firmware update just before dont know if this is the reason but right now, I found myself with a 500$ phone that do Edge and GSM !!! thanks Nokia :-(<br />
<br />
question, Is there a way to revert to my previous firmware, this way I could test and see if this issue is related to the firmware update !<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Right now, the phone is showing a perfect 3G reception but i can not receive calls or SMS on the network for only certain area of Montreal. Fido confirmed me that there 3G network is working perfectly in this area.<br />
<br />
If I received a call while i am surfing or downloading a podcast from the 3.5G network, the call will be receive correctly without any problem !!??!!!<br />
<br />
Why ???<br />
Can anyone make some sense of this mess ???<br />

            It seems it is a bug with the phone.<br />
<br />
I have dont a lot of investigation with this issue as my N95-3 is suffering from the same.<br />
<br />
This happens every time you do some use of the 3G data access, for example Maps, VoIP, or just Web Browsing.<br />
<br />
After some time using 3g data, the phone is unable to receive calls or SMSs, a reboot or change to 2g (GSM) is the only way to get it working again. I think it is possible when you switch to 2g cause the phone re-registers itself to the MSC serving your BTS/BCSs.<br />
<br />
Today I rebooted my phone 4 times cause of the same issue!!!

            Dear friend,<br />
sometimes after data transfer or FW upgrade this problems shows up some of our collies saying in order to fix it one is rebooting the phone and the best way is to hard resetting or reformatting before you do that make sure to have back up to your data then
 do it and hopefully will be okay enter this *#7370# let us know how goes , sincerely R

<h2>            The data source contains no visible tables</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm getting a message box with this message:</p>
<p>The data source contains no visible tables</p>
<p>When trying to import data from an Access 2010 database.</p>
<p>The database contains a query and several linked tables to another, back-end, database.</p>
<p>I have done this once before on another machine and I have compared visually the databases but I can't see any difference.</p>
<p>In Excel I'm clicking on "Data" and then the first option in the ribbon, Get External Data From Access".&nbsp; Then I am presented with a File Open dialog where I select the .accdb file.&nbsp; I press Open and then I get the message box.</p>
<p>Both the spread sheet and the .sccdb file are in a folder on my desktop.&nbsp; The log in I'm using is a member of the domain administrators group.&nbsp; I am the creator of both files.&nbsp; So I don't think it's a permissions issue, but I'm new to both Windows 7 and
 Office 2010 so I'm not sure.</p>
<p>In Access 2010 I can open the tables and run the query without any errors so I think the linked tables are working OK.</p>
<p>Gary</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I found the problem.</p>
<p>In my query i was using a string function to make a computed field. Apparently Excel doesn't like string functions in querydefs so it wasn't showing that query. Also, apparently Excel doesn't like linked tables since it wasn't showing those either. So after
 not showing the linked tables and the query there weren't any objects for Excel to show in the selection list, hence the accurate but obscure message.</p>
<p>My work around is to create a temporary table in the front end database with the computed field in it that is populated by another query that the user has to run before importing the data to Excel. And then do a join on the temporary table to put in that
 field. Not a nice solutions but it works.</p>

                    <p><em>Original Title: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, Microsoft blocked me out from my own account. They said that someone was using my account, although I highly doubt this. Then they told me to fill out a form so they can validate my identity. I filled in as much information as I could remember,
 but I was still denied access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another strange thing I encountered was this: it told me to complete "<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***".</span></p>
<p><span>I don't know that email. Why would it tell me to write down the rest of an email that I don't even know?</span></p>
<p>I'm starting to think that Microsoft is purposely locking me out of my account.</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 - getting 1004 error on vba macro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david craft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 - getting 1004 error on vba macro</h2>
                    <p>Below is a macro that our company has been using for a long time, initially developed with Excel 2010 and it also works in Excel 2013, but since we installed Excel 2016 we are now getting a runtime 1004 error.&nbsp; Interestingly if you "step into" the macro,
 executing one line at a time it works but if you just run it, it issues the 1004 error.&nbsp; I know very little about excel so could really use some detailed help.</p>
<p>There are additional modules executed before this one including a button -</p>

<br />
</p>
<p>"Range("C2")" refers to the ActiveSheet not necessarily to the myTS sheet.<br />
All range callouts should have the appropriate sheet specified; so the offending line of code should read...<br />
<br />
Set myCopyRange = myTS.Range(myTS.Range("C2"), myTS.Range("C2").Offset(mycount, 0))<br />
<br />
All other similar code lines should be changed to reflect the correct sheet.<br />

            <p>I'll answer as best as I can:</p>
<ol>
<li>This document is the only one where this has occurred. I'm concerned it could reoccur and I'd like to know what causes it. It's a customer-facing document. All images were fine in the file until, to make it part of a larger whole, I selected all its content
 and pasted it into another document. (Originally, I had to break apart the larger document into separate files for editing/collaboration. I then needed to reassemble into the larger, single file.)
</li><li>The image was inserted in one of 2 ways: <br />
<br />
Insert&gt; Picture&gt; from file with no linking&nbsp; <br />
<strong>OR<br />
</strong>using a macro that prompts the user to browse to the image. If you need to see the VBA, I will dig that up.<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;If is was inserted using the macro, there have been issues sometimes with a
<em>different</em> error message appearing that states "The linked image cannot be displayed. The file may have been&nbsp; moved, renamed&nbsp;or deleted." This error occurs when the file is saved as a .docx, but not as a .doc
</li><li>It's either a .png or a .jpg. </li><li>Images are stored on a network file share.</li></ol>
<p>Follow-up question:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have images that are inserted with linking turned on, HOW do you determine the exact file path and file name for that link? I have looked under Prepare&gt; Edit Links to files. However,&nbsp;no matter what graphic I have selected in the file, the Links dialog
 always displays the same. So selecting a graphic before opening the Links dialog makes no difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Any ideas on this?</p>
