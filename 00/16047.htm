<p>Hello Karon, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We would just like to confirm, do you still have an installer of your Office 2013 suite? Also, is the license for your Office suite a 1 per computer type?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is yes for both, you can directly uninstall the Office suite on the old laptop and install it on the new device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case that the old computer is no longer working. You can activate the Office suite on the new computer through the phone activation option. If you use this feature, wait until you are given an option to communicate with a live representative for assistance
 with the activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reply on this thread.</p>

                    I am uploading music ripped from a CD to One Drive Music folder.&nbsp; Music shows up on my Windows 8.1 phone (Nokia) in the Music app.&nbsp; It is properly categorized by artist and album (from metadata) but the album artwork does not show up.&nbsp; After thirty minutes
 or so, artwork does show up but it is not the correct album artwork - not even close.

            <p>Howdy BobMooney, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Support forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not unheard of to have difficulties with album art for music that is not obtained through our system. But it's definitely odd for completely unrelated album art appear for music that is missing album art.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the album art appear correctly on your PC?&nbsp;Does it appear correctly from music.xbox.com? What software did you use to rip the music?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As always if you have any additional questions or concerns, please feel free to reply to this post and we'll be happy to assist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, <br />

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that this is not the wrong place to post this but after deleting tempory internet file and clearing my history in IE on my windows mobile 5 MIO A701 IE has died. It just hangs and I have to kill it from task
 manager. The same thing is also happening with Opera with the only difference being that I cannot even kill it from task manager and have to do a soft reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea what could be going on and any idea one how to fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hello SandyBarkow
<br />
<br />Do you not receive mails from any specific user or anyone in general?
<br />
<br />Make sure to check:
<br />
<br />Check your Junk Email folder. In your Outlook.com folder list, choose the Junk Email folder and look for the missing email.
<br />
<br />Clean out your inbox. If your inbox is full, you won't receive new messages. To make room in your inbox, try emptying your junk folder by right-clicking Junk Email &gt; Delete all.
<br />
<br />You can also sweep unwanted email from your inbox or archive folders. Sweep lets you automatically delete all incoming email from a particular sender, keep only the latest message from that sender, or delete email from that sender that's older than 10 days. Select a message you want to sweep, and select Sweep.
<br />
<br />Check your inbox filter and sort settings. If your inbox is filtering based on categories or if your sort order is different than usual, you might not see the messages you expect to see. Filtering and sorting are accessible at the top of your message list.
<br />
<br />For filtering, select Filter &gt; All.
<br />
<br />For sorting, select Filter &gt; Sort by.
<br />
<br />To check for recent messages, choose Date. To look for messages from a specific person, choose From. You can reverse the order by choosing the option again.
<br />
<br />Check the Other tab
<br />
<br />Focused Inbox separates your inbox into two tabs, Focused and Other, to help you focus on the messages that matter most to you. If Focused Inbox is enabled for you, some messages sent to you might be in the Other tab. You can right-click any messages you want to appear in Focused and select Move to Focused inbox or Always move to Focused inbox. Focused Inbox will learn which messages should go always go to the Focused tab.
<br />
<br />To learn how to turn off Focused Inbox, see Turn off Focused Inbox.
<br />
<br />
<br />Check your Blocked senders and Safe senders lists
<br />
<br />Select Settings  Settings &gt; Options.
<br />On the left side of the screen, select Blocked senders.
<br />If you see the sender's address listed under Blocked senders, select their address and then select Remove  Remove &gt; Save.
<br />
<br />If the sender's address isn't in your Blocked senders list, you can add them to your Safe senders list. Email from contacts in your Safe senders list will never go to the Junk Email folder.
<br />
<br />Select Settings  Settings &gt; Options.
<br />
<br />On the left side of the screen, select Safe senders.
<br />
<br />Enter the sender's email address and then select Remove  The Add icon &gt; Save.
<br />
<br />To return to your inbox, select Options at the top of the screen.
<br />
<br />Check your junk email settings
<br />
<br />Select Settings  Settings &gt; Options.
<br />
<br />On the left side of the screen, select Filters and reporting.
<br />
<br />Under Choose a junk email filter, choose the level of protection you want and then select Save.
<br />
<br />With Standard, some junk email might make it to your inbox. You'll need to manually mark those messages as junk.
<br />
<br />With Exclusive, some legitimate mail will end up in your Junk folder. You'll need to check the folder periodically.
<br />
<br />To return to your inbox, select Options at the top of the screen.
<br />
<br />Check your email rules
<br />
<br />Check email forwarding
<br />
<br />Check if email forwarding is turned on.
<br />
<br />Go to Forwarding settings.
<br />
<br />Select Stop forwarding.
<br />
<br />If you want email forwarding to remain on, make sure to check the box for Keep a copy of forwarded messages.
<br />
<br />Let me know how it goes. I hope this help you.
<br />
<br />Regards

<h2>            MS ClickToRun is eating my free space.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I'm on Windows 10 build 10532 and Microsoft Office 2016 preview and I'm slowly running out of space on my C: drive.</p>
<p>The issue seems related to ClickToRun, there is over 6GB of files in&nbsp; C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\ClickToRun, files like: 26BC8375-8C8C-4317-95EC-1F79DA9C8BDC.stream.x86.x-none.dat</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk Cleanup didn't do anything and I wonder, are they safe to delete, is there another way to safely delete them?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am currently using IBM Cloud Connections/Verse for my email and I want to migrate/transition to Office 365 business premium as I prefer Outlook. Is there a migration procedure to migrate my email from the IBM Cloud? Has anyone done this successfully before?</p>

<p>Then I'd stick to a manual migration via IMAP or a Connected Account. That is faster than setting up a migration tool ;-)</p>

</p><p>Contacts can be exported to a csv-file which can be imported into Outlook. Note that you may need to map some fields during the import process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Calendar can be exported to an ics-file which you can import into Outlook as well. However, some Calendar entries (especially recurrence patterns) from Notes may not be compatible with Outlook. Worst case scenario; You'll have to export it to a csv-file
 as well.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Education Edition</h2>
                    I am a teacher trying to set up Minecraft Education Edition for a class of 25 4th graders.&nbsp;
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Our district provides Office 365 accounts for teachers, but not students in K-8.&nbsp; I am trying to get Office 365 student accounts for each student, but my students are only 10, so they don't have email accounts. Is there a way for them to get Office 365 accounts
 that they can use for MEE without using the standard process? My IT department doesn't want to get involved and I am running out of ways to make this work. Additionally, when it comes to buying licenses for MEE, my teacher Office 365 account won't let me purchase
 them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What started as an idea that my kids and I were really excited about has turned into a frustrating mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help.</p>

<p>All users of Minecraft: Education Edition including students will need an Office 365 Education account to play the game.&nbsp;<a href="https://education.minecraft.net/support/knowledge-base/setting-up-office-365-education-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Learn

<p>My Nokia N900 wifi connection shows only "PIN Method" for connecting to my home Wifi. I tried this but it didn't work. I need to connect to my Wifi router using PSK but I don't see the option of changing PIN method to any other option like Manual Setup or
 PSK etc. How do I setup the Wifi on N900 manually so I can enter the Wifi PSK on my N900?</p>

<p>(this might not be the answer)<br />
<br />
i think you better configure your wifi router with your PC.<br />
Then you can get a pin number.<br />
<br />
Coz i dont see anyother options to connect wifi with N900 and even my wifi router is configured via PC and i connect it using wifi pin number.<br />
<br />

<p>thats strange your n900 should give you the option to enter the wifi's key, ok try rebooting both you n900 and your router, than retry it.</p>

            no there is a difference, wifi pin method is where you click taht pin button on the router to configure the device, or by adding manually the device's pin in the pc to add it to the router.

<h2>            Permanently turn off &#39;Comments On Rollover&#39;</h2>
                    <p>This feature is ridiculously annoying, and must be unchecked to turn it off within every document, and every new window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to permanently disable to feature? Otherwise, Microsoft, please fix Word so that unchecking the box permanently disables this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's just an idea.</p>
<p>Here's a vector Dot product of the first row.</p>
<p><br />
Sub Demo()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim Arr As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim FirstRow As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim LoadArray As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arr = [{1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9;10,11,12}]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With WorksheetFunction<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FirstRow = .Index(Arr, 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LoadArray = .SumProduct(FirstRow, Array(3, -1, 1))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />

            You can load a Variant array like this:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim TempArray As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ReDim TempArray(0 To 3, 0 To 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TempArray = [{1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9;10,11,12}]<br />

    <title>Zune HD &#34;Driver is unavailable&#34; on Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaustin7689  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zune HD &#34;Driver is unavailable&#34; on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I've had my Zune HD since they first came out, and was truly shocked when I found out my device is not supported on W10. I mean, a later update could fix that with enough attention from us insiders/users, right? I've tried running the Zune software in
 compatibility mode, but it won't find my device, either. W10 will find it and put it in "other devices", but says the drivers are unavailable and I can't do anything with it at all. Any help, please?<br />

            <p>Hi CLRTech,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been facing the same "Code 31" issue with my Zune HD for the last 6 months (since Windows 10 build 130, to be precise), un-installing and re-installing the Zune software several times to no avail, until I finally got it working again today by following
 those instructions (up to step 8, where I chose to search for the driver online):</p>
<p>http://support.xbox.com/ms-MY/zune-player/software-does-not-detect-device#anchor29</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pretty sure I had tried uninstalling the Zune driver before, so maybe the key was to select the "Delete the driver software for this device" option. Anyway, it is now working like a charm on Windows 10 (version 1511, build 10586), so do not give up!</p>

            <p>I was having the same issue as you guys are talking about&nbsp;but, luckily, I just had to uninstall and reinstall the Zune software from&nbsp;a Zune&nbsp;software package&nbsp;that I had saved to&nbsp;my hard drive from the last time I downloaded it&nbsp;and it now recognizes my Zune
 device again and now I can go back to syncing my music whenever I choose to do so</p>

            Hi Andrey,<br />
<br />
After checking the following article, I’d like to confirm if you’ve added more than 250 domains in your Exchange Online environment recently since you are already in Exchange hybrid.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3001493/total-number-of-explicit-and-implicit-sub-filters-exceeds-maximum-all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3001493/total-number-of-explicit-and-implicit-sub-filters-exceeds-maximum-all</a><br />
If so, please refer to the SOLUTION part to try to get the issue resolved.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Moreover, I’d like to collect the following information for further troubleshooting:<br />
1. You managed to run the Hybrid Configuration Wizard, correct?<br />
2. When did you notice this issue? Did it occur recently?<br />
3. If you change the Guid value to other users, does the issue persist?<br />
4. Does the issue happen to other Exchange On-premises admins when running the same cmdlet in PowerShell?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sam<br />

            Hi Andrey,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting back.<br />
<br />
Based on my test, the cmdlet you used should be wrong as the " is missing in the end. The correct one should be:<br />
<strong>Get-User -Filter "Guid -eq '12345678-1234-abcd-5678-a1b2dc042' -or Guid -eq '87654321-4321-dcba-8765-ffd73f15fab0'"</strong><br />
<br />
Please try again with the cmdlet above and let us know how it works.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sam<br />

<br />
Thanks for posting back and clarifying the situation.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To go on troubleshooting, can you please uplaod a screenshot about the detailed error message for our further check? Moreover, by saying 'This is the only account we can find which has the issue on-prem or O365.', do you mean other admin account has no trouble
 running the cmdlet mentioned above?<br />

<h3> apf22  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I copy and paste a shape that is a text box, the font changes from Calibri to Times New Roman</h2>
                    The default body font for the document is Calibri 11. When I insert a new shape and start typing into it, the font defaults to Calibi 11. However, when I copy and paste the shape, fhe font changes to Times New Roman 11.<br />
<br />
If I change the font back to Calibri 11, and then delete all the text and type in new text, the font changes to Calibri 12. So I have to keep at least one letter of the original text, type in the new text, and then delete the original text.<br />

            <p>This approach does not always work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have followed the same process as in the original post, and I have tried a number of possible fixes, but when I copy and paste a shape or text box, Word 2010 stubbornly refuses to maintain my formatting. After creating a drawing canvas and text box, here
 are the things I have tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just copy &amp; paste: text in pasted shape is Times </li><li>Use a defined style based on Normal: text in pasted shape is Times </li><li>Use a defined style based on "No style": text in pasted shape is Times </li><li>Add style and set as default shape: text in pasted shape is Times</li></ol>
<p>There are two solutions I have found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alter the font (to eg Arial): text in pasted shape remains in chosen font </li><li>Create a style using a different font (eg Arial): text in pasted shape remains in chosen font</li></ol>
<p>These solutions do not work if the font chosen&nbsp;is Calibri which suggests that there is some unintuitive interaction between Word 2010's default settings and the copy &amp; paste functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is something that Microsoft should not have allowed into a release product in the first place, but now that it is there it should be fixed.</p>

Check the document defaults (Styles pane&gt;Manage Styles button&gt;Set Defaults tab). If the font is TNR, change it to whatever you set in&nbsp; normal.&nbsp;

    <title>Sub divide cells without adding columns - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emerogork2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sub divide cells without adding columns</h2>
                    <p>The set up does not lend itself to adding 26 columns for this or to expand a <br />
column for this task.&nbsp; I can merge a row to span 14 columns.&nbsp; The list starts on row<br />
33 just below the freeze set to X33.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a long list of plants sorted alphabetically.&nbsp; I would like to place an index<br />
on which I can click to scroll to that section of the plants.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, along the top of the chart I would like to see the alphabet and be
<br />
able to click on a letter to scroll the chart to plants starting with that letter.&nbsp;
<br />
Click on D and the list scrolls to have Daffodils start at Y33 followed by all the
<br />
rest of the plants.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>one other possibility, no code, works in Excel 2013 and up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Turn your list into a table (Insert Table)</p>
<p>- add a column that has the letter index. You could use a =LEFT(Title,1) for that</p>
<p>- Insert a slicer for the index column</p>
<p>- format the slicer to have 26 columns and make it wide enough to show all the letters.</p>
<p>- position on top of the list.</p>
<p>- regardless of the sort order of the list, one click on the slicer will return all titles that start with that letter. You can also Shift-Click to select contiguous letters or Ctrl-click to select non-contiguous letters.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> manoli337  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display Nvidia</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a problem on my computer [Dell XPS L521X] running Windows 10 Pro [Windows 10 Insider Preview 17728.1000 (rs5_release)].</p>
<p>I used to connect my laptop to an external monitor [Dell S2715H] or two of them : One using the HDMI port and the other using the miniDisplay port.</p>
<p>Now I only connect one monitor via HDMI and it is now using the Intel Graphics 4000 instead of my Nvidia GeForce GT 640m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like my internal display to be displayed using my Nvidia Graphics card. the same when I plug an HDMI cable, I want it to be rendered by Nvidia Graphic card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alongside this issue, my Nvidia Control panel only displays the 3D settings. Back in time it used to show display and video tabs.&nbsp; Maybe it is related ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some screenshots of my problem, if you have any questions don't hesitate!</p>

<p>It said it will stop sending me insider Builds when the next one will come out.</p>

</p><p>About the issue, I tied connecting my 2 monitors (One via HDMI &amp; One via MiniDisplayPort) and the Nvidia control panel showed again all the tabs. The only thing is that It detects only my second screen plugged on MiniDisplayPort :/</p>

    <title>Custom Disco Light Phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doogibo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom Disco Light Phone</h2>
                    
<p>I just finished watching an episode of The Mighty Boosh. A British comedy for those of you not in the know. Now ... a character on the show had the coolest phone I have ever seen. It had a yellow backing and on the front it was covered in disco lights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The closest thing I could find on google images was this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_geNll96rLvg/SQh9agnLWkI/AAAAAAAAAjU/W-7DCwwVlnY/s400/DSC_0059+resize.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_geNll96rLvg/SQh9agnLWkI/AAAAAAAAAjU/W-7DCwwVlnY/s400/DSC_0059+resize.jpg</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would love to have a phone like this or something similar. How does one go about customizing their phone like this? Is Nokia involved or are these things customized by a third party?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!!!</p>

<p>Nokia cannot help you to customise a phone like this but you will find various 3rd parties and non-official modding forums by searching google. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia does not allow discussions of hardware modifications on this site or links to anything that can void a warranty.</p>
