<h2>            Hotmail Inbox messages automatically purged&#47;deleted</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had my current Hotmail account for around 8 years. I use it daily and is my main personal email account. I also have a Gmail account through work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep my inbox organised and only keep the emails that are important. I've noticed that my older emails have been deleted from my inbox. Anything from when I opened the account in 2007 until 2011 is gone. As you can imagine I am not at all happy about this
 as I had many vital emails in there that I need to access from time to time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spoken to a couple of tech guys via Microsoft chat support who were fairly helpful but I don't think they understood the extent of the issue. They said they could retrieve deleted emails from the past 30 day's but anything else is lost forever. I was
 also told that the mailbox size is increasing from 5gb to 50gb (can't remember the exact size) with Outlook so I wouldn't need to worry about space in the future. A bit late now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked why I wasn't notified when my inbox was reaching it's capacity. My Gmail account tells me when it's almost full and doesn't just go and purge my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple of sub folders into which I've moved certain messages but my main inbox is slowly getting emptied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously the emails are unfortunately long gone. The oldest email in my inbox is from 2011 so the previous 4 years worth of stuff has been wiped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a bit of research online and discovered people have had similar issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume there is no way at all to ever get these back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use this account daily though desktop and iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>You assume that the data went missing because of space.&nbsp; Not a valid assumption.&nbsp; Glitches do happen which is why Microsoft suggests all users make (and keep) a backup fo their data to prevent data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the MS folks you spoke to are a bit optimistic, AFAIK you can only recover deleted items for the previous 5 days.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. It didn't cross my mind to be a glitch although would such a glitch only delete emails up until a certain date? As I mentioned I have emails from 2011 onwards but nothing before.

            I have seen stranger.&nbsp; I guess it is just a question of what failed and where.&nbsp; IMHO (and I dont work for MS) on line data should be backed up but they dont see it that way

            <p>Well they've obviously gone forever, bit of a bummer as there were some really important emails in there but I have to take responsibility for not saving or backing up the vital stuff. Lesson learned for the future.</p>

<h2>            OSPPREARM.exe error when scanning to email &#40;Outlook 2015 - Office 365&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am having an issue when scanning to email from a Brother MFC device. The scan initiates and appears to complete but when it tries to open a new email to insert the PDF a command window opens and then the OSPPREARM.EXE error occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version of Office 2016 MS Office 365 Small Business Premium via Go Daddy. The user account information is correctly displaying and all of the Office products work. It is just the scanning to email that generates the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is a Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 on a Dell Precision T3600 with 8G RAM. The Brother device is an MFC-8890DW. The Brother Control Panel software is version 3.10.0.0. The following is the error from the event viewer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: OSPPREARM.EXE, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x5643289a<br />
Faulting module name: ucrtbase.DLL, version: 10.0.10240.16390, time stamp: 0x55a5bf73<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000417<br />
Fault offset: 0x0007c3b4<br />
Faulting process id: 0x1fe8<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01d1311e378f10b3<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16\OSPPREARM.EXE<br />
Faulting module path: C:\Windows\system32\ucrtbase.DLL</p>
<p>Any help in resolving this issue would be appreciated. Let me know if you want or need more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version of Office is the latest 2016 version available for download from Office 365. I don't have the version number as this issue is on a computer I can't access right now. I would assume it is 16.0.6001.1038. The full Office has been uninstalled and
 reinstalled. And the Brother Control Center software was updated to the latest available version for the printer. This issue started with the installation of Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that the problem is not fixable without installing a later version of the Brother Control Center. Version 3.x is currently installed but version 4.x is not available for the printer model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the OSPPREARM.exe command a couple of times. The first time I received the "Microsoft Office rearm successful" message. The next time I tried the command I received a message that indicated the licensing was okay. I don't remember the exact
 message but it indicated that repeating the command was not going to fix anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot of the error:</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get W10 after a crash</h2>
                    <p>I've using Win 10 for some months and enjoyed to install the final version two days after its official launch. However, a major crash happened in my notebook and I decided to recover the whole installation. Well, it took more than 3 hours ( !) and nothing
 (good) happened! I had to reinstall Win 8 (from my official DVD) and while doing it I noticed that my hard drive was empty!!!</p>
<p>Now I have Win 8 with all updates but cannot even go back to Win 8.1, let alone to Win 10. I've been checking in in the las two days and all I get is an optional update.</p>
<p>How can I get Win 10 back?</p>

 the 8.1 update to save time.&nbsp;You cannot 'go back ' to win 8.1-- you need to update to 8.1.

<p>
</p><p>Going back to original install of windows 8 wiped the hard drive. You should investigate what happened in the first place before going through all the reinstallations only to have the same problems.</p>

            <p>If Windows 10 Pro Build 10240 was previously activated on your computer, you should be able to do a clean install.&nbsp; Download the official Windows 10 Pro ISO by running the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; If you create install media from the ISO (USB flash

<p>
</p><p>If this does not auto-activate, use the Windows 8.1 Update Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; Make a bootable flash drive or DVD&nbsp;to clean install Windows 8.1 Update.&nbsp; You would have to create the same edition of Windows 8.1 as you have a license for.&nbsp; Activate with your

<p>While using the Mogul I have found that I really like this phone, except there are two things that I do not like (at this time).&nbsp; I use Windows Live Messenger and it does not show my yahoo contacts where if I was using the computer based Windows Live my
 yahoo contacts show up.&nbsp; Has anyone been able to download the newest version of the Windows Messenger and not by going through the back door meaning when you click on the Window Live you see your yahoo contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two - I had a program that allowed me to send picture mail through text messenging and with my phone going on the brinks I lost everything and can not find the program that allowed me to do that.&nbsp; Does anyone know of a program that I can use
 to send picture mail with text messenging?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can help me with any of the problems listed above can you please send me an email at
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            I'm assuming that when you say "picture mail" you mean sending a text message with a picture?&nbsp; If that is the case, then choose the MMS option for messaging rather than using Text Message

<h2>            Filter Appointments in Outlook Calendar by Creator</h2>
                    <p>I connected a SharePoint 2010 calendar to my Outlook 2013 program. How can I create a view in Outlook that will filter appointments and meetings by who created them? Since it's a SharePoint calendar, multiple edit&nbsp;it and add their own appointments. In SharePoint,
 I can set view criteria to filter appointments created by specific people, I&nbsp;want to do that in&nbsp;Outlook.&nbsp;I can see "last modified by" at the bottom of each appointment when I open them to view, but how can I apply filter criteria to those attributes? I don't
 see anything resembling created by or modified by in the View Settings -&gt; "Filter" options. I tried setting the persons name in the "Organizer" field but it filters everything out of the view.</p>

            Hi <strong>Amanda</strong>, <br />
<br />
A certain option may not work properly if there were some changes recently made that triggered a system conflict or if there were corrupted files. We'd like to know if you have made any adjustments prior to experiencing this issue. Also, does it only happen
 to PowerPoint or to other Office 2010 programs as well? <br />
<br />
In the meantime, we suggest repairing Office from the Control Panel to fix any file corruption. Please follow the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Repair Office from the Control Panel">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
We'll wait for your response.

<h3> chackra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conversion of ACCDB in to ACCDE</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
Is the conversion of a data base (ACCDB) into ACCDE format necessary/possible, only if it has to be shared via on-line?&nbsp; Or a data base (Access 2010 - split format - single user) designed to use off the line can also be converted in to ACCDE format and distributed
 to end users through Removable device like CD, Pen drive. <br />
Thanx.<br />

            There's nothing online-specific about the ACCDE format.&nbsp; You can certainly use it locally, offline.&nbsp; All that the ACCDE format does is disable the design elements of the database and remove all the source code.

 as in my computer.<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Presumably all these users have Access installed?&nbsp; Because you're distributing an ACCDE, they must have the same version of Access installed, in the same folders.&nbsp; Otherwise references will break, and they can't be fixed in an ACCDE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, either they must install the back-end in exactly the same folder, with exactly the same path to it, as on your system, or else you need to have a mechanism in the front-end for locating and relinking to the back-end.&nbsp; Do you have that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Distributing an ACCDE can tricky, if you don't have control over your users' PC setups.</p>

<h2>            My name are showing up with another person email address in my Outlook</h2>
                    <p>so, I have email from Office 365 for Business designated from my office to send and receive emails for work. for quite sometime, I haven't received emails if I sent it to my self (mainly it's because it was private). when I checked it, apparently my name
 are assigned to 9 of my client's email address. so, when I thought I send an email from myself, it was sent to my client's email. for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>my name is John Smith with email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>but there are 9 accounts more that have same name with my client's email address:</p>
<p>
</p><p>John Smith with email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>John Smith with email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this happens on Outlook for Android and Office 365 on web. It was showing up on Outlook 2010 when I search y All Contacts, but I can delete that contact from there. however, my clients email address still showing with my name on Outlook for Android and Office
 365 web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>those contacts are unable to edit since it wasn't saved on my Outlook contacts. I have tried to add them on my Outlook Contacts using their names, but when I tried to send email and search my name in To box, I still found their emails with my name. I've
 checked my contacts card but it only showing my email address. I also tried to reset my account, delete my account and sign in again on Outlook for Android, reinstalling with clearing data and cache but still no changes. even if it's changed, what about the
 contacts that still showing up in Office 365 web? what should I do so I can remove my name from those contacts?</p>

<p>Hello Rudy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I forward the message, and input the To field, I still can see my client mail in suggestion with my name on it and my mail. I've already deleted my client mail on Office 365 for web and it wasn't appearing anymore but in Outlook for Android I still
 can see them. I think it was because the Auto-suggestion in Outlook for Android can't be deleted from the app, that's why I still can see them. That's why I still can see it on my phone.</p>

</p><p>Yes, the problem still exist only in Mobile app now after I do what you've said in Outlook Web App. I've already reset account; deleting and signing in again; resetting, deleting then signing in again; deleting app data then signing in; deleting app data,
 then reinstalling again; resetting, deleting app data, uninstall, remove leftover folder on Android folder, Installing again but alas, the problem still persist. I think I may try to find the results through the hardway, by opening some files in the root folder,

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please check whether these emails address stored in the contact book application on your phone? Or other applications you had used these address before? Since the Outlook for
 Android may sync with these applications.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also, please provide us some screenshots about "</span><span>still can see my client mail in suggestion with my name on it and my mail" on your phone for further analysis.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>

 but not in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I havenâ€™t been able to get the screenshot, but I will try and give you tomorrow.</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only your Outlook for Android&nbsp; occurs this issue,
<strong>could you please also try using another Android device to check it again</strong>? Since it maybe an pure Outlook for Android client issue and the cache shouldn't be cleared up. Please
<strong>follow the steps to clear the App cache </strong>to see if there is any improvement: Head to Setting menu &gt; Find Outlook for Android in the menu &gt; Tap on Storage and then click Clear DATA and Cache.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please
<strong>update the version of Outlook for Android</strong> if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>

<p>Hello Rudy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry Iâ€™ve been away from internet connection for awhile. I havenâ€™t tried to check using another device. as for clearing cache and data, Iâ€™ve already tried that before, and it still producing the same result. I think this problem will be solved if Outlok
 for Android are giving some options to clear name suggestions, since what I can see is that the names and the email address are showing up only when I type my name in To field. so I will say this question is solved, even if Iâ€™m not satisfied with it. thank
 you for your help.</p>

<h3> ryanr25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Home&#58; Product Deactivated, subscription expired - Thinks ProPlus is installed.</h2>
                    <p>I purchased 365 Home for my father last week, the one where you can have up to 5 installs. I installed it on his Windows 7 PC with no issue but when installing it on his Surface Pro 2 from the office.microsoft.com website some strange things happen. It seems
 to install fine but it wont authenticate at all. When you launch an application and go to "account" it shows that office 365 Pro Plus is deactivated and &nbsp;Office 365 has expired. I have never had Pro Plus installed on this device so I have no idea why its doing
 this. Image below is what the account page is showing. Any idea as to what's going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both "Manage Account" buttons and entered in my fathers Microsoft account where Office 365 is purchased. It shows under the install information on the website that the Surface is activated but it shows this below no matter what I do.</p>

            <p>Hello Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description provided, you tried to install and activate Office 365 Home subscription but it shows Office Professional Plus 365 product information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check for the Office products listed under Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Office 365 Professional Plus is listed, then let us run the fixit available in the link below which removes Office 365 traces completely from the computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once removed, log into <a href="http://www.Office.com/MyAccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.Office.com/MyAccount</a> website using the Microsoft credentials associated with the Office 365 Home subscription then try to install and verify the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result to assist you better. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to prepare a pretty simple overview for my end users about the recovery options they have / can expect before they call IT.</p>
<p>Assumption for this overview is E3 plan and no special retention policy or litigation/in-place hold feature activated on the users mailbox or site collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bold text where I have a question and do not really know what options are available.</p>
<p>Please correct when I am wrong with other assumptions.</p>

<p>1st stage: &nbsp; &nbsp;Self restore from the "Deleted items folder" - Retention is in theory "Unlimited" as long as deleted items folder is not purged by the user or mailbox limit 100 GB is reached (E3), overwrite starts, ...</p>
<p>2nd stage: &nbsp; 30 days from the recoverable items folder, after that the message is gone forever</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Exchange Online Mailbox deleted by the administrator / No litigation hold or in-place hold set</span></p>

            Hi Manuel,<br />
<br />
Here are my answers to some of your concerns:<br />
<br />
<strong>Exchange Online Mailbox / Options if a users deletes a message</strong><br />
<strong>2nd stage: 30 days from the recoverable items folder, after that the message is gone forever</strong><br />
<br />
In fact, the emails will be moved to the purge folder when theyâ€™re disappeared from the recoverable items folder, and remain 14 days there. For this situation, we can use
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd353189%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eDiscovery search</a> to restore the emails.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, if litigation hold is enabled, all deleted emails can be recovered.<br />
<br />
<strong>Onedrive (Personal)</strong><br />
<strong>2nd stage: Is there another option for Sharepoint site admins to recover personal Onedrive files after 90 days for the user?</strong><br />
<br />
No. By default, each user is the administrator of his own OneDrive for Business site collection. If he deleted a document from the 2nd stage recycle bin, the file is permanently deleted.<br />
<br />
<strong>Office Groups (Documents deleted within a library, Office groups sharepoint site)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1st stage: ? Same as with personal Onedrive? (90 days?), Self restore by the user?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2nd stage: ?</strong><br />
<br />
Office 365 Group teamsite is a customized SharePoint site collection, and it has the same retention time as common site collections and OneDrive for Business.<br />
<br />
For your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Restore-deleted-items-from-the-site-collection-recycle-bin-5fa924ee-16d7-487b-9a0a-021b9062d14b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1#__howlong" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How long are deleted items kept in the Recycle Bin?</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Office Groups (whole group deleted by the administrator)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Currently no backup / recovery</strong><strong> option in place / right?</strong><br />
<br />
When you delete a group, you are permanently removing the group team site, group conversations, email messages, Yammer messages, files, calendar events, and any other related information. There is no way to recover the information once it's been deleted. (Reference:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Delete-a-group-ca7f5a9e-ae4f-4cbe-a4bc-89c469d1726f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Delete a group</a>)<br />
<br />
<strong>Sharepoint Sites</strong><br />
<strong>2nd stage: ? Another 90 days by site collection admin? Right?</strong><br />
<br />
According to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Restore-deleted-items-from-the-site-collection-recycle-bin-5fa924ee-16d7-487b-9a0a-021b9062d14b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1#__howlong" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>, the retention time for site collection admin (Site Collection Recycle Bin) is 30 days.<br />

    <title>Listserv messages in digest form in the online version of Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james l. hubbard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Listserv messages in digest form in the online version of Outlook Office 365</h2>
                    We recently switched to office365 and in the web version when receiving posts from a subscribed listserv, the posts no longer come in digest form. They come as attachments in the message. Sometimes as many as 10 attachments. Is there a way to change this
 setting in the web version of Outlook?

</p><p>However you can remove the Battery and return it back and the phone will start..but it will not go through the startup and just shutdown</p>

            My Lumia 1020 has just done this but to be honest to the people who are getting angry. Microsoft clearly state this is NOT finished software and actually state that if you use it software or hardware damage can occur even "Bricking" thus as such we all
 take the chance and roll the dice when we install it. This includes me!

            <p>Hi Insiders,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally got my L520 back. I first tried command level attempt of Lumia Software Recovery Tool. It installed successfully but my phone didnt restarted i thought that there was an error in S/W Installation. So i tried after some time with this S/W provided
 in this link,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">http://nds2.fds-fire.nokia.com/fds_fire/1405/1213/7361995544/NokiaSoftwareUpdaterForRetail_4.2.1.exe</span></p>
<p>But the same thing happens, after installtion there will be green screen and phone trying to restart, white small NOKIA logo will appear then it shows charging symbol. After that
 the phone wont show language selection screen. Pull out the cable, i had an additional nokia battery charged, i replaced that and switched it on then it finally works. The S/W installation drains the battery very low, so the phone cant get restarted. Keep
 try with another battery. Hope you get the phone get back as i got it.</p>
