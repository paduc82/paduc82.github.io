    <title>Unable to turn on Windows Defender in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to turn on Windows Defender in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>How in the world do you turn on Windows Defender?&nbsp; Somehow the damn thing got turned off, and I have no idea how it happened.&nbsp; I tried following the solution on the Microsoft website, but it simply doesn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp; For one thing, it tells me to type in Defender
 using the start key, and then select Windows Defender.&nbsp; When I do that, I get the message that the Defender APP is turned off.&nbsp; That's it, nothing else.&nbsp; According to the instructions on the website, I should be able to click on 'Tools'.&nbsp; It NEVER COMES UP.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 What I'd like to know is how in the **** this got turned off in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is extremely frustrating, especially when the Security tab tells me that everything is ginger peachy.</p>

            <p>I spent 30 minutes with a Microsoft Support person in a chat yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was unable to fix the problem.&nbsp; What is difficult for me to understand is that when I downloaded Windows-10, I already had a anti-virus software program installed.&nbsp; I was able
 to enable Defender without any problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, suddenly, I'm getting these messages that both Defender and my anti-virus programs are disabled.&nbsp; In somewhat of a panic, I checked, and found out that this was not the case whatsoever.&nbsp; My anti-virus software
 was on.&nbsp; So why all of a sudden, after nearly six months did this happen? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The curious thing about the support chat was that when trying to enable Defender a 577 error code appeared that indicated there was a malicious file preventing the enabling of Defender.&nbsp; A scan of my PC, including a system verification, indicated that there
 was no intrusion from an outside source, and that everything was fine.&nbsp; It makes me wonder what this error is.&nbsp; Support told me that I shouldn't worry about this.&nbsp; Then where did it come from?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Supports conclusion and fix, was that I should disable my anti-virus software, leave it disabled and then I should be able to reinstate Defender.&nbsp; This solution leaves me in a quandary since for months things had been peachy-keen.&nbsp; So, am I satisfied with
 the solution, no.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this day and age of computer hacking, personal files being hijacked, and no such thing as privacy anymore, this does not give me a warm and fuzzy.

            <p>I followed a thread which had a solution to disable/uninstall the 3rd party Antivirus software, (I use Norton Internet Security), turn on Windows Defender and Update the antivirus fixes.&nbsp; Use Windows Updates to update other Windows fixes.&nbsp; Turn off Windows
 Defender and re-install the 3rd party Antivirus software.&nbsp; I have done this three times just to get Windows Updates and frankly, I am tired of it.&nbsp; MIcrosoft needs to fix their update because it is the one that is failing, and their Autoupdate for Macintosh
 fails because it doesn't use the right protocol to connect the update to their server.&nbsp; This was verified by a temporary fix to add a couple of DNS IP addresses which worked once and failed later.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, and all of the other email and browser apps on the Macintosh
 worked fine on the Internet.</p>

            <p>I just had that same issue.&nbsp; If you have another antivirus program running on your pc, remove it and do a restart.
</p>
<p>Then go back into WD and it should reset itself to ON.&nbsp; WD will not run if there is any other type of program running on your system.&nbsp; It will turn itself to the off position automatically.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't work - do let me know what 'Virus Protection' is displayed in the 'Security' section of Security Center.<span>&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender receives it update by default through Windows Update Service.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would first check to see if the Windows Update service is working correctly.<span>&nbsp;

<p>If that is working and you feel that you need to manually download latest signatures try executing the following command : "%programfiles%\windows defender\mpcmdrun.exe" -signatureupdate -http</p>

            <blockquote>This is really strange.&nbsp; Doing what you said did delete a textbox on the left side scratch area but will not delete any of the objects on the right side.&nbsp; I tried Arrange--Group/Regroup--nothing worked.&nbsp; I can click on these objects and copy them
 just by dragging and can then delete the copy, but the ones that came with the document won't budge.&nbsp; By the way, David, I really appreciate your taking the time to advise me.<br />
</blockquote>
==============================================<br />
Sorry, but I'm running out of ideas..<br />
<br />
Left clicking a blank area of the publication or the scratch <br />
area should deselect the objects so they would no longer <br />
be grouped.<br />
<br />
If you upload a copy of the .pub file to the following site <br />
that you pasted the copied objects into I would be happy <br />
to have a look at it.<br />
<br />
"SendSpace"<br />
<a href="http://www.sendspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sendspace.com/</a><br />
<br />
It's very simple...on the SendSpace site the following<br />
steps are all you have to do.<br />
<br />
Left click the Browse button and it will open a window<br />
that allows you to access the files on your hard drive.<br />
<br />
Navigate to the folder your .pub file is in and select it.<br />
<br />
Left click the Upload button.<br />
<br />
When the Download Link appears...left click the Copy<br />
Link button and then right click/paste the link into a <br />
reply to this thread.<br />
<br />
To download the file from SendSpace<br />
<br />
Left click the link.<br />
<br />
When the SendSpace site loads.<br />
<br />
***Scroll down slightly and left click the blue text***<br />
<br />
"Click here to start download from sendspace".<br />
<br />
Save the file to your desktop and view in MS Publisher.<br />

            <p>New OS, new philosophy. The only reason to connect a WP7 to a PC is for media transfer, music, pictures, video, etc. (and you can do that over WiFi) Everything else is designed to be cloud based. Documents, contacts, calendar are designed to sync with some
 cloud based source. Your phone and your PC are intended to sync to the same cloud based source keeping the two, or three or whatever number of devices in sync, without having to wire them together.</p>
<p>What specificaly are you trying to accomplish and I'm sure there will be help here. Connecting a WP7 to a PC like you did with WM and ActiveSync or WMDC isn't going to happen though...it's so last decade ;)</p>

<p>I use Microsoft Word 2013 (32 bit version) as part of the Office&nbsp;Home and Student suit (Windows 7 64bit Professional) It's always worked fine in the past but lately, whenever I try to print anything all I get are blank pages. The weird thing is that the
 paper goes through the printer 'as though' something is printing but every time it is blank. I've tried printing documents that in the past printed fine but the same thing happens - nothing is on the paper. The text setting is on black or automatic and I believe
 there are no hidden characters. It may be a coincidence but this seems to have happened when I tried to use a letter template, but now even if I type onto a blank document, nothing prints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone got any ideas what has happened here? I have the latest printer drivers for my Canon ip4500 and as far as I know the printer is fine. It seems to be a Word or Office problem. It's very frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phil</p>

If you're able to print from other applications, change the default printer to Microsoft XPS Document Writer, try printing virtually and check if it works. If it does, update/repair/re-install the printer driver and see if it helps.</font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

            <p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently been checking my printer for problems and I think I have found one. I have performed several nozzle checks and each time the PGBK 'grid' that appears at the top of the page is missing. I have done a couple of deep cleans and the problem is
 still there. This was confirmed when I printed out an email earlier from the web&nbsp;- any text in black was missing but everything else was fine. This makes sense when I observed what happened when printing from Word, the paper feeds through the printer 'as if'
 something is printing, so the printer is trying to print normally but&nbsp;no ink is put on the paper. So the issue seems to be with the PGBK. I have tried another cartridge and nothing has changed. I'm wondering whether it could be the printer head? A blockage
 maybe?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            It does sound as if the problem is with the printer, so your next step should be to check the printer manufacturer's website for help (FAQs, forums, Help files, etc.).

            <p>Hi Daniel - I noticed that on January 8th someone I know sent me an attachment with a .dot extension. Ever since then my printer is printing blank pages from Word. All other printing works (adobe .pdfs, etc). Is there some correlation here? Also, if someone
 sends me a corrupted word document and I open it up via hotmail, why isn't Microsoft catching this problem?</p>

            <p>It could be that the template (that's what a file with a .dot extension would be) may have contained a macro that has contributed to the problem.&nbsp; Have you asked the person who sent you the document about it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have you opened the template in Word and then accessed the Visual Basic Editor to see if there is any code in the template?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You should never open documents directly from e-mail messages as by doing so, you may circumvent the security software on your computer.&nbsp; You should always save them to the local drive and then use the Open facility in the application to open the file.</p>

            <p>Similar issue. Using Office 13 and Windows 8.1, try to print MS Office files (word, excel, powerpoint) will now just result in blank pages. Same issue with notepad.
</p>
<p>

            Issue got worse and turned out to be printer. Removed the print head and soaked it in hot water for 10 minutes as per another thread. Three regular cleaning cycles and one deep cleaning and it seems to be working now.

<p>Hello Raj,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a common issue. To investigate it, can you please provide us the entire NDR message? You can drag it to the desktop and save it as a .msg file, then share this .msg file with us. We will
 send you a private message to collect it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, from the error message, it seems that the IP address (40.1x7.10.1x8) is not allowed to send mail from "domain.com", please confirm where this IP is used for?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please let us know the detailed information about the mail flow in your hybrid scenario?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to Split an Exiting Contact Group in Outlook 2013 into Multiple Groups</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_winother/how-to-split-an-exiting-contact-group-in-outlook/23436358-6c42-4c9b-bd62-ee332587cb8d" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I can't delete any members from my contact group. Outlook thinks this group is a member and treats it as a member, not a group. If I double-click on the group "Distribution List" it brings up a window that shows "Distribution List" group. Like opening a
 Russian egg, I see the same exact thing, but then when I double click on the group again I see the members in quick view mode (hover mode, whatever you want to call it) and in this mode you can only add members, send IM, start a conference call, start video,
 or send email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created this contact group by copying and pasting a distribution list from a cc: box so maybe Outlook thinks that all these emails are one person. At least that is what I gather based on the behavior of Outlook in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only option I see is to create a new group with same name and add members (one by one) using Outlook Address book and that would take too long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Update is taking forever  and  what is Interactice Services Detection&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way to see the status or percentage of completion for Office 365 when it is updating?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I left the computer on to update 365 and came back two hours later and have no idea if it is still updating or is just corrupt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, what is the Interactive Services Detection?&nbsp; Is it part of the problem here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p><span><font color="#000000">Hello Norman,<br />
<br />
From your description, I understand that installation of Office update is not getting completed.<br />
<br />
I will work with you to resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
Here is the answer your question regarding Interactive Services Detection, <br />
<br />
It is a service responsible for communicating between session 0 and session 1 services. System services run under session 0. Session 0 is non-interactive. When you log on, you log on to session 1.<br />
<br />

<font><br />
</font></span><font color="#000000">Now regarding Office update issue, follow the below mentioned steps and verify the result:<br />
<br />
1) Cancel the update installation and re-boot the computer.<br />
2) Now disable Print Spooler Service following below mentioned instructions:<br />
<br />
a) Click <b>Start</b>&gt; <b>Run</b>, type <b>services.msc</b>, and then click <b>OK</b>.<br />
b) Look through the list of services, find <b>Print Spooler</b>, and open it.<br />
c) Tap or click <b>Stop</b>, and then tap or click <b>OK</b>.<br />
d) Now try installing the Office update again.<br />
e) Once Office update is installed on your PC, go back to the list of services and open
<b>Print Spooler</b>.<br />
f) Tap or click <b>Start</b>, and then tap or click <b>OK</b>.</font></span><br />
<font><font color="#000000"><font><br />
Hope the above information helps. If not, please reply with the result and I'll be happy to further assist you.<br />

    <title>PowerPoint 2010 randomly changing font size&#47;spacing within symbols - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonbaab  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2010 randomly changing font size&#47;spacing within symbols on every slide</h2>
                    <p>Been working on a presentation for over a month in PowerPoint 2010. Yesterday this issue suddenly occurred. When I open my file, everything looks correct in the slides as well as the left slide menu. When I click to another slide, the font size and/or spacing
 in each of the symbols/text boxes in every slide grow and destroy my format. If I close the program and reopen it (in most cases), it is correct again until I change slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only catalyst that I can think of, is I had two different co-workers send me presentations in emails. I opened their individual presentations and copied slides into a separate master presentation. I did not copy anything into the presentation of which
 I am speaking, only out of it (confused yet?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before and After:</p>

            <p>Hi Jason, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why your font changes randomly might be because the auto resize of fonts is turned on to your PowerPoint. Kindly follow the instructions below to have it changed:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the backstage view, click on the <strong>File</strong> tab and select <strong>
Options</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Proofing</strong> category on the left pane. </li><li>Click the <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">A</span>utoCorrect Options...</strong></li><li>Once the<strong> AutoCorrect </strong>windows pops up, click the<strong> AutoFormat As You Type
</strong>tab.</li><li>On the<strong> Apply as you type</strong> section, click the checkbox of<strong> AutoFit title to placeholder</strong> and
<strong>AutoFit Body Text to Placeholder </strong>to uncheck the options. </li><li>Click<strong> OK </strong>to save changes. </li></ol>
<p>Once changes have been applied, the random changes of the font's sizes shouldn't apply.
</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

 presentation until this week.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>PowerPoint crashes repeatedly when clicking animations in the ribbon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melinafilomia  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint crashes repeatedly when clicking animations in the ribbon</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Office for Mac 2011, specifically to edit PowerPoint files that are sent to me. I add logos and do cleanup.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was able to do this in office 2001 for Mac, but it was a hassle as most came from a Windows environment, with newer versions of PowerPoint.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Using Office for Mac 2011, I do not see any content on most slides. Content appears on the first slide, but none of the others. I can open the files in Keynote and see content, but nothing is visible in PowerPoint 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, Compatibility Check shows multiple issues with animations. When I click Animations in the ribbon, PowerPoint crashes. Every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have updated, repaired permissions, repaired disk, removed old versions of Office, rebooted, and continue to have the same problem. I am ready to have my purchase refunded, out of frustration. I am running 10.6.8, have sufficient RAM and drive
 space.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any ideas? Anything I've missed?</p>

            No, reinstalling is seldom a fix -- that's why we tested in a new User Account :-) The fact that the problem doesn't occur there indicates that neither the Office software nor its system support installation is at fault. If either were causing the problemit
 would have arisen in the new account as well. The issue is specific to the support files for your original account... most likely a damaged/corrupt Preferences file.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Log in to your original Account</li><li><i>Quit</i> all Office programs</li><li>Go to the <b>~:Home:Library:Preferences</b> folder</li><li>Delete the file by the name of <b>com.microsoft.Powerpoint.plist</b></li><li>[While there go deeper into the <b>Microsoft</b> folder. If you find a file by the name of
<b>com.microsoft.PowerPoint.<i>prefs</i>.plist</b> delete it also]</li><li>Next go to <b>~:Home:Library:Application Support:Microsoft:Preferences:Office:Preferences</b></li><li>Delete the file named <b>Office Font Cache</b></li><li>Restart your Mac</li></ol>
<br />
PowerPoint will recreate the necessary files when you launch the program so it may take a few seconds longer than usual for the program to start up. After that it should load normally.<br />
<br />
Reply here with your results, but that should resolve the issue. If not there are less likely possibilities but they should be fixable without reinstalling.<br />

            <p>Tah dah! I found the Library, deleted the .plist and now Powerpoint does animations without crashing. Why on earth would Apple hide the Library like this, and how was one to know where to find it?</p>
<p>Thank you!!</p>

</p><p>I have a form "tracker", to access this form the the user are&nbsp;required to login (which is another form). The form tracker have a backend table "Backend".</p>

<p>If user 1 logs in to the form&nbsp;and update the "tracker", is there&nbsp;a VBA that i can use in the form to auto populate/capture the login ID (either in the form or derectly into the backend table) which was used to login to the form.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>to retrieve a field from a table you can use the DLookUp function to set the form control e.g.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=DlookUp("fieldName","TableName","conditionIfRequested")</p>

            <p>You didn't answer my question. How do you identify the current user? </p>
<p>
</p><p>In my blog, I hide the login form so that the combobox where the user selects themselves is always accessible using the syntax:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Forms!frmLogin!cboUser</p>
<p>
</p><p>But without knowing how you capture the user login, we can't tell you how to populate the table.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Creating simple graph for data with no numerical value - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Creating simple graph for data with no numerical value</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to create a simple column graph using data collected showing things on or off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I have recorded the instances in where human actions may change the temperature in a room (ie, heater on, open windows, tv on...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have data basically stating wether something is on or off over a period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to create a graph expressing an x axis showing the time in hours and y axis showing the action, with the data displayed in a column for each action corresponding to the time when the action was happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems simple enough but I can not figure out how to plot in excel, I think it is because the data has no actual value but is expressed as on/off or positive/negative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I have column A (Time) starting at 0:00 and moving half an hour every cell. Row 1 has the actions listed left to right and then I have inserted a tick where the action is on or positive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts. Sorry if that makes no sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.&nbsp;</p>

            You need to use actual values to plot. How about in another column, enter a formula that changes OFF to 0 and ON to 1. Fill this down for the range and then plot these values.<br />

                    <p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having troubles most likely with Outlook 2016 for mac, when I try to attach a file (any file) It appears as null (0kb) and does not attach or send. This happens with all document types and also with .zip files. Any help would be appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have tried,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Repair Disk Permissions</li><li>Web Client Version (Which works and is my workaround)</li><li>Complete reinstall of the Office suite</li><li>Switching profiles</li><li>Switching Mac OS accounts</li></ul>
<p>Let me know if you have any suggestions and thank you for your time.</p>
