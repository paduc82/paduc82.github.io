<h2>            What is &#34;&#58;WofCompressedData&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I previously made this post, but the expert who was helping me has not responded to my response http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/what-is-wofcompresseddata/3135c8a7-99fe-4fbf-a985-b9cb5982f7ce</p>
<p>
</p><p>A week ago, I did a MBAM Threat Scan on my desktop (nothing was found, I actually did a couple over the weekend and Monday too... long story).</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>During the scan I noticed that a lot of the system files were appended with ":WofCompressedData" at the end. I wasn't paying close enough attention before, but this is the first time I have noticed it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I re-ran the scan on my desktop I saw WofCompressedData appear a lot. When I ran the scan on my laptop, I rarely saw WofCompressedData. Both computers run Windows 10 64-bit and both of them came out to be clean. I just wanted to know what WofCompressedData
 means?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told <em>"WofCompressedData file is a disc fragment file and can be deleted. This is created when virus scan is run on the computer. I would suggest you to update the MBAM and rescan to check if you get same message. If yes you may contact MBAM support.
 Thank you."</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>I later posted that MBAM never found any malware during any of the scans and that the only thing was when I was looking at the screen while it was scanning and saw the ":WofCompressedData" continually showing up, I was concerned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MBAM and Kaspersky and Microsoft Safety Scanner all do not find any problems on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to confirm that given all these clean reports, I should not be concerned about the ":WofCompressedData", because as Pavan said they are just benign disk fragments; is this a correct interpretation?</p>

<h2>            Audio Jack Not Working After Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My audio jack will not play my speakers and my ear buds don't work in the jack either.&nbsp; This happened after my last Windows 10 update.&nbsp; I tried the suggestions from the previous posts from 2015, but they didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me with this?&nbsp; Thanks :)</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level 
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing. 
<br />

<h2>            Cannot Change brightness after upgrading to 1803 RTM, previously it was fine .</h2>
                    <p>I had to reset windows because on installing build 17127 , it botched. Even in the botched state it had no brightness control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now , I don't have it even after upgrading to 17133 or 1803 rtm .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried&nbsp; , installing / uninstalling Intel HD graphics driver ( very old , core i3 first gen PC)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have installed/uninstalled Monitors &gt;generic PnP monitor drivers .</p>
<p>
</p><p>(monitor.sys ) is the said driver that allows / disallows F2/F3 brightness hotkey , while brightness never changes. Can you give Monitor.sys from an earlier build such that it can be tested , how do I replace the driver.&nbsp;</p>

            The problem I am having here is that I am not seeing any native Windows 10 drivers for this model and most of the drivers for it, especially the graphics in this model, date back to October 2012.

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703 or 1709.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703 or 1709
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1803 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1803, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<p>Had the same issue with a Dell Inspiron 15 N5040 with an Intel i3 380M. I will downgrade as it worked on all previous versions of Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick Update - It appears the actual graphics driver component is completely fine, as when I reinstalled it, it became stuck at full brightness.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Good Day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kindly help me to recover the files of one of our Manager, something badly happened to his laptop and the vendor have to replaced the MoBo. But the worst thing is that the drive is Bitlock encrypted, when we tried to boot it up boot disk failure then tried
 to slave the HDD into another machine it is asking for the recovery key and upon checking the AD the recovery is not present or deleted. Is there another way to recover his files, he is pleading so much because his life works is all in that drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone know a solution kindly share it with me, appreciate very much the help.</p>

    <title>External monitor connected to dock loses connection &#40;Surface - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            External monitor connected to dock loses connection &#40;Surface Book&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Book that keeps disconnecting from the external monitor after it has been idle for a while. Possibly related to going into sleep mode, although from other related posts I've seen, possibly not. Regardless, rather not turn off sleep. I need
 to unplug the dock and plug it back in for the connection to return. So far, I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Applying Windows Updates</p>
<p>2) Updating Surface firmware</p>
<p>3) Updating dock firmware</p>
<p>4) Replacing dock (and dock power adapter) entirely&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue still exists. Has anyone else encountered this? Is there a resolution (short of returning the Surface to Microsoft)?&nbsp;</p>

incompatible monitors</a>, and other factors may cause external monitor issues with your Surface device. Have you tried to check for updated drivers and firmware for your monitor from the manufacturers website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are any available, please ensure that the monitor is attached directly to your Surface, then download and install the updated drivers. Also, does the problem exist when you have the monitor directly connected to your Surface Book?</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>I had just gotten a surface book also.&nbsp; And the dock issues also drove me crazy.</p>
<p>The article that Voun Tia cited was the best, I could find to resolve my issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023468/surface-troubleshoot-surface-dock-and-docking-stations</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I learned is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The surface book dock is only compatible with monitors that support DisplayPort.&nbsp; The article says a workaround is to use an HDMI adapter and connect to the monitor using HDMI.&nbsp; This partially resolved my issue.&nbsp; It reduced the number of times the dock
 lose connection with the external monitor 95% of the time.&nbsp; It still loses connection sometimes.</li><li>What I learned from googling elsewhere.&nbsp; And learned the hard way.&nbsp; Is that Windows 10 has a habit of disconnecting devices to save power.&nbsp; After every windows update, I have to go into Device Manager and find all the devices under "Universal Serial Bus
 Controllers".&nbsp; For each device, open properties-power management, and uncheck "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power".&nbsp; On my machine I have to do this to 3 GenericSuperSpeedUSBHub, 3 GenericUSBHub, 1 Intel(R)USB3.0extensibleHostController,
 and 1 USBRootHub(USB3.0).</li><li>I also had an issue with an old wired Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard.&nbsp; It worked if I connected directly to the SB; but not if I connected to the dock.&nbsp; I think the dock only supports newer accessories.&nbsp; I ended purchasing a SurfaceBookErgonomic keyboard
 that uses bluetooth.&nbsp; The only problem is the keys are not as comfortable as my old ergonomic keyboard.&nbsp; sigh.&nbsp; FYI - the flashing white light on the keyboard means it is ready to pair.&nbsp; When you pair it, windows will give you a pin code that you have to enter
 into the keyboard.</li></ul>

<h2>            Transfering Windows Movie Maker portrait photos flips them sideways</h2>
                    <p>Original title: windows movie maker</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to windows 10. I'm creating a project with movie maker but when I transfer portrait photos it flips them sideways. Using the flip option in movie maker corrects this but then after a few seconds it adjusts the aspect ration to be wide so the photo
 is distorted. The version of movie maker is 2011.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to answer your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that pictures imported in the Movie maker will auto adjust itself depending on the&nbsp;default size of the movie maker screen. Since there is no option to adjust the size of the picture within the Movie Maker, what I would suggest you to do
 is to try with a different image which exactly fits the Movie maker window and change the size of the other pictures&nbsp;&nbsp;accordingly. Using an image with a larger width and length is recommend so as to get the best resolution in the editing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any Windows related queries in the future, let us know. We will be glad to help.</p>

<h2>            Prevent Windows 10 updates from touching any drive other than it&#39;s own</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've encountered a maddening issue on a corporate laptop. I dual boot linux via a *separate* internal m2.sata. In other words, my company issued the laptop with one m2.sata, and I installed a second drive for linux. The corporate drive utilizes bitlocker
 and SafeBoot. On *two* recent upgrades, Windows encrypted my linux EFI partition with bitlocker. I know this as I couldn't boot, booted into a linux via a USB stick, tried to mount my existing linux EFI partition and it reported "unknown partition type: BitLocker".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I prevent this? In both cases, I had to re-install a bootloader from scratch and re-create the bootloader configuration from scratch. I want Windows 10 to mind it's own business and completely ignore the second drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy to post other details if they would be helpful.</p>

            Hi  jwhendy 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there is not much that can really be done because of the integration between Windows 10, the UEFI firmware and Secure Boot. 
<br />
<br />Your best option is to avoid upgrading Windows 10 if you can.
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-bug-report-in-windows-10-using-feedback-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-su...</a>
<br />
<br />Information in the above link is sourced from a trusted Microsoft MVP blog.

<p>I submitted the Feedback Hub ticket. I was going to fast and missed the note about signing in, so I'll have to try and find the report after it's reviewed (if they publish it), as I think it went in anonymously...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this is a corporate laptop, I can't avoid upgrades. I wish I could at least have one reboot to do so, as I could pull the drive. Once the update was queued, my start menu options became "Upgrade and reboot" and "Upgrade and shut down." There was no way
 to pull that drive :(&nbsp;</p>

            Maybe you could speak to IT about delaying upgrades on your particular make and model?
<br />

<p>Right, but I wasn't signed in to Feedback Hub as mentioned, so I don't get the option to see my submitted feedback. I'll have to find the collection of all feedback at some point in the future and see if I can find the suggestion I submitted (anonymously).
 Then I can get a short link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did also submit an IT ticket to see if they can put my linux partition on a blacklist for the auto-encryption software or whatever is causing this. Postponing upgrades&nbsp;<em>could
</em>work. We'll see once they follow up.</p>

</em>addressed on <strong><a href="https://heartbeat.skype.com/2017/10/issues_connecting_to_the_skype.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype Heartbeat</a></strong><em>.
</em>The issue has been resolved already, however, if you continue to experience this, please confirm the following information before we proceed with further troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What Skype version are you on? Kindly specify the exact version, not latest or recent.
</li><li>What operating system is running on your laptop? </li><li>What exact error message do you get when signing in? We will highly appreciate it if you can provide us a screenshot. Remember to
<strong>omit any personal information </strong>such as Skype Names, email addresses and phone numbers.

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>Please see the suggested steps below regarding the error message you received.<br />
<br />
Understanding and troubleshooting Live Mail “CCC” error codes<br />
Network error codes<br />
Network / Internet error codes in Live Mail will all start with 0x80072, followed by a combination of 3 letters / numbers – which give the root cause.</p>
<p>Example: Error: 0x80072F81</p>
<p>Root cause: ERROR_INTERNET_SERVER_UNREACHABLE</p>
<p>Troubleshooting: check internet connectivity, flush DNS cache, check mail server (possible outage)</p>
<p>HTTP error codes<br />
HTTP errors are indicated by 0x80AA4** or 0x80194** (where ** = a combination of 2 letters / numbers)</p>
<p>The last 3 digits of these error codes are standard Hex codes – which give the root cause.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>• Error: 0x80AA41F7 </p>
<p>• Hex --&gt; decimal: 1F7 = 503</p>
<p>• HTTP error 503 = service is temporarily unavailable. </p>
<p>To convert hex to decimal:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-decimal-converter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-decimal-converter</a>
</p>
<p>For list of common HTTP errors codes and their meanings:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes</a>
</p>
<p>Passport / Authentication error codes<br />
Passport / Authentication errors will start with 0x000488** or 0x800488** (where ** = a combination of 2 letters / numbers)</p>
<p>For Hotmail accounts – 0x800488** error codes usually indicate an issue on an account-level, for example:</p>
<p>• 0x800488fb – Account suspended</p>
<p>• 0x800488fe – Account compromised</p>
<p>Troubleshooting: Check the account!</p>
<p>Exception: 0x80048849 – MTU / network issue!<br />
<br />
Let us know the result.<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<h2>            Unable to map NAS. I am able to access and login to my NAS via the browser, but mapping gives error 0x800704cf &#34;network location cannot be reached&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Win7 SP1.</p>
<p>Other Win7 and XP Pro machines on network&nbsp;can map drive.</p>
<p>Booting from same machine with fresh Win7&nbsp;install can map drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pure Networks - Network Magic was installed and uninstalled.&nbsp; I am concerned that this did some sort of node lock preventing this mapping.&nbsp; I've tried to do a manual install, but it appears it was already unistalled properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to try next.&nbsp; I do no want to go back to a fresh install as I do not have the time or all the apps readily available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>Here are certain considerations you may look into.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;<br />
Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that computer is on and that you've enabled file and printer sharing on your network. For more information,
 see networking home computers running different versions of Windows: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Networking-home-computers-running-different-versions-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Networking-home-computers-running-different-versions-of-Windows</a>
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Disable firewall to test if it’s preventing you from sharing. If sharing works after disabling firewall, enable
 it back and make sure your firewall allows file and printer sharing. Refer your firewall documentation for more help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Try to map in clean boot state, and check if you map.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: After you have finished diagnosing, follow step 7 in the article to boot to
 normal startup.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the Operating System installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the game that you are installing?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do other disks work fine on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First check the game`s compatibility to check if it is compatible with the Operating System installed on your computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>For Windows Vista:</span></strong><span>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It might possibly be due to a faulty or damaged disk. Give it a wipe with a cloth and try installing again. Also, check the disk on a different
 computer to see if it working.</span></p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Who is the Manufacturer of your Secure Data card?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Is the Secure Data card reader integrated with your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Have you checked if the card works fine on a different computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Have you checked if the SD card shows up in the Device Manager and the Disk Management?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you go to the computer or the Secured Data Card readers website and download the drivers for the Secured Data Card reader.</span></span></p>
