<h2>            Why should I pay&#63; It&#38;&#35;39&#59;s your defective equipment. </h2>
                    
<p>I bought an Xbox one 2 months ago. Installed it in my bedroom and never moved it, never spilled anything near it, and now the power source cooling fan is grinding. It's a good thing I called customer service so they can tell me it will take up to three weeks
 to receive a new power source AFTER I send them mine. So, just to say this all again, I have done nothing wrong except to purchase your equipment and after two months it breaks. I have to mail in the power source so I can not use my unit for up to three weeks
 because of malfunctioning equipment. I have to pay for the shipping on the repair BOTH WAYS. You are a HUGE corporation with responsibilities to your customers, but hey, screw the little guys, we all ready have their money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's with all manufacturers</p>
<p>For accessories which doesn't include the main unit line cords controllers power supplies you ship it at your cost for the repair
</p>
<p>And it rarely takes 3 weeks it depends where you live in the us it's won't take 3 weeks however it depends how you send it</p>
<p>Over land the time taken is most likely going to be your shipping method</p>
<p>They send it express courier which is acthally pretty faster but it depends on where you live relative to the repair centre and how you ship the power supply back.</p>
<p>They also tell you up to 3 weeks in case it does take 3 weeks they can't say a week and it comes in two</p>
<p>You would be calling up complaining &nbsp;every day after they make the promise 1 week</p>
<p>They don't make promises they can't keep &nbsp;that gets them into trouble so they give you a range typically 1-3 weeks</p>
<p>Never assume the latest because literally you send it back depending on how you send it let's say 1 week</p>
<p>The guy receives it says defective then sends you out a new one via courier this isn't to say it won't take 3 weeks but it's their worst case that's why they give you a broad range</p>
<p>That way in case shipping delays happens or you ship it land by snailmail and then it doesn't arrive there for 1 week any they promise 1 week see where the issue is then you call and they just received it and you would have a legit complaint because they
 said 1 week</p>
<p>It's customer service don't promise something you can't keep </p>
<p>They promise something they can't keep</p>

<p>The accessories policy is actually pretty standard like your remote on your TV or controller on ps4 or xbox you pay the shipping to the company but they ship it back at their cost</p>
<p>Why would it make any sense that you pay the shipping back they don't know the rate that they ship it to you at
</p>
<p>Don't assume things</p>
<p>Yes I have shipped ms an accessory and a phone company's even before you just pay the shipping go them</p>
<p>That's why they don't even ask for a credit card unless you are out of warranty

<p>Accessories warranty is 90 days so I doubt you were charged they would've told you to go to a post office or a courtier and put insurance and tracking on it for one way
</p>
<p>You can't prebill a return shipping it's done at point of sale.</p>
<p>What would make you even think that if they don't ask you for a credit card to charge you to ship it back</p>

<p>Just take it to your nearest Microsoft store! They're all over the world! </p>
<p>Oh wait, they're not. </p>
<p>Could at least do what Apple does and send the replacement item out but charge your credit card for the replacement if you don't send it your faulty item or warranty isn't valid due to negligence...

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Firewall is your computer's built-in defense against a possible malware attack. Only allow apps that you trust to communicate through your firewall. To add an exception, you must be logged in as administrator. With that said, assuming you are logged
 in as administrator, what is the error message that you are getting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you need a refresher, here's how you can add an exception. <span>Go to
</span><strong><span>Control Panel&nbsp;</span></strong><span><span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>View by: Small icons</span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>Windows Firewall</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Allow
 an app or feature through Windows Firewall</span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Change settings</span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Allow another app</span></strong><span><span>&gt;
 Navigation to the location of the app</span></span><span><span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>OK</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Add</span></strong><span><span>. Restart your device afterwards.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We look forward to your response.</span></span></p>

<h2>            No Windows Mail&#63;&#63; EXPLAIN THIS</h2>
                    
<p>If there is no Windows Mail in Windows 7 can anyone explain these registry entries in my 4 month old Toshiba Laptop that came with Windows 7 Home premium??&nbsp; I have not installed anything that would have included Windows Mail....yet there it is.....OBVIOUSLY
 IT IS IN MY MACHINE....JUST NOT FOR ME TO USE!</p>
<p>I have already had to do a clean install due to problems with the pc running correctly, as most forum posters also seem to have a large amount of issues with Windows 7.....shouldt nt somebody be looking into the possiblity that the OEM's have corrupted every
 setup of Windows 7 on a new pc??? I am fed up with trying to get an answer about why I can't get a new PC to install updates, why I am running a NT Workstation on a $400 computer bought from WalMart, why Trusted Installer owns the machine and has all the privileges,
 why is there BlueTooth drivers when it is clearly labeled on the packaging and the machine specs that there is NO bluetooth capabilities, why is bitlocker drive encryption running actively when Microsoft says it is not a feature of Windows 7 Home Premium???&nbsp;
 Why .............this is a serious security issue and it needs to be exposed!!</p>

            replace the msoe.dll from Vista to get Windows Mail working again. I don't know why MS includes the files, but disabled them.

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />You'll need to download the drivers for your specific device from the manufacturer's website. Windows may not have the specific drivers needed to recognise the device.
<br />
<br />If you need help locating the correct drivers, please let me know what model your fingerprint device is and I'll have a look for you. Thanks!

    <title>Storage location for Archived emails, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jlgarza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storage location for Archived emails,</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.&nbsp; I was just hoping that someone could point me in the right direction to find my archived emails.&nbsp; I got some emails which were digital copies of a store receipt, so I archived them, I believe, but now I can't find the location where those
 emails would be stored.&nbsp; Can anyone point me in the right direction?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for any help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for the archive folder in Windows 10, for the Mail and Calendar app.&nbsp; I use the same app on my three Pc's, one is my main tower style PC for gaming, my second and most frequently used PC/Tablet is my Surface Pro 4, and my occasionally used Tablet
 is a Dell Venue 8 Pro 3845.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I had to guess which one I used to archive the Email/receipt, I would guess the Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; Do the archived messages&nbsp;go in one of the folders in my&nbsp;users folder in C: or would those go into my&nbsp;One Drive folder?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I'm at it, is there a way to prevent the Dell Venue tablet from downloading all of my email messages so that I don't have to delete the same files on multiple&nbsp;locations?&nbsp; I usually don't have a problem with this on my regular&nbsp;tower pc, as I only use
 it for PC Gaming, so it's not on often, but I do use the Dell Tablet as the most affordable in case of dropping or some other form of danger/damage, so I use it while eating in the&nbsp;living room or while sitting in the kitchen table, so I use it just enough
 to make sure that any message I get on my Surface will probably also download onto my Venue.&nbsp; It's something I'd love to be able to put into a suspended mode,&nbsp;so that it usually doesn't download my emails, but in a situation where I'd like it to, I could just
 enable it again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank anyone for your help here.&nbsp; I do appreciate any advice:)&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. I will assist you with this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows Mail App in Windows 10 does not have an archive &amp; backup function. Luckily all messages are stored locally in a Mail folder located deep in the hidden AppData folder.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Messages are stored as EML files. To read them outside the Windows Mail App you need a mail client capable of handling EML files (Microsoft Outlook, Windows Live Mail).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Please be extremely careful when browsing and handling these folders as your Mail Application might stop working if the folders are removed, renamed or moved. Also do not delete individual email messages in File Explorer,
 use Mail App's Delete function for that.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you go to “<strong>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\”,
</strong>open the folder that starts with </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>"microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps", open the folders “\LocalState\Indexed\LiveComm” inside that, then select the folder with the email you want to look at, then one folder down you'll see two folders, "Mail" and "People". Select the one you
 want, and then a few more folders down you'll (.eml) files for each of it has stored emails/contacts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope the above information helps. Reply with necessary information and the result to help you further. Thank you.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c03ed96e-fd34-4c85-9a7b-2de6d58173d9" title="Macademics">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue: </strong><em>I purchased the monthly unlimited mobile/landline calling to the UK subscription. However, I'm having trouble with the call. It keeps going straight to voicemail.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow-up questions: </strong>Have you tried calling the same number that goes straight to voicemail using a regular number to check if the same behavior occurs? How about other numbers, does the issue affect all the numbers you try to call or does
 it happening to a particular number? </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong><em>Does the mobile I'm calling need to have international calling to simply RECEIVE my call?&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>No, they do not need an international calling plan to receive a call. As long as their carrier permit calls from Skype, they should be able to accept the call.
</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 black screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 black screen</h2>
                    <p>Toshiba Satellite A135-S2386 running Windows 8.1 standard.&nbsp; The display is listed as ATI Radeon Xpress Series in the device manager.&nbsp; It is using the driver provided by the operating system - ATI Technologies dated 12/1/2008 and version 8.561.0.0.&nbsp; From
 a cold boot the blue Windows logo appears and then the mouse cursor in the middle of the screen, but the start screen with the tiles is not displayed.&nbsp; Maybe this sounds weird, but I think the start screen and tiles is there, but just not being shown on the
 screen.&nbsp; There appears to be nothing there, but I can move the cursor around on the black screen and click in frustration.&nbsp; Then I press the power button and the laptop enters sleep mode.&nbsp; Once in sleep mode I press power again to resume the computer and then
 the lock screen shows up and I can see the start screen and tiles and everything works like it should.&nbsp; This only happens from a cold boot.&nbsp; If the computer was on and restarted it does not happen.&nbsp; Has this happened to anyone else?&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; I will
 check for a newer display driver from ATI.&nbsp; The only driver on the Windows Update Catalog is for Windows Vista.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>****EDIT****</p>
<p>It appears to be a display driver issue.&nbsp; I changed the display driver to Microsoft Basic Display Adapter and the issue has gone away.&nbsp; I must have been mistaken, because Windows 8 does not appear to have a driver for ATI Radeon Xpress 200M chip.&nbsp; And the
 last release on AMD's website is for Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Dear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experience the same with a Packard Bell R3400 (quite old, I know) and the ATI Radeon Xpress 200 drivers installed (same version as yours).</p>
<p>
</p><p>These drivers have been running&nbsp;corectly under Windows 8&nbsp;Pro for more than one year now (update from XP to Windows 8 in Feb 2013).&nbsp; I just updated to Windows 8.1 Pro&nbsp;and get exactly the same problem (black screen) as you describe. I wonder what changed from
 Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 (Not a major release).</p>
<p>Also the mouse&nbsp;touchpad is not working when the video is ok and vide-versa.&nbsp;(the external mouse has no problem)</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the&nbsp;update to Windows 8, it&nbsp;wasn't really easy to find the right drivers as the ones for Windows 7 was not performant.</p>
<p>I found a site where people can write drivers for all hardware. From them I got the drivers for Windows 8.</p>
<p>I keep searching for their site as I don't find them back immediately. I let you know if find them back or if you have solution, I am interested.</p>

            Yes I have the dell xt and I have the same issue after updating to 8.1.&nbsp; The screen is all black but you can see the cursor.&nbsp; I know the tile menu is running because if I arrow around and hit enter I see the loading symbol next to the cursor.&nbsp;&nbsp; I usually
 close the lid and open and the display comes up.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has to be a driver issue because it doesn't act this way with the generic windows display driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; But who wants that?&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone has found a solution please post.

            <p>I have the same issue. I have a HP 1230n AMD Athlon, with a ATI Radeon 200 xpress video processor on the motherboard. I am running the 32 bit version of 8.1. I have an ACER 193 monitor that looks best at 1440/900. The generic Windows video driver won't support
 that format. There is no 8.1 driver available from MS or from ADM. The 8.1 compatibility tool says it supports the 200 xpress but IT DOES NOT. I have loaded a old vista driver version 8.593.100 from 2/10/10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above driver worked fine for 2 years on Windows 8 but has the Black Screen Issue on cold boot under Windows 8.1. It works only after a forced shut down and second boot. It appears to work fine once I get past this second boot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried the power options
 to inhibit sleep and hibernate but they don't work. It may be related to the driver thinking there is a second monitor. But again I can't figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a Radeon 200 Xpress&nbsp;8.1 driver, I can't find it. Why doesn't the generic Windows 8.1&nbsp;driver support 1440/900?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until this is fixed, the Radeon 200 Xpress should be declared NOT Compatible in 8.1.</p>

            <p>I figured it out. It is the Blank Screen problem associated with Windows 8.1 Fast Startup. If I disable this feature it does not require the second boot. Obviously the semi-hibernation is not properly stopping and restarting the Radeon 200 Xpress driver.</p>

<p>Hi Emma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that an application is blocking the camera from working, or that the camera drivers are outdated, etc. As a first troubleshooting step, we suggest that you check if your webcam driver is outdated, if it is, kindly update it and see if your webcam
 works. Here's how to check for an outdated webcam driver:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start </strong>button, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the search results.</li><li>Find your webcam under <strong>Imaging devices </strong>or <strong>Sound, video and game controllers</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the name of your webcam, and then select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, select the <strong>Driver Details </strong>
button, and look for a file name that includes <strong>stream.sys</strong>. If it's there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.</li><li>From the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, select <strong>Update Driver </strong>&gt;
<strong>Search automatically for driver software</strong>.</li><li>After installing the updated driver, restart your device and see if your webcam is working.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, feel free to post back to us.</p>

            Hi weichan621 ,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Ana. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting our support.
<br />
<br />Change the "Remote Desktop" port in Windows.
<br />
<br />To change it, we must modify the Windows registry. 
<br />
<br />Before modifying the connection port it is advisable to make sure that this port is not being used by another resource and that you allow the passage through the Firewall for the new port. 
<br />
<br />Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe). 
<br />Locate the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ System \ CurrentControlSet \ Control \ TerminalServer \ WinStations \ RDP-Tcp \ PortNumber 
<br />On the Edit menu, click Modify, Decimal, type the new port number, and then click OK. 
<br />Finally you have to exit the registry editor and restart the server. 
<br />
<br />To connect to the server, type the name or IP address of the server followed by a colon: and the port number. for ex. Server: 13256 or 192.168.1.10:13254

    <title>Windows Media Player Error&#58; Service execution failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swrain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player Error&#58; Service execution failed</h2>
                    I'm currently experiencing some troubles with Windows Media Player. I cannot open the program or open any media associated to the program (.mp3, .wmv, .wav, etc.) When I try to open the program itself, nothing happens. No message, nothing, it just doesn't
 open. When I try to open a file associated with the program, a message box will pop up with the location of the file in the title and description, and also in the description it will say "Server execution failed".&nbsp;
<div><br />

<div>An example image is here:&nbsp;<a href="http://i.imgur.com/W65Ybt7.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/W65Ybt7.png</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already tried uninstalling and reinstalling it by going to "Turn Windows Features On and Off", and I've also tried the method where you type&nbsp;<b>net localgroup "Administrators" "NT Authority\Local Service" /add
</b>into a command prompt with elevated privileges.</div>

<p>See if registering the scripting runtimes help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the Start Menu, go to <strong>All Programs</strong> - <strong>Accessories</strong> , right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> , and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> . Then type the following command:</p>
<p><strong>regsvr32.exe jscript.dll</strong></p>
<p>and press Enter. Also type the following command, and press Enter again:</p>

                    <p class="contentStandard">I've been using Network Share (HomeGroup before) for a while. Weeks ago I changed my Microsoft account password, and then here I got a problem.<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Let's say my main PC is PC A, and my second PC is PC B. When I try to access files on B from A, everything works fine. But when I try to access A from B in Network, it needs me to enter network credentials. Weird thing is, if I
 type in my new Microsoft account password, it will say ' The user name or password is incorrect ', I need to type in my previous password in order to access A. Problem is, every time after I shut down, or restart on B, and try to access A, it requires me to
 enter network credentials with a red ' The user name or password is incorrect ' at the pop up window's bottom, despite I clicked remember. And more weird thing is, if I tried to enter my current password in that popup, it will say ' The user name or password
 is incorrect ', but after I close the popup, I can access A!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Both PC's network is set to private. They have the same setting in Advanced sharing settings. I have turned off password protected sharing on both PC.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">So is there any way to let me use Network on B just like it is on A? I do not want to open File Explorer and enter the password again every time I start my PC.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you’ve already turned off password protected sharing, this issue could be due to the incorrect cached credentials stored on the PC. I suggest you to try the steps listed below and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>and categorize to view by <strong>small icons</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on <strong>User Accounts </strong>and choose your <strong>User Name.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
On the left pane, click on <strong>Manage your credentials. </strong>Under <strong>
Windows Credentials, </strong>remove the shared computer credentials and save the changes.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Exit <strong>Control Panel</strong> and restart the machine to see if the issue persists.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know how it goes.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h2>            New Xbox 360 Slim asking me to connect Wireless Networking Adapter</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>As mentioned in the subject line above I just got myself a new Xbox 360 Slim and when I turn it on it connects to Live for about 2 minutes and then disconnects. When I go to click test setting it then comes up with error.</p>
<p>"To use a wireless Internet connection, connect an Xbox 360 Wireless Networking Adapter to your console"</p>
<p>I have tried factory resting network connection, deleting profile, opening ports and leaving my xbox 360 unpowered for 20 min but nothing seems to work. Is this a know issue for repair or is there something else I can try?</p>

<pre>What Country/State/Province do you live in?  New Zealand<br />Modem brand &amp; model number: Linksys <span>WAG320N</span><br />Router brand &amp; model number: Same as above<br />If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter? Internal<br />Things you have tried: See above, can connect for about 2 min<br />Is UPnP Enabled? Yes<br />Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT? No<br />Any Error Codes you encounter: Can't connect to LIVE and then "To use a wireless Internet connection, connect an Xbox 360 Wireless Networking Adapter to your console"<br />Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? Telecom<br />After you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" press “Y” for "More Info”. In the pop-up that appears, what are the following values, if shown? (If a value below does not appear for you, just leave it blank.)<br />Unable to run test due to console asking me to connect adapter<br />W:<br />X:<br />Y:<br />Z:<br />ID:<br />L:<br />Q:<br />T:<br />

<p>Since that website has now been shut down, can anyone advise me what to do? After having not used the console for a week or so, booted it up, get into FIFA 14 and just I'm about to get into a match, boots me off Xbox Live and I now have this issue. I'm loathed
 to have to go out and spend money on it when it's my 4th Xbox 360 (3 originals all with disk drive issues) and Microsoft promised they'd fixed everything on the slim, I'd rather look towards getting a PS4.</p>

    <title>How do I convert a file path with a symbolic link to the original real - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tangosof  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I convert a file path with a symbolic link to the original real path&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I created a symbolic link with the mklink command in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
mklink /d c:\linkDir c:\realDir<br />
<br />
Is there a command that will return the path c:\realDir if I pass in the path with the symbolic link (c:\linkDir)?<br />
<br />
In python, there's a command called os.path.realpath(path).&nbsp; Unfortunately, Windows' symbolic links aren't recognized by Python versions older than 2.7; we're on 2.6.4.&nbsp; Is there an equivalent command in Windows 7?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<h2>            No sound since windows anniversary</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the windows anniversary update happened, my Insigina tablet sound isnt producing sound anymore(no audio ouput). I tried to update the driver of my soundcard and they did but i just cant find the driver for the multimedia audio controller, wich
 i suspect is an intel one(by checking the peripheric id). i tried to install it manually without success. ive reseted my tablet more than once and it did nothing. In msinfo, it doesnt detect a sound card. Here are the info. Sorry if my pc is setup in french!</p>

            <p>OK,</p>
<p>First I want you to try to download the intel driver utility and see if it finds any drivers for your tablet:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html?iid=dc_iduu<br />
</p>
<p>After this what I want to try is to install the drivers for the intel compute stick which has the same all-in-one cherry trail cpu as your tablet&nbsp;<a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/87383/Intel-Atom-x5-Z8300-Processor-2M-Cache-up-to-1_84-GHz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Intel®
 Atom™ x5-Z8300 Processor</a>&nbsp; you can see this on the page of intel</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://ark.intel.com/products/91065/Intel-Compute-Stick-STK1AW32SC#@specifications</p>
<p>
</p><p>so we are going to use the drivers of this computestick which is running the same OS windows 10 x86 as you have on your tablet and which should control video audio etc....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver is here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25730/System-on-a-Chip-SOC-Driver-Package-for-Intel-Compute-Stick-STK1AW32SC</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rest of the drivers for the compute stick are here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://ark.intel.com/products/91065/Intel-Compute-Stick-STK1AW32SC#@downloads &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which you can look at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this should also include the audio drivers as you can see on the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this will work, but it is worth a try. Let me know.</p>

<p><span>Hi BluebyrdM,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer before
 this issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, you may try to enable the hidden default administrator account on your computer and check
 if you can access it. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how you enable built-in admin account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to start and type&nbsp;<span>cmd</span> in the search field.</span></li><li><span>Right-click on&nbsp;<span>cmd</span> listed and click on “<span>Run as Administrator”.</span></span></li><li><span>Once the command prompt opens, type the following command and press enter:</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>net user administrator /active:yes</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You should see a message that the command completed successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Log out, and you’ll now see the Administrator account.&nbsp; Log in to the Administrator account and create a new administrator account
 and check if it works fine.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp; BluebyrdM,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are facing low disk space while copying and pasting to a new user profile, you may try to use the option to cut and paste. Cut
 and paste will not use much disk space. The files in the old user account will be moved to the new user account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you copy and paste the files will still be there in the old user account and that will consume lot of space on the hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To Cut the files and paste it to a different location, you may follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 the location where you want to copy the files from.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 all the files.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Press
 the Alt key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Edit menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Cut.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Navigate
 to the new user account where you want to paste it and Right click in the Windows explorer and click on paste.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This will move the files without consuming much space.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t select multiple files in file explorer using either shift or ctrl keys. Keyboard works fine.</h2>
                    Any idea why this would be the case? Every "answer" I find says to just use the shift key, but for some reason this is NOT working. The keyboard works fine, so it's not my shift key!

            Hi,<br />
1. Try Ctrl+Alt+right arrow key (or maybe left or up or down arrow key.)<br />
2. Access Display Settings (from Control Panel or right-clicking the desktop) and look for an option to rotate the screen.<br />
3. Check the System Tray for an icon for Nvidia Control Panel or similar and look for the "rotate screen" option there.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Don

<h2>            Hard disk space not enough for Game of war game in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: windows Games</p>
<p>I was talk to customer support about moving my Gears of war game to my mechanical HDD and they told me where ever you install windows 10 on that's where the game will be. I installed my windows 10 on a 120 GB SSD and don't have space for my Gears of war
 Game :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish microsoft gave us the option what HDD to download the game on like steam, orgin, and ubisoft. I don't think people will be buy games from the windows store.</p>

            <p>Doesn't this game allow you to <strong>choose </strong>where it should installed? Usually,&nbsp;every installer offers a
<strong>"custom installation"</strong> where you can change the default path from C:\... to wherever you wish (example: D:\Games, or where you like it). Anup Karkal's suggestion -</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em>"Please refer the steps to change the save location of new apps,</em></span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. In Search Bar type Settings and then Enter.</span></em></p>

</em>-</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is also doable. It has the disadvantage that you're prescribing general settings here which may or not fit your individual storing wishes. Think of a \Games folder that may contain special subfolders like \Games\Bethesda\..., \Games\Lucas
 Arts\... or whatever... would be a bit more organized, then.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you want a personal opinion, be my guest: I've installed most of my newer games on a 256 GB SSD drive, only to reduce
<strong>loading times </strong>(you enter a new area, and... either you are patient, or make use of the SSD speed). Nearly all games prior to 2015/2016 are totally happy with a fast HDD and don't need that speed boost.</span></p>
