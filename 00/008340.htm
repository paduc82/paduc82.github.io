<h2>            Storage Capacity&#47;Mysterious Disappearing Emails</h2>
                    I've had a Hotmail/Outlook email account since 2010 that contains lots of emails. I delete unwanted/unneeded ones every week. However, recently I noticed that a number of emails have been mysteriously sent to my Deleted Items file. I didn't delete the
 emails so I'm confused. I'm wondering what happened and why?

            I did what you said and it shows I haven't created any rules. I'm not techy enough to set up something like that. That's why I asked if there's a storage limit. I'm concerned that emails I still need have been mysterious deleted.&nbsp;

            If your mailbox is full, you will be sent a message stating that your account is over the quota limits and you will not be able to send or receive messages. In addition, people who send you email messages get an error message stating that the inbox is full.
<br />If you do not have any rules, another reason why this is happening is that you have your account synchronized with another email account or in your phone you have the settings for when you delete the messages on your mobile they are also deleted from the server.

            None of those apply to me. Again, I'm not techy enough so I wouldn't know how to
<span>synchronized with another email account or do anything in my phone the settings like you described. Literally, it was like 1 day I had 500 emails in my Inbox and 300 deleted messages then the next day I had 100 emails in my Inbox and 700 deleted
 emails. I didn't do anything. I think I may have lost some necessary emails and I need them back. Also want to know if Hotmail/Outlook has a storage capacity limit?</span>

            Yes, Microsoft offers 15 GB of email storage space per free Outlook.com account. Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal subscribers get 50 GB of space.

            Hello Chantelasia!
<br />To view your storage, go to settings&gt; view all the outlook settings.
<br />Select the general option&gt; storage.
<br />I also suggest checking the option to clean.
<br />In configuration, select the option mail&gt; clean. Since this rule is executed to keep the inbox clean.
<br />What may be happening is that someone has their password and set up their email account.
<br />
<br />If you have another question, I am here to help you.

    <title>OneNote sync open notebooks and left pane organization - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kent king  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote sync open notebooks and left pane organization</h2>
                    <p>I opened a ticket with MS O365 support and they suggested I post this here. We would like to know if Microsoft has any plans to to make OneNote have the ability to auto open notebooks when they are created on other devices. Also, we would like to know if
 OneNote can sync the order of open notebooks in the left hand pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the scenario .... our executives go on long road trips and create notebooks on their iPad but come back to the office and don't see the notebook on the windows desktop OneNote application. Since they have been away from the office so long they can't
 remember which ones they need to open. Compounding the issue is the fact that when they need to find out what notebook they haven't opened on the desktop they can't since they have 40 or 50 notebooks and the left hand pane is in a different order on each device.
 They are ready to give up on this product because of the amount of time needed to keep everything in order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft says they don't support both of these scenerios, but I can't understand why. It seems to me that busy executives don't want to spend there day do the same thing over and over (organizing Notebook order in the left hand pane and open Notebooks on
 each device). Cant that configuration be sync with OneDrive as well? Seems like a major oversight to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any opinions on this or has a work around, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks;</p>
<p>Kent</p>

            Hi Kent,<br />
<br />
To access the OneNote files on multiple devices, we can create a OneNote document in the OneDrive for Business library with OneNote 2016 client and then open it on other computers. Here are the detailed steps for your reference:
<br />
<br />
1. Start OneNote 2016 client and sign in with our current Office 365 account via FILE &gt; Account &gt; Switch account.
<br />
2. Create a file via FILE &gt; New &gt; OneDrive – companyname. <br />
3. Type the notebook name and click Create. Then edit the document with OneNote and it is synced automatically.
<br />
4. On another computer, start OneNote client and sign in with the same Office 365 account.
<br />
5. Click FILE &gt; Open &gt; Open from other locations &gt; OneDrive – companyname &gt; select the newly created &nbsp;OneNote file &gt; Open.
<br />
<br />
To access the same OneNote file with OneNote client on multiple devices, we need to save it to an online location instead of a local folder on the computer.
<br />
<br />
Regarding OneNote has the ability to auto open notebooks when they are created on other devices, I’d like to invite you to submit your feedback to our dedicated
<a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote User Voice forum</a>. Providing your feedback is the best way to perfect our products and services.

<h3> m&#234;skwananihsi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2011 Blank emails</h2>
                    <p>Recently, only my hotmail account, began sending me completely blank emails.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The left hand pane that list the email accounts will show a number of unread emails;&nbsp;</li><li>These emails have no date, no from, no title, no body are at the bottom of the 700+ emails in the centre pane that shows the message headings</li><li>In order to retrieve the content I have to login to my Hotmail account on the web</li></ul>
<p>I've been searching around for a solution that I can execute but no joy! &nbsp;All that I have come up with are solutions for Windows or that are 3 or 4+ years old and I'm not ready to attempt any stone age software engineering to solve this problem.</p>

            <p>Hi Mêskwananihsi,<br />
<br />
Since you can see the email content of those affected emails in your Hotmail account on the web, it should be a display issue in the Outlook 2011 for Mac client. In this case, I suggest you delete your account and re-add it so all your emails can be synced
 from the server again, and check if the issue can be fixed. Note that we recommend you
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Export-items-to-an-archive-file-in-Outlook-for-Mac-281a62bf-cc42-46b1-9ad5-6bda80ca3106#ID0EAABAAA=2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
backup all your data via exporting items to an archive file</a> in case of potential data loss.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I’d like to collect the following information for further troubleshooting:<br />
1. Some relevant screenshots about the symptom.<br />
2. The detailed version of Outlook 2011 for Mac client. (In <strong>Outlook</strong>&gt;<strong> About Outloo</strong>k.)<br />
3. By saying ‘only my hotmail’, do you mean the other personal accounts are still working fine in the Outlook for Mac client?<br />
4. Did you make any changes to your account or Mac before the issue occurred? (Like some configurations in the account or upgrading the Mac OS.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Sam<br />

</li><li>Hardware upgrades on my MacBook Pro 15 inch mid 2009&nbsp;in late December 2016
<ol>
<li>Memory from the original factory installed 4 GB to 8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3; and,</li><li>Storage from the original factory installed hard drive &nbsp;to a Samsung V-NAND SSD 850 EVO</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>The only oddity was before the hard drive upgrade I had to "call the Hotmail emails in". &nbsp;After the hard drive upgrade it immediately started to "cycle" itself just like my Gmail and corporate accounts. &nbsp;I also lost all of my past emails and have begun
 the laborious process of trying to repopulate Outlook from either the corporate or the Hotmail and Gmail web accounts. While I backed everything up on Time Machine prior to the upgrade and I still have the original hard drive, its another learning experience
 I don't have the time or patience for.</li></ol>

<h2>            Outlook 2007&#58; Meeting Tab is missing</h2>
                    We have a user that is missing the Meeting tab from his Outlook 2007 when he opens a new Meeting request. Does anyone have any idea why this would be? I was able to create a Quick Access Toolbar icon for the ShoreTel Conferencing button, but that doesn't
 explain what happened to the whole tab with it.

            I solved the issue. When starting Outlook 2007 in Safe Mode, the Meeting / Appointment Tab returned. I proceeded to disable each Add-in, one at a time, to figure out the culprit and it was the iCloud Add-in by Apple.
<br />
<br />
Figured I'd post here in case anyone else has the same issue.<br />

</p><blockquote>
<p>Thanks to both of you for your replies and the information about how auto-complete works.&nbsp; I understand the feature better now.&nbsp; So it looks like even if I send an email to a group, auto-complete does not remember the group for a subsequent email.&nbsp; Auto-complete
 works fine for individual addresses, just not for groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Office 365 Pro Plus Version 1707, Build 8326.2073.&nbsp; Someone else here using 365 (V1707, slightly later Build) does not have this issue with auto-complete remembering groups.&nbsp; This is not a huge problem (costs me an extra click), but it's odd
 that this used to work and now it does not.&nbsp; The same time that group auto-complete stopped working, the order of my address books also changed - moving my local contacts below the global contact list.&nbsp; This may be completely unrelated, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other ideas about what may be causing group auto-complete to not work on my PC, I would appreciate those.&nbsp; Otherwise, thank you again for your responses - and the auto-complete education!</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this issue as well.&nbsp; Autocomplete DID work with distribution lists in Outlook 2010.&nbsp; So this is another handy feature that Microsoft has removed in 2016/365?</p>

<p>Apparently some phones come with sim cards and some don't.It's very odd yours didn't come with one since I bought my Nokia 1661 prepaid phone from T-Mobile (just got shipped yesterday) and it came with the sim card as well as a headset and charger. But I
 was looking at the Nokia 1208 as well and that one did not come with a sim card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ps. Mine was the $20 dollar package too. Though maybe it's some sort of special they have going on last month/this month that includes the sim card. Free shipping also.</p>

<h3> kls91  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surfacebook Pro 4 - Onenote 2016 freezing&#47;buttons disappear while scrolling or zooming</h2>
                    <p>This is on a Surfacebook Pro 4</p>
<p>
</p><p>When zooming in on slides in OneNote, the slides will disappear. This was a well known issue that required you to simply zoom out and they would reappear. After the major windows update in October, this has gotten much worse. If a user scrolls too quickly
 or zooms in, the content disappears, as do button tooltips/images as you mouse over there. Even the "Exit" button disappears. To fix it, it requires closing and reopening OneNote, which gets problematic when you are reviewing notes and freezing every 2 minutes.
 (Even with only one small workbook open).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I know this has been documented, but the Surfacebook Pro 4 stylus will not be recognized often until a reboot. Although I really loved my Surfacebook, I would recommend people steer away from them until these issues are fixed. It's quite disappointing
 to see these issues continue on, especially when caused by forced updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, OneNote crashes quite routinely since the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to point out is it not just me, but another four Surfacebook&nbsp; pro 4 users I know as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Darian,</p>
<p>I really appreciate the help. Unfortunately, it did not work and OneNote continued to crash if one attempts to scroll quickly (which, I must add, is NOT that quickly at all.) Simply scrolling at a snail's pace isn't a viable use for a note taking program,
 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also good to note is that after a crash, hand written notes will often be crammed&nbsp; to the left side of the screen, overlapping eachother and completely unreadable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I appreciate the help, I think it would be worthy of Microsoft to take note that users are attempting to use Microsoft Software on a Microsoft OS on hardware sold and packaged by Microsoft. I am not sure "video configuration" being incompatible seems
 like a reasonable explanation given that one would assume a company would keep it's products synergistic. Additionally, I believe it is noteworthy that these issues can be seen in many instanced in a single classroom of Microsoft Software, OS, and Hardware
 packages. Also interesting is the the Mac users appear to have no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the help, but would also appreciate if Microsoft might look into these issues as, even within a single classroom, there are multiple instances of the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the negativity, please take it as frustration with constant crashing and loss of information, and not frustration with your answer. I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Customer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Export to Excel</span> button is visible and available even if we don't install Office client in our computer. Thus, it seems not to be related to Office version.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To narrow down this behavior, we would like to confirm the following two information:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>By "</span><span>This
 option is available on some systems (IE11/Office 2016)</span><span>", whether do you mean that some of your colleagueas
 can see and use that button in their computers or you can see and use that button in their computer with your work account?
</span></li><li><span>Please confirm whether you can see the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Export to Excel</span><span> button in other site collections.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, please contact your IT department to check whether you are in a group which is assigned with a permission level without

    <title>Autorecover file from word won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autorecover file from word won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>I have finally located the auto recover files for word when it crashed earlier but they won't open. It comes up saying &nbsp;'Word can't open the file because the file format does not match the file extension.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I went into the location for where the auto recovery files are saved there was no location selected, so as a office365 user I eventually found where they were on my mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to open the file through word is not possible because the saved location seems to be hidden when you go to file...open...</p>

            <p>Pardon my jumping in but I can't stay quiet on this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding an AutoRecovery file that you can't open... use Finder and make a copy.
<strong>Rename the copy taking the file extension off of the name.</strong> Thus if the file is "AutoRecovery My File.docx"... remove the ".docx" from the name. Ignore the warning the system will give you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, from <strong>Finder</strong> right click (A.K.A <strong>Control + Click</strong>) on the file and use
<strong>Open With...</strong> to open the file with Word. The file will open as <strong>
Read Only</strong> and just <strong>Duplicate</strong> it so you can get a new working copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now some personal advice...</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I don't trust the default AutoRecovery feature and its unspecified "secret" location. I prefer to assign AutoRecovery files to a location that I specify.</li><li>With MacOffice 2016 the location must be within the "Sandbox" designated by Apple. I use:&nbsp;<strong>~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/AutoRecoveryDocs</strong></li><li>Open <strong>Finder</strong> and press <strong>Shift+Command+G</strong> and a GoTo box will open. Paste the above bolded path, including the tilde "~" symbol into the box, remove the "<strong>AutoRecoveryDocs</strong>" folder name and click
<strong>Go</strong>.</li><li>Now create the "<strong>AutoRecoveryDocs</strong>" folder as a subfolder in the "<strong>User Content</strong>" folder.</li><li>Open <strong>Word &gt; Preferences &gt; File Locations</strong> and set the AutoRecovery files path to this location. The path will will look like
<strong>/Users/&lt;your login name&gt;/</strong><strong>Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/AutoRecoveryDocs</strong></li><li>Set your AutoRecovery time period to no more than 10 minutes but not less than 3 minutes.</li><li><strong>Quit and restart Word</strong>, allowing the new setting to be stored in Word's internal preference file.</li><li>Finally, make sure you don't just rely on AutoRecovery as a "backup" function, because it's not. It only works if Word crashes. If you accidentally write over something you didn't mean to... you are SOL... so...</li><li>Turn on <strong>Word &gt; Preference &gt; File Save &gt; Always Create a Backup</strong> so at least you have one previous copy before you accidentally destroyed your file and every time you pause to think as you are editing, press
<strong>Command+S</strong> to save your file.</li><li>However... if your files are <strong>REALLY</strong> important to you then download
<strong>GUB (Zapps Pro GOT-UR-BACK)</strong> from my website. It <strong>FREE</strong> so I'm not trying to sell you anything. In MacOffice it will optionally keep (your choice) up to 5-levels of backup on
<strong>Word</strong> and <strong>Excel</strong> documents. </li><li>It's important for you to understand, this is not an "auto" backup, it is a file overwrite protection mechanism. Every time you click
<strong>Command+S</strong> or click the <strong>Save</strong> button it stores the previous version of the document you are editing, and it will store up to 5 of them. They are held in a convenient folder that you can access and do not clutter up your Documents
 directory. If you use GUB, you turn off Word's "Always Create a Backup" feature.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            E71 - New 400&#42; firmware - Chat application - No alert sounds or vibration</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just upgraded to the 400.* firmware without major issues. I was pleasently surprised to see the new Chat application. Although not the best it works on my unlimited browsing service where no other IM app will so I am thrilled!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one issue is that there is no sound or vibration alert for new messages (using Google Talk). I have checked and unchecked the more-&gt;options play sound/vibration boxes without effect. Is anyone else experiencing this? Any suggested solutions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            Did a reformat and restored my settings. It is now working. I imagine it was some interference from Nimbuzz, another IM app.

<p>It is not actting the way I would like it to. AUdio and vibration alerts only happen when you are outside that actual chat window. While you are actually viewing the messages there are no alerts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is annoying because often the other person will take a minute or more to reply (busy doing something else) and you will not be alerted when they do reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Main screen pop-up would be nice too.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you check that the 3.0.0.290 installation file has not been corrupted during the download? This can be done by right clicking the Nokia_Ovi_Suite_webinstaller_ALL.exe. Then from the Properties -&gt; Digital Sigantures (tab) you should be able to see Nokia
 signature. Select that and then push the Details button and you should see a new dialog and there the text "This digital signature is OK." if the file is valid. If you can get find the signature, the file has got corrupted and you should try to download the
 latest version again <a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_Ovi_Suite_webinstaller_ALL.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
from here.</a></p>

<p>Could you give some more information about this issue. Such as when you are getting it? Are you able to start the installation or does it appear already during loading of the installer. A screenshot would be nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also recommend to verify the signature.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive - Cant sync Account</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've got a customer that cant sync his OneDrive with the OneDrive Client on his PC. With the App from the Store it works but not with the installed Client. I can enter the mail address and password, then the target folder and the a error message appears
 "Please contact the support&nbsp; etc..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried it on multiple PCs and everywhere was the same message. I think its a problem with the O365 Account, i had to rename it and since then its not working anymore - But the login in O365 and everything else works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why its not working?</p>

 Windows installer displayed a box stating that the file was not a valid installation file.&nbsp; A second computer with the same OS has the same version of MSE and checking Windows Update states that there are no updates available.&nbsp; Yet first computer is trying

            <p>If the PC has 4.3.215.0 it is already up to date. 216 and 215 are virtually the same. The 216 install is targeting the older version of MSE for upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My recommendation, after reviewing the below and taking action to remove conflicting software and addressing any other potential issues with your setup, is to

<p>Please review the following:</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software. See this Wiki article:</p>

What do you mean by #9 and Step #2?</p>
<p>The article here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_start/uninstalling-microsoft-security-essentials/316493c2-8885-46b0-afba-28ebd45c0838">

<p>doesn't include either of those indicators.</p>
<p>Are you manually executing the steps outlined in the section for creating and running MSEREMOVAL.BAT?</p>
<p>I just edited the&nbsp; Wiki article as I noticed that it included instructions to save an attachment, which was the instruction from the Support email that this was taken from. You need to create the MSEREMOVAL.BAT file following the steps in the article.

            Looks like I took a wrong turn.&nbsp; The article above had an "official solution" and took me to this:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</a>.&nbsp; Now it gets more complicated.&nbsp; After that failed, I tried manually deleting anything that had MSE in it's title.&nbsp; I was not able to delete the folder in C:\Program
 Files but the backup file was deleted.&nbsp; I then tried to follow the correct instructions and I knew that it would not work because of the deleted backup file.&nbsp; What now.&nbsp; How can I uninstall MSE without that file?&nbsp; Sorry for the mess.&nbsp; Appreciate your quick
 responses and your time.&nbsp; Is this a hopeless cause?&nbsp; I ran ccleaner to remove the leftovers so the recycle bin is empty.

            <p>Yes, the official solution is viable.</p>
<p>However, failing that, simply go back to the wiki and create the batch file (MSEREMOVAL.BAT) by copying and pasting the lines of text into a new Notepad file as explained in the Wiki. After saving it, run the file as administrator and it should clean up
 the mess.</p>
<p>Another option would be to use either of the free RevoUninstaller or AppRemover products. They are good, but may still leave detritus behind.</p>

            What I have tried today was to restore the system to yesterday before the first attempt to install the update.&nbsp; I then tried following command prompt directions and that failed.&nbsp; There are two problems.&nbsp; When entering the information in the command prompt
 the folder in Program Files is named Microsoft Security&nbsp;Client and there is no executable file that it will except - even with me changing the title to MSC.&nbsp;&nbsp;The file that is there is dw20shared.msi in the backup folder.&nbsp; I think it is looking for epp.msi.&nbsp;
 I will now try to go back and create the batch file.&nbsp; I just tried the batch file and that didn't work.&nbsp; Everything I try looks to my external backup drive for the .exe file.&nbsp; I am using Acronis backup and the files are coded.&nbsp; The only thing I have accomplished
 so far is restoring a usable MSE with the latest update.&nbsp; Any more suggestions?

<p>I'm not clear on what you are doing in that sentence... Are you trying to upgrade again or uninstall so that you can reinstall?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And am I understanding that you created the batch file for uninstalling MSE and it failed?</p>

            The answer to the first question is yes.&nbsp; I restored the system to yesterday and unchecked Windows Update for the MSE upgrade.&nbsp; At first I tried to complete the first attempt of the official solution as I had missed the last part.&nbsp; I created the batch
 file and it did the same thing.&nbsp; Told me in a msg box that the Microsoft Security Client folder did not have an valid executable file.&nbsp;Basically the instructions gave me Microsoft Security Essentials as the target folder in the command line string.&nbsp; The answer
 to your third question is yes it failed as it came up with the same messages.&nbsp; The answer to your 4th question is that when the installation is getting ready to install the same message box appears that shows my F:\ drive as its target.&nbsp; My F:\ drive is my
 Acronis backup location.&nbsp; It just won't accept anything else.&nbsp; I tried searching for the epp.msi file it refers to in the message box that comes up when you try to change the locatrion.&nbs

            Hi,
<br />
<br />There is no retail Microsoft Office Pro Plus 2016. That is a volume license. You can get it as an individual through the Home Use Program but you can't just buy it in compliance with the license agreement. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news. I think you got scammed.
<br />
<br />Also, these licenses are valid for installation on a single computer at a time.
<br />
<br />This forum is a user-to-user support forum. I am a fellow user.

<p>I already have the iso for office pro plus 2016. The problem seems to be with the registry or something, cause it's the same iso i used before and it worked perfectly fine in the past. I get the error before it even tries to install. I'll double click on
 the iso and the orange window will come up saying it's preparing to install and then a second later I'll get the message mentioned previously.</p>

<p>Hi Charles, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue happens when there's a problem setting up your account. There could be a wrong detail on the account information. For us to sort this out, we would like to know the Account Type you used when you set up your account. Also, are you using a personal
 or work email? Which version of Outlook are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, kindly make sure that you're using the correct port numbers for the Incoming and Outgoing server. For us to make sure that you have the correct ports, we suggest that you contact your email service provider for them to help you with the ports.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response. </p>

<div>Hi James,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for posting your issue on Microsoft Community forum. Which Outlook desktop client version are you using? Please provide us with the detailed information about this
<em>(e.g. Version 1905 (Build 11629.20246)</em>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>May I know where did you deleted those emails in Outlook desktop client or Outlook Web App or else?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have set up Office 365 mailbox on multiple devices, please temporarily disconnect all the devices/client
<em>(e.g. Outlook desktop/mobile client)</em> and then try to check this issue via only using Office 365 webmail App (Outlook Web App) to see whether the problem still occurs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best regards,</div>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing, see no changes in upgrade behavior so far....(Not that I expected any |--)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just read through <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/07/13/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-16241-pc-build-15230-mobile/#3tMe2pY8ZSOLWGr6.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the release notes</a>, and you know, not that bad, some nice additions.</p>
<p>But I think this is worth mentioning:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>We’re investigating your reports that after upgrading to the latest Insider Preview builds, some network settings are lost and revert to default settings. Static IP address configuration is reverted to DHCP. Networks which were marked as private
 are reverted to public. After the upgrade you will need to manually readjust your network settings back to your preferred settings.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>PS Just realized, no new ninja's! So let me correct, <em>great </em>release notes |--)</span></p>

<p>After much difficulty with updates after 16199, I finally bit the bullet, downloaded a 16237 iso image and did a clean install. &nbsp;While extremely tedious to reinstall and configure everything, my update experience with 16241 is now flawless once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous attempts to update would cause my 3.5Ghz/32Gb/512Gb SSD system to churn for 5 hours or more, then fail. &nbsp;Here's what I logged for build 16241:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Preparing to Install - About 5 mins</p>
<p>Downloading - 2 minutes</p>
<p>Installing - 49 minutes &nbsp;(stalls around 77% and 97%)</p>
<p>Reboot &amp; Configuring - 1 minute</p>
<p>Working on updates, this will take a while... &nbsp;- 5 minutes to get to 75%</p>
<p>Reboot</p>
<p>Working on updates, this will take a while... - 6 more minutes to go from 75% to 100%</p>
<p>Reboot</p>
<p>Login, "Hi...We've updated your PC...." - 2 minutes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total time = 1hr 10 mins</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so much better than before. &nbsp;Hope it lasts!</p>

    <title>Change the way drag and drop inserts Excel files into Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cak1234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change the way drag and drop inserts Excel files into Word</h2>
                    
<p>I have a folder that has Excel files with two worksheets on it.&nbsp; The first is specific data with xy coordinates, the other is a plot of those cooridinates.&nbsp; When my friend drags one of the files into Word, it inserts it as an Microsoft Excel 2003 file.&nbsp;
 He is able to see the plot with all the data points on it.&nbsp; When I do it, it inserts it as an Excel Graph Chart.&nbsp; It isn't linked to the data points.&nbsp; I can go through Word to insert the object as an Excel file type, but that will slow things down, because
 I have over 30 of these files to be added.<br />
<br />
My question:<br />
Is there a way to change the drag and drop settings in Word, so when I drag an Excel file into Word it will insert it as an Excel file type and not Excel graph chart type?</p>

 Google seach brought me here. I figured it out.&nbsp; To attach the file as an Icon. Select the&nbsp;table/Graph. &nbsp;Right Click and select Worksheet Object&gt;Convert</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the Convert window, clik on Display as Icon radio button and click OK. &nbsp;</p>

            The time interval for syncing data from the phone to your windows live account is set by you!&nbsp; You can change it by tapping Settings &gt; email + accounts &gt; tap your windows live account &gt; change the option under "Download new content."<br />
<br />
You can force a sync while on the email + accounts screen by pressing &amp; holding your finger on your windows live account until a menu appears, then tap "synchronize"<br />
