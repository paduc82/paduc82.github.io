<h2>            UPDATE&#58; Audio issues in Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 10049</h2>
                    <p>Hello Insiders!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We got a new build out in record time, I hope you're all installing build 10049!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the latest update on audio issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Issues that should be fixed</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Realtek driver install timeout (the infamous error 0x800705b4)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. VIA HD Audio only playing system sounds and sounds from certain programs</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Issues that should be fixed but didn't make it into Build 10049</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Audio configurations using 5.1 don't work and give the error "unable to play test tone" - We've fixed this but are still testing our fix. I hope to get&nbsp;this into the next build, but it will depend on when we finish our testing vs. when the next build
 is snapped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Some issues with changing endpoints (i.e. plugging/unplugging headphones and microphones) have been fixed, but I believe there are still some issues out there.
<strong>If you have such an issue, please start a new thread so we can work on it together.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Issues that are still under investigation</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Conexant issue on 64-bit systems with &gt;3GB of memory, the workaround is to set the system to a maximum of 3GB of memory. We have an understanding of this issue (it has to do with the inability of the hardware to deal with 64-bit addressing) but we're
 still trying to decide on the safest way to fix the bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Conexant issue on 32-bit systems. We have a repro here at Microsoft and are trying to find the root cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. IDT requires some tweaking to work. We don't have a reliable repro yet and are trying to put one together.
<strong>There are a number of threads in the forum on this issue, if you're seeing this please add your info to one of those threads.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Creative X-Fi driver issues. The latest driver package from Creative didn't resolve all of the issues (specifically with the control panel) and so Creative is still working on updating the driver package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help in tracking down and fixing these bugs is hugely valuable. As always, I want to express my appreciation for your ongoing work!</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 Will Not Install After In-Place Reinstall Of Operating System</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This weekend, I spent some time doing a non-destructive reinstall of Windows 7 Home Premium (OEM), and things went rather smooth except that IE 10 and/or IE 11 would not install.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing that blew my mind, though, was seeing both browser versions offered as optional updates. I always thought *any* version of Internet Explorer was considered an important update.<br />
<br />
I followed the advice on this web page, but still had no success. I have since restored 7 from an image until I figure out what to do next...<br />
<br />
</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.wintips.org/fix-error-code-9c59-insternet-explorer-installation-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FIX Error Code 9C59: Internet Explorer Installation failed (IE10, IE11)</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent much time on this, and I would like to figure out why...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) IE 10 and/or 11 will not install.</p>
<p>(2) Why are these browsers listed in the optional updates section of Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit on a Dell quad-core desktop. The OEM installation DVD is not a recovery disc, and it only has the operating system installed on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, I have had this same (IE 11 installation) problem on a Toshiba laptop, and a Samsung laptop (Windows 7 on both) after doing in-place non-destructive operating system reinstallations on both, although neither one offered Internet Explorer
 as optional updates.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not you might as well stop focusing on what level of IE you are at and instead find out why your OS is not up-to-date in terms of security patches.&nbsp; That is typically the most common cause of the symptom that you are investigating.</p>

</p><p>Have you found out if you have current maintenance for whatever level of IE your OS has now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like now the best you could have, if not already having IE11, would be to be stuck at Jan 2016 with no more maintenance</p>

    <title>HowTo&#63; Avoid having &#34;Cookie Challenge Prompt&#34; behind tab - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HowTo&#63; Avoid having &#34;Cookie Challenge Prompt&#34; behind tab so appears locked&#63;</h2>
                    <ul>
<li>Win-7-64-Pro-Sp1 with all updates</li><li>IE-9 with all updates</li></ul>
<p>On a regular basis, IE9 appears to hang and is unresponsive. When I try to do something with IE9, like click any widget, there will just be an error bell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes I just use TaskManager to "End Process Tree" and start over ... with muttering and expletive deleted.</p>
<p>However, it sometimes is the case that there is a "zombie cookie challenge" behind the IE9 window that is difficult to see, and also difficult to dismiss in order to get IE9 back to being responsive.</p>
<p>For security, I make some changes to the default IE9 settings, including having primary cookes challenged, and secondary cookies refused. That may be erring on the side of extra security, and may or may not be appropriate.</p>
<p>If i hover the mouse over the Aero icon on the TaskBar for the multiple IE9 instances that are running, sometimes one of them will cause the cookie challenge prompt to be visible during the time of the hover. It will disappear behind the IE9 window if I
 attempt to move the mouse to the cookie challenge popup.</p>
<p>I am usually able to get the cookie challenge to dismiss if I press the Enter key for the default of "Accept Cookie (once)". Typically, it takes several presses of the Enter key to get IE9 back to being responsive, as a single webpage may have multiple cookies.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong? PEBKAC? Would another setting be appropriate? I am reluctant to use the default for cookie handling, as that seems to allow way too many cookies.
</p>
<p>Or is this a bug to have the "cookie challenge prompt" popup behind the IE9 window? The effect is that IE9 is unresponsive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
If you would like to try something a bit more refined use Resource Monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. start that from the TM Performance tab.&nbsp; Then in the Overview tab, sort by Image.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then scroll down to the last&nbsp; iexplore.exe&nbsp; and click its box to pin it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue clicking
 until all iexplore.exe tasks are pinned.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The reason to sort and scroll down to the last iexplore.exe task may now be evident.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Then sort column&nbsp; Average CPU descending.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then press Home and Menu, A&nbsp; (so, right-click&nbsp; Analayze Wait Chain&nbsp; on the iexplore.exe&nbsp;
 task which is doing the least.)&nbsp;&nbsp; 19 times out of 20 this finds a Task which has a thread in deadlock chained to itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing the task via that dialog lets it retry in its own window via recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp; ProcExp provides us the capability of killing separate
 threads instead of whole tasks but I tried using that a few times and found that the net result would be killing all threads which would then have the effect of killing the task, so now I just kill the deadlocked task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; sometimes is the case that there is a "zombie cookie challenge" behind the IE9 window that is difficult to see</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW I have never heard of that specifically but I have occasionally had windows which have the wrong Z-order and then end up behind other ones which don't have focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case I would try tricks like using keyboard commands which could still have
 effect even though the window they are being received by can't be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if the hidden window has a&nbsp; Move&nbsp; command you could try using&nbsp; Alt-Space, M&nbsp; even though you don't see where it is being directed to and then use your cursor keys to move
 the window somewhere where it is more visible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Etc.&nbsp; Note that such procedures should only be necessary if the window is a modal dialog;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g. otherwise you should be able to minimize or shift things out of the way which are currently on "top" of the problem
 window.&nbsp;&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; I am usually able to get the cookie challenge to dismiss if I press the Enter key for the default of "Accept Cookie (once)".
</p>
<p>That's even better, assuming you know what you are accepting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p><span><span>Good Day!
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further troubleshooting, kindly consider the following steps below:
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Make sure that Skype is no longer running. Quit Skype.</span></span></li><li><span><span>On your keyboard, press the Windows key + R key. Then, the run windows will appear.</span></span></li><li><span><span>On the run window, type in
<strong>%appdata% </strong>and hit enter.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Locate and rename the skype folder into:
<strong><span>skype_old.</span></strong></span></span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Also, there might be a firewall and antivirus blocking your access to Skype. With that being said, kindly
<strong>temporarily disable</strong> it. Then, try to sign in to your account using your Skype app on your device and enabled those two again.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If the issue still persists, kindly reply to this thread.

    <title>Intalling apps from Windows 10 Store on Windows Phone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Intalling apps from Windows 10 Store on Windows Phone</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>So before the new store,&nbsp;we were able to send apps from windows phone store website to windows phone device. After the universal apps and merging the windows store with windows phone store, we practically can't do that anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example I am on my laptop and I see this app on the store and I want to install it on both my laptop and my phone. It really adds inconvenience to the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a plan for bringing back that feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case this adds information, my phone still runs Windows 8.1&nbsp; Denim.</p>

Yeah.&nbsp;The&nbsp;feature&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;removed&nbsp;in&nbsp;new&nbsp;store,&nbsp;to&nbsp;sending&nbsp;apps&nbsp;from&nbsp;website&nbsp;to&nbsp;phone.&nbsp;I&nbsp;will&nbsp;suggest&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;wait&nbsp;for&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;news,&nbsp;hope&nbsp;so&nbsp;they&nbsp;will&nbsp;bring&nbsp;back&nbsp;that&nbsp;feature&nbsp;when&nbsp;windows&nbsp;10&nbsp;for&nbsp;phones&nbsp;publically&nbsp;available.&nbsp;

<h2>            Vista Home Premium and my Toshiba e740 Pocket PC 2002</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I understand that Windows Mobile Device Centre doesn't fully support PPC 2002, but it says that it does allow Explorer pass through and Internet access.<br />
<br />
However, not for me...<br />
<br />
Vista has recongised and installed the drivers for the e740, but I can't find any evidence of it having done anything with this. Nothing appears in Explorer and WMDC doesn't find it at all either.<br />
<br />
How exactly should I be able to copy files to and from the thing?<br />
<br />
Ta<br />
<br />

<p>You are correct Bryantma, WMDC (Windows Mobile Device Center) 6.1 is fully compatible with Windows Mobile 2003 devices and later and it offers basic connectivity support for Windows Embedded CE 4.2, 5.0, Pocket PC 2002, and Smartphone 2002 devices which
 means you can connect over USB and serial, use desktop passthrough using the PC’s internet connection, and file browse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't have a 2002 device to check this out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you click on Computer on your desktop, does it show your device when it is connected?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were to go into Device Manager with your device connected, is it listed anywhere?&nbsp; If so, where</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My e740 shows in device manager and the drivers that Windows installs give it it's correct name, but no, it doesn't appear in My Computer or under the Manager tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll check the details and add more information when I can. :-)</p>

<p>Same problem here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently dusted off the old e740 to use it again, and found out active sync was abandoned in Vista...and also found that Toshiba didn't bother with any ROM flash to Windows Mobile 2003, so I'm feelin a bit frustrated that I can't really use
 any of the connectivity functionality of this PDA.&nbsp; I too am looking for a workaround somewhere, or at least someone that can explain how to use explorer to see the device.&nbsp; I had the exact same experience when first connected....Windows update found the new
 driver for it...it lists fine and working properly in the device manager, but no device listed in My Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help from anyone would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oddly enough, I dug mine out of the drawer over the weekend again too. Charged it over night and tried to get it to sync last night, without success. Nothings changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an old XP box that I hope to get working again soon, so that might be a workaround, but some form of update from Toshiba would be best. One of the reasons for buying it was that it had one of the fastest processors of the time and so
 was, in theory, as future proof as possible. But then Toshiba let us down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, still looking for some way to sync with Vista so if I find anything, I'll post it...</p>

<h3> miketerrien  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 documents not opening</h2>
                    <p>I loaded Office 365 after upgrading to Windows 10. All the Office programs were working great. Double-clicking any of my old documents from Office 2010 would open no problem. The documents in file manager all show the new Office 365 Icons. So thinking I'm
 good I decided I don't need Office 2010 anymore I'll uninstall it. I'm a dummy, right? Well now none of my documents Word, Access, Excel, etc. have any Icon at all. Also all my documents open if I double-click them except for one, Excel will not open that
 way anymore. I have to open them after I start Excel and go to the File Tab to select one.</p>
<p>How do I fix this problem?</p>
<p>Can I re-install Office 365 to repair it?</p>
<p>Will that action raise my Install Count?</p>
<p>

            I fixed my problems by using the Repair Function from Control Panel. I opened Help in Word looking for info on where I could find which version I installed. That's when I ran across the Repair Function. Anyway I did find out which version I installed (32bit)
 and your right it's not obvious&nbsp;which one your installing. So I have my tasks to do tomorrow. Uninstall the 32bit version and re-install the 64bit version. Thanks for the help.

<p>I copied some Excel worksheets from another computer onto my Notebook desktop. When I click on them, Excel opens however the document doesn't. The document does open OK if I choose file open from within Excel?</p>
<p>On checking under Set Associations, I notice the default program for xlsx file types is "Microsoft Open XML Converter".</p>
<p>Is this correct?</p>

</p><p>I too am having this issue. We only have one installation of Office 2016 for Mac. The user&nbsp;previously ran Office 2011, but upgraded a week ago to try and fix another issue. Ever since then, they get the roor: 5.7.8 Bad username or password (Authetication

<p>
</p><p>Could it be an issue with Apple, even though it only&nbsp;became an issue&nbsp;when upgraded to Office 2016. Maybe a co-oincidence?</p>

<p>Hello RevServTech,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try enabling the Two-Factor authentication of your email account in the website of your mailbox. Then generate the App password, use that password to set up your mailbox in Outlook for Mac 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persist, please let me know the version number of Outlook for Mac such as 15.35 170610 and the type of that email account you are using. (&nbsp;Office 365, Exchange server accounts, Outlook.com, Hotmail.com, and Live.com or Gmail, yahoo etc.)</p>

            <p>And one more screenshot in the latest iteration of trials and tribulations. Think this is a larger problem that hit with the latest update, but just a hunch. I've now also uninstalled and reinstalled Microsoft Office 365 (educators) in its entirety.</p>

            <p>I googled the error code I was receiving when OneNote crashes and that brought me to this thread. Every time I open OneNote it immediately crashes. This began midday yesterday and still continues. All other office programs work great without any issues.
 In an attempt to be proactive I have already reinstalled OneNote. This was not successful in preventing crashes.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm jumping back in just to clarify, David. My problem was not fixed *just* by reinstalling Office, as I had Office on my Mac for 1+ year prior to the OneNote issue with zero problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was fixed in full through following these steps and clearing out the keychain:</p>

            <p>Just keep in mind that if you are able to fix the problem by following those steps, then we still have no way of tracking down what might be going wrong here. I would love to see the full crash log before we lose the ability to reproduce the problem. &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, those steps <em>can</em> be dangerous. If you have made changes to your notebooks that haven't had a chance to sync up to the server yet, then the first step (deleting the app container folder) will result in data loss because those changes will be
 lost forever. If you are confident that all of your recent changes have synchronized up to OneDrive, though, then there should not be any harm.</p>

<h3> lesteryiu  say:</h3>
<h2>            My urgent situation with technical preview &#43; Windows 10</h2>
                    So heres my situation right now. I have the Windows 10 Home Insider Preview BUILD 10074 and I can't seem to uninstall it or restore it back. When I click restart while holding shift it isn't an option. Several people have told me "You're already on windows
 10 don't worry". For example on my last post. But my situation is both confusing to me and something I am worrying about. My task bar doesn't seem to work. When I click the home button both on screen and keyboard, the button ONLY (yes only the button on the
 screen) turns white. I restart and Close the computer several times and It wont work. Sometimes the task bar might glitch itself and the whole thing would just stop working. Is there a way to COMPLETELY get rid of this. ALSO this popup keeps coming up on my
 computer. Saying that it needs my serial code and its invalid because recently i've restored (or the other thing that resets my computer) my computer because it was super glitchy. PLEASE HELP ME WITH BOTH SITUATIONS. I also have

                    <p>Hi</p>

 work with the new SSD drive.</p>

<h2>            e72 - Call log not showing old calls, only the latest one</h2>
                    
<p>When I call someone at a particular time, it gets recorded into the log.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I call someone at a later time, the only log entry is that of the newest call. How do I see all the times I had called the friend, etc?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, for each person I have received a call from, missed a call from or made a call to, &nbsp;only the latest call information is shown in the log. Anyway to see the complete log?&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the initial Log screen, what is your "Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Log duration" setting?&nbsp; Make sure it's something reasonable.&nbsp; If that doesn't help, there must be some kind of corruption in the call log.&nbsp; I don't know the exact solution, but would try</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Use "Options -&gt; Clear List" for EVERY category of logs: Missed calls, Recieved calls, etc.&nbsp; Even if a log is empty, still clear it.</p>
<p>2) Change "Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Log duration" to something else.</p>
<p>3) Reboot the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, you will likely need to perform a phone reset to clear the corruption.&nbsp; Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Nokia c6-00 and the disgusting update 41.0.010</h2>
                    
<p>I just got a new update for this phone. It said solved hanging problem and camera problem.</p>
<p>The camera problem is solved (by making it take longer time to process I guess).</p>
<p>The hanging problem? Not so.</p>
<p>My phone had no problem of hanging with the previous version. But now when I open the menu,
<em><strong>IT HANGS</strong></em>. I try to install some apps,<strong> <em>IT HANGS</em></strong>.</p>
<p>All I want to say is bring back the old version. I can live with camera not ready problem but not this.</p>

            have you try to reinstall the fw using ovisuite?<br />
<br />
nokia updates tend to make your phone betterin performance and usability<br />
<br />
<br />
does the update doesnt have any failed resultduring the process?<br />
<br />
you cannot downgrade the firmwareas it can make your phone a total paper weight..just wait for another update to be release if its still buggy

            OK I see the things that you are talking about. &nbsp;However, here they only appear when the mouse pointer hovers over the junction of either two columns or rows and they don't trouble me. &nbsp;I doubt that there is any way of turning them off.

            They make it virtually impossible to select a row or a column without first, unwillingly creating one. There was a perfectly well working way of creating rows. Why adding this burdon? Oh, I see! Touch screens! How do I select a row or column with a touch
 screen? Without going slightly mad?

            <p>Move the "cursor" further to the left away from the table and the "marker" will disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you have very narrow columns, selecting a column should not be so difficult.&nbsp; Of course it is much easier with a touch screen device with which you can use a stylus, which you can do with both of mine EeePC and Samsung Slate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, you can always put the selection into a cell and then use the Table Tools&gt;Layout tab to Insert either Above, Below (for rows) or Left or Right (for Columns).</p>

Sachin, you genius!!!!! It worked, finally I have a solution.</p>
<p>However, the first time I tried your suggestion it did not work.&nbsp; So what I did then for step 3. was go through the whole registry and delete<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ALL</span></strong> .xl type extensions, not just in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT,
 and not just .xlsx and .xlsm.&nbsp; And that did the trick.</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
John.</p>
