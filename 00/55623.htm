<h2>            Steam Source Games Black Screen Bug.</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I installed windows 10 THREE times now trying to fix this issue and or malfunction.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I open steam and try to play some Garry's Mod but what happens is i get a black screen and that's it. i can hear the noise that comes up when u try to click or hover the mouse over the Options and everything. since this wasn't working i thought it was
 a problem with the game files from the windows 10 transfer. i verified the game cache and it said everything was validated successfully. i did it again to be sure and it said one file was corrupted and it will be reacquired. i ran Garry's Mod again and it
 was still giving me a black screen.&nbsp;so i uninstalled it and re installed it and it still gave me a black screen. i reverted to windows 7&nbsp;and Garry's Mod worked. i could see everything&nbsp;in the game. so i thought it was fixed. so i go back to&nbsp;windows 10 and i
 run it&nbsp;and i get the black screen. so i thought the whole game was&nbsp;gone.&nbsp; so i tried playing team fortress 2 and i got the black screen again. and since those games weren't working i thought&nbsp;i would play Half-Life 2. i got to hear the valve opening sound but
 that's it. i still got the black screen. i decided to play minecraft but it turned out being WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY to slow. i mean it was atleast 12-14 frames per second slow on lowest settings. i installed Minecraft Windows 10 Edition and got at the
 most a stable smooth 50 fps (Frames Per Second) and i typically get around 70 fps in the default Minecraft in windows 7.&nbsp;i ran asphalt 8 (high polygon Phone Game) and i got around 30fps which is pretty decent. i went back to steam and tried a trick online
 about reverting some of the games back to DirectX 8/9/10/11. now since&nbsp; i don't have or have the ability to install DirectX 11 I tried it anyway. nothing worked. i put it in windowed mode. nothin worked. i went to windows 7 to see about asking people in Team
 Fortress 2 servers for help but they weren't much help. when i went back to Windows 10 i ran Team Fortress 2 again and it worked. i saw the main menu. i click on multiplayer and it all went black screen again. all i could see was the multiplayer screen appear
 and that was it. i quit the game and it was happening again. all i could see was the black screen and the ability to hear the Valve Startup sound. it didn't crash and it didn't show anything. the game interface worked but i couldn't see because of the black
 screen. </p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;I understand your concern and I'll be glad to assist you. Appreciate your interest
 in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try to Un-plug and plug (Net-Gear Wire, Monitor , CPU and Modem and Re-Plug in them)
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps if the issue still persist.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you see the black screen
<strong>only</strong> <strong>after sign-in </strong>and you can see a mouse cursor:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>While at the black screen, try using CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to start Task Manager.
</span></p>
<p><span>If it becomes visible, try finding LockAppHost.exe on the Details tab and ending the task.
</span></p>
<p><span>If this resolves the black screen, use corruption resolution steps (dism, then sfc), and run the all apps PowerShell command in

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not work, use File, Run new task in Task Manager to start an Administrator CMD window. Use this to create a new administrator
 user with the following commands (changing ‚Äú&lt;password&gt;‚Äù to something of your choice.
<br />
<strong>net user test &lt;password&gt; /add</strong><br />
<strong>net localgroup Administrators test /add </strong></span></p>
<p><span>This will give you a test user to try, which will confirm if the issue is user or system-specific.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you see the black screen or have a flickering screen
<strong>before sign-in</strong>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span></p>
<p><span>2. To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, Display Port to VGA, or any other combination.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video.
</span></p>
<p><span>Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state.
 Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. </span></p>

<p><span>Note: &nbsp;Applies in Windows 10
</span></p>
<p><span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of your monitor. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters
</span></p>
<p><span>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (Try vice versa if it does not work)
</span></p>
<p><span>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</span></p>
<p><span>Check the PC or display adapter manufacturer‚Äôs site for an updated driver.</span></p>

            this isn't a problem involved with signing into my profile. when I start certain games its just a black screen. I can hear the audio for the games but I cant see them.

            <p>Sat with exactly the same problem (black screen but the game still responding) on Portal and L4D2 and after reading through the advice from A. User I realised I had my HDMI along with VGA plugged in simultaneously. Removed the HDMI and voila. All source
 games running with no problems. So just check that you only have a single display output physically plugged in.</p>

            <p>I'm having this issue as well... I find that if you do this that you can get the games to (at the very least only just about) run:<br />
<br />
Step 1: open your Steam library, pick a known iffy source engine game<br />
Step 2: right click it and select "Properties"<br />
Step 3 (holy crud, HL3 confirmed!): Select the "Set Launch Options" button in the menu and type the "-safe" (without quotes) flag in there<br />
<br />
After that... try launching the game... it SHOULD show up in a 640 X 480 window. You can increase the resolution to match your DFP if a small box in the middle of the screen is too annoying but DO NOT USE FULLSCREEN MODE!! this appears to be where the bug lies,
 Windowd and borderless modes are absolutely fine... hope this at least gets your games playable till either Valve, your GPU manufacturer or Microsoft fix their shiznit!<br />
<br />
Oh... and a few quick questions: Are you running &nbsp;AMD or NVidia GPU hardware?... Do you have a Crossfire or SLI aware setup?... Also... are you running the latest drivers? Personally, I'm thinking it MIGHT be a descrepancy with windows 10 and AMD Radeon "Crimson"/NVidia
 GeForce Experience driver architectures since the games themselves aren't really optimised for the OS and Windows 10's kernel is quite a bit different to Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 which use relatively equal kernels.</p>

            I guess it was some Dockbar preinstalled with your computer (laptop?).<br />
<br />
Dockbar was a third-party application and it is not the default Windows 7 feature. Maybe you have uninstalled it, or changed some settings, and it's not starting automatically now. Try to remember, what you have done before it disappeared.<br />
<br />
You may also try go to the manufacturer website of your laptop, find yours model, and check is there some software related to "Dockbar", or something similar. If you have some Recovery CD with additional software you can check it also.<br />

<h2>            How do I get back my genuine Windows.</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(47, 69, 80, 1)">I purchased a Lenovo laptop some years ago. It came pre-installed with a Windows 8.1. I admit, at the time, I didn't know enough
 about computers to know I ought to create a recovery media. Well, the hard drive for my Lenovo laptop failed eventually and I had to replace it. I gave it to some dude to change the hard drive for me and intall windows. well, he did change the hard drive,
 but he installed windows 8.1 Pro. And now my windows can't activate, and the Windows 8.1 pro is fake. I've come to find out that my laptop is originally licensed for just windows 8.1, and I'm not sure how to go about getting my windows 8.1 back. I used Microsoft's
 media creation tool to create a USB boot media but when I tried installing, it said to enter the product key. I'm not sure what to do, i was led to believe that the Windows product key is in the BIOS and that this would be detected automatically.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(47, 69, 80, 1)">Please help me with detailed instructions, I'm not sure how to go forward from here. The laptop is a Lenovo G50-80.</span><br />

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

    <title>unable to use Wake on LAN unless &#34;Allow this computer to turn off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quikky  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to use Wake on LAN unless &#34;Allow this computer to turn off the device to save power&#34; is checked</h2>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Wake on LAN - Power Management</span><br />
<br />
On my Media Center PC, I am unable to use Wake on LAN unless "Allow this computer to turn off the device to save power" is checked (within the Power Management tab of the network adaptor in Device Manager). Both "Allow this device to wake the computer" and
 "Only allow a magic packet to wake the computer" are checked, but become greyed out when&nbsp;"Allow this computer to turn off the device..." is unchecked.</p>
<p>The problem is, Wake On Lan only works if the computer has been asleep for a short amount of time. If I try to wake the computer using WOL after about 10 minutes, it will never awaken. I'm assuming this is because&nbsp;"Allow this computer to turn off the device
 to save power" is checked, and the machine is turning off the NIC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to force the computer not to turn off the NIC yet retain the ability to WOL? Or make sure WOL works no matter how long the PC has been asleep?</p>
<p>The machine is a Windows 7 PC, with an Nvidia nforce network controller.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I have a laptop on the same wired network that has all three items checked in the Power Management tab for its NIC device, and this machine can be awoken using WOL at any time, no matter how long it has been asleep, so this issue must be with
 configuration of the Media Center PC.</p>
<p>I'd be really grateful for any suggestions, I've spent a long time trying to get this working!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If the systems are only a Sleep you do not need a magic packet.<br />
<br />
If the computers are set to wake on any Network traffic any Ping or arp will wake them up.<br />
<br />
For such configuration it is better to Uncheck the NIC Power saving.</p>
<p>There might be some variations on where the Power saving setting is.</p>
<p>Here are few examples, YMMV, look around in your systems.</p>
<p>Example, <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/example/powersave.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/example/powersave.jpg</a></p>
<p>Example, 
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/power_sav_wireless..jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/power_sav_wireless..jpg</a></p>
<p>Example,  <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/power_save_win7.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/power_save_win7.jpg</a></p>
<p>Example, <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/adv_power-sav.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/adv_power-sav.jpg</a></p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>Real WOL means switching On a Hibernated computer from real Off position, <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/WOL.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ezlan.net/WOL.html</a></p>
<p>However since these features involved cooperation of PSU. Motherboard. Network Card, and are not considered crucial by End-user industry it is a YMMV situation.<br />
<br />
Out of 12 Desktop that are under my immediate control (mix and match of brands and cpus). Only three are fully compliant and waking correctly.</p>
<p>Three comply partially, the rest do not care about my wishes/needs to Wake on LAN.</p>
<p>On the positive side, since it is now fashionable to go green, the percentage of new computers that maintain better Sleep habits dramatically improved.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going through the conversation so far, I understand that Java keeps on crashing repeatedly on your computer. You have already tried a number of troubleshooting steps like reinstalling Java, uninstalling antivirus, performing clean boot, running Microsoft
 System File Checker etc. but none of them helped you enough to get this problem resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The causes of ntdll.dll error can vary greatly. However, most ntdll.dll errors result from a corrupt or damaged version of the ntdll.dll file itself, corrupt hardware drivers or issues between Windows and other programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly the installed version of Java has corrupt components and needs to be repaired.
</p>
<p>Since, Windows resource protection does not report any error the issue is most likely related to Java program itself. I would suggest you to uninstall the Java completely from the computer and reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps below to uninstall Java and remove all components of java completely from the computer.</p>

            <p>I might suggest to capture a user-mode dump of the crash to see if the root cause can be pinpointed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as javadump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time java.exe crashes&nbsp;should
 be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\java.exe]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
</strong></em><br />
<br />
After&nbsp;java.exe crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via a public folder on&nbsp;OneDrive (SkyDrive) or similar site?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. Below are answers</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I do not receive any error code or message. The screen just remains black, but the screen light is still on. It remains this way for over a very long period (about 1 to 2 hours)&nbsp;before I have to forcefully restart</p>
<p>2.I cannot send a screenshot because this happens after the system has restarted and it is installing the update. Rough estimate is that it goes blank when driver installation is about 70% and overall update is about 60-70% complete</p>
<p>3. I have over 100gb free on my system.</p>

            <p>Hi I did as suggested from the link but did not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I observed however that general&nbsp;installation stops at 75% and the drivers installation progress shows 100%. However after the 100%&nbsp;progress the screen goes blank, though the screen light is still turned on.&nbsp;It stays this way for a pretty long time until
 I have to forcefully shut down</p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry just replied after a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything and it not working. I even did a "PC reset" recently as provided in windows 10, it removed all application and certain drivers, yet, this update still gets stuck at that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is worthy of note &nbsp;however that it took several trials and restart (my PC kept freezing during installation) and about 10 to 15 hours after the reset before the main windows 10 OS was finally successfully installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Moving my gamertag to another account</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Is it possible to move my gamertag to another account? I have an account in Great Britain but I am from Slovakia. Now we have XBOX LIVE in Slovakia too. I created new e-mail *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and I'd like to move my old gamertag to this email. Is it possible?
 Never mind if I'll lost all points and everything. I want only my old gamertag.</p>
<p>Thank you for replyes.</p>

<p>You can change the Microsoft account that is associated with your Xbox LIVE gamertag. Here‚Äôs how:</p>
<p>Sign in using your Xbox LIVE gamertag.</p>
<p>Go to Settings and select Account.</p>
<p>Scroll right to Your Information and select Account Security.</p>
<p>Select Change Windows Live ID. (Your Windows Live ID is your Microsoft account. Find out more.)</p>
<p>Do one of the following:</p>
<p>If you have another Microsoft account, select Yes.</p>
<p>If you do not have another Microsoft account, go to accounts.live.com and click Sign up. After you have another Microsoft account set up, select Yes and continue with the next step.</p>
<p>Enter the password for the Microsoft account that is currently associated with your gamertag, and then select Sign in.</p>
<p>Enter the email address and the password for the new Microsoft account that you want to associate with your gamertag, and then select Sign in.</p>
<p>Select Yes, change to change the Microsoft account associated with your Xbox LIVE account.</p>
<p>Select Update Contact Information to update your contact information or Done to finish.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>When you change your Microsoft account, your Microsoft Points are automatically transferred to the new Microsoft account.</p>
<p>You can make only one Microsoft account change for a given gamertag every 30 days.</p>
<p>You must also wait 30 days after your gamertag is downloaded from Xbox LIVE before you can switch that gamertag to a different Microsoft account. If 30 days have not passed since the gamertag was downloaded, you‚Äôll get an error message.</p>
<p>Before you can change the Microsoft account associated with a child account, you must provide the Microsoft account information for the adult account that has parental control.</p>
<p>You can choose to require input of your Microsoft account password to sign in to Xbox LIVE. For more information on how to do this, see Password-protect your Xbox LIVE profile.</p>

- You may have issues though as your account is a UK account and your physical location is in a different region.

<h2>            google chrome crashes in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I installed win 10 on my 2 desktops with no problems..but on my laptop which is hp notebook 2000 and is 1.5 yrs old I had a problem.When I went to open chrome it would either have a loading error or it opened a tab but the page didnt load.I did uninstall
 and reinstall with the same problem.Any help would be great as I work with chrome and would like to remain with it.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Diane,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is the exact error message when Google chrome crashes?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I understand chrome crashes in Windows 10. The issue might arise due to various reasons, including system file corruption or due to user profile corruption.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to troubleshoot the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may check the same issue with the new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Accounts </strong>and then select Other User Accounts&nbsp;towards the left.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Add an Account</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Enter a <strong>user name</strong> and hit Next.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Finish</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Sign out from the current Account and Log into the new&nbsp;account.</span></li><li><span>Check if issue persists.</span></li></ol>
</span>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <div>Hi there, tried both these methods with no success. SFC just reports no problems found. Creating a new user profile in Windows 10 does not fix the problem. Also, I have cleared the Chrome "Default" profile folder found in the AppData/local with no effect.
 Do you happen to have any more suggestions?</div>

            <p>I just recently as of last night started getting crashes on google chrome, so far seems to be the only program it worked fine then started crashing I have uninstalled tried the sfc /scannow checked for registry errors, I have also tried compatibility mode
 and trouble shooter solutions. Nothing works but I have tried the program in safemode and it seems to work fine. I also went to reinstall windows and it wont install windows I also tried system restore and it fails too. I don't know if these are related issues
 but every thing was working fine prior to this. Last system restore I did was 2 days ago because I was trying out a program and it wasn't want I wanted and wouldn't install so I did a system restore. I tried all restore points. I'm getting no errors and I'm
 getting now conflicts within my system. been having other programs crash since I upgraded to 10 but never seemed to cause issue with performance that I noticed but it seems to be loading my computer slower since this crash. I don't know what has changed if
 anything but I do know that I can't fix my system because it will not allow me to restore my system back to factory defaults. I tried it both with in windows and the hidden menu of f9 at startup it still will not allow me format and reinstall windows. I have
 exhausted most of my options any solution would be greatly appreciated. P.S. I also tried to use another profile same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Krishna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried this also, no luck as it didnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just thought i share that the only thing that worked was for me to install Chrome Canary which is the early release version of Chrome. While not a great solution as its not considered a stable release of Chrome, it does the job and all my extensions work
 perfectly. I dont find it unstable and I'm hoping that there'll be a Win10 or Chrome patch soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may connect to a MS tech as suggested by Diane_611 when i have time to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, but I already knew that Microsoft no longer supported Microsoft Easy Transfer for Windows 10.</p>
<p>I found my own solution by using Laplink PC Mover.&nbsp; The only unfortunate thing was Windows 10 migrated everything to OneDrive instead of Windows Media Player so it is slow and difficult to use my music and pictures files.&nbsp; I do not like OneDrive at all!</p>

            I tried Laplink. The tech support phone number is outsourced to India. And they immediately tried to upsell me. They couldn't provide "advanced" help unless I paid extra. So, if the transfer ends up messing up your new computer, they'll try to extort more
 money from you.

            How do we migrate files and settings from a Win7 laptop to a Win10 laptop?&nbsp; I know XP had a great migration process and I'm pretty sure Vista and Win7 did too, though I can't swear to it.<br />
<br />
We shouldn't be penalized for buying a new product.&nbsp; I understand that not everything will transfer because of the massive differences in the systems, but we shouldn't have to start from square one or manually move files. :/<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
And for anyone who says "use the feedback option," it's just as useless as Yahoo's "feedback" is for the User imo.<br />

            <p>Personally I just copy my files over and reconfigure the new OS install (or new system) the way I want. A clean start takes a bit more time but is the best way to ensure a stable trouble-free system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Of course I also remove OEM bloatware by installing a clean copy of the OS first, but that's a different topic.)</p>

            I‚Äôd suggest downloading classic Skype and use it to see if that corrects your problem. 
<br />
<br />1 ) Go to <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />2) Click the drop-down arrow in the blue download button
<br />
<br />3) Select Get classic Skype
<br />
<br />4) Run the downloaded program

<h2>            Xbox One Console keeps losing connecting to the External Hard Drive</h2>
                    
<p>Pretty much the problem since over a year ago as read in this thread:</p>

<p>http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4269/t/1768291.aspx</p>

<p>After playing a game for about 15 minutes, the console loses connection to the external hard drive and the game crashes. REALLY sad that this has been going on since June 2014 and it STILL has not been fixed. That's OVER one year ago!</p>
<p>I have the WD MyBook 4 TB external hdd as recommended by Major Nelson.</p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t hear any voice chat during multiplayer</h2>
                    
<p>The problem is whenever I play any game on Xbox Live I can't hear anyone talk in multiplayer. Whether it's through the headset or through my speakers I have never been able to hear anyone. This didn't used to be a big deal for me because I don't need my
 4yr old hearing chat when someone is on the xbox without a headset, but now I would like to be able to communicate or at least coordinate with people when I play Destiny and I just can't get it to work. I probably make for a terrible multiplayer/strike teammate.
 I am also having problems finding solutions to the problem. I have tried tweaking settings myself, but nothing seems to work. When I use party chat my mic lights up so it identifies me talking. I just can't hear anyone. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks!</p>

<p>Take a look at your NAT type. If it's anything other than "Open", this will cause issues with using voice chat of any kind.</p>

<h3> bisonbreath  say:</h3>
<h2>            My computer snores while it is sleeping</h2>
                    When I close a program back to my desktop my computer goes to a dark screen in about five minutes, just like I set it to do. Shortly after that it starts to play a two-tone chord similar to someone ringing a chime-type doorbell, but softer, like it is
 from a vibraphone being played with padded sticks. It does it on 30 second intervals and only quits when the power manager shuts the CPU down. Any attempt to discover what it is is futile as it quits as soon as I wiggle the mouse or hit the space bar. For
 now I just turn down the volume on the speaker but I am open to suggestions as to a more intelligent solution.

            Hi BisonBreath 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option.
<br />
<br />1. Restore Default for Power Settings
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; sleep &gt; Click Additional power settings to open Power options &gt; Click Change Plan Settings &gt; Click Restore default settings for this plan
<br />
<br />2. Disable Fast Startup
<br />Reach to Power options as in previous step &gt; Click Choose what the power buttons do &gt; Click Change settings that are currently unavailable &gt; Scroll down to Shutdown settings and uncheck Turn on fast startup &gt; Click Save changes 
<br />
<br />3. As a last resort, you should perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not an install of Windows).

<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>

<p>I think I see something like that occasionally with a MWDA. &nbsp; So, see if this describes your symptom:&nbsp; press Win-k&nbsp; and see your TV,&nbsp; trying to open it there fails, so use the "Find other types of devices" link (at the bottom; opens in Settings where you
 may already be looking) and then in there see your TV listed.&nbsp; Click on that item to Remove it.&nbsp; Then see if you can use the Win-k display normally; otherwise please describe what messages you see there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

<p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure that you understood the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connected TV to the home network (Private network profile) and I'm trying to stream movies from my PC to it.</p>
<p>"Find other types of devices" is exactly the menu where I should add TV as a new device in order to be able stream to it with Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>The problem is that I cannot add it to the list of connected devices because when I choose TV from the list of available devices, I got the error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows doesn't have a network profile for this device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I checked Private network profile definitions and didn't find anything suspicious.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Appreciate your help,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Irit</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for clarifying.&nbsp; It sounds like my analogy is on track.&nbsp; So, I'm saying from my experience, if the device shows up there, Remove it, and then try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just thought of something else that would be related.&nbsp; In PowerShell I always do a&nbsp; Get-NetConnectionProfile&nbsp; to see if&nbsp; Public&nbsp; connections are being created.&nbsp; Often there are, so then I use&nbsp; Set-NetConnectionProfile -NetworkCategory "Private"&nbsp; to fix
 that.&nbsp; I'm not sure that is necessary but it seems to makes things go more smoothly.&nbsp; In any case, the Get-NetConnectionProfile may get you another clue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

    <title>Not able to stream media from Laptop Server to Desktop gaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinmac1982  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not able to stream media from Laptop Server to Desktop gaming pc-Error&#58; Before you can play items in this library you must first be allowed access to the library </h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to stream my media (audio,video,pictures) from my Laptop Server, to my Desktop gaming pc to no avail! Both machines running Win 7 and have WMP12 installed</p>
<p>all my libraries are shared in every way i can see on the Server Laptop and i can play my media locally on that machine, when i try to play it on my remote machine (the gaming Desktop) i get the error before you can play items in this library you must first
 be allowed access to the library, my files are on an external hard drive plugged into the laptop and all required media has been added to the library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh 1 last thing the library shows up in wmp12 on the remote Pc but never reveals the content on the server i.e. (my vids , songs and pics)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>This issue occurs because Media Library Sharing in Windows Home Server has a 10-device limit. It sounds like you are experiencing
 a situation where this limit was exceeded. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue will manifest itself with the error message ‚Äú<strong>Before you can play items in this library, you must
 first be allowed to access the library</strong>.‚Äù</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The following steps should resolve your issue by disabling unused media devices and media sharing for those devices:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Start
 the Windows Home Server Console</span></p>

            I know this thread is ridiculously old now, but I am having the EXACT same problem after a clean install. I'm NOT running home server to the above poster. BOTH systems are running windows 7. BOTH machines are set to "ALLOW" each other to see and thus stream
 the respective media.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The "server" one with all my media can stream the sample files from the desktop one (one that I use for gaming and thus dont want my media files stored on) yet it will not no matter what I do let me play my media from the servers hard drives on my desktop
 through WMP12. Joke of a program is WMP12.</div>
