    <title>WM6 will not sync files with ActiveSync 4.5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> professornayr  say:</h3>
<h2>            WM6 will not sync files with ActiveSync 4.5</h2>
                    
<p>I just got a Motorola Q (running WM6) and have been syncing it with my work laptop (Vista Business) without any problems. I just set it up with my home computer (XP home) via ActiveSync 4.5, and I do not have the
 option to sync files (e.g. 'My Documents' folder). I have removed the relationships on the device and started over, but it will not give me the option to sync the files via my home machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I have seen several posts that, at least early on, WM6 could not sync files with Vista via Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC).&nbsp;This is obviously been fixed, because I am able to sync the files. Now, it appears that I am
 having the exact same issue via ActiveSync 4.5 and my home computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I have had a previous Pocket PC (running 2002) that was able to to sync the files without any problems. Optimally, I would like to simply transfer the files from this folder to the new sync folder that would be set up for my Moto Q.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts? Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, the partnernship on both machines is working well. Everything (contacts, calendar, files, favorites, tasks) works great with the Vista machine and WMDC. Everything (contacts, calendar,&nbsp;favorites, tasks, Media)&nbsp;for the partnership with ActiveSync 4.5
 on my XP home machine works well also, but when I click on Tools/Options, the 'File' option is not available. Also, when I open up ActiveSync on my device, the 'File' option is not available here either.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my previous relationship on my home computer, this option was available, so I am curious if it is a limitation of my device, and not ActiveSync or the OS. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Ok, well that is interesting.&nbsp; I have the Q9m and I do have the option for file sync (although I rarely use it because I prefer to manuallly transfer important files.&nbsp; I use a naming structure that tell me what file is the most recent and I also want the
 backups of previous versions).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you setup the partnership, were you given the option to add a sychonrized files folder?&nbsp; Probably not is my guess.&nbsp; I might consider deleting the partnership from both the devie and the PC.&nbsp; Soft reset and reboot then set it up again.</p>

<p><span>No, I did not have the option during the original setup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I just removed the partnership from both the device and the PC, and I even uninstalled ActiveSync from the computer to give it as much of a fresh start as possible. I reinstalled ActiveSync and started the
 partnership again, and there was no option for files. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another interesting aspect is that I previously used my Pocket PC 2002 device to sync up Microsoft Money as well. Obviously, with WM6, this is not possible since Money is not supported after 2003. However,
 Money shows up as an option for syncing with this device even though I am not able to select it. It actually appears on both the sync settings for the device and on the computer itself. I just uninstalled that, but it does not seem to make a difference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is there any chance that the file sync option works similarly to the mail sync options, in that you can only sync the device with one PC? If so, is it possible to change which device you sync files with?</span></p>

<p>I keep looking at this Professornayr I I can't figure out why you don't have what I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am syncing a Motorola Q9m with a Vista machine and a XP machine.&nbsp; I have the File option on both and can sync files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you setup the partnership, did it create a Dicuments folder on your Vista desktop?</p>
<p>Did&nbsp; it create a My Documents folder on your XP machine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It did create the Documents folder on the Vista machine (the folder was in 'Documents' with a shortcut on the desktop), but the option was not even available with my XP machine. I have another Pocket PC (running 2002 or Version 3.0.11171), and the files
 sync up fine with this device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night, I deleted the partnerships between the Moto Q and both computers. I deleted both relationships on the Moto Q, and each individual relationship on each computer. I also deleted the previous relationship I had between my Pocket PC
 and my desktop computer. Then, I started the relationship between my Moto Q and home computer first, and there was&nbsp;NO option for 'Files'. I wish I could send a screen shot to help explain what I am seeing. I was able to sync everything else, but 'Files' did
 not appear and was not available. Also, no folder was created either on my desktop or in My Documents. However, when I setup the relationship again between my Moto Q and my Vista machine, everything worked great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, I setup the relationship between my Pocket PC and home computer again, and the&nbsp;option for 'Files'&nbsp;was available for this relatinoship. I must admist I am quite confused too, as I have been working with these types of relationships (i.e.
 Pocket PC and XP) for a few years and never had this type of situation. I am not sure why it works fine for my older device, but will not even appear for the Moto Q9h.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go into the ActiveSync application on my Moto Q, and select 'Option', I see what I have written below. I should note that 'Email' is NOT selected for either device, and 'Favorites' and 'Files' for the partnership with my Vista computer
 are gray, and not able to be changed or deselected. 'Favorites' and 'Media' are also gray and not able to be deselected for my XP machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LSWC Laptop </strong>(running Vista Business)</p>
<p>- Contacts</p>
<p>- Calendar</p>
<p>- Email</p>
<p>- Tasks</p>

<p>- Email</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarily, if I attach my Moto Q to my home desktop, let it sync, and select 'Options', I have an identical list appear (other than
<strong>Home Computer</strong> is shown first on the list).</p>

<p>Is there any chance that this is an issue with SP3? I recently installed SP3&nbsp;on my XP Home machine.&nbsp; I believe it was shortly before I purchased my&nbsp;Moto&nbsp;Q.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to easily rollback to SP2? I am sure I could use my system restore options, but it would be several weeks back and I would have a lot of other changes in the meantime.</p>

<h2>            using a VLOOKUP to pull area codes out of a phone number</h2>
                    I want to create a vlookup formula that pulls the area code out of a phone number and matches it to a table of area codes and returns an are in the country for that area code. I have tried making sure that the formatting is the same but I still get #na.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you'll really have to supply a data sample of the value before you extract the area code, the formula you use to extract the area code and a data sample of your lookup table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without seeing that, we can only guess. I'm guessing that the are code you extract is a different data type from the area code in the lookup table. The lookup table probably has the area code as numbers, but the extracted area code is probably text. If you
 use a formula with LEFT(), MID() or RIGHT(), for example, the result will be text. You can coerce it to a number by adding a 0 to the result, for example</p>
<p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp; </span>I can't access my hotmail account, which i made so many years ago, i CANT remember ANY of my security questions because it was that long ago (neither my password) . I can remember all the basic stuff like my name
 and date of birth, but apparently it’s not enough information to get back in. <br />
I have a lot of important information there. <br />
I don't use the account to send any mail, and any friends i have on this account are all people i am no longer in touch with so it would be STUPID TO ASK THEM TO BE IN TOUCH WITH ME SUDDENLY BECAUSE I CANT ACCESS MY ACCOUNT. I havent in a long time sent out
 any mail, but i do receive ALOT if important information through the blocked account with is linked to my phone bills and house bills, etc, making it pretty damn clear how important it is that i get back in.<br />
<br />
I'm pissed off because this is the first time that i've ever had problems with (what was once known as and reliably so) hotmail, but ever since outlook has come in, and i've spent more time then i have spare looking at this microsoft forum looking for answers
 (which has made it obvious to me that outlook has more bugs in it then it should have had for a FORCED CHANGE TO OUTLOOK FROM HOTMAIL and that i am not the only person to have had this problem) that I am incredibly disappointed by the new service that outlook
 is providing. I might be a few in several hundreds of thousands who have no problem, but that doesn't excuse this poor excuse of service. there was no reason for me to be blocked out, I'm the only person with my password to my email account.
<br />
<br />
I need help from someone who is actually from Microsoft who can get me back into my account because this is just bloody ridiculous and that its absurd to expect people to remember information they might have put in over five/ten years ago. I've used hotmail
 for so long, have trusted it for all this time and have NEVER had any problems with hotmail, and now with this change (i tried to get outlook of my android phone the same way I had hotmail, was able to use hotmail without a glitch and then when i'm informed
 that i need to download outlook to be able to view my emails, get blocked out of my account and am now completely unable to access MY ACCOUNT THAT I USE since it's BLOCKED TO ME.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am having the same problems as the above
 people, my account keeps saying that someone else is using my account. Then i am redirected to another email address i originally in puted some years ago , hotmail would use this address to send me a code, however, i dont remember that password. Then i filled
 in a questionnaire asking me my dob, folders that i have, last email sent. I had to give an address for this and i gave th<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is email address</span> which is my boyfriends.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>Synchronization Error occur due to number of reasons as virus attack, network issues, Exchange Server downtime, corrupt ost file etc. This such error generated due to unavailability of Exchange Server or network issues in Exchange Server.</p>
<p>You can try manual method to fix small errors in OST file using Scanost.exe - Inbuilt OST Integrity Check tool</p>
<p>If this tool is not much useful then you can also try third party tool ( <a href="http://www.ostpst.biz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ostpst.biz/</a>&nbsp;)&nbsp;to fix all type of errors in Outlook OST file.</p>

            <p>Hi Palcouk</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah you could say as the PC starts. The teachers here at the school check their emails the moment they are logged into their accounts. They are all connected to the internet at the time with limited access to resources on the network and windows itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We get this message every time we open outlook after closing or shut down.</p>

While Hyper-V is a great out of box solution because of its tight integration and robust performance, it does have certain limitations and complexities. In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox. For instance, VirtualBox makes network connections easier, I don't have configure switches and configure Internet sharing especially for wireless networks, it does all of that for me.

<h3> tankslappa  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 V21 used as alarm clock makes the phone unstable...</h2>
                    
<p>I've always used my phones as alarm clocks, and the same goes for the N97.</p>
<p>There hasn't been a problem until recently.</p>
<p>Up until about a week ago I have left the phone turned on over night, the alarm goes off, I snooze it a bit, and eventually I select off and get up.</p>
<p>Recently I have had the phone turned off, so the alarm goes off, I do the snooze bit, eventually I give in, and then it asks if I want to turn the phone on. I do, and then it asks me for my lock code. Fine, I have that option set, and I enter it. The phone
 starts up and everything looks fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until you decide to do something, then it's memory errors and random crashes. I've seen this several times in the past week. Turning the phone off and then back on again seems to solve it and the phone is back to normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you happen to have received an SMS message whilst you were asleep, the act of this arriving as the phone starts up makes it do a mini reboot, you know the white screen flash, darkness, Nokia logo, then back to the front screen (no pin request).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think something in the Alarm induced boot up isn't quite right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this?</p>

                    I accidentally 'closed' a notebook in OneNote and didn't know that it would delete it. Can I get it back...and how do I do that?<br />

Thanks for any help you can give me because I really need that notebook back.<br />

<p><span>Hi Carlene, <br />
Even if you close it, it would not be deleted. Try the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>Open OneNote<br />
Click on "File" at the top left and Click "Open" in the drop-down menu<br />
Click on “Notebook" in the side menu then click on your "OneNote Notebooks" folder (Locate the folder)
<br />
Click on your notebook you are looking for. (the Folder might look empty, continue to open it)<br />
Click "Open" at the bottom<br />
Your Work notebook should open again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Saeed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally you'll get an error message telling you there's a problem with a website's security certificate. A site's certificate enables Internet&nbsp;Explorer to establish a secure connection with the site. Certificate errors occur when there's a problem with
 a certificate or a web server's use of the certificate. Internet&nbsp;Explorer helps keep your information more secure by warning about certificate errors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to disable Certificate Error checking:</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>R </strong>keys, then type <strong>
inetcpl.cpl </strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Click on <strong>Advanced </strong>tab.</p>
<p>c. Search for <strong>Security </strong>settings.</p>
<p>d. Uncheck the option "<strong>Warn about certificate address mismatch</strong>".</p>
<p>e. Click <strong>Apply </strong>and <strong>Ok </strong>to save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the status of the issue so that we can help you better.</p>

<h2>            New Version - but &#42;still&#42; no N900 support&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So I was prompted to install the new version of Ovi suite today, and I couldn't help but think "I wonder if this new version will support Nokia's top-end phone, the N900?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How foolish I was to think such a thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously, what's going on? How on earth can you release a phone as one of your top-end phones and not even be bothered to get the support ready for it before you release it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lots of my friends want to buy iPhones and I always say "Nah, the N900 is so much better" because I really believe that hardware-wise, it is far superior. But the software for it, and the non-existant support from Nokia really must (or SHOULD) be an embarrasment
 for the company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When are Nokia's loyal customers going to be treated as such?</p>

<p>it really should have been ready for day 1 launch of the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would Apple launch a new iPhone that doesn't yet work with iTunes? I think not.</p>

<p>I much prefer the N900, but the software/support experience is certainly not first class.</p>

<p>Yes, I have to agree with this thread, I am extremely disappointed that the PC Suite/Ovi Suite softwere is only partially working for the N900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I bought the N900 (after considerable research) I was convinced that it was a tablet with a huge amount of versatility and promise and a great step forward&nbsp;in pc/phone technology.&nbsp; However I do feel somewhat deflated by the fact the interfacing software&nbsp;for
 keeping my N900 synchronised &nbsp;is just nowhere near the high standard and quality it should be, given Nokia's track record.&nbsp; Nokia, I feel you have let yourselves down on what may be seen as a small thing, but to customers like myself, attention to the small
 things makes soooo much difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As&nbsp;one of your people has already commented that you will be getting this right soon I do not want to berate you further, I keep my fingers crossed in the hope that Nokia will produce a suite to at least match the standard of the N900 itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But please do one thing for us Nokia, Keep us informed, let N900 users know as soon as the compatable software is available so that we can get the most from our devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you will see this message in the vain it is written, I am, on the whole, an extremely happy customer, with a great tablet phone, but for me Quality of service&nbsp;is key and its just not quite there at the moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing an improvement.</p>
<p>regards</p>

    <title>Cannot edit hyperlink using alt F9 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randombrian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot edit hyperlink using alt F9</h2>
                    Suppose that I wanted to edit a hyperlink in Word using the alt-F9 shortcut. By hitting alt-F9, the following would appear within my Word document:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>{ HYPERLINK "http://www.aol.com" }</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When this appeared, I would be able to then directly edit the link and the new link would remain after editing. For instance, if I wanted the new hyperlink to be MSN, would simple alter the above to:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>{ HYPERLINK "http://www.msn.com" }</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This method until recently has always seemed to work without flaws. However, just recently, I tried to do this and as soon as I changed "aol" to "msn" and my cursor exited the braces, it would immediately change back to the original. That is the edit would
 not stay.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I realize that in this simply exam I could simply exit alt-F9 mode and right click EDIT HYPERLINK and manually make the adjustment. However, this is not an option for me because the link must include a mergefield. That is, it will ultimately look something
 like this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>{ HYPERLINK "http://www.aol.com/{ MERGEFIELD PAGE }" }</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Because of the problem I just described, as soon as I insert the mergefield into the link and my cursor leaves the braces, it reverts back to its original.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have no idea what is going wrong or what setting might have been changed. Any help would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>I suspect the problem you're having here is that you're not differentiating between the display text (which changing the field code doesn't affect) and the URL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the mailmerge, if you insert a mailmerge field into a hyperlink field, the hyperlinks will all show the first record’s address as the 'Text to display' text. Here's how you can get a mailmerge to display your preferred default 'Text to display' text
 instead:<br />
1. Disregarding mergefield issues for the moment, insert a hyperlink into the document in the normal way, choosing whatever 'Click Here' text you want in the 'Text to display' box.<br />
2. Select the inserted hyperlink and press Shift-F9 to expose its field code.<br />
3. Replace everything in the field after 'HYPERLINK' with your mergefield.<br />
4. Select the field and press F9 to update the display.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In Word 2007 &amp; later, you can make the display text variable also, by following these additional steps:<br />
5. Position the cursor anywhere within the display text.<br />
6. Insert a mergefield pointing to whatever data field you want to use for the display text (this could even be the same field as used at step 3 above).<br />
7. Delete all of the previous display text either side of your last-inserted mergefield (note that this field will likely have updated already).<br />
8. Execute the merge.<br />
9. After merging to a new document, use Ctrl-A, F9 to update all fields. Without this, the mergefield hover text won’t update to the correct targets.</p>

            Macropod, thank you for your response. However, the problem isn't a differentiation issue. I uploaded a video on youtube so that you can clearly see how the edit immediately reverts back to the original when the cursor leaves the braces. Hopefully this
 better informs you of what is actually happening.

            I have found that when&nbsp;you edit the target of a hyperlink that has the URL as display text, not only do you have to edit both the underlying HYPERLINK field
<strong>and</strong> the display text (as Macropod points out), but you also have to update the field after doing so. Until you do, when you hover over the link, you'll see it's still displaying the old target. I think this should be considered a bug, but at
 any rate it's useful to be aware of it.

            <p><font color="#000000">You most likely will have to increase the font size of the text before printing. To make the font size larger select the text and click on the "Grow font" button in the Home tab area, or just change the size of the font in the "Font"
 window. If using a template, usually paragraphs are separated in textboxes. Just select the textbox and then click on the "Grow font" button located in the Home tab. However, you may have to increase the size of the textbox to allow for the larger text size.
 To increase textbox size select textbox and drag the edge sizing handle to the size needed.</font></p>

    <title>This is not a valid Office Product Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dadron  say:</h3>
<h2>            This is not a valid Office Product Key</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased and downloaded Office 2010 Pro from the Microsoft Home Use Programme. Together with Office I also purchased Project and Visio.</p>
<p>All products install with no problem. The Product Keys for MS Projects and Visio work with no problem and the products are now activated.</p>
<p>I am having a problem with the Office Professional Product Key as supplied in the follow up e-mail after purchasing.</p>
<p>When I enter the Product Key and following the verification process the following message is displayed "This is not a valid Office Product Key"</p>
<p>How does one go about getting a new Product Key or get some one from Microsoft activation on the telephone for some support. All numbers tried lead to automated systems which are not able to solve my issue.</p>
<p>Prior to installing the above products, I uninstalled all 3 of the same 2007 products, so there possibly could be a clash.</p>

<p>The uninstalled programs probably are not an problem, but they may be. You can use the following procedure as a model to locate and remove any leftover bits:</p>
<span><span><span><span>Manually uninstall the 2007 Office system if you cannot uninstall it by using the "Add or Remove
 Programs" feature - </span></span></span></span>

<p><span><span><span>For 2010 clean up procedure remains the same, just have to make some number substations:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Change all references to suite:<br />
Office 2002 = Office 10<br />
Office 2003 = Office 11<br />
Office 2007 = Office 12<br />
Office 2010 = Office 14</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>The
 best way to clean the %temp% folder is after a reboot, so if you are planning to reboot, hold off on that step or repeat the %temp% cleanup after reboot</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span></span><span><span>open the run window:<span>&nbsp;</span>&lt;win&gt; +
 R </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span></span><span><span>type %temp%,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span></span><span><span>press &lt;ENTER&gt;,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span></span><span><span>Windows Explorer opens in the TEMP folder</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span></span><span><span>Select all files: &lt;CTL&gt; + A</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span></span><span><span>&lt;Delete&gt;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span></span><span><span>For any files in use, just<strong>SKIP</strong>
 them</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span></span><span><span>For Windows XP and Windows Server 2003,
 click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type %AllUsersprofile%\Application Data\Microsoft\Office\Data, and then click<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>Check to make sure you do not have any trial versions of Office installed. If you do, uninstall them too. They do cause this type of conflict.</p>
<div>
<span><span><span><span>"This is not a valid Office product key. Verify that you have the correct key and retype it."</span></span></span></span>
<p><span><span><span><span>This behaviour occurs for one or more of the following reasons.:</span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>You have a Trial Version of Office installed that is “intercepting” the activation attempt, uninstall it first</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Check the numbers and letters on the product key. Sometimes the number eight (8) can resemble a capitalized B, and a number zero (0)
 can resemble a capitalized O. Copy the product key from an email message to avoid typing errors.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Make sure that you are not using a product key from an older version of Office. These product keys will not work with Office 2010.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Do not use a product key that might be attached to the bottom of your laptop, or on the back of your desktop computer. These are usually
 the Microsoft Windows product keys and will not work with Office 2010.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>If a Product Key Card was purchased at a retail store and activated at the register, do not use the key that is inside the card to
 unlock Office 2010. You must logon to the website listed on the card and follow the instructions to obtain the actual product key for the version of Office that you purchased.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>A product key for an Office 2010 stand-alone product (such as Microsoft Visio Professional 2010) will not be accepted as a product
 key for an Office 2010 suite. It is important to match the product key to the product for which it is specified.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Volume License product keys will not be accepted for a retail Office 2010 product.</span></span></span></li></ul>

<h2>            Sharepoint - Columns in content type not showing in custom list</h2>
                    I've created a site content type (CT1) and added some site columns to it. I've then created another content type (CT2 inherits from the first one) and hidden 2 of the columns on CT1. Then I've created a custom list and added these 2 content types to it.
 When i create and entry for CT1 the 2 columns I hid in CT2 do not show up either on the form or the list of available columns. Is this expected behaviour? (I have a lot of experience with SharePoint 2007 but not 2013/2016). If not, how can i get the fields
 I want to appear?

<p>Hello PipMeadway,</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, if you hid the columns in the content type, then they wouldn't appear in the list or the form - this sounds right
</li><li>If you want to resurface those columns, try this
<ul>
<li>Access "List Settings" </li><li>Access "Advanced settings" </li><li>Select "Yes" on "Allow Management of Content Types
<ul>
<li>Click OK (Remember how to get back here so you can turn this back off when you are done playing with the content types)
</li><li>This will open up a content type section in the "List Settings" menu </li></ul>
</li><li>Look just above the list columns and you will now see a section called "Content Types"
</li><li>Select a content type on which you want to "hide" or "unhide" a column </li><li>Click on the column you want to unhide </li><li>Select "Optional" or "Required"
<p>Please let us know if this answers the question.</p>
</li></ul>

<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a82bf7ba-e3bc-43b9-9263-fba7a76f9204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da82bf7ba-e3bc-43b9-9263-fba7a76f9204" /></a></p>
<p>c222:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a3650e6c-ac99-4b52-8ef3-cb7671a3387d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da3650e6c-ac99-4b52-8ef3-cb7671a3387d" /></a></p>
<p>then i created an entry named 11 based on content type c111, and an entry qw based on content type c222.<br />
below is the result:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=bff81288-803c-4f40-aa73-3a4e670f9157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dbff81288-803c-4f40-aa73-3a4e670f9157" /></a></p>
<p>if the issue persists, could you&nbsp;tell us&nbsp;more about "<strong>the 2 columns i hid in ct2 do not show up on the list of available columns.</strong>"?<br />
a screenshot of this would be appreciated.<br />
