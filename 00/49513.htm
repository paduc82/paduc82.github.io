            <p>The "timeline" in Windows Live Movie Maker is sort of a storyboard/timeline hybrid.&nbsp; You can use the zoom slider in the lower right to make it behave more like a storyboard (one thumbnail image per clip) or a timeline (each item is shown as a rectangle representing
 its duration).&nbsp; However, it's still not a traditional timeline similar to what you had in the original Movie Maker.</p>
<p>I would try to get used to the new way the timeline behaves.&nbsp; In a lot of respects it still does what you expect.&nbsp; But if you absolutely need the traditional timeline (where you can trim and overlap clips, see music waveforms, etc.) then you might want to
 install <a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Movie Maker 6.0 on Windows 7</a>.&nbsp; That's the most recent version of the classic Movie Maker and will have the tradition timeline, titles, effects and transitions you are familiar with from WMM
 2.1 in XP.&nbsp; In addition, there are lots of <a href="http://goo.gl/jLyuG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
custom transitions, effects and titles</a> that can be added to that classic version of Movie Maker (where Windows Live Movie Maker does not have this customization today).</p>

<br />
considerate_guy is correct, in Windows Live Movie Maker they have&nbsp;made it as a&nbsp;storyboard/timeline hybrid. To know more about Windows Live Movie Maker, please check the link I have provided below:<br />

<p>I think there's some misconception here. A OneDrive account doesn't depend on an Office subscription - the amount of free storage does.</p>
<p>If you have an Office 365 subscription then you get a free 1TB of OneDrive space.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you get 5GB free as standard, which you can upgrade by paying for more space instead of having an Office 365 subscription.</p>
<p>You can purchase 50GB of storage for £1.99 per month...otherwise the prices for 1TB are the same as an Office 365 subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH</p>

<p>If you are running chkdsk from a command prompt with no options, seeing a few USN Journal issues reported may be normal and here is why:</p>
<p>Chkdsk examines disk space and disk use for the file allocation table (FAT) and NTFS file systems. Chkdsk provides information specific to each file system in a status report. The status report shows errors found in the file system. If you run chkdsk without
 the /f command-line option on an active partition it might report spurious errors because it cannot lock the drive. You should use chkdsk occasionally on each disk to check for errors.<br />
<br />
If you run chkdsk from a command prompt while Windows is running, it may report errors or it may not report errors - and it may report different errors each time you run it.&nbsp; It doesn't necessarily mean there is something wrong - is the way you are running
 chkdsk.<br />
<br />
Here is how Microsoft explains this observation: <br />
<br />
"...CHKDSK may report that a disk is corrupted even when there is no <br />
real corruption present. This can happen if NTFS happens to modify <br />
areas of the disk on behalf of some program activity that CHKDSK is <br />
examining at the same time. To verify a volume correctly, the volume <br />
must be in a static state, and the only way to guarantee that state is <br />
to lock the volume. CHKDSK only locks the volume when /F or /R (which <br />
implies "F") is specified. Thus, you may need to run CHKDSK more than <br />
once to get it to complete all stages in read-only mode."<br />
<br />
Read the entire article here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/187941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/187941</a><br />
<br />
If you are running chkdsk from a command prompt (running just chkdsk with no options), you are not in the static state required and as Microsoft says, you may see errors "when no real corruption is present". That is the way it works if you use it that way.<br />
<br />
The usual problems or "errors" seen when running chkdsk from command prompt involve the USN Journal.&nbsp; If XP is not in a static state, the USN&nbsp;Journal could be changing all the time, so chkdsk may report issues in the USN Journal because chkdsk is not being
 run when the system is in a static state.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you do not run chkdsk in a static state and it reports issues, that does not mean there is a problem - it is the way you are running chkdsk.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you want chkdsk to actually try to fix problems, you must run it in a static state.<br />
<br />
There are only two ways to be sure you are in a static state when running chkdsk.<br />
<br />
One way is to run chkdsk from the XP Recovery Console so that XP is not "running" to interfere with chkdsk and when it will be impossible for&nbsp;things to be changing on the volume.<br />
<br />
THe other way is to schedule the chkdsk to run on the next reboot of the system before XP has a chance to finish loading.<br />
<br />
When you choose to run chkdsk with error correction either from the disk properties Tools options or from a Command Prompt (chkdsk /r) you must respond in the affirmative to this question:<br />
<br />
Would you like this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts?<br />
<br />
If you respond in the affirmative, then chkdsk /r will be scheduled to run the next time XP reboots.<br />
<br />
If you run chkdsk /r from the XP Recovery Console, you can watch it and see everything that is happening.&nbsp; Sometimes that is a little more interesting&nbsp;to watch so you can keep an eye on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have no genuine bootable XP media from which you can boot into the XP Recovery Console, it is easy to make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required).<br />
<br />
If the chkdsk with error correction runs the next time the system is rebooted, the activity and result will show up in the Application Event Log.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you want to see what chkdsk did when it ran on the reboot, look in the Application log for events sourced by
 Winlogon and that have the date and time close to the time chkdsk was run.<br />
<br />
Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; Depending on the size of the speed of your system, the size of the volume being checked,&nbsp;the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time to complete or appear to
 be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; If the HDD light is still flashing, it is doing something.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount to be sure it is still making progress.&nbsp; It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.<br />
<br />
If chkdsk reports any errors while running in a static state, the errors should be investigated, resolved or explained.&nbsp; It may take multiple&nbsp;executions for chkdsk to resolve all issues and some issues may not be resolved by chkdsk.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When chkdsk runs automatically on a reboot either because XP thinks it needs to (perhaps your NTFS volume has been marked as dirty) or you chose to do<br />
it yourself, the results are shown in the Event Viewer Application log.&nbsp; You need to look there for the chkdsk log and any problems after chkdsk has run.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Look in the Application log for an event sourced by Winlogon, that looks something like this:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winlogon<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1001<br />

There actually is some additional reading about chkdsk if you want to learn about it and it will explain everything you see and why your expectations may exceed reality.<br />
<br />
If you need help interpreting the chkdsk log and events, you need to post them from the Event Viewer into your topic so it looks like&nbsp;the example above.</p>

    <title>Xbox One keeps turning off when launching a game or app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loling panda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One keeps turning off when launching a game or app </h2>
                    <p>I woke up this morning jumped on xbox to play some Destiny 2. I was playing the game fine for about 20 minutes when my xbox randomly turned itself off. I turned it back on and now every time I try to launch a game or app the console will turn off. Why is this happening everything was fine and now all I can do is turn it on, sign into my account and sit on the home menu as soon as I try to launch any game, app or even the xbox store the xbox will turn off. The fan is working fine so it isn't an overheating problem and the power brick is solid green and fine. I would appreciate if I could receive some help on this issue ASAP considering this is my day off of work.</p>

                    My nephew recently tried to convert wma files to mp3 files so I could put them on my mp3 player. He used Jodix and everything seemed to go as planned until we tried to get the songs from Windows Media Player. A message came up: you need to update DirectX
 to version 8.1 or higher. Well, I tried to download from Windows and got a message saying I alreday have the most current DirectX version. So, back to Jodix and found another message that says I may need to update Windows Media Player to version 7.1 or higher.
 Only, I can't find out what version I have (sorry, I just can't find the information). And I wouldn't even know what to do next if I found the info. Really, I just want to get my Walmart purchases (purchased several years ago as wma) to play on my mp3 player.
 Can anyone help me? I would appreciate your advice. Thank you!

    <title>How can I play Odell Down Under on Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richellezeitler  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I play Odell Down Under on Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I have DosBox, but it says I need Microsoft Windows to play the application. I assume it means an earlier version of Windows.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried using the compatibility mode, but it gives me the same error message: "THe version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64
 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there another version that will run on Windows 7? Or is there some way to make it work? I could try running it on an old computer I have collecting dust in the corner, but I'd rather like to be able to play it on my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any help.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for asking question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are not able to DosBox and Odell Down.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if games are compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>Here is the link: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Default.aspx?type=Hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Default.aspx?type=Hardware</strong></a>
</p>
<p>If it is compatible, you may try downloading the <strong>Program install and uninstall troubleshooter</strong> and try installing the games and check for the issue.<br />
Refer to the link:<strong> </strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651/</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any further assistance, I would suggest you to contact the games manufacturer support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Pro activation key rubbed off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amoomoocowski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro activation key rubbed off</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a cd of Windows 10 Pro at Microcenter on 12/28/17 for a computer I was building because the saleseople told me somenof the components I bought required Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finished the build today and installed Windows. &nbsp;When I tried to reveal the activation key on the envelope, parts of the number rubbed off with the gray stuff. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to call support, but the woman tried to tell me to call the vendor.... her English was poor, and I don’t think she understood this wasn’t a pre-built computer with Windows installed. &nbsp;When I complained that she couldn’t help me with this $150 piece
 of software I’d bought, she transferred me to a man who cut me off!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a department or email, somewhere I can send photos of the receipt, packaging, and damaged product key so I can get some assistance? &nbsp;This is absolutely ridiculous. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A number of users have been reporting issues recently removing the protective seal on Windows 10 OEM System Builder product key stickers. Unlike retail Windows 10 licenses, which come on a business size card in the box; the OEM Windows 10 System Builder
 product key is located on the certificate of authenticity sticker on the outside or inside of the package. To prevent theft, a protective seal covers the product key. Similar to a pay as you go phone card, users can utilize a sharp instrument such as a knife,
 scissor or even a coin to remove protective seal. See below: </p>

<p>Sometimes, if too much pressure is applied or liquid comes in contact with the sticker, this can damage the product key characters. When this happens, your best course of action is to return it to the reseller for a replacement or refund; since it might
 be a defective product. Contacting Microsoft might be an option, although the software firm has no responsibility for damaged product keys; since production is handled by a third party source. If vendor is able to provide a replacement, ask them to remove
 the protective seal for you, so you are not liable for damage if it happens again.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://content.invisioncic.com/r266649/monthly_2017_03/58db1edde1ab7_coaseal3.jpg.f17143d69b416632a819a85fbce28114.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Enlarge image"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fcontent.invisioncic.com%2fr266649%2fmonthly_2017_03%2f58db1edde1ab7_coaseal3.jpg.f17143d69b416632a819a85fbce28114.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>If you are unable to get any assistance from the vendor, contact Microsoft support and they might be able to replace it for you.

</p>
<p><strong>What if Microsoft can't help either?</strong> </p>
<p>Your options are limited, you might have to cut your losses, or try salvaging the key yourself. The first option you can try using is a magnifying glass to enlarge the characters. If you don't have a magnifying glass, you can use digital camera or your smart
 phone to take a picture then blow it up on your computer. Below is a list of characters used and not used in Microsoft product keys:
</p>
<p>Characters and numbers used:<br />
2346789BCDFGHJKMPQRTVWXY<br />
<br />
Characters and numbers not used:<br />
015AEILNOSUZ </p>
<p>Sometimes a 6 could be easily mistaken for a G or a B for an 8, so look carefully. If the product key sticker is smudged, you could try using a damp Q-Tip to gently scrub the smudge covering the letters. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, my laptop was formatted, the Realtek HD Audio Driver installed on my laptop now is version 6.0.1.7620. Before formatting, (forgot the software version) i was able to see those disconnected and disabled devices on the window shown above. But now
 it only show 1 device (as the figure above), not matter how i plugged in any other devices, like my portable speakers, or headphone, it's still showing that speaker only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this i can't enable the multi playback streaming of 2 sets of speaker simultaneously that i used to listen with...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyone knows how to deal with this problem T.T</p>

<p>hmm thanks anyways</p>
<p>actually i also tried this method a lots for the passed few days, but it seem does not work with my laptop</p>
<p>but finally i found a solution, i searched for the original Realtek version which designed for my laptop, and install it in safe mode without internet (prevent it automatic download and install the latest version), and the problem is fixed... ^^&nbsp;</p>
<p>so my conclusion is we shouldn't update all those drivers version when it is working very fine...&nbsp;</p>
<p>is it true to say so ?&nbsp; @.@</p>

<h2>            Huawei E153 isn&#39;t working on Windows 8</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div>I recently upgraded my OS to Windows 8 N retail version(64 bit), after the installation I plugged my Dongle, as usual start up it installed the software from USB stick and detected the device and signal state, but when I clicked the connection button it
 gives me an error saying Modem isn't connected or Unavailable...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What would be the solution, I have no other option to connect my desktop machine to the internet other than the Dongle, it works with windows 7 fine(I didn't remove windows 7)</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apologize for the delay in responding to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have you try connecting to a different USB Port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update the firmware as well as the computer hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these steps do not help then I would have you contact the manufacturer of the USB modem for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

Administrative command prompt - (run as admininstrator that is...)?<br />

Also - if you do it through the GUI - that fails too?<br />

Being logged in as a users with administrative rights&nbsp;doesn't preclude my suggestion of opening the command prompt with the right-click on the CMD shortcut and choosing "Run as Administrator".&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Is that what you did to open the command prompt?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Anyway - glad it worked out for you!

            <p>That is exactly what I did, Shenan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file was probably already removed by previous attempts but still listed in dir and explorer.</p>
<p>Thanks for the thoughts anyway.</p>

<h2>            &#34;rpctr4.dll was not found&#34; for nearly all installed programs and on startup</h2>
                    <p>Hello Windows users squadfam!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I come today with an issue that's started appearing today (05/10/2018) on my Windows 10 Pro (64x) computer.</p>
<p>On startup and whenever I try to launch games or other software (i.e. osu!, Steam, Audacity) I'm greeted with the dialogue box that reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">The code execution cannot proceed because RPCTR4.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Fortunately, Google Chrome functions like nothing's wrong so I can actually type this up. This also applies to programs like File Explorer and Task Manager.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I looked online with my search engine and I was given numerous suggestions, and all of them failed after following the instructions as they were placed. Here is the list of things I have tried this far,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all in safe mode</span>:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><ul>
<li>Usage of <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> in an elevated administrator cmd.exe panel and failed (error:
<strong>Windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation.</strong>)</li><li>System Restore from an automatic restore point from the day prior to today (05/09/2018), which failed to restore.</li><li><strong>CHKDSK</strong> usage in elevated administrator cmd.exe panel, got snagged on 31% and wouldn't budge for an hour</li><li>Usage of <strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong>, once again fails</li></ul>
<p>The house this computer is in had a power outage at around 5:00am (in my timezone), and I was thinking that&nbsp;<strong>rpctr4.dll</strong> got corrupted when the computer lost its power.</p>
<p>If anyone knows how to fix this, please reach out to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>rhearmas</p>

<h2>            Family Safety Screen Time Limit Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set the time limits several times but it only works very occassionally. I get the weekly email showing daily usage so I can see he is using much more than the limit set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed his profile, replaced it and confirmed verification, twice, but still no luck.&nbsp; I have tried most of the other suggestions here. This seems to be a long running problem with no permanent solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel Strommen (MSFT) is currently dealing with this issue but he suggested going to his wiki page but there is no link yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx</p>

<p><strong>It is a album art problem, when you try to change it you just get&nbsp; ERROR that tells you that you cannot change while song from album is in use....</strong></p>
<p><strong>please help...I spent a long time in media player 11 getting all my songs to display album art correctly. Now all that seems to have been in vain.

<p><strong>And if there is no good fix for media player 12 is there a way to delete version 12 and install version 11...</strong></p>

            I had an issue with no files being shown in the library.<br />
It ended up it was corrupted and this is how I fixed it.<br />
<br />
Go to Windows File Explorer.<br />
Go to Libraries.<br />
On the right pane delete the Music Library.<br />
Then on the left pane right click Libraries and hit Restore Default Libraries.<br />
Now go to Organize,Manage Libraries and click Music.<br />
Make sure that the folders you need are included and WMP should rebuild the library.<br />
<br />
It worked for me and now things are normal again.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As it is prompting for the SP3 CD to run the SFC scan you need provide the same. However you may follow these alternative methods and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: </span></b><span>Disable the security software temporarily.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span></b><span>Put the computer in Clean Boot state to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

            If you have SP3 installed and do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD with SP3 on it, sfc /scannow is going to complain - alot and there is only one way<span style="font-style: italic">
</span>to<span style="font-style: italic"> </span>make it work.<br />
<br />
If you want to make sfc /scannow happy, you need to take your SP2 XP installation CD and 'slipstream' SP3 and create a new XP installation CD that has SP3 on it (this is a fun project).<br />
<br />
It is unlikely that sfc /scannow will solve your Windows update issue since that is not what sfc /scannow does, that is not what it is for and that is not how it works.&nbsp; While it give you a good feeling when sfc /scannow runs to completion without complaining,
 it is extremely unlike to resolve your issue, but it will waste alot of your time.<br />
<br />
There are many tutorials on the Internet that tell you ways to create a slipstreamed SP3 XP installation CD.&nbsp; Here is one:<br />

            <p>Trying to fix four Net Framework updates that install successfully...but keep trying to reinstall...google searches indicate this is a common problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have tried the Fix IT from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</span></a>&nbsp;but I can run FixIT dozen times and it keeps "fixing" one issue and keeps reporting....<em> "The location where windows update stores data has changed and must be repaired..."</em></p>
<p>One of the solutions on the forum was to run sfc /scannow...thus this post.</p>
<p>I have also tried the <strong>fix it yourself</strong> option on <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</span></a>&nbsp;but that didn't help.</p>
<p>No matter how many times I run "Fix It"...I keep getting a report saying..." <strong>
update needs to be fixed...repair successful</strong>"...but also "<strong>The location where windows update stores data has changed and must be repaired</strong>" but no solution so far is available ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>repeating updates:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KB2656352</p>
<p>KB2572073</p>
<p>KB2518864</p>
<p>KB2539631</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These updates have been installed and removed without solving the issue ?</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick way to solve that error is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening CMD in admin mode and run command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>REagentc /disable</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After you run this command, restart your computer and try to upgrade again!</p>

<p>I keep getting error code 80072efe on my windows vista 32-bit pc. when trying to check for updates. I know I'm connected to the internet, I use Norton to scan for viruses and have none, Ive downloaded microsoft security essentials to help but it keeps saying
 I can't check for updates, I went to windows update help and made sure all the services were set to automatic and nothing seems to help. &nbsp;I downloaded MSE and got the same problem. It would clean my computer but still couldn't get updates. I realized that
 having 2 Anti-virus programs wasn't a good idea so I kept Norton and uninstallled MSE. I don't know what to do Can someone please help?</p>

<p><span><span><strong>Hi jimbeam0341,</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1: </strong><br />
I would suggest you to follow the steps outlined in the below article that talk about the error code you get.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>You may encounter temporary connection-related errors when you use Windows Update or Microsoft Update to install updates:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836941</span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
If the issue still persists, you may try to reset windows update and then check again.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Run the fix it first. If that fails to run, then use the manual steps.</span></p>

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be noted that the "Skype Meeting" in Outlook is a feature integrated with Skype for Business. That is to say, it is the feature of Office 365 (Skype for Business). Since you are using G Suite, it is not feasible to use this feature. The solution should
 be buying an Office 365 Subscription (ie, Office 365 Business Premium) if you are interested in this feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>
