            HI 3Amer4.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Do you have the brightness slider presently at  Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings?
<br />
<br />In the latest Version 1903 they really went to work on this problem with new brightness sliders in Action Center (at right end of taskbar) and Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.  
<br />
<br />So  I would manually upgrade to the latest version by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now. 
<br />
<br />This is the most stable method to change versions which you will need to do anyway, brings all Updates current, and solves most problems at the same time.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If it won't run the Upgrade, this can mean your install is corrupted and would have problems.  What we've found in Windows 10 is that everything depends upon the quality of the install.  You can follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to wait then if it is pushing itself you can block the Version Update until the next one and then try installing it the same way.  The latest version 1903 should be released any day now:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Did you even read my post?  I didn't say a word about Windows Updates which you implied is all I addressed.  
<br />
<br />Is your issue that screen brightness will not adjust?  This is a known issue before Version 1903 so I gave you the fixes for it because you did not say you have Version 1903 and the vast majority don't yet.  
<br />
<br />Do you have the new brightness sliders?  Yes or No?  
<br />
<br />If so then what is the problem exactly?   Are you referring to brightness buttons on your monitro?

            I asked you not to rate my post before I had the chance to help you completely?  Everyone who works with me gets their problem solved.  Did you want my help?  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the above information that you have provided, it seem like Windows is trying to detect the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if the drive is detected in File Explorer. If the drive is detected,&nbsp;right click on the diver and try to open&nbsp;to check for the content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;you are facing the same issue, I suggest you to use a different PC, which is&nbsp;not an Windows 10 OS and check.</p>
<p>This will help us to find the root cause of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help&nbsp;us with more information to assist you better.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Guru Kiran&nbsp;</p>

 wife used Chinese yesterday. I have also noticed that the Caps lock tab will goes to upper class but when pressed again nothing happens. Has anyone had this problem or know of a rectification.</p>

    <title>System slowing down - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System slowing down</h2>
                    <p>I am running my system with windows 8.1 since 1.5 years. It has suddenly slowed down. During startup &amp; loading of initial settings, it runs with normal speed but once it loads completely, its response becomes slow to every command like running of movies,
 songs, games etc. Kindly suggest any solution.</p>

            <p>Hi Sid,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are getting a slow performance issue with the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter how fast or shiny computers might be when they're new, they all seem to get slower over time. That state-of-the-art PC you bought last year might not feel like such a screamer after you install a dozen programs, load it with antispyware and antivirus
 tools, and download untold amounts of junk from the Internet. The slowdown might happen so gradually that you hardly notice it until one day your system stops responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I would suggest you to try the following methods that might help you to optimize your windows for better performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> <br />
I would suggest you to run the System Maintenance troubleshooter and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
a) Press the ‘<strong>Windows + W’ </strong>key on the keyboard.<br />
b) Type <strong><em>troubleshooter</em> </strong>in the search box and then press ENTER.<br />
c) Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Click on <strong>view all </strong>and select
<strong>System Maintenance</strong>.<br />
d) Click <strong>next </strong>and follow the <strong>on-screen instructions</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices other than mouse and keyboard and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Delete programs that you never use. Maybe you thought you might use the software someday, but never did. Uninstall it and see if your PC runs faster.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/uninstall-change-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall, change or repair a program</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, there are third party software conflicts that hinder the system performance. So, you may try to run the system in a selective startup and check which third party process is slowing down the system performance. This process is known as
<em>Clean Boot</em>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Optimize your drive for better performance. Refer to the following link to optimize or repair your drive.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/improve-performance-optimizing-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Improve performance by optimizing your drive</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong><span> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong></p>
<p>If your PC is running slowly, it's possible that it's infected with a virus or spyware. This is not as common as the other problems, but it's something to consider. Run the Microsoft Safety Scanner for check for any viruses/malware on the computer. Refer
 to the following link:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></a></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<strong><br />
<strong><span>Note: </span></strong></strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner
 again.<br />
Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>

            <p>Did you get any error message when the pc crashed?</p>
<p>The crash may have corrupted the file, so it could be that you will need to start again with a new project file.</p>
<p>What video/audio etc file types ware you using? It could be that these are not totally compatible with MM and caused the crash, so you might have to convert them before using them.</p>

    <title>How do i Delete several folders in the C&#58;&#92;Boot folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hanspeeters  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do i Delete several folders in the C&#58;&#92;Boot folder</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I'm running Vista SP2, and with all the WinSXS clogging, my C:\ harddrive space is becoming scarse, only 2 Gb of 32 left.<br />
This also means that defragmentation is slow, and not always can move bigger files.<br />
<br />
I've already moved (uninstall-reinstall) several programs to the D:\ partition, but still, I could do with more space.<br />
<br />
I've seen that in the C:\Boot and C:\Windows\System32 folders there are lots of folders specific to a lot countries that I even haven heard of (joke), but that will NEVER be used on my computer, all taking up to 1,5 - 2 Gb of space.<br />
<br />
I am a computer consultant, so tried to take ownership of the directories and their subs, to be able to delete those folders, but to no avail.<br />
I keep getting the message that I do not have the rights to do it (I did start Explorer as Administrator).<br />
<br />
HOW CAN I GET RID OF THESE FOLDERS ??????<br />
<br />
Thanks beforehand,<br />
<br />
Please<br />
Hans<br />

            <p>Either you get a bigger hard disk or revert to XP. My winsxs folder is 12G. You cannot delete it because it should not be deleted.</p>

            This is a SH.T answer, it does not even deserve to be named as such.<br />
<br />
I am not asking for the SXS folder, I am asking about language files that NEVER EVER are going to be used.<br />
<br />
Not all the people have the money at hand to buy another hard disk, so are looking for a different solution. One which, may I say, even SHOULD be backed by Microsoft themselves.<br />
Because I do not have Ultimate and don't want it, so the F language files can go in the trashcan, if not MS's then Linux's<br />

            Hi  Mabolghar 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It might be possible. 
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.

<br />
<br />Learn how to setup a dual boot:
<br />
<br />This is if your hardware can still run Windows 7. Most modern computers especially those with Skylake and Kabylake processors or AMD Ryzen don't support Windows 7. 
<br />
<br />If yours does, then here is how you do it:

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes, you can dual boot. However 10 and 7 can't be operating with the same license. So if 10 was an update to the 7 license then you would need a new 7 license.<br />
<br />
These should help&nbsp;(they also apply to Windows&nbsp;10)<br />

            I'm afraid I have some bad news, but the only drivers available for this model is for Windows 10 64 bit. There are not even 32 bit Windows 10 drivers. 
<br />
<br />This means, this model laptop likely does not have any Windows 8 or Windows 7 support at all.
<br />
<br />Your best option for running Windows 7 is in a virtual machine.
<br />
<br />Learn how you can set that up:

            Hello Mabolghar,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Note that Microsoft no longer sells Windows 7 license.

<br />
<br />Regards.

            After windows 10 1903 update Iwas unable to change the color of the task bar. When following the direction of windows for this function.&nbsp; The section where one would check mark the function of" Task Bar and action center" it was ghosted out while the"
 chose your color" section had light indicated. One I change the "chose your&nbsp; color" to dark I was then able to check mark the Task Bar and action center; and then change the color of my task bar. Windows documentation is wrong.

                    My computer often slows down. I take speed tests to monitor the internet speed. I&nbsp; to often unplug my wireless router for about 30 seconds. When I plug it back, the speed of the computer improves to the normal. Is there any way to stabilize the computer

            <p>&nbsp;It sounds like you have either a faulty router or a faulty Internet service.&nbsp; Your PC is probably spending a lot of time and CPU cycles trying to recover from connection problems.&nbsp; How many bars do you normally see when you click on your network icon in
 the feedback area (lower right corner of your screen)?&nbsp; If it's only 1 or 2 bars, you're either too far away from the router, your router has a problem, or you need to get a stronger router.&nbsp; If you're using wireless-G, you probably could benefit from upgrading
 to wireless-N.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.</p>

                    I have a new Windows 8 laptop, a Dell Inspiron. I've just noticed what horrible audio recording quality I have! I know it was pretty good before now because I had made Google Video Chat calls and Skype calls with no problem. Now I'm trying to record some
 audio on OnNote and it sounds terrible! I can't even understand what I'm saying. I tried using my microphone and experienced the same problem, although not as bad. I tried using sound recorder: same result. I even tried recording a video on OnNote and still
 had awful sound.&nbsp;
<div>I pulled up the outside Mic Properties and the microphone levels were going crazy. Under Internal Mic Properties the level is at 100 and the mute button is flashing on and off incredibly quickly.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The internal mic is Cirrus Logic High Definition Audio.&nbsp;<br />
<div>I'm not sure what happened!</div>

                    <p>I just shipped my wife's bricked SP4 for replacement - cost $480.00 - now I find this could have resulted from the updates she initiated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SP4 would not shutdown after an update. After it finally shut down, it would not start up. The Microsoft Store could not get it to start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally shipped it to Microsoft for replacement this week. So, my wife gets an old refurbished replacement device for Christmas. Not at all happy about this. I don't think I should have to pay for this.</p>

<p>I have experienced the same dead surface pro 4 which happened last week.</p>
<p>I bought a surface pro 4 i7 256 GB September 2017.&nbsp; My warranty expired on September 18, 2018.</p>
<p>This computer was bought for around $1500. It never worked right from the beginning. It used to freeze constantly during work where I would have to push the power button on and off and relogin to continue my work-- native applications, internet browsing
 and network applications-- didn't matter. Also it would not wake up after sleep. I would have to use the trick where you press the power button shutdown and press volume up and power button together again to make it work.&nbsp; Took to microsoft in nov 2017 without
 resolution of the issue. They gave the same **** answer install updates.</p>
<p>Frustrated in july&nbsp; i reinstalled operating system from scratch still without resolution of the problems.</p>
<p>recently around november 20,&nbsp; let the computer go into sleep and did not open it for 3-4 days. Battery must have run out&nbsp; and now I cannot turn on the computer at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now microsoft wants to charge me $450 to replace out of warranty computer which likely got destroyed due to their updates while it was in sleep mode, does not work. The old computer they will send has 90 day warranty period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to up their game and have some responsibility towards their customer. Please send me the address of the corporate office and I will send you this brick and you can do what you want with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there should be a class action lawsuit against them. They are replacing computers that have flickering problem. Mine did not have that/ did not notice that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you had the device how would you confirm that update broke the device. I still have mine, it cannot be turned on. I took it to local microsoft store yesterday and the tech guy was like "it is bricked". He cannot even turn it on. You cannot open these
 devices and fix them-- one or 2 youtube videos are there but extremely complicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution is if we get enough of the people who have experienced this we can try and talk to the company or lawyers.... Unfortunately my time is also important.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since misery likes company I feel for you and writing this is making me feel better. Rest assured I am not going to send them $450 to give me a old surface pro 4 that has quality issues to begin with</p>

            I bought a Surface Pro 4 Two years ago, after 22 months of use my Surface Froze up and has never turned back on. I brought it to the Microsoft store where they tried to turn it on and was told it was dead and I was unfortunate and unlucky to have mine
 die after less than 2 years. I hope they start replacing as it seems lots of people are having these same issues. My Surface was up to date.&nbsp;

<p>My wife's Surface was about 18 months old. I paid for the replacement refurbished unit - $480 with tax.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the number of issues I have seen reported, Microsoft needs to do what's right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the refurb is acting up...</p>

<p>The SP4 randomly stops detecting the keyboard type cover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have made the 1+ hour trip to the Beechwood store the day after the replacement was received and the keyboard was not being detected. The keyboard worked flawlessly while there, also worked on other surfaces. No issues were detected. On returning home,
 the issue started again. It will randomly just stop working. In Device Manager, it does not show up. Sometimes shutting down the tablet and starting it, reconnects the keyboard. There is no pattern to when it will work or not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This never happened on the original raplaced surface.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I want to transfer old cassette tapes to mp3 files but my os is Windows 7, which audacity isn't compatible with.</p>
<p>Also, the Realtek sound driver doesn't provide for a "line in" input for the 3.5 jack I have from the cassette deck.
</p>
<p>My hardware only has a mic input, no separate "line in."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I give up?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have just been looking at this page on the audacity site; it has reminded me that I don't actually use Audacity for creating the mp3s - the LAME (!) mp3 encoder option is not the best in my opinion...I use NCH switch sound file converter (free version)
 to create mp3 files after I have used Audacity to create wav. files from vinyl or tape sources and I have experienced no issues with either of these.</p>
<p>I think your inability to get the sound through to record in audacity is going to be a setting issue. I have lost my signal by inadvertently changing something and then I've had to retrace my steps to get it back again! And things are probably going to be
 a bit different on your Sony to my Dell, but I'll try and put together a few steps to try and just hope they work for you...R</p>
