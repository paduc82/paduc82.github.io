<h2>            How to Opt out of Insider Program.</h2>
                    <p>I don't want to get anymore Insider program updates. How do I opt out of the program. I've tried following different posts from others. I am ready to "factory reset" my computer but I'm afraid that after I do I'll just get them again. I'm really disgusted
 with these updates. Every time I get an update I wind up spending days fixing problems that they cause. Can someone PLEASE either give me a link to go to or tell me how I can remove myself from the program. PLEASE!!!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem with a single user accessing locally installed O365 apps - especially Outlook. The credential work with online versions of the apps. Opening Outlook triggers a password dialogue box. Entering the password opens another dialogue =
 "use this account everywhere on your device" . Responding 'yes' triggers another dialogue on screen too briefly to read as it is replaced with the original dialogue asking for credentials again. Trying to log in to OneDrive with the known good credentials
 simply triggers an error "your account or password in incorrect..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have have deleted the stored credentials in the Manager - without this fixing the problem. Interestingly, those credentials have not been recreated.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be relevant that this all followed the user having a problem with the lap on the train which resulted in the unit (a Dell Inspiron) restarting in rescue mode and then refusing to boot claiming no boot device was present. Some work in the bios restored
 that but a Bitlocker (not set by us) lockout them had to be bypassed with the unlock code from the Azure database. Thereafter, all local installations of Office products won't recognise the password</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have solved the problem. I spent about 2 hours on the phone with O365 support yesterday. We ran through a lot of elements and tried a variety of corrective actions. This means it is hard to be sure what worked. There are two possibilities and one probability:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>O365 and Azure showed a list of registered devices some of which were redundant. However, it only shows PCs not other devices such as Android ones. We deleted them all (including the malfunctioning device) and allowed the recreation of the current devices.
 TBH, I think this was a bit of housekeeping rather than the core problem</li><li>the 'license' registered on the laptop seemed to be wrong i.e. from a previous O365 installation. Had to use various command line commands to remove and replace the license. Again, not sure if this was central - certainly got no idea how it might have happened
 as the laptop is relatively new and has not had any other copy of O365 on it. The laptop did experience an event (don't know the cause) which caused the bios to stop recognising the boot device (an SDD) and I had to recreate a boot path. It was certainly after
 this that O365 stopped working&nbsp;</li><li>We set up a test user on the PC and were able to configure O365 to connect to the correct account and run. This, I suspect, demonstrated that the problem was some configuration conflict buried deep in the user account configuration. So I deleted the malfunctioning
 account, recreated it, using a MS registered login email and linked the O365 to it. This now all works</li></ul>
<p>The one remaining issue is that account syncing is greyed out with a message that its controlled by an administrator. I am that administrator and I certainly haven't turned it off. I've seen this problem with domain-registered devices but this one is running
 plain old W10 Home which can't be domain linked</p>

<p>I really want to make Drive+ Beta on my Lumia 920 BUT there&nbsp;are downfalls using this&nbsp;in retrospect to Standalone GPS, and other 3rd Party Apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See, prior to getting my 920 I had to endure HTC's "Locations" App for GPS, and prior to that a TomTom SatNav that because costly to run due to subs.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But both the TomTom and HTC's Locations App did have the Speed Camera locations, and TomTom had the Live Traffic, but where are these features is Drive+? I know it's a "beta" still, BUT these features were available on Drive on the Lumia 800/900 here in
 the UK (and one of the exclusive apps that attracted me to Nokia for my new WP8 device)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Nokia want to make a KILLER Navigation App, they really need to get these features in ASAP</p>

<p>Nokia Drive+ Beta is still a work in progress but it does have a speed limit warning feature which is a good feature to have to prevent us from accidentally going over the speed limit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;As for other features, all we can do is wait for if or when they will be added in a future update.</p>

<p>Here maps used to support this but this summer they were yanked out of all european maps due to legislation in France and some other european countries making it illigal to use a gps device with speed camera warnings</p>

<br />
I wasn't aware of the change in legislation but it really doesn't surprise me.<br />
<br />
@Carlos80,<br />
<br />
I don't want to sound like a boring nag but there is still the speed limit warning which is far more useful than telling you about an upcoming speed camera. As long as you stay within the safe speed limit of the road then you don't need to be told when a speed
 camera is about to emerge.

<h2>            How to get a table that is too wide &#40;ie too many columns, NOT too many rows&#41; to flow to the next page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I created a table in excel and copy/pasted it to word. The table is too wide to fit on the page (even in landscape mode) and when I format it to "fit to window" it becomes unreadable because the columns are so narrow. How do I create a break in my table
 to get it to flow to the next page? There is so much info online regarding this topic when it relates to rows flowing to the next page, but I can't find anything for a table that is too wide.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past I have dealt with this issue by just going back to excel and formatting my tables there/ breaking them up into multiple tables that will fit the page, but this is super time consuming and a pain in the butt. Please tell me there's an easier way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice!</p>

            <p>No information is available because it cannot be done... At least not in the manner you're expecting. Word documents flow top-to-bottom, not side-to-side. The only reasonable option is to copy the Excel content individually in "bite sized chunks" that will
 fit on a single page &amp; paste each chunk onto a separate page in the document. [Theoretically, you could try to cut/paste the overflow columns while working in Word, but that would be a more difficult task.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>An acceptable alternative <em>may</em> be to print the data from Excel, then manually insert the output into the document after printing it.</p>

<h2>            How about some golf related emojis &#47; emoticons&#63;</h2>
                    <p>With a PGA bot available to Skype users, and the Masters starting today, how about some golf emojis?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two that I have found on Windows 10 (a flag in a hole, and a person in a pink jumper playing golf) but how about some more?&nbsp; Lady golfer, male golfer, hole in one, 19th hole?
<br />
<br />
With an estimated 60 million golfers worldwide, I am sure I, and my son, would not be the only ones to appreciate and use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We loved the Happy Gilmore emoticons, but some emojis would be brilliant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to know what the&nbsp;decision makers behind the emojis / emoticons as well&nbsp;as&nbsp;other Skype users think&nbsp;about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I couldn't find a "suggestions" page, nor could I find the right category / topic / sub-topic for this.&nbsp; Moderators, please move if necessary.</p>

    <title>Rename a list that has more than 5k items - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> webbrewers3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rename a list that has more than 5k items</h2>
                    <p>I created a data input list for one of my business units, and knowing what a disaster the 5k item limit is, I created a system for them to rename the list when it got to 4000 items. The idea being they'd create a new list at that point from a template. For
 some reason, they went over 5k items , so they've asked me to rename the list. I tried through windows explorer (network locations) and SP&nbsp; Designer but always get the "5k limit" error.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>What's the best way to rename such a list? It HAS to be renamed - this isn't an optional thing - so "it can't be done" isn't even a remote possibility.</p>

<p>Hi webbrewers3,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, I tested with a list named Table1 which has 5001 items in it.&nbsp; Then I navigated to List settings&gt;List name, description and navigation, and succeeded to change its name
 to Table2. Then, I tried to open the site collection in SharePoint Designer and navigate to the list: Table2. I succeeded to change its name to Table3.</p>
<p>The following pictures are the screenshots for my test:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2da2915e-1286-43ed-87b7-89434b9a51f7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2da2915e-1286-43ed-87b7-89434b9a51f7?upload=true" /></a><br />

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, could you provide a screenshot of the error messages you encountered for us to better understand the situation and help you? Moreover, please test whether you can rename the list from the UI
 at your convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I use an app called Outline+, that I bought when OneNote for iPad was not yet available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is fully compatible with OneNote. files and has some extra features (e.g. you can sync via Dropbox or Box, export pages as PDFs, a somewhat better interface). One thing it does lack is audio and video recording.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used OneNote for a while because Outline+ was giving me a lot of synchronization issues, now they seem to have fixed that problem so I am using it as my primary tool on iPad and only switching to OneNote when I need audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check with Outline+ team to see if it would run on the iPad 1.</p>

            <p>I think this is a generic WP8 issue, not specific to any handset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like a bug to me that the sub text in the settings menu displays "off" when the user switches it on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needs fixing.</p>

            After a factory reset of the phone, the Find My phone settings now shows the checkboxes and the on / off setting works.

            I think that this may be a bug as well. According to another post on a different forum, someone contacted windows phone support, and the support team said that they were already looking into the issue, so hopefully an update will be made available that
 might fix this.

            7 months, 2 factory resets and one update later... the problem persists... Does anybody have a solution for this problem, I mean it's really bugging me (to put it nicely)? There are a few bugs which I wouldn't expect from a company like Microsoft (more
 so from a manufacturer like HTC). I'm really disappointed and if I don't fix my bugs soon, I'm afraid I'll have to sell it and go back to Android... At least it WORKED PROPERLY

<p>You are always advised to use full battery when resetting device to try to avoid such issues, and almost certainly visit to a Nokia Care facility required to re-install device software required now.</p>

            <p>Hi Wayne, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you want to import your other account's information&nbsp;to your new account, however, the option to directly transfer&nbsp;data from one Microsoft account to another remains unavailable.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest that you use Windows Live Mail. It's an email client that can synchronize with your web-based email account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you don't have Windows Live Mail, download Windows Live Essentials first from
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-other-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span><font color="#0033cc">here</font></span></b></a></span></span><span> and then install it. After doing so, you'll have the option to download all
 the application available or you could only download Windows Live Mail.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Once you're done installing,&nbsp;configure your two accounts in it. K<font color="#000000">indly refer to this
</font><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span><font color="#0033cc">link</font></span></b></a></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> to learn how to set up an account in Windows Live Mail.
 After setting up your accounts, you&nbsp;can drag and drop files from one account&nbsp;to the other.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps and if you have other questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to inform us.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Best regards.</span>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>my Nokia 950 xl double tap works with its screen protector. Sometimes i have to use a bit of force or boot the screen with the button at 3 o clock. But rather that and keep my screen protected.

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your concern, you might accidentally turned off the double-tap to wake feature on your phone. To check if double-tap to wake is enabled, go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Personalization</strong> &gt;&nbsp; <strong>Lock</strong>
<strong>screen</strong> &gt; you can see the <strong>on</strong> <strong>and</strong>
<strong>off</strong> <strong>button</strong> for double-tap to wake feature below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Importing from Excel</h2>
                    When I attemp to import project data from Excel 2010, I end up with blank tasks up to line 2999.&nbsp; I have attempted to research the issue but with no results.&nbsp; I normally take an hour and clean up the resulting project file but, I should not have to.&nbsp; All
 my data is imported correctly and to the correct fields but, the import function does not stop at the end of my data.

<div>First of all, which version of Project are you using? Is it updated with the latest service pack?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm a little confused by your first sentence and by your third and fourth sentences. First you say the tasks are blank and then you say you spend a lot of time cleaning up the data. Then you further say all the data is imported correctly. I must be missing
 something.</div>

            I am sorry about the confusion.&nbsp; I spend needless time removing all the tasks without and descriptions.&nbsp; I usually have about 50 actual tasks I import but, then I have over 1000 aditional blank tasks tacked on to the end.

            InstrumentTech#1,
<div>Still a little confused. So are you saying that the import works fine except that you have a bunch of blank tasks that appear after you import in addition to those you expected? If so, I would suspect your Excel workbook has extra rows that are getting
 included in the import. Try importing a new fresh workbook and see if you still get the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, are you importing as "new", "append" or "merge"?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, what about my first question concerning Project version and updates?</div>

            To your first question, yes there are over 1000 blank tasks after what I expected.&nbsp; I alway import to a new project.&nbsp; I have copied the project information to&nbsp;new and/or otherwise blank&nbsp;spreadsheets and have recieved the same result.&nbsp; I am using Project
 10.&nbsp; When I look at the properties, I do not see any indication of a service pack.&nbsp; I did try to search the MicroSoft web page for updates but I did not see anything specifically for Projects.

            InstrumentTech#1,
<div>Properties is not where you will find the version number. Go to File/Help. In the middle on the right hand side you will see, "About Microsoft Project". Under that click on the "additional version and copyright information". If you have any service packs
 installed, you will see it as part of the version number. If it does not say SP2, then go to the following page to download it for installation. Make sure you download the correct version for your system and Project version (i.e. 23 or 64 bit). I also recommend
 you install the June 2013 cumulative update as it contains fixes that were released after SP2.</div>
<div><br />
<div>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ee748587</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let's make sure you are up-to-date with your updates and then we can go from there.</div>

            In the Excel workbook, if you press Ctrl+End does the cursor jump to 1,000 rows below your last task? If so, that's the reason.<br />
<br />
To delete extra rows or columns permanently in Excel:<br />
<ol>
<li>Select the rows or columns</li><li>Press Delete</li><li>Delete the rows (Ctrl+-)</li></ol>
<p>As John says, make sure you have the latest Service Pack for your version of Project.<br />

<p>First of all, thank you for your assistance.&nbsp; I am running Project 2010 (14.0.7011.1000) SP2 MSO(14.0.7106.5003) a 32 bit version.&nbsp; The enviroment is Windows 7 Professional version 6.1.7601 Service Pack&nbsp;2 build 7601.&nbsp; I had searched the link you kindly provided
 and ran the latest update (KB2687457)&nbsp;with a resulting, nothing to update message.</p>

            <p>Interestingly enough, I did what you indicated and the curser does jump to row 3000.&nbsp; I highlighted the unsued rows and hit the delete key, and while the rows remained highlighted, I deleted the rows.&nbsp; I hit the CTRL-END key combination again and the curser
 again jumped to row 3000.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have pasted the information that I am attempting to import.&nbsp; When I do this, from row 98 to 2999, are filled with blank tasks.&nbsp; I have attempted this in the past with the same result.&nbsp; Is there something I can place after my data
 to signal the program to end the import process?&nbsp; Thanks for your help.&nbsp; I pasted the beginning end the ending rows of data.&nbsp; Too long otherwise.</p>

            InstrumentTech#1,
<div>Okay it looks like you're up-to-date with updates. I wish there was a consolidated list of version numbers and what they represent in the way of updates but I have yet to find one that's complete and up-to-date.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, based on your response back to Rod, it sounds like the issue is with the Excel file, not the interaction between Excel and Project (i.e. import wizard). I don't think I've ever run into the issue of blank lines in Excel that couldn't be deleted,
 although I have run into a similar issue with Project files (i.e. several "rogue" blank lines). Maybe the issue is you highlighted the "unsued" rows instead of the "unused" rows. You should get a good lawyer and sue those puppies. Okay, bad humor.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You might want to try the following. First, highlight more than the 3000 or so "blank" rows in Excel and delete. If that doesn't help, try copying your valid data rows and pasting into a new workbook, then delete the old workbook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In your original post you mentioned that it took you an hour or so to "clean up" the import. It shouldn't take but a few seconds to delete blank task rows in Project. Were there other issues with the import that caused problems? If so, what?</div>
<div><br />

            <p>John:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "clean up" is mostly due to my inexperience with Projects.&nbsp; There are tasks that have a couple of hours to complete but, projects assigns days instead.&nbsp; I am slowly gaining knowledge on what it is doing and the overall process is getting faster.&nbsp; I am
 going to write a bit of code to create a .CSV file and will import that file.&nbsp; This will take the Excel worksheet completely out of the picture.&nbsp; I think that this should worl well.&nbsp; I do appreciate the effort both you and Rod had provided.</p>

    <title>Using Word VBA to fix paragraph separation issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> la lawyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Word VBA to fix paragraph separation issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a large number of files where sometimes there are 2 forced paragraphs (i.e., 2 vbCr's, caused by hitting enter twice) and sometimes there are 3 forced paragraphs (caused by hitting enter 3 times). Sometimes, this occurs in the same file making for
 inconsistent formatting. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a problem with the paragraph style, but deliberate differences in the spacing caused by an extra vbCr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to force the entire file into 2 forced paragraphs (that is, programmatically delete the extra vbCr IF and only if there are 3 vbCr's in a row). &nbsp;I do not want to change the normally separated paragraphs (i.e., hitting the enter key once).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How could I do that?</p>

<p>You can do this without a macro by using the Replace dialog. Click the More button in the dialog and check the box for "Use wildcards". In the Find What box, enter the expression</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(^13{2})^13@</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the Replace With box, enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>\1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then click the Replace All button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still want a macro, for instance as part of a larger operation, the equivalent in code is</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sub ZapExtraCrs()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim rg As Range<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set rg = ActiveDocument.Range<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With rg.Find<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .MatchWildcards = True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Text = "(^13{2})^13@"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Replacement.Text = "\1"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The expression for the Find What says "find an instance of two vbCr characters (ASCII 13) followed by one or more additional vbCr characters". The \1 in the replacement refers to the first part of the expression surrounded by parentheses. Thus, three (or
 more) paragraph marks will be replaced with only two paragraph marks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Even that is not an optimal outcome. What you should be doing to ensure consistency is using a single paragraph break to separate all paragraphs and setting the paragraph before/after spacing to a suitable value, preferably at the paragraph Style level -
 using different Styles with different before/after spacing settings, according to how much inter-paragraph spacing you want.</p>

    <title>Cannot start up applications in WP8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zwe31  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot start up applications in WP8</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Phone: Nokia Lumia 1020</p>
<p>Software Version: WP8, Lumia Amber</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, I have been using it for about two weeks and recently, there's this problem that seemed to be becoming quite frequent on my phone. What is happening is that I can't seem to open most of the applications,&nbsp;<strong>be it from the home screen or the app
 list</strong>.&nbsp;Every time I want to open an app, the app tile or the list would just
<em>pop in a little</em> (indicating that it has been clicked), and after that, nothing happened; the app will not be opened, no matter how many times I clicked. For example, I clicked the WhatsApp tile pinned on the start screen, and the application will not
 open like aforementioned.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As for the&nbsp;native applications,&nbsp;such as Messaging and Phone, I <em>can</em> open them without any problems. On the other hand, Settings and Office Mobile&nbsp;cannot be opened due to the same reason above; it just popped in then that's it - the application isn't
 opened.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This problem, I observed, seemed to happen 1) after I charged my phone completely, 2)&nbsp;when I changed my phone's settings from Settings, 3) at random. It
<em>can</em> be solved by <strong>soft resetting</strong> my phone (i.e. I can then again open
<strong>all</strong> my applications as normal) but I've been doing it quite a few times that I'm afraid that it might harm my phone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, may I know whether is there any alternate solution to this? Is it because of the phone itself, or is it a WP8 OS problem?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Zwe</p>

            <p>This could be a possible issue that is developing on windows phone 1020. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If it was me, I would try a full phone reset. If that makes the issues return, then you should get the seller to give you a new phone.

    <title>Excel 2008 date input format problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timopearce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2008 date input format problem</h2>
                    <p>I have just updated to yosemite (10.10.5) and reinstalled Office 2008</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel (ver 12.3.6) has a problem with date input recognition. The system is set to UK date format but Excel treats all dates as if they were US format i.e. mm/dd/yyyy This is also true of dates copied and pasted in dd/mm/yyyy format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.g. I copy 20/11/2015 into a cell and it does not even recognise the date as it sees this as the 11th of the both month which does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix? I do not want to spend money upgrading. I am happy with Office 2008 and see no reason I should for no fault of my own lay out anything.</p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><span>I wrote an office 2007 access database many years ago for a local community charity.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Last week they had a big problem (someone downloaded “something” in error) so they had to reset their PC’s (running office 2007).</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I have reloaded MS office from the original disks and the system now works OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
BUT I need to download SP2 and SP3, which they need to be able to output to PDF, etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>But these are no longer on the MS website or available from the Update Now option.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
Where can I get these updates?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
<br />
PS.&nbsp; Yes I know they should update, but they don't want to and can't afford to.</span></p>

                    <p>When replying to an email in Outlook in the main pane, I click the 'Pop Out' button above the message recipient information. But when I click on it a blank new email window opens and deletes any message I was writing in the main Outlook reply pane.&nbsp;</p>

            Dear BT_1992 ,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />This looks like browser issue. Try to use another browser, and In Private mode. Sometimes extensions or cookies can block authorization and cause problems. It is also recommended to clear cache and cookies from time to time. In this article you will find the way how to delete the cache and cookies for most of the browsers <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies</a>
<br />
<br />It is better to avoid Safari, Firefox and Chrome for this as there are lots of problems with browsers recently <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-...</a> That is why please test this in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer in Private (CTRL+SHIFT+P)
<br />
<br />If even in Private you will receive that error, please share screenshot. In this thread you will find tips on how to insert screenshot into message <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

            Dear BT_1992 , 
<br />
<br />Thank you for note.
<br />
<br />In this case first Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10 <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12376/...</a>

<h2>            My drop down menus are blank. I had the same problem with Explorer 7 but not 6.</h2>
                    I downloaded Internet Explorer 8 today and all of my drop down menus are blank on any website. I can't even see the options for "My question is about..." or "Select the Best Forum" drop down menus lower on my ask your question page. I used to use Internet
 Explorer 6 and the drop downs were fine. Awhile ago I downloaded Internet Explorer 7 and I had the same problem. How can I get my drop down menus to show the options again?

<span>Hi TerribleTruth,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask you few questions in order to get a better understanding of this issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have WindowBlinds installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If you have WindowBlinds installed, you may try uninstalling WindowBlinds to check if it works without any issues.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.
</span><span>There likely is an add-on interfering. To verify, you can run Internet Explorer without add-ons by going to Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools and open Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the problem stops, an add-on is causing the problem. To identify what one is causing
 it, go to Tools, Manage Add-ons change the Show option on the left to All Add-ons, select all add-ons on the list to the right and click Disable All. Restart Internet Explorer normally and go to Tools, Manage Add-ons again and enable each add-on one by one
 and test to identify the problematic add-on.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If you wish to remove an add-on completely, you should be able to right click it, choose
 More Information, and then click the Remove button.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Refer the link for more information:
</span><strong><span>Internet Explorer add-ons: frequently asked questions:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Internet-Explorer-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Internet-Explorer-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions</a></span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span>3. I suggest that you perform a virus and a malware/ spyware scan on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may perform online scan from the link:
<strong><a href="http://safety.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://safety.live.com</a></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span>Hope this information is helpful.<br />
Let me know if&nbsp;this worked.<br />
All the best!</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
