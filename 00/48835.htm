<h2>            Functions of laptop keys have randomly changed.</h2>
                    <p>Some of my keyboard functions have drastically changed in Windows 10 since about 2 months ago. The left &amp; right arrow keys no longer navigate left &amp; right, and the home, end, pg down, page up, and delete keys no longer perform those functions. In addition
 to the frustration I'm having with this, I can no longer play my first person shooter game (that I paid for) because the keyboard no longer functions properly and I can't figure out how to undo these changes. Here's a sample of some of these new functions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The left arrow key when typing in the URL space automatically opens a tab showing the code for the tab I was just in.
</p>
<p>Pg Down no longer takes you down screen , it adds a new bookmark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pg Up opens a new tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home opens a new tab to bing.com for questions on Win 10 and it turns on the Caps Lock which can only be turned off after tapping twice.</p>
<p>End automatically adds the number 13428 to whatever you're typing.</p>
<p>Left arrow adds qe</p>
<p>rwi (with the hard return)</p>
<p>Right arrow adds&nbsp; &nbsp;13428 and you can no longer insert the cursor into other portions of text. It will merely delete the text if you try to type over it and basically destroy what you just wrote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this? Any ideas on how to fix? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!<br />

<p>[/quote]I did play the first two...a lot (probably more than you have).&nbsp; And all aliens ever amounted to were small easter eggs.&nbsp; As in, they were entirely optional, avoidable, technically non-canon parts of the game in some cases.&nbsp; You couldn't even get
 the alien blaster in <em>Fallout 2 </em>without having certain skills (you had to have Speech the highest of several skills, then had to perform a repair check on each of the terminals in the electric room on the Oil Rig) and the phaser from
<em>Star Trek</em> was added back by mods.&nbsp; Other than that, I believe there was one alien skeleton in the Sierra Army Depot, but that's it.&nbsp; And I hardly ever encountered the crashed ship in my time with
<em>Fallout 1</em> because it was a random encounter<br />
<br />
So yes, aliens were in the first two <em>Fallout </em>games, but barely and as easter eggs more than actual parts of the atmosphere (there's a reason that aliens are only in
<em>New Vegas</em> with the Wild Wasteland trait).&nbsp; So no, aliens and <em>Fallout</em> don't really mix that well.&nbsp; What Bethesda did initially with the crashed ship was fine.&nbsp;
<em>Mothership Zeta</em> was too much, and Area 51 would probably be the same.&nbsp; And in Nevada or not, the newer
<em>Fallout </em>games don't have the same scale as the older games in terms of their world map (the newer ones are more detailed and have more random locations, but the older ones encompassed large parts of several states instead of just the area around one
 city), so 150 miles is too far away in this case</p>

<p>Logically, if I were a species capable of faster then light travel, and was running out of resources on my own planet, then farming material from planets where idiotic species of semi-intelligent life nuked their entire planet would not only be cost effective
 (no mining costs for drilling and such) not to mention easier then scanning individual planets for resources (just look for massive radiation bursts from planets)... just saying.</p>

<p>Yes, but the plot to <em>Independence Day</em> (which is essentially what you described) doesn't really apply to
<em>Fallout</em>.&nbsp; Rather, the aliens of the 1950s were either trying to kill us (<em>War of the Worlds</em>), save us (<em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em>), or take us over with mind control and whatnot (<em>Invasion of the Bodysnatchers</em>).&nbsp; Except,
 it's a little too late for the first two, and the third would kind of derail the series<br />
<br />
Look, I don't mind seeing an alien skeleton or alien blaster in<em> Fallout</em>.&nbsp; There were a part of that culture, so they should be in there somewhere, but in small parts.&nbsp; If I want to go around shooting aliens on board a spaceship or whatever, I'll play
<em>Half-Life</em> or <em>Halo</em>.&nbsp; Especially when the spaceship is as horribly designed as it was in
<em>Mothership Zeta<br />
<br />
</em>Regardless, all of this arguing is kind of pointless.&nbsp; <em>New Vegas</em> is finished, DLC and all, and the only way to visit Area 51 would be a PC mod</p>

<p>[/quote]First of all, no, aliens were not a main part of <em>Fallout 2</em>, let alone the series beyond being small easter eggs or easily overlooked tidbits (like Skynet being based on alien technology) prior to
<em>Mothership Zeta</em>.&nbsp; And even then, <em>Fallout 2</em> went a little overboard with the pop culture references (they were funny, and it's still my favorite game in the series, but it still was a bit too much), so take that with a grain of salt.&nbsp;
 Secondly, the alien blaster was in <em>Fallout 2</em> as an easter egg (two easter eggs actually), which you can see
<a href="http://www.falloutwiki.com/Alien_blaster_%28Fallout%29#Fallout_2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp; And the fact that you didn't know about it illustrates my point about easter eggs and easily avoidable parts of the game. Third, that's just as out of place.&nbsp; And isn't the
 whole Area 51 conspiracy supposed to be only one alien, not 15-20?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium product key</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba L770 laptop with a dead hard drive, I bought an SSD drive and want to re-install Windows 7 on the laptop. It has a product key on the bottom but when I enter the product key to download a Windows image disk, all I get is a message that
 the key is for preinstalled software. Aside from spending hours on hold with Toshiba, is there any way I can activate Windows 7 using the product key I got with my laptop ? I have tried to contact Toshiba but gave up after a half hour on hold.

            <p>Step 1: Download a copy of Windows 7:</p>
<p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_7-system/how-to-what-are-my-options-for-obtaining-windows-7/528163c1-0b2e-4ad2-a26d-7112851d1dc2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How to: What are my options

<em>
<p>What to do if you cannot get recovery media from your manufacturer, refuse to use or purchase it or the Microsoft Software Recovery Website is not working?</p>

</p><p>Step 2: Perform a custom install, see Windows 7 section of the following article how to perform a custom install:</p>

Hi, there's no Pin option on the login screen. In Settings it says to "Create PIN" with an "Add" button.&nbsp; It then asks for password and then asks for confirmation of my PIN. When I enter if the box disappears leaving me back in Sign-in Options

    <title>LOST ADMINISTRATIVE PRIVILEGES, LOST ADMIN ACCOUNT, LOST DEFAULT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr.chubs  say:</h3>
<h2>            LOST ADMINISTRATIVE PRIVILEGES, LOST ADMIN ACCOUNT, LOST DEFAULT SETTINGS AND EVERYTHING</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hi there!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Okay, so First Let me explain why I've lost my administrative privileges&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Once I've Discovered the Chrome Remote Desktop Control I've got too excited to try this but once I installed this in my PC it says that error blah blah and blah blah then It gets to the point that I've searched for the
 solution on that error I've search in Youtube and I clicked a tutorial video and I thought that video will help but I was wrong nothing happens and It made my PC worse. The tutorial said that I must open in run the NETPLIWZ and then Control Folders and Click
 show hidden files and Go to Users in your C:// Drive then click your Account and then Click App Data and Right Click the folder TEMP&nbsp;</strong><strong>and select properties then security then click edit then add then advance the click find now and select the
 username you see in the NETPLWIZ and then click apply and ok and thats all. &nbsp;I've lost my Administrative Privileges so I can't Install software and programs and I discovered that my only one administrator account has changed into a Guest account, So I've searched
 for another solution and I tried them all but it always Access Denied so I've tried to open an elevated Command Prompt in the System Recover Mode, but when &nbsp;I log on I saw an account named Administrator once I've clicked it it says that this account is disabled.
 So I made an experiment. I look for the command line on how to change guest account into a admin account and I tried also but it only made things worse. My Account was lost the only account left is the guest but once I clicked it It turns out nothing. Once
 logged in it always says "Preparing Custom Personalization and Web blah blah and blah blah blah. I tried to enable again the Built-in Administrator Account but everything was too late even if I open the system recovery option when I'm always selecting my account
 RANMA the only option left was System Repair and no Command Prompt and Everything. I don't Know the password for the HomegroupUser$ and Updatususer. I regret all of what I've done. I made thing worst and I can't turn it back.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Are there another way Instead of reinstalling windows????? If there are please tell me. I need to fix this before the Summer Vacation Ends.&nbsp;</strong><br />
<strong>Thank you for Viewing this Question and I hope Someone will response Quick as much as I expect. And I still Hoping that this problem will be solve soon. Thank you Microsoft Community :D :D :D :D :D&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p>Hi Mr.Chubs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I understand you correctly you have only one user account on your computer which is a Standard account. Correct me if I am wrong. If you don't have any other administrator account then first try to create a new user account with administrator permission
 and see if you get success. If it ask for administrator password in creating new user account then you might need to enable default administrator on your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For creating new user profile as an administrator on your system you may refer to the article mentioned below and see if it helps you to create new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><strong>Create a user account</strong>
</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For enabling default administrator account on your system try to refer the step provided in the article mentioned below.</p>
<p>

</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>This article is for Windows Vista but steps hold good for Windows 7 too.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. <span>If issue still persists post </span>back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <div style="text-align: justify">Hi there, I'm so happy that someone replies really quick. I have a question, How can I enable the Built-in Administrator account, Via safe mode or via System Recovery???<br />
If it is in System Recovery Option, It is Impossible because the only option left was System Repair and I don't know the password for HomegroupUser$ and the Updatus Acc. And I forgot to mention that My Account Before is the only Administrator Account not a
 Standard but When I do the Chrome Remote Control thing In turns out to be a Guest/Standard Account even when I change the type of account nothing happens it always display as the Guest Account user. :D :D :D When I'm Logging On the only account left is the
 Guest Account which I accidentally Made it to an Administrator account because of my Stupid Idea :( I can only open it in safe mode but even when I tried to enable built in account in safe mode in the guest account it always say System Error Access Denied.
 :( :( :( How can I revert back the Guest Account into a Guest account again not an administrator account and how can I Revert back the Built-in Administrator Account but not disabled &nbsp;Account when I'm gonna click/select it when I'm logging on as it appears
 before I tried it d :D :D Thanks again :D :D &nbsp;I hope You'll reply as quick as you did before :D&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            SfB online - Persistent chat</h2>
                    
<p>We have recently deployed SfB and do not have access to&nbsp;persistent chat. We want to&nbsp;create groups / chat rooms where conversations can be on-going for weeks and be able to view all the history of the chat without having to refer to outlook or another area
 of SfB.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this is possible with the online version of SfB - it appears to be available in the "on prem" version.</p>

<p>Hi Vince,</p>
<p>It’s not feasible to achieve that in the Skype for Business online.</p>
<p>However, it’s a good idea. The best way to influence our product is to submit feedback via:

<p>I think the closest you will get is to create an Office 365 group. It allows persistent group IMs, not exactly the same but better than nothing.</p>

                    <p>I purchased Windows 10 when I upgraded my computer in September, 2015, and have definitely NOT enjoyed the experience.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I have Windows 7 on 3 other computers and I have absolutely no interest in&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>DOWNGRADING
 them&nbsp;to Windows 10 </strong></em></span>until&nbsp;Microsoft fix the many severe problems they have, particularly with the vulnerabilities with EDGE.&nbsp; Windows 10 is the biggest piece of **** operating system I've ever had and I would&nbsp;revert back to XP in a heartbeat
 if I could.&nbsp; As a result of these vulnerabilities, I have been the victim of multiple malicious attacks which did significant harm to my installation.&nbsp; These attacks have cost me nearly as much at the computer did and my time lost was significantly more than
 that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last Thursday, I ran the SFC program to see if my suspicion that I had&nbsp;corrupted and/or missing Windows 10 files was correct.&nbsp; To my great relief, it found and corrected most of the problems I had.&nbsp; However, after the first cold boot, when I tried to access
 the control panel form the menu that pops up when you right click the Windows 10 icon at the lower left corner of the home page, instead of getting the Control Panel, I got a&nbsp;"<strong><em>::(26EE0668-A00A-44D7-9371-BEB064C98683) The remote procedure call failed</em></strong>"
 error.&nbsp; I reran the <em><strong>SFC /RUNNOW </strong></em>command as a system administrator and it did not correct the problem.&nbsp; I then ran the "<em><strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong></em>" command as a system administrator and then
 reran the <em><strong>SFC /RUNNOW </strong></em>command as a system administrator.&nbsp; Neither corrected the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can still reach the control panel by other routes, but Windows 10 remains, for me, functionally impaired and I have so little confidence in this product, I'm thinking seriously about converting to LINUX or MAC&nbsp;systems.&nbsp; Is there anyone out there who can
 help me fix this piece of ****?</p>

            It took me a couple minutes to&nbsp;figure out the directory structure from your shorthand.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I clicked on the&nbsp;shortcut, it did open the control panel.&nbsp; But it did not fix the problem of not being able to open it from the &nbsp;Windows 10 dialog box, itself.&nbsp;
 It appears that link is corrupted.&nbsp; How do I fix it?

            <p>All files have the same dates and times.&nbsp; They also function.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>But that is not the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I get the error when I attempt to access the Control Panel from the dialog box that opens when you right click on the Windows 10 icon on the extreme left side of the task bar.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>It is<em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">that </span></strong></em>"<strong><em>Control Panel</em></strong>" command that initiates the error.</li><li>It is the very same dialogue box that contains the "<em><strong>Shut down or sign out &gt;</strong></em>" command</li></ul>
<p>So, how do I fix that?&nbsp; The command responds the same way regardless of whether I right click or left click on it.</p>

<p>4. Run ProcMon, and it starts capturing events</p>
<p>5. Press Win+X key and then press P (same as clicking Right-clicking Start, and clicking Control Panel)</p>
<p>6. When the error dialog appears, let it remain. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

            <p>This is really maddening!<br />
<br />
I went through steps&nbsp; 1 thru 4 OK.&nbsp; Got to step 5 and after right clicking Start, when I clicked Control Panel it functioned like it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I turned ProcMon off, right clicked Start and clicked on Control Panel, after a pause it failed and I got the same alarm.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I repeated the recommended process four times with the same result.&nbsp; It seems I&nbsp;cannot produce a failure when ProcMon was running.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I turned ProcMon off, I get a&nbsp;failure every time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that whatever is happening, ProcMon seems to disable whatever is causing this problem.&nbsp;

What next?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>Which "Ms FixIt " are you referring to?</span></p>

<p>Hi Stewart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Hiberation, there is no problems, if you Empty your Temp Folders. The problem does exist, if you are simply letting the computer go to sleep. The operating system writes information to Temp folders during use. There is absolutely no problem
 in emptying the Temp Folders and doing a Shutdown or restart of the Computer. Works fine and no crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you use Sleep Mode and you decide to empty the Temp Folders and run Disk Cleanup, you should reboot the computer prior to Sleep Mode.</p>

                    <p>I tried to reset my computer to factory settings but since I have installed windows 10 I no longer get that option but when I go in settings it does allow me to completely delete all of my files.&nbsp; Once I chose that option, the computer restarts then a blue
 screen comes on and asks me to choose my keyboard setting and has several countries to choose from but there is no mouse arrow for me to choose therefore I cannot complete the task.&nbsp; I just turn the computer off holding the on button down and try to start
 again but still have to go through the same process.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>windows 7 computer crashing shortly after startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe aaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 computer crashing shortly after startup</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I recently updated my laptop from xp to windows 7 about 4 months ago.&nbsp; In the past two months I began to experience the laptop shutting down about 30 to 40 seconds after I press the power button.&nbsp; To fix it I had to remove the hard drive and boot the laptop
 a couple of times.&nbsp; I would then reinstall the hard drive and it would run through a memory test and reinitialize and boot up and recover to an earlier restore point.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; I am running windows security essentials and just realized that windows 7 has it's own security program windows defender.&nbsp; I am going to switch to that by removing windows security essentials and turning on windows defender.&nbsp; Not sure that is going to
 do the trick, however, cannot afford to loose time fixing this laptop every week.&nbsp; In the last two months this shutdown has happened 3 times.&nbsp; The last two occurrences have been within a week.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Any info would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You may disconnect the hard disk from this computer and connect it to different computer. Then check this disk for any errors.<br />
<b><br />
Refer to the following link to check for disk errors:</b><br />
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>This tool will help us to find the bad sectors on your hard disk and try to repair them.</font></span>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-vista/check-your-hard-disk-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-vista/check-your-hard-disk-for-errors</font></span></a></p>
</span></font><br />
Now connect the hard disk to your computer and check if it works fine.<br />
<br />
I suspect it is an issue with faulty hard drive. Because currently you are using the new RAM module and you have newly installed the operating system. So the faulty RAM and corrupt operating system files are not causing the issue.<br />
<br />
If you have any external hard disk, connect it to this computer and try installing operating system onto it and check the functionality. If it works fine, you may need to replace the corrupt hard drive.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Diablo III &#43; Windows 10 Dont Fit Properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sadie e allen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Diablo III &#43; Windows 10 Dont Fit Properly</h2>
                    The title says it all.&nbsp; I have Played Diablo III with no problem when I had Windowss 8.1 for quite some time now.&nbsp; But after I upgraded to Windows 10, Diablo III doesn't work in a certain area of the game.
<br />
<br />
I never would have known this had I not started a new character and gone through the quests from the beginning.&nbsp; Since I cannot take this level 21 character further, I don't know if it does this in later areas while in Quest mode.&nbsp; When doing the "Blood and
 Sand" quest in the desert, The ghost of Zoltan appears, talks and follows my party while trying to get away from the entrance to that area.&nbsp; As soon as I encounter the first monsters to fight, the screen freezes.&nbsp; While the audio is not affected, the video
 is.&nbsp; All I can do at that moment is to go to desktop and close the game out.&nbsp; I have tried this with new characters in both the Seasons and regular playing modes.<br />
<br />
On the Diablo, a person gives the suggestion to go to a certain website and download a zipped file and extract the contents into my Diablo III folder so that the version of DirectX packed into the file will affect only the Diablo III game as opposed to making
 a computer-wide change.<br />
<br />
I have learned through the years not to follow links and download files from links that are put on public forums.&nbsp; Can someone help me with this?<br />
<br />

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
The issue seems to be with the display card drivers. Usually when you install Windows 10 all the drivers for the hardware gets installed with the operating system files. If you are facing any issues with the drivers installation, then I would suggest you to
 go to the device manager and right click on the device so that you will have the option to upgrade the drivers. If you are still facing the issue, then you can download the drivers for that particular hardware from the manufacturers website and install in
 compatibility mode. Also check with the computer manufacturer to see if there are any updated drivers for Windows 10.<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I followed the link you gave and it had me do the compatibility test.&nbsp; I ran it twice...once with the comp. program dialing my windows back to Windows 7 in compatibility mode...and the second time when the comp. program suggested adjusting the DPI.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither of the two did any good...The game still freezes in the same spot.&nbsp; After running my full level 70 characters through the same area yesterday, I found that ALL of my characters freeze in the same desert...no matter what level and no matter from
 where I enter the desert...regardless of whether I'm doing the Blood and Sand quest.&nbsp; The screen freezes but there is still sound going on in the game.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Diablo III public forums suggested that the problem was in the directX version used in Windows 10.&nbsp; Is there a way I can have a copy of the Windows 8.1 directX version placed in the Diablo III directory, as they suggested to solve the problem?&nbsp; If
 so, where could I get a "clean" copy of that version of directX and it's related files?<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 hidden HDD space</h2>
                    Hi i have problem with missing HDD space. After turning off and deleting hibernation and system restore files i have moved pagesys file to second HDD. Than i have&nbsp;analysed my System partition that is 50GB (47.7) and i saw that 33,9GB is used but Windows
 is reporting that i have only 1,4GB free space.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to find out where is missing space but i couldn't find it. &nbsp;Here is screenshoot&nbsp;http://i.imgur.com/bp71EsQ.jpg
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also noticed that my system sometimes restore missing space but shortly after that space is missing again. It looks like something is reserving dynamically.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What should i do?</div>
                </div>

            I have done every clean up i could think off and nothing. Now i have searched a bit more and i have found that my Windows folder is 35GB! And there is my space. After calculating used space with Windows folder size of 35GB everything is as it should be
 (around 50GB). Most space in Windows folder is&nbsp;occupied&nbsp;by Windows/System32/config (around 16GB). There are bunch of small files named:
<div><br />
<div>DRIVERS{0b492a0a-5bd8-11e2-be85-00268337f1e4}.TM.blf (64KB x 16100 files)</div>
<div>and</div>
<div>DRIVERS{9349806e-423d-11e2-be7a-00268337f1e4}.TMContainer00000000000000000002.regtrans-ms (512KB x 32200 files)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everything else in System32 folder is around 4,2GB</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everything (except Winsxs and System32 folders) in Windows folder is around 5,6GB</div>
<div><br />
<div>Winsxs folder is about 9.2GB</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't think that is normal&nbsp;behavior. On Windows 7 my Windows folder was around 20GB an it wasn't increasing. Now i can't work on my PC because my free space is constantly decreasing. I had around 11GB of free space after clean Win8 install and with all
 programs that i have now. But now i have less than 1GB of free space without installing any additional software. I really don't know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently came across something that indicates at least sometimes this is related to Search Indexing basically going nuts....The file getting out of control seems to &nbsp;be... C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data\Applications\Windows\Windows.edb....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This file is in an area that is locked unless you have altered the Ownership\Permissions of the folders, but you should be able to get to DATA and check it's file size to see if it's the culprit...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, here are a couple of links with more info.....</p>

            <p>That's not the case. It's the regtrans-ms files that use up all the space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read that these will be created as soon as the registry has been altered. In my case every 3 minutes 2 of these files are created. Currently I am moving towards 40.000 of those files leaving Windows almost unusable!</p>

            <p>Sorry, but I am quite disappointed by this response. If people have the exact same question why post a new thread?</p>
<p>And, more important, why do you have the option to click a link "x People had this question. Me too" ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But anyway: I will create a new topic. If my issue is solved quicker if I post my own topic that is fine with me.</p>

                    <p>Hello! So a weird thing has been occurring on my friend’s Xbox for the past couple months. Basically, whenever&nbsp;anybody, and I do mean anybody, even random people not on his friends list, presses the “Join Game” option on his profile, it launches Halo 5 Guardians. We have literally no idea why this has been happening and it’s pretty annoying. Any advice would be fantastic, thanks!</p>

<h2>            Upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10 and TouchPad no longer detected</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Acer Aspire E 17 - ES1-711-P1UV</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I updated my OS from Windows 8 to Windows 10 I noticed that the touchpad stopped working.&nbsp; I connected a USB mouse to the Laptop and that allowed me to have mouse functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Acer's website and entered my serial number and downloaded the drivers that were under Windows 10 - 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>specifically downloaded </p>
<table>

<p>

<td>ELANTECH</td>
<td>Touchpad Driver</td>
<td>13.6.3.1</td>
<td>7.3 MB</td>
<td>2015/07/27</td>
<td>
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>After I downloaded this I double clicked on setup and installed the software.&nbsp; I did not see any errors.&nbsp; I restarted the computer and my touchpad did not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the system settings and viewed the Device Manager and noticed there is an Unknown Device.&nbsp; I installed the Unknown Device and scanned to detect new hardware/software and the Unknown Device reappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My TouchPad still did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Acer and their live support had me do several things and nothing happened.&nbsp; They escalated me to their "Supervisors" and they responded "Contact Microsoft as it sounds like it's an issue with them." and they disconnected.&nbsp; They have GREAT customer
 service *sarcasm*.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm stuck without the ability to use the touchpad on my keyboard and also the FN + F7 does not do anything either.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<br />
</span><span>As Windows 10 is new operating system, the drivers for the hardware might not be available. I would suggest you to uninstall the drivers for the touchpad and re-install
 in compatibility mode.<br />
<br />

            <p>Thank you for your reply; however there is no drivers to Uninstall as windows does not detect the touchpad. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into device manager nothing is listed under the mouse tier. &nbsp;I even went into view and tried to make sure everything was visible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the manufacturer website and tried to install drivers but nothing gets installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So with nothing to uninstall... and nothing is detected.. I'm stuck.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can always resort back to Windows 8.0, which I did when none of the fixes worked for me on my ASUS.&nbsp; You have 30 days after the initial download of 10 to revert back to your previous OS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try: Settings/Update and Recovery/Recovery/Go Back To A Previous Version of Windows/Get Started</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend backing up files, but it shouldn't be an issue.</p>

            <p>Hey, StickingNell! Sorry to see any issues with playing Domino Master! When you launch up the game, aside from asking if you own the game, does it give you an error code with that error message? It should start with 0x, followed by letters and numbers (or only numbers). With that, we'll at least be able to see what's happening with it.</p>
<p>If it doesn't have an error code, have you tried removing and downloading the game again? If that doesn't work, we can dig into other troubleshooting steps to help get you sorted out. :)</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't have permission to save in this location.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you like to save in the Documents folder instead?<br />

When I select Yes for this question, the same error appears again. This only started happening in the past few hours. I have tried changing from my @outlook.com account to a local one, checked all my administrator settings, restarted multiple times. All to
 no avail. I am the only user of my PC, so it's not like someone changed my permissions.

</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to give permissions to the drive:</span></p>

<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on ‘<strong>Security’</strong> tab and under ‘<strong>Group or user names</strong>’ click on ‘<strong>Edit</strong>’.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>
‘Add’</strong> and type <strong>‘Everyone’</strong>.</span></p>

<strong>control’</strong> and click on ‘<strong>Apply’</strong> and Click ‘<strong>Ok’</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
