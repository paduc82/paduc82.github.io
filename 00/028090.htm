            Yes, just tap the arrow to the left of the ringtone and it will play.

    <title>Internet Explorer won&#39;t access Hotmail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dominic0904  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer won&#39;t access Hotmail</h2>
                    I'll give some backstory to this before I actually post what the issue is so it may be easier to understand I am coming from and to know what I have tried to do already to solve this issue.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Basically for Christmas I bought my Mum and Brother a Dell Inspiron 15 laptop. Both have Windows 7 Home Premium on them.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Being the only technically proficient one in the household I went to set up their laptops. I connected them to our WiFi, installed any programs they needed such as Skype and Chrome. All the while Windows was downloading the vast amount of Windows Updates
 that needed to be installed (the first set was around 115+ updates? My brother's one needed to install 150+).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So after more or less a whole day of letting the updates download and install I left them to it. But the next day my Mum tells me that she cannot sign into her Hotmail account using IE. So I check it out and she can get to the sign in screen fine (where
 you put your email address and password in) but once she clicks Sign In it loaded up a blank white page with black text that read:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&lt;body onload="javascript:rd();"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I installed the latest Java update from their website and that did not help. So what I did next was upgrade her IE to 11 by installing it from the offical site.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now when I rebooted her computer and tried to sign into hotmail using the freshly installed IE 11. Instead of showing me a Java script error text the page was just white. No writing or anything, just a white page.</div>
<div>So I did typical things to try and see if I could solve it. Wiping her browsing history, cache and letting more updates install (it's still finding more bloody updates even as we speak). None of that worked. Still just a white page.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So then I decided to downgrade her back to IE 10 which was what she originally had by going into Control Panel - Programs - Uninstall IE 11 update and rebooting.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Interestingly enough now when I try signing in now. I look at the address bar and for about 10 or so seconds I can see it kind of spaz out. It first has the long url for login.live or whatever when you sign in. But then it changes to "about.blank" and
 then back to the login.live url. It flips between these two for about 10 seconds and then redirects to a Outlook page that reads in little red text "Something when wrong and we cannot sign you in at this time. Please try again in a few minutes".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And that's the point in which I decided to come onto this forum and try my luck. The funny thing about this error is that this issue is also present on my brother's laptop as well AND my mum's old laptop that runs Vista. But here is the catch with my mum's
 old laptop. She could sign into IE perfectly fine on her old laptop for the 5-7 years she was using that laptop. It is only when I did a Factory Reset to set it up again so my Dad could use it that the issue came up. On the old laptop the page just has that
 Java script error I wrote about earlier.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So can anyone help me out on this? I really am stuck and my mum does not want to use Chrome. My Mum isn't very technically literate so she does not want to go through the hassle of trying to learn a new browser no matter how easy it is.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Dominic.</div>

            <p>Hi all - this series of posts has been illuminating. My Hotmail a/c started to go wrong a week or so back. Can sign in and get same script that Dominic was getting. Yes, I have Avast on this laptop. Our other laptop runs Windows Security Essentials and I
 have no issues getting into Hotmail on that machine. On this one I can get into my gmail a/c and use Google as my search engine (not chrome). Same on the other laptop. Both run latest Java - updated in last 36 hours. Both run CCleaner and MalwareBytes.</p>
<p>Why Avast (used to use AVG) is/maybe the issue I don't know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled Windows Live from programs and tried via Google to Hotmail and sign-in and get same load-on script that began these postings. So, it has to be somethig on this machine. If Avast is the culprit I shall be disappinted as it has worked well
 for me. I am concerned that Dominic (I think) said he uninstalled Avast but still had issues. Perhaps uninstalling it and then reinstallng it might be a route, I don't know.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, since writing the above and saving notes to desktop, I have uninstalled Avast - sad to do it - but I needed to find stuff out. I restarted laptop and via Google went to Hotmail.co.uk - my address - and signed in - went straight into my Hotmail account
 - not been able to get in regularly since last weekend. So, with sadness it would seem Avast, for me, was a problem. I will now duplicate the other laptop and use Windows Security Essentials. Chris.</p>

<h2>            hyperlinks to other documents</h2>
                    hi I am using word 2013. can you point me to a video that shows how to create a document with hyperlinks to other documents from my computer, not Web pages, but personal documents, that the hyperlinks will work when I email it to someone? I created one
 but the pages I hyperlinked didn't go with it I guess. thanks!&nbsp;

            As long as the other documents are only on your computer, you won't be able to make hyperlinks to them that will work on any other computer -- there's just no way for the link to get to its destination.<br />
<br />
If you store the documents on SkyDrive or Dropbox or some other sharing service, you can get an HTTP address from the service that points to a specific document. Also make sure the sharing permissions for the document are set to allow access for the people
 who will get your Word document with the link, or share with everyone.<br />
<br />
Then in Word's Insert &gt; Hyperlink dialog, you can paste the HTTP address into the Address box. Fill in the Text To Display box with whatever you want to appear on the Word page.

<h2>            Office 2016 and MacOS 10.14</h2>
                    <p>I am running MacOS 10.14 on an iMac that has a licensed copy of MS Office 2016 Vr 16.18 (181014) installed yesterday.</p>
<p>Prior to updating to MacOS 10.14, MS Office was working well.</p>
<p>Post updating and on opening Word I was requested to Activate the app??</p>
<p>In the process of attempting to get MS Office operational I checked and found updates which is why I now have Vr 16.18 installed</p>
<p>I went through the activate process using the "Sign In" option entering my user email and password and the app searched and responded that "No License Found" "Buy Office" / "Use Anther Account"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is affecting all the installed MS Office components, not just Word</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total frustration! I spent most of the day trying to sort out this issue so that I can continue to use an application that I purchased and have used since it first came out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help, please</p>

</p><p>Which license/ subscription you have? Is it Office 2016 for mac (perpetual) license or Office 365 subscription?

<p>
</p><p>If you have Office 2016 for mac (perpetual) license, then you can’t activate version 16.18. Starting with the 16.17 release in September 2018, it applies to Office 2019 for Mac,&nbsp;

            Hi Claire,
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; send requests to the required attendees.
<br />Importing will import appointments only. It won't handle meetings. You would need to use a macro (in outlook desktop software) or open each imported event and send it. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; Error message: The folder specified in the Import Calendar Event request is a shared or read-only folder"
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Do you have read-write access to the calendar?
        </p>

<p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My skills are quite basic when it comes to Microsoft, so I'm not sure how to create and use a Macro. Is this something that is quite simple?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I should have read-write access to the said calendar, but will query this with my IT department.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            If you can use a macro (not all corporations allow their use), you only need to know how to read.  I have a macro at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/developer/create-appointments-spreadsheet-data/#meeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/developer/create-appo...</a>
<br />
<br />One way you can check permissions: click on the calendar and create an appointment. If it creates a meeting request from you, you don't have the correct permissions to import to the calendar.

            <p>I love how you linked a Word 365 link for assistance with what she stated was Word 2013. Your settings and gear menus are not the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just today noticed the same thing, and I have both a licensed version of Office 2013 and Office 365 and I am just now getting an "Unlicensed Product" issue on my computer and when I try to verify the account through the internet, it constantly says "cannot
 connect to the server, please try again in a few minutes" (0x80072EFD) (which I will note does not have a thread on your support site based on this error code). &nbsp;My firewall is disabled and should allow office to connect, and since my onedrive is connected,
 I'm assuming the network is not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist with a way to keep my activated Word 2013. I am not looking to upgrade from a paid in full version to a subscription-based access model on this machine.</p>

    <title>Unable to access Office 365 account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abhi_ed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to access Office 365 account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a "work account" with which I used to access my emails from Office 365 portal. And then I used to login to Skype from the same account. Aftersome time I changed the password which works fine with skype but not with the Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using my old password to access Office 365 but failed. I have a confusion what was the password that I kept. I tried several combinations which I vaguely remember but I am not sure after how many attempts the account gets blocked. So, I stopped trying.
 When I tried "forgot password", it says Administrator has not activated resetting of password for your account. But I don't want to contact my administrator for resetting of the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am logged into Micorsoft Outlook at three places: My Android phone, laptop and office's computer. That means I am able to access my emails. But I am afraid my VPN connection also works with the same password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to access my old password? If not, at least I want to reset password on my own. Also, I wanted to know what is the rate of wrong attempts of password that I can afford in order to avoid being block out from account through Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me out of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Abhishek<br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why only USB cable CA-157 is using in certain phones? I want my C6-00 also able to use the smiliar function. And WHY this cable is proprietary? NOT microUSB as most of the new phones use?&nbsp; :smileymad:<br />

<p>Hi user109,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Nokia Discussions Forum! USB OTG (On The Go) is indeed compatible with only few Nokia devices. It is the same thing like with most of the features in mobile phones, some features are meant to work with certain software or hardware. Unfortunately
 it is not possible to get the USB OTG to work with C6-00.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Like we can see from<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://europe.nokia.com/find-products/accessories/all-accessories/memory-cards-and-cables/cables/nokia-adapter-cable-for-usb-otg-ca-157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>, the&nbsp;USB OTG
 cable&nbsp;CA-157 has male micro USB connector on the other end, and female normal USB connector on the other end. It is meant to be used with&nbsp;USB memory devices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I didn't quite get what do you mean by "WHY this cable is proprietary?"?</span></p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel sort left to right function</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using Office 2016 for Mac (OSX El Capitan) and have youtube'd, google'd, even read the microsoft excel help guide on how to sort data by row.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done all the proper steps: click on a cell which is in the row to be sorted, click on "sort", click on "option", click on "sort left to right", and then I should have the option of choosing which row but the option still remains for COLUMNS, not rows.
 I've tried this on another Mac using Office 2011 for Mac and it works okay.</p>
<p>Appreciate any input in this. Thanks!</p>

            I'm sure it's possible, but why reinvent the wheel? It's far easier to set up a few cells in a sheet and run the Solver from VBA.

<h2>            Macros, VBA, Excel Spreadsheets, User-forms, Errors, MOSS, One Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I was wondering if someone could help me with the following query, I will admit in advance that I am a dinosaur when it comes to computers please take it easy on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend created me an Excel database , which appears with a MAKRO WORKS user form upon updating the user-form the information is then transferred to the separate tab &nbsp;(spreadsheet) in form of a database with auto filters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I am encountering is that it works as intended on my personal computer etc. However whenever I use it at work I am bombarded with several errors such as the one below. I initially thought the problem was in the trust center because i cannot actually
 enable macros due to having no administrative &nbsp;rights (its grayed out). However, now I am now lead to believe the problem is occurring because the platforms i am using this database on save temporary files for example the One Drive or Microsoft Office Share
 point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In work, these are the only platforms in order to share work documents? is there any solutions to the problem. your help will be massively appreciated &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Harry</p>

            I suspect you will have to take this up with your system administrator, whoever that might be. [It is quite common for corporate environments to restrict Excel to non-macro capabilities - i.e. no XLM/XLSM files.]<br />

<h2>            Tasks stuck on &#34;Loading...&#34; Office OWA 365</h2>
                    <p>When I try to open the "Tasks" tab it gets stuck on Loading.. and won't load the page. Same thing with Edge, IE, Chrome and Firefox. And every computer I have tried this on</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open up the console in one of the browser I can see a lot of error's like</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTTP401: DENIED - The requested resource requires user authentication.</p>
<p>(XHR)GET - https://webpoolam41e03.infra.lync.com/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/112097193517?instanceId=ddba4824-6254-4a84-88cf-c517cbd6594f</p>
<p>
</p><p>and</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTTP403: FORBIDDEN - The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.</p>
<p>(XHR)GET - https://webpoolam41e03.infra.lync.com/Autodiscover/AutodiscoverService.svc/root/user</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot of the console&nbsp;http://i.imgur.com/DnthshX.jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's strange because when I got first contacted with this problem I was able to open up the tasks tab and everything worked fine, then I opened up the mail tab and went back to tasks and the problem reappeared and didn't go away. Then I tried to open up
 the tasks on the same account on another computer and the problem was there too. Then I tried the 3rd computer and that computer acted like the first one, opened up tasks normally but after 2-3 times of switching between tasks and mail( or people or anything
 else) the loading screen came back. I then tried another browser and the tasks worked there too, but like the others, only for a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This mailbox is used with outlook on one computer and there are no problems there. But the rest of the people need to access the tasks tab from OWA. Every other tab works fine, people, calendar, mail.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows Phone 8 Lumia Black Update on Lumia 520.</p>
<p>When using, suddenly apps stop opening. System apps like Phone, Calendar, Messaging open, but other apps just dont (Settings, Calculator, Data Sense and so on). If you tap the app, it does nothing. The app cant be open no matter what. Even via Voice Recognition,
 it doesnt open. Even the camera button also wont launch the camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will only resolve when you restart your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the 4th time or maybe the 5th time this is happening.</p>
<p>Please suggest a solution.</p>

<p>I apologize for the late response. I recognized that you cannot open PDF attachments on your Ipad. Before we troubleshoot this issue, please verify if the scenario happens when using computer. This will allow us to isolate the cause of the problem whether
 it is specific&nbsp;to your device or account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<br />
Microsoft My Phone is only available for Windows Mobile devices. If your new Palm device does not run WM, you will not be able to use the service on your device. Nevertheless, your information will remain available on the web portal (<a href="http://myphone.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://myphone.microsoft.com</a>).<br />

            I imagine you're using PowerPoint Online, otherwise I can't see any relevance your browser would have. We have no way of knowing why the quiz might require a particular browser, you would have to question the author of the quiz. However, when using Microsoft
 products, they sometimes prefer a Microsoft browser, like Internet Explorer or Edge.

                    <p>In Office 365 Sharepoint we have a Public Docs repository that syncs to out users via the One Drive app but it seems like no one has access to the folders. I went into the Sharepoint admin portal and added 3 users to "Team Site Members" group which should
 give anyone in that group edit rights but it hasn't worked. Any suggestions?</p>

            Actually it turned out it was a permissions issue. Thanks for the suggestion though.

<h2>            You do not have permission to use selected printer</h2>
                    <p>I can print from all other applications except for IE8&nbsp; I am using windows 7 on an HP pavilion dv71247cl laptop. I am on a wireless router using a Brother MFC-J430w.&nbsp; The print dialog box comes up and the print and apply button are greyed out.&nbsp; I get an
 error box stating "You do not have permission to use the selected printer. If you need access, contact your network administrator." I am signed in as administrator.&nbsp; I have research the problem and tried everything I could find.&nbsp; I upgraded to IE9 and it still
 did the same thing so I went back to IE8.&nbsp; I am using a wireless router.&nbsp; I was always able to print then it stopped.&nbsp; I had some things that did not print and could not delete the port fixed that deleted all ports and the printer reinstalled. Not sure what
 to do now.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Commmunity. As you are not able to print from Internet explorer try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unable to print or view the print preview of a webpage in Internet Explorer</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973479</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable the “File and Printer sharing”.</p>
<p><strong>Step&nbsp;1: To turn on file and printer sharing</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Advanced sharing settings by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type network, click Network and Sharing Center, and then, in the left pane, click Change advanced sharing settings.<br />
</p>
<p>2. Click the chevron to expand the current network profile. <br />
</p>
<p>3. If printer sharing is off, under File and printer sharing, select Turn on file and printer sharing, and then click Save changes. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step&nbsp;2: Grant the permission to the printer</strong></p>
<p>Printer permissions determine which printer properties you can manage, such as renaming or sharing a printer, allowing or removing access to the printer, and determining who can manage documents or properties for the printer. Printer permissions are typically
 managed by the person who installed the printer or, if the printer is connected to a business or enterprise network, by a system administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Enable the account on the computer that is hosting the shared printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Navigate to the location:C:\Windows\System32\Spool folder, grant the Everyone group Read and Execute, Read, and List Folder Contents permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>· To apply permissions to a file or folder</strong><br />
</p>
<p>If you need to manually apply permissions to a file or folder, follow the steps below. Manually applying permissions is something that only advanced users should do because you might end up with unintended results.</p>
<p>1. Right-click the file or folder, and then click Properties.</p>
<p>2. Click the Security tab, and then click Edit.</p>
<p>3. Do one of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o To set permissions for a user that is not listed under Group or user names, click Add, type the name of the user or group, click OK, select the permissions, and then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o To change or remove permissions from an existing group or user, click the name of the group or user, select the permissions, and then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the client computer, log on as the user and add the printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the&nbsp;link for more information:</p>
<p><strong>What to know before applying permissions to a file or folder <br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/What-to-know-before-applying-permissions-to-a-file-or-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/What-to-know-before-applying-permissions-to-a-file-or-folder</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> You may also try the following work around:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Printers by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Hardware and Sound, and then clicking Printers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Click Add a printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. In the Add Printer wizard, click Add a local printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Click Create a new port. Make sure Local Port is selected in the list, and then click Next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. In the Port Name dialog box, type \\computer name\printer name, and then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Complete the rest of the wizard, and then click Finish.</p>
