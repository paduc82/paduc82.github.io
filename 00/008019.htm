<h2>            SharePoint 2013 Workflow, won&#39;t move to next stage</h2>
                    <p>I cannot for the life of me figure out why this workflow wont tranisition to the next stage.</p>
<p>It stays stuck on the first stage "ExpYN Select"</p>
<p>I don't understand why.</p>
<p>Can anyone see a flaw in my logic?</p>

            Hi Drew,<br />
<br />
I understand the type of the column Calc ExpYN is Calculated Column. <br />
<br />
Based on my test, when a value (Yes / No) of a calculated column is used for the equal operation, the workflow won’t run correctly. If I replace it with a normal check box column (Yes / No), the workflow will run successfully. So the issue should be the calculated
 column.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, we suggest you post in our <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home?forum=sharepointcustomization&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Cannot Access Exchange 2000 Mailbox from Exchange 2007 CAS Only through Web Access</h2>
                    Unable to access the Exchange 2000 Mailboxes from a fresh installed Exchange 2007 Sp1 (No Rollups, rollup 9 killed /owa completely)<br />
<br />
<br />
When I do access http://../owa i do get:<br />
<br />
Outlook Web Access could not find a mailbox for DOMAIN\User. If the problem continues, contact technical support for your organization and tell them the following: The mailbox may be stored on a Microsoft Exchange 2000 or Microsoft Exchange 2003 server, or
 the Active Directory user account was created recently and has not yet replicated to the Active Directory site where this Client Access server is hosted.
<br />
<br />
This is by design but when I try to connect to https://../Exchange I'm no able to access my Webmail<br />

<p>This virtual directory is used by Outlook&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Access when accessing mailboxes on computers that are running&nbsp;Exchange&nbsp;2003 or Exchange&nbsp;2000. If your organization includes Exchange&nbsp;2000&nbsp;or Exchange&nbsp;2003&nbsp;mailboxes in addition to Exchange&nbsp;2007&nbsp;mailboxes, all
 users can access Outlook&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Access&nbsp;through the /Exchange virtual directory. The Client Access server will automatically redirect Exchange&nbsp;2007&nbsp;mailbox users to the /owa virtual directory.</p>

<div><span>If the server that hosts the Client Access server role also hosts the Mailbox server role, users who use the /Exchange virtual directory will be redirected to the /owa virtual directory, which cannot be used
 by Exchange&nbsp;2000 or Exchange&nbsp;2003&nbsp;mailboxes. If you must support Outlook&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Access&nbsp;access to Exchange&nbsp;2000 or Exchange&nbsp;2003&nbsp;mailboxes, do not install the Client Access and Mailbox roles on the same Exchange&nbsp;2007&nbsp;server.

So I only installed the CAS role on the new Exchange 2007 <br />
<br />
The OS is Windows 2003 R2 Sp2 x64 with Exchange 2007 Sp1<br />
<br />
Maybe some one has a solution<br />
<br />
I'm Trying to get Outlook webacces running before I do ActiveSync <br />
<br />
The future planning is to upgrade all Mailbox servers to Exchange 2007

<p>Did you&nbsp;uninstall the CAS role from the MB role&nbsp;(since legacy proxy does not work when CAS&nbsp; and MB role are on the same box) or did you rebuild your entire environment from scratch again?</p>
<p>Check your CAS server IIS to see if the legacy virtual directories show up.</p>
<p>1. start, run type inetmgr</p>
<p>2. Does the legacy vdirs exist?</p>
<p>/exchange</p>
<p>/public</p>
<p>/exchweb</p>
<p>3. I see you didn't apply any roll ups, I would get the roll ups installed, I remember some authentication issues that were fixed after RU4. (As always fixes may pertain to certain unique environment setups)</p>

            Most versions of Excel do not include Get and Transform (formerly called PowerPivot); it is only distributed with certain Office products and I'm afraid yours may not be one of those. See <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Where-is-Power-Pivot-aa64e217-4b6e-410b-8337-20b87e1c2a4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Where-...</a>
<br />
<br />Versions that include PowerPivot are:
<br />Office 365 Pro Plus
<br />Office 365 Enterprise E3
<br />Office 365 Enterprise E5
<br />Office Professional 2016
<br />Office 2016 Professional Plus (available via volume licensing and HUP only)
<br />Office Professional Plus 2013 (available via volume licensing and HUP only)
<br />Excel 2016 standalone
<br />
<br />PowerPivot is NOT included with any of the following:
<br />
<br />- Subscriptions that do not include PowerPivot
<br />    Office 365 Education
<br />    Office 365 University
<br />    Office 365 Home
<br />    ﻿Office 365 Personal
<br />    ﻿Office 365 Small Business Premium
<br />    Office 365 Business Essentials
<br />    Office 365 Business
<br />    Office 365 Business Premium
<br />    Office 365 Enterprise E1
<br />
<br />- Products with a one-time purchase (perpetual license) That do NOT include PowerPivot
<br />    Office Home &amp; Student 2013
<br />    Office Home &amp; Student 2016
<br />    Office Home &amp; Business 2013
<br />    Office Home &amp; Business 2016
<br />    Office Professional 2013
<br />    ﻿Office for Mac
<br />    ﻿Office for Android
<br />    ﻿Office RT 2013
<br />    Office Standard 2013
<br />    ﻿All Office versions older than 2013
<br />
<br />Excel 2010 did not come with PowerPivot but it was available for all versions as a download. That download, though, does not work with later versions of Excel. If you have a licensed copy of Excel 2010, you can download it from here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=43348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>

<br />
<br />The list for Office 365 may have changed. It is my understanding, which may be mistaken, that all Office 2019 Excel applications will have power piviot.

    <title>BSoD on Windows 10 TP Build 10041 during reinstallation of build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jahko  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSoD on Windows 10 TP Build 10041 during reinstallation of build</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my computer has been running on Build 10041 of the Windows 10 Technical Preview. About a week ago I tried updating to Build 10049, but even though it appeared to work one time it wouldn't respond so I had to rollback. When I rolled back, some icons
 were buggy/missing (i.e. Mozilla Firefox was a white file icon, some Metro apps didn't display on taskbar, Cortana was labeled @{Microsoft.Cortana.1....}).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I got tired of this, so I decided to reinstall Build 10041 by going to Settings &gt; Remove everything and reinstall Windows &gt; [Delete] just my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right after a screen showed up with "Restarting...", <strong>a little notification popped up about how the program was unable to reference 0x00000000</strong>, and it could not be written to, and the program would be terminated. I clicked OK, but it kept
 going along and eventually restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it restarted, it said "Restoring your system x%" and everything went fine until it reached 68%. After hanging here for about 10 minutes, I came back to find
<strong>a BSoD with the error code 0xc0000034</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick search says this has something to do with a "boot configuration data file", but I'm not sure what to do. At the BSoD, there are no buttons that suggest fixes for the problem. All I get is "use your recovery disk (which I obviously don't have) to
 solve this, or contact your PC admin/manufacturer." I have not tried restarting yet, any ideas what I could do?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>During the process of deleting some system boot files might have been broken or missing. You need to ensure that the boot priority is changed so that the computer boots from the USB drive. Once the computer boots from the USB drive then you can
 install the Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in developmental stage, you may expect some compatibility issues as of now and some features or settings might not work as expected.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would like to let you know that as of now the ISO file is available only for Windows 10 build 10041. You may download this file and save it to an USB flash drive so that it can help you install this build on your computer. You need to boot
 from the USB drive and install this version. Once this is done, then you can update the computer build to 10049 through Windows Updates.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may download the ISO file for Windows 10 technical Preview with the latest build 10041 using this link:

    <title>Feedback Hub issue build 18298. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlesmickler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Feedback Hub issue build 18298.</h2>
                    Feedback Hub stopped working so I did a reset in Settings which failed sending me to Microsoft Store to reinstall Feedback Hub. Reinstall failed and keeps trying to install burt failing. There is no error code, it keeps referring me back to Store. I reset
 Store and ran the Store App Troubleshooter. Resetting Store didn't change anything and the Troubleshooter reported hanging apps not repaired, which is the usual from that Troubleshooter. I can't access Feedback Hub to report the issue in Feedback Hub.

<p>Not sure why you asked this question, but the answer is yes. The app appears there but won't open, in fact I get a notice when I click on it that the app can't open then a referral to Store to repair/reinstall the app. Reinstall fails and and refers me back
 to Store. I initially tried to reset the Hub in Settings but got no results and also reset the Store as well as running the Store App Troubleshooter.</p>

<p>I tried that method and the Powershell process ran to completion with a lot of red warning sections scattered through the process and no change was accomplished in anything. All the apps I've tried work except for the Feedback Hub app. I've had some other
 issues with this build related to my Realtek HD Sound Card and my built in monitor screen not restarting after it shuts down without my shutting the laptop down and rebooting it. That one I solved by setting screen timeout to never. Also my Outlook 365 accounts
 had to be reset to get the emails functioning in Outlook. It appears that this build has several issues with drivers and other software related issues. All this may just have to wait for the next update.</p>

<p>I did try the individual package install and it simply didn't do anything. I verified that I had entered all the terms correctly but the app package simply didn't install that way either. Possibly there could be some Registry corruption or something similar
 that is affecting these items that aren't working on my Dell now. I suspect I may just have to wait for the next update for a solution. For now I can do without the affected items.</p>

<p>I'll give that a try as I did save an ISO of the build, and I suppose I could also try running a DISM repair to see if that would fix the issue.</p>

            Hi, GunnhildBerntsen 
<br />
<br />First you can follow these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Toggle microphone and webcam settings in "Settings&gt; Privacy&gt; Microphone" and "Settings&gt; Privacy&gt; Camera" (Allow applications to access your camera / microphone)
<br />
<br />2. Then go to the "Audio and Video Settings" , see that the microphone is recording sound.
<br />
<br />3. Then click on the drop-down arrow next to the camera window and select the correct webcam driver.
<br />
<br />If the above does not work try uninstalling and installing the new version of Skype, if this does not work, you can try to reinstall the classic version, which was extended until a new warning, I hope you can solve the problem.

            Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Camera
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows Key+X 
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />  Open start menu
<br />    Type in "powershell" 
<br />    Right click on "Windows PowerShell"
<br />    Run as Administrator
<br />
<br />Then paste the following command
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage -AllUsers Microsoft.SkypeApp | foreach { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" }
<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />After the install process finishes, you have the Windows 10 Skype app back
<br />
<br />If that still not does not work...
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<p>That error can point to a driver or OS issue. The output from a DirectX diagnostic would be helpful:</p>

<h2>            Opening telephone number links in the edge browser.</h2>
                    <p>When I open telephone links on the edge browser, expecting the number to be passed to the phone and commence dialling the number. However on my Lumia 640 with win 10 installed. The link offers to open my Skype preview app only leading me to make a Skype
 call.</p>
<p>The alternative is to write down the phone number on the link, then open the phone app and dial the number.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook Mail App sending items to the wrong folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silverpulser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Mail App sending items to the wrong folders</h2>
                    <p>Windows Insider Preview build 10074 and using the Outlook Mail/Calendar App. I have a Virgin Media IMAP&nbsp;email account which I can use as web mail to check everything is as it should be (or otherwise in this case),</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mail app doesn't place sent items or deleted items in the correct folder and I cannot see any settings for mapping special folders in the settings. Am I missing something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;The sent items are being placed into a folder labelled&nbsp;Sent Items&nbsp;but when I look at the web mail this is a different one to the one that Virgin Media uses.&nbsp; When I use the web mail&nbsp;it goes to a folder labelled Sent Mail. Similarly, when I delete a mail
 in Outlook it is sent to a folder labelled Deleted Items and when I use web mail it goes into a folder labelled Bin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes Outlook all but unusable, especially as drafts crash the app often. In that case, once a draft mail has been started and crashed, every time I go back to that draft it again crashes the app.</p>

            <p>Hi Shaun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us try removing and <strong>reconfiguring </strong>the account to check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To add an account to the Mail app </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the email address for your Microsoft account ends in outlook.com, live.com, hotmail.com or msn.com, just sign in to your PC. Go to the Start screen, and open the Mail app—your email is waiting for you.</p>
<p>If your email address ends in a different domain, like gmail.com, yahoo.com, or comcast.net, here's how to add it.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the Start screen, tap or click <span>Mail</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Right click and click on settings.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Accounts</span>, tap or click <span>Add an account</span>, and then tap or click the type of account you'd like to add.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter your email address and password for the account, and then tap or click <span>
Connect</span>. </p>
</li></ol>
<p>Let us know if this was helpful.</p>

            <p>I &nbsp;have done this twice already without success. However, for good measure I have just done it again and the result is the same. In Outlook Mail App there is no folder named Bin and neither is there a folder named Sent Mail. The two previously mentioned
 folders, Deleted Items and Sent Items, are there and that is where Outlook Mail App is placing deleted and sent emails. I might point out that I did not have this problem with the original Mail App and neither do I have a problem with the Mail App on my Windows
 8.1 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is not machine specific as I have a laptop, running 64 bit Insider Preview and a desktop, running 32 bit Insider Preview and the same behaviour is being exhibited on both machines.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is so annoying as both my Windows 8.1 phone and my Windows 8.1 desktop work correctly. It is just the Mail App on Insider Preview that is not downloading the correct folders to sync to.</p>

<p>Hi DIB,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First please make sure you are using an Office 365 account. Second, please make sure you have updated to the latest Outlook 2016. Then you should can see the option like below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22599da3-b32a-4019-b70b-33aca77644f8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22599da3-b32a-4019-b70b-33aca77644f8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still can not see the option and the focused inbox, please let me know the detailed version number and then capture a full screenshot for further check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;I was wondering whether it is possible to have an Excel Spreadsheet linked (not sure if that is the correct term) to a Word document so that when entering information on the Excel Spreadsheet, it filters through to specific fields on a Word Document simultaneously?
 Trying to avoid double work.</p>

<h2>            Random number generator from a seed value</h2>
                    I am trying to perform a calculation with a random number generator I borrowed. The&nbsp;seed&nbsp;value 0.5284 is multiplied by 997. The result is 526.8148.&nbsp;I can grab the fractional portion of the result (0.8148) by use of the TRUNC function and&nbsp;would like use
 it as my new seed value. My desire is to&nbsp;replace the old value 0.5284 in the original cell with newly calculated value 0.8148. I can do it by building a string of calculations in my workbook, but&nbsp; I believe there is an easier way to do it. I am not familiar
 with MACROs. How can I do it?

            Seeding is not possible if you use Excel functions to generate the random numbers.
<br />
<br />This is possible only though the use of VBA
<br />OR
<br />You will have to use Analysis ToolPak Add in to generate random numbers

            The VBA.Rnd function supports a seed, therefore you can follow this steps:
<br />
<br />Right-Click the sheet tab
<br />Choose "View Code"
<br />Within the menu click Insert\Module
<br />Paste in the code below
<br />Close the VBA editor
<br />
<br /><pre><code>Function RandSeed(Seed As Variant) As Variant
  RandSeed = Rnd(Seed)
End Function</code></pre>
<br />
<br />Make a new sheet and setup the cells:
<br />A1:  Seed
<br />B1:  Multiplied
<br />C1:  Random number
<br />A2:  0.5284
<br />B2:  =A2*997
<br />C2:  =RandSeed(A2)
<br />A3:  =B2-INT(B2)
<br />B3:  =A3*997
<br />C3:  =RandSeed(A3)
<br />
<br />Select A3:C3 and drag down as needed.

<h3> project master  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start &#38; Finish Dates Not Computing Correctly</h2>
                    
<p>I created a project in version 2010 and I used auto scheduling</p>
<p>when entering my tasks.&nbsp; I assigned resources &amp; estimated</p>
<p>durations to each task in the hopes that MS Project would</p>
<p>compute the correct start &amp; finish dates, but it isn't.&nbsp; For example,</p>
<p>I have a resource which I entered&nbsp;with&nbsp;20% maximum units</p>
<p>(thus denoting he can only spend 20% of his 8 hour day on the</p>
<p>project) and I assigned him to a task that has an estimated</p>
<p>duration of 1 day (8 hours).&nbsp;&nbsp; MS Project calculates the start</p>
<p>and finish date as the same day, which can't be correct because</p>
<p>he only can spend 20% of his time on the task.&nbsp; It should take</p>
<p>him about 7 days.&nbsp; I am using the "Standard" calendar.</p>
<p>I have tried a number of different things to try to fix it, but</p>
<p>to no avail.&nbsp; Has someone encountered this before and can</p>
<p>shed some light on how to fix this?&nbsp; Thanks for your assistance.</p>

<div>You are not handling the resource assignment correctly.&nbsp; Here is what you need to do:</div>
<ol>
<li>Apply the Gantt Chart view, if not already visible.</li><li>Click the View tab to display the View ribbon. </li><li>In the Split View section of the View ribbon, select the Details checkbox.&nbsp;Microsoft Project 2010 displays the Task Entry view, with the Gantt Chart view in the primary pane (top pane) and the Task Form view
 in the secondary pane (bottom pane).</li><li>Select the task to which you want to assign the resource at 20% Units.</li><li>In the Task Form pane, select the resource from the pick list in the Resource Name column.</li><li>In the Units column for the resource, enter 20%. </li><li>In the Work field, enter the amount of work you estimate the resource will perform on this task.</li><li>Click the OK button.</li></ol>
<div>The system will now calculate the Duration of the task using the Units and Work values you supplied.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</div>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Did&nbsp;you hope to get a different reply in a different newsgroup? Alas! For the benefit of the readers in this NG, here is a copy/paste of my reply in the technet forum:</span></p>
<p><span>This is Project's normal behaviour; Project calculates as follows: Work=Duration * Units. Since you haven't entered Work Project cannot recalculate duration as you hope. The tasks
 takes 1 day (duration) as you have set.</span></p>
<p><span>There are books written about this but just to get you started insert a Column Work and fill in the estimated work before assigning the resource. OR after you assign the resource
 as you did, reset Work to 1 day. In both cases Duration will be re-estimated.</span></p>
<p><span>THEN buy a book or otherwise learn about task types, Effoirt Driven scheduling, contoured assignments...</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I ask this question, because I have 2 copies of Windows 10 Pro 64-Bit installed on 2 different Desktop Computers and upgraded to Build 10240 without any problems, what so ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 copies of Windows 10 Pro 32-Bit installed on the same Desktop Computers. One is with Build 10162 and the other is Build 10166. I have not seen Build 10240 in those operating systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, the question in the Title of this Post:&nbsp; Is Microsoft Ending Support for 32-Bit operating systems?</p>

<p>Received Build 10240 on the Build 10162 and installed fine.</p>
<p>Not seeing Build 10240 on the Build 10166 Computer.</p>

I'm on build 10240. I got to this point from clean install of build 10130 then using windows update proceeded to all 1015X, 1016X builds. But in most of those builds I had to reset my windows update components and use windows update troubleshooter. In fact
 on build 10240 I had to do reset components again to get KB3074665 security update.&nbsp;

<p>A lot of people would not be able to update to Windows 10&nbsp;if MS stopped supporting 32 bit systems.&nbsp; Simply they cannot afford to buy a new machine.&nbsp; A Windows XP machine was normally 32 bit and were upgraded to Windows 7 32 bit which ran with very little
 problems.</p>

    <title>Two Excel Add-Ins Causing .NET Runtime Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drewfuss28  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two Excel Add-Ins Causing .NET Runtime Error</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 2 excel add-ins that seem to be budding heads. Maybe they are using the same dll files at the same time? When I look in the windows event logs I see a .NET runtime error at the time of crash. We are using Windows 8.1 and Office 2013. Any ideas on
 what could be causing the issue? I know this is a longshot but trying to see if there is something configurable on the outside rather than trying to get the vendors to change their product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate all suggestions!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Drew</p>

<p>Hey Phillip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the response. Is there anyway to determine if this is the case? Maybe in windows event logs? Everything works as expected when one of the add-ins is disabled. Just don't know what is going on when they are both enabled.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>

            Go to the web version of SkyDrive and find the album you don't want showing on your phone. This is easier on a PC.<br />
<br />
You will see that folders/albums are treated as containing pictures or documents with corresponding icons:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36569e9b-f5dc-449c-bb74-07abf0fefc48" /><br />
<br />
On the phone, Picture ones will show up in your photo hub and document ones will show up under SkyDrive in the Office app.<br />
<br />
To change the folder type, select the folder (still in the web version of SkyDrive) and display the details pane:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dea08177-3eb4-4fb9-9465-ba88082e1a1e" /><br />
<br />
Now It's pretty obvious how to change the folder type from here!<br />
<br />
Note that it will take a while for your phone to sync up with this change. <br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
John<br />

<p>The phone was discontinued quite some time ago and the OS is no longer in development or even in use. I doubt you will see any system updates ever.</p>

    <title>Downgrade to O365 Visio Pro 2013 from 2016 due to Office 2016 problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Downgrade to O365 Visio Pro 2013 from 2016 due to Office 2016 problems &#40;had to downgrade to Office 2013, now I&#39;m stuck unable to install a compatible Visio version&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have both a Business subscription to Office 365 and an add-on subscription for Visio.</p>
<p>I upgraded both at the same time to the new Office 2016 edition. I really wish I'd kept the old installer executables for the 2013 version however.</p>
<p>Due to the gotchya with Outlook 2016 not talking to Exchange 2007, I was forced to unintstall Office 2016, and I found these articles helpful in obtaining the older 2013 installer, and setting my registry to prevent automatic upgrades back to Office 2016
 in the future:</p>

<p><strong>Obtaining older versions of Office</strong> &nbsp;- &nbsp;https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/172/p/409681/1019000?ss=175eb2a4-ffad-4056-8a76-92db781994bd</p>
<p><strong>How do I keep on running Office 365 ProPlus 2013?</strong> -&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3097292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3097292</a></p>
<p>
</p>

<p>But now the problem. I need to install Visio 2013 again, and via the Office 356 portal, I can only download the 2016 installer (English, 32-bit I'm after) now - there's no way to ask it for the previous
 version.</p>
<p>I've searched on here as best I can, but there doesn't appear to be a thread for Visio Pro via O365, such as there is above for the main Office product in downgrading to the 2013 version if you've
 been forced to revert Office.</p>
<p>And before anyone asks - nope, you can't run Visio 2016 along-side Office 2013. In fact, if you run the currently offered Visio installer, the first thing it wants to do is REMOVE the entire Office
 2013 suite for me.</p>
<p>Does anyone know the link to download the previous 2013 Visio Pro installer? I can see from the above threads that these downloads are still available - you just need some guru who knows what the
 URL's are to get at them.</p>
<p>I'm guessing as a number of people have been bitten by the Outlook 2016 / Exchange 2007 gotchya and are in the midst of rolling back to Office 2013 that my installation of Visio isn't the only one
 that has gotten caught up in the crossfire.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone will know the answer, and others will be able to use this thread to help themselves out.</p>
<p>A huge thanks in advance to anyone from Microsoft, or another guru who might be able to provide the necessary download link for English, 32-bit Visio Pro 2013 that'll work with my Office365 Visio
 Pro subscription.</p>
<p>I'll also log a support ticket - if I find the answer to this before anyone else, I'll post info here for others to refer to.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BenH</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>OK... Using both the download URL available to me for the Visio 2016 installer from within the my Office 365 portal, and the info gleamed from the above thread on downgrading the main Office 2016 distribution, I managed to piece together the URL to download
 the Visio Pro 2013 installer.</p>
<p>English (US), 32-bit: &nbsp;<a href="https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/download.aspx?productReleaseID=VisioProRetail&amp;platform=X86&amp;language=en-us&amp;version=O15GA&amp;source=O15OLSO35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/.../download.aspx</a></p>
<p>English (US), 64-bit: &nbsp;<a href="https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/download.aspx?productReleaseID=VisioProRetail&amp;platform=X64&amp;language=en-us&amp;version=O15GA&amp;source=O15OLSO35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/.../download.aspx</a></p>
<p>Basically, the only thing that needs changing in the download link is to change "version=O16GA" to "version=O15GA" to get the 2013 installer rather than the 2016 version.
</p>
<p>As per the previously listed threads, other languages can be downloaded just by changing the "language" parameter (EN-US in the above links), and the difference between 32 and 64-bit versions is controlled by the "platform" parameter.</p>
<p>I hope this helps others out if they get caught in the same situation of having to downgrade back to Office 2013, and lose Visio in the process.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>BenH</p>
