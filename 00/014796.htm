                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi everyone,</strong></p>
<p>I have two questions about a document I'm working on. I started the document in and earlier version of Word and then opened it up in Word 2007. In 2007 I could see some of the styles that I created in the style gallery but when I open up the style pane,
 I can't see any styles at all - it's empty. Does anyone know why this is happening?</p>
<p>Secondly, I have a text box that is placed on the first page of the file. I made sure the the setting to lock anchor was set however when I go select all this box gets deleted. In fact even when I do other minor editing it sometimes moves. Is there a way
 to make it stay put once and for all?</p>
<p>Appreciate any assistance.</p>

            <div>There are several settings for the <strong>Styles </strong>pane. The default, I believe, is "In current document," which should show your styles, but if the
<strong>Styles </strong>pane is set to "Recommended," and your styles are all user-defined ones (not modifications of built-in styles), then they might well not appear. If you change the setting (by clicking on
<strong>Options... </strong>in the lower right corner) to any of the other settings ("In current document," "In use," or "All styles"), you should see your styles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With regard to your second question, a text box that is wrapped (not In Line With Text) is anchored to a text paragraph; if you delete the paragraph to which it is anchored, it will be deleted as well. And of course, if it is inline, it will also be selected
 when you <strong>Select All</strong>. You can specify a position for the text box relative to the page (in the
<strong>Advanced Layout </strong>dialog), but the text box will still move from one page to another if the paragraph to which it is anchored moves.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But there may be a way to accomplish your goal without using&nbsp;a text box. For example, if you are trying to put letterhead information on the first page of a letter, you should put it in the First Page Header; see&nbsp;<span><a href="http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/LetterheadRibbon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/LetterheadRibbon.htm</span></a></span></div>

<h2>            6720 Christmas Brick after update</h2>
                    
<p>Hello All</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought me Ma a 6720 for Christmas.&nbsp; It came brand new, direct from the factory with firmware 12.008.&nbsp; I only found one obvious bug, you couldn't access bluetooth devices without going through the help page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 7 days old I figured it had to be bang up to date but I checked anyway and found the firmware was now up to 13.009 so I did the update in the hope of a bug fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well the bluetooth ain't a problem anymore.&nbsp; The phone doesn't work!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know familiarity can breed contempt but I've done a few updates before so I&nbsp;at least sort of&nbsp;know the ropes.&nbsp; The battery was fully charged and the power was connected.&nbsp; I didn't remove the USB cable during the process.&nbsp; In fact everything was correct
 including the "Update Successfull, firmware version now 13.009" message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why does the phone not work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not completely cabbaged.&nbsp; You still get a buz at switch on but thats about it.&nbsp; The odd feint line on an unlit screen but no functionality and the PC can't find it to try anf fix the FUBAR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried the battery/PSU/USB/SIM in/out in various combinations as per posts for other models but nothings worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone got any better sugestions or do I just gotta wait till the Techs come back to work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards All</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Might not be as bad as you think if you got a Update succesful message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Firstly remove the battery for at least 5 minutes and then replace and see if that makes any difference.<br />
<br />
If the aove doesn't work then try the "3 finger deep reset". With the phone powered off, depress and hold these three keys simultaneously "*" "3" "green phone" and then power on phone using the on/off button whilst keeping the three keys depressed until you
 hear start-up tone.<br />

            I had the same problem with a specific Publisher file. In the Explorer properties of the file I checked the Read-only box, to make it readonly. Then it printed without a hitch.

    <title>How exclude attachment content when searching in Outlook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How exclude attachment content when searching in Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    I've noticed that when I do a search in Outlook, Outlook considers it a match if some of the terms I'm searching for are in a message attachment.&nbsp; I'd like to disable this.&nbsp; That is, when I search for terms in my email archive, I don't want to see something
 listed where some of the terms I'm searching for are in an attachment. I only want to see results where everything I'm searching for is in the message itself (or its headers).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;How can I do that?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>AFAIK, you can't disable it in outlook without disabling it in windows. Indexing Options &gt; Advanced &gt; File Types tab. Index properties and file contents. ETA: select the file extension in the list and set it to properties only.

Unfortunately, this is impractical for two reasons.&nbsp; First, I receive attachments with many different extensions (e.g., .zip, .pdf, .doc, etc.), so I'd have to disable indexed search for a large number of extensions.&nbsp; Second, I want to be able to do indexed
 search inside those file types outside of Outlook.&nbsp; It would make no sense, for example, to give up the ability to have Windows search for text in any PDF or DOC file anywhere on my computer, simply because I don't want attachment content to be searched through
 Outlook.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I should perhaps clarify that the problem I'm running into now is that when I search for terms I remember being in old email messages, Outlook returns a large number of false positives, because some of the terms I'm searching for are, by happenstance, present
 in attachments to messages unrelated to my search. I'd like to eliminate those false positives.<br />

            <p>Yeah, its not practical. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use <strong>contents:keyword</strong> as the search term, does it exclude attachments? Contents is supposed to be the message body.&nbsp;</p>

            Yes, using <b>contents:keyword</b> excludes matches in attachments. This is helpful, but still bordering on impractical, because I generally search using many search terms (generally 2-4), and if I want to exclude matches on all of them for attachments,
 I must precede each term with <b>contents:</b>. Furthermore, blind qualification of each search term with
<b>contents:</b> would exclude matches on subjects and senders, which I also want to match.<br />
<br />
The fundamental problem is that if I'm searching for a message I got years ago involving a discussion of
<b>kitchen counters</b> (as I recently was), I don't want to get hits on messages about program
<b>counters</b> (a common software development term) where an attachment mentions throwing in the
<b>kitchen</b> sink. The more messages and more attachments you have, the higher the likelihood of such false positives.&nbsp; I have about 160,000 messages going back to 2002, and I know that many Outlook users have many more. In my mind, it's just silly to consider
 attachment text on the same basis as message text.<br />

            <p>You only need to use contents&nbsp;once&nbsp;&nbsp;-use <strong>&nbsp;contents:(kitchen counters)</strong> to find the words kitchen and counters in the same message but not necessarily next to each other. kitchen+counters should give the same results but will search attachments
 too (and return the kitchen sink example)</p>

<p>OK, a friend confirms this issue getting to 17723, too. He was one who could never get to 13, because Setup immediately booted back to 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost the same thing with trying to get to 23, though as the OP mentions, now it actually makes an attempt, getting to around 11%, before booting back to 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe that makes this a "different" problem in MS's view?&nbsp; That would give what MS says in their release notes a bit more credibility.</p>

<p>That's unfortunate, and suggests there's more than one cause of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend's report on how he got to 17723: Removing old user profiles (Control Panel, System, Advanced) worked here to finally get off 17711. I didn't need them, so deleting them was simplest, but logging into them to "freshen" them may also have worked.</p>

    <title>Excel data filter stuck with big sheet 10000 lines - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sergeigenikhov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel data filter stuck with big sheet 10000 lines</h2>
                    <p>Office version Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally problem has started in office 2013, suddenly.</p>
<p>Then after uninstall and reinstall office 365, it persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my work, there is an Excell file with 8000 more lines, weekly updated. That a lot of uses handle it without a problem.</p>
<p>I need to select some relevant line by data filtering option.</p>
<p>I am able to select and set data to filter option on the table.</p>
<p>The problem starts once I am opening the data filter dropdown menu (arrow on cell) and trying to type filter criteria.</p>
<p>When I am trying to filter out data, it is stuck and Excel becomes nonresponsive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 20-30 sec, status resets as before trying. I have a drop-down menu of data filter in the closed condition (arrow on top of the column).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I am working with lower size tables, like 1000 lines, there is a delay in respond of 10 sec, but I can do the filtering slowly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC with 16G RAM, 8 Generation of i5 processor.</p>
<p>Touch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Working in Excel "safe" mode doesn't resolve the problem.</p>
<p>I am not sure, that problem with Excel and not with PC itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>As you sent that link, so I replied to the link, but here is my reply, in full:</p>
<p>"Well, if I do this, won't EVERYTHING be wiped clean?&nbsp; I'd lose all photos, all Contacts (People), all email, everything that's on my Calendar, etc?&nbsp; As it is, this Lumia 950xl dual sim cell phone, AUTOMATICALLY does a&nbsp; "soft reset" after about 15 minutes
 of use; phone call history is gone, can't text message at all, can't log in to&nbsp; Cortana or Feedback Hub, won't stay Signed In to Microsoft Account, even though I always check the&nbsp; "remember me".<br />
What do you think happened?&nbsp; Thank you."</p>

<p>+ a factory reset (in my opinion) causes losses to UNBACKED data (1st step is to back up the data to OneDrive or to a PC or other devices)&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;many apps will&nbsp;need to be reinstalled or updated ++ as for looking for other options, these can be interesting learning
 experiences, but probably the competition can also have issues, which can be solved promptly (e.g. face time for the US market leader) or support issues for the global market leader OS</p>

I am getting the same error message when i try to get email in my yahoo account. &nbsp;I saw the same article at MS support and it does not work for me, either. &nbsp;The IMAP instructions don't work with a Yahoo POP account. &nbsp;Do you have a recommendation for how to
 get Outlook for MAC to sync with a Yahoo account? &nbsp;FYI, i am very much not a technophile and this is my first MAC.

            If you enter your Yahoo email and password when creating an account in Outlook for Mac it will automatically set up the account for you. You need to be running the latest version 14.2.2.<br />

            Outlook won't show items if the Spotlight cache files aren't fully updated. You can try re-indexing your Identity, but it could be an issue with your Identity.
<br />
<br />
If re-indexing doesn't help, then move to a new Identity. You could just add your Yahoo email to the new Identity before doing the full steps to move.
<br />
<br />
Even though some users had what seemed to be a successful upgrade to the SP2 database, issues in the Identity are causing concern. I suggest you move to a new Identity. Follow directions here:<br />

HOW TO RE-INDEX YOUR SPOTLIGHT CACHE FILES<br />
<br />
From the Apple menu, choose System Preferences.<br />
<br />
*&nbsp; Click Spotlight.<br />
*&nbsp; Make sure Mail Messages is checked under the Search Results tab.<br />
*&nbsp; Click the Privacy tab.<br />
*&nbsp; Drag your Identity (named Main by default) to the list. Wait a couple of minutes.<br />

<h2>            Linking text in the columns of a table in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have inserted a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">table</span> into Word 2010 with two columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enter in text in the first column (i.e. the left column), when the text reaches the bottom of the page, the table continues onto page 2.&nbsp;Is there a way of linking the text in column 1 to the next column, so that when the column is filled with text,
 the next line of text will automatically go onto the next column?<br />
<br />
I know that there is the "Column" feature in Word that does this, however I'm just curious if tables can do the same thing. Thanks!<br />
</p>

<p>Appreciate the link.&nbsp; I have installed and previewed all of the Windows 10 Professional builds since the first copy became available in 2014 in both 32 and 64 bit format.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Where can I get a copy of Windows 10 Home for evaluation purposes before I upgrade my win 7 sp1 pc and my win 8.1 pc?&nbsp; I would like to see how it performs before I commit&nbsp;to the final copy.&nbsp; I don't recall seeing any specific references to Windows 10 Home
 and based on problems people are having with the professional version, how is does the Home version compare?</p>

<h2>            Mail Migration &#40;IMAP&#41; drops sent and received item &#40;mail&#41; in same folder</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'd like to discuss with you a strange behaviour I found while syncing a mailbox in a Batch over IMAP. I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a feature ...</p>
<p>Some of our users sorted their mails (sent and received mails) in the same&nbsp;(sub-)folder. So it occurs that they have sent an item to a user cc-ing themselves. This leads to two emails - one in sent items and the cc-ed copy in the inbox. If the user moved
 both items to the same subfolder one(!) item is dropped during the migration.</p>
<p>I'd guess this is a bug, as the mails have different headers and should both be kept in the folder.</p>
<p>Regards, Andreas</p>

<p>Hi Andreas,<br />
<br />
I have done a test with a Gmail account. When I moved the two emails in the Sent Items folder and Inbox folder to another subfolder, one of the two emails automatically disappeared so there was only one email left before starting the IMAP migration. So I would
 like to confirm from which email service you migrate to Office 365. <br />
Then since mail headers will be created after the email reaching the recipient’s email service, the message in the sent items folder will not have mail headers. So could you help confirm whether the message left in the Office 365 mailbox after the IMAP migration
 is the message sent out in the sent items folder or the message received in the Inbox folder.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

    <title>Broken rendering in Visio 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fek8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Broken rendering in Visio 2016</h2>
                    <p>I was using Visio 2007 on Win-7 before I updated to Win-10.&nbsp; Updating to Win-10 also required I update Office.&nbsp; And, the previous ability to run multiple versions of an application is gone from Win-10 (at least as far as office goes).&nbsp; It will not let me
 continue to use Visio 2007; so I have to move to Visio 2016 (aka Office 365).&nbsp; But Visio 2016 is broken.&nbsp; Here are two correct samples produced by Visio 2007 and the problem renderings from Visio 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GOOD:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39961408-b24c-4a2e-bddf-433e291bfb4f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39961408-b24c-4a2e-bddf-433e291bfb4f" /></a></p>
<p>BAD:</p>

<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5e344b2-8fd5-4104-bdd5-e4cc37ecc6a3" /></a></p>
<p>The only difference between the good images and the bad images is = Win-7 with Visio 2007 (good images) vs. Win-10 and Visio 2016 (bad images).&nbsp; These images come from a document with over 1000 pages and 100s of these kinds of figures; these are just 2 examples.&nbsp;
 So a workaround to the problem&nbsp;that requires&nbsp;tweaking of 100s of images is going to be a real pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a real fix (either let me run Visio 2007, or fix Visio 2016 so it renders correctly).&nbsp; I'd be glad to supply my .vsd files if&nbsp;someone needs it&nbsp;to figure out the problem.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Based on your screenshot, the difference is that the text in Visio&nbsp;2007 is vertical and the text in Visio 2016 is change to horizontal.</p>
<p>Did this issue only appear in file create in Visio 2007 and open in Visio 2016</p>
<p>As our environment is limited to help you reproduce this problem in Visio 2007 and 2016.</p>
<p>I suggest you provide the file created in Visio 2007(Both good file and bad file.) Please provide the file via OneDrive so that I can download it and text.</p>
<p>I'm glad to help you.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Emi</p>

            <p>OK, I've posted the 2 examples files on OneDrive.&nbsp; There is no "good" file and "bad" file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the SAME file.&nbsp; I printed in on Win-7 (with Visio 2007) and it's fine.&nbsp; Using Win-10 (with Visio 2016) it's NOT fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using FrameMaker and have the Visio imported as a linked image (OLE2) into my Frame document.&nbsp; I've tried it with Frame 9, 10, 11, and 12 - all produce the same results.&nbsp; When I do it on Win-7 it prints fine, when I print it on Win-10, the vertical text
 renders wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did an in-place upgrade from Win-7 (where everything worked fine) to Win-10 (where it doesn't work).&nbsp; So nothing changed in the FrameMaker applications.&nbsp; The only thing that changed is the Windows version and the Visio version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have a backup system (that is running Win-7/Visio 2007).&nbsp; Both systems were the same until I upgraded one of them.&nbsp; The old one works, the upgraded one doesn't.&nbsp; So for now, I've stopped using the Win-10 system and I'm back to using my Win-7 system,
 but that isn't going to last long until I'm forced to use only Win-10.</p>

            <p>OK, another clue.&nbsp; The plot thickens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open a .vsd file in Visio 2007, and while it is open, I then open my document that references THAT image and print it - IT WORKS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I close that file in Visio 2007, and then open my document that references THAT image the vertical text is all messed up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that while the old Visio has the file open, it somehow changes how OTHER applications access that file.&nbsp; Once the old Visio closes that file, that OTHER application doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO, it appears that if I can open every one of my images (over 234 of them), and then access my document to print it - it should work - IF Visio 2007&nbsp;can open that many files at the same time!</p>

            <p>Finally found a solution.&nbsp; Painful, but it worked.</p>
<p>Step 1: Uninstall all my Adobe applications (Acrobat Pro, Framemaker 9/10/11/12).</p>
<p>Step 2: Uninstall all my MSFT Office 2016 stuff (including Visio 2016) and the Visio 2007.</p>
<p>Step 3: Install all of MSFT Office 2016 (including Visio 2016). Do NOT reinstall Visio 2007.</p>
<p>Step 4: Install all my Adobe applications (Acrobat Pro, Framemaker 9/10/11/12).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the install order matters.&nbsp; When I installed Win 10 and Office 2016 on top of my running system (with all those already installed Adobe applications), it broke this stuff.&nbsp; So, when I removed everything back to base Win 10, and then installed
 the MSFT stuff first, and added the Adobe stuff LAST - it seems to have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have vertical text rendering properly.</p>

    <title>VBA code to copy Row labels - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seeker63  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA code to copy Row labels</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Office Community,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am working with an excel file that has 13 worksheets. The first twelve are labeled Jan through Dec. The last worksheet is a summary.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time the file is saved, a macro copies the data&nbsp;in colums A through K from each worksheet and pastes it into Colums D through N in the summary sheet. As sample of this code is provided below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>LastRow = Sheets("JAN").Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row<br />
Sheets("Jan").Range("A12:k" &amp; LastRow).Copy Sheets("summary").Range("d" &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp)(2)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>LastRow = Sheets("FEB").Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row<br />
Sheets("FEB").Range("A12:k" &amp; LastRow).Copy Sheets("summary").Range("d" &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp)(</em>2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each monthly &nbsp;worksheet contain the name of the user in Cell A4, The office location in A6, and the month in A8. I would like to update the code provided above to enter this information into Colums A, B, and C of the summary sheet.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I struggle with VBA so&nbsp;any help I can get with this would be greratly appreciated.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            I assume you cycle through all of the worksheets.&nbsp; Here is some code that cycles through as you do in your lines above, and adds in the extra cells to copy.&nbsp; It also adds some error checking in case one of the Monthly sheets is not present -- it will skip
 over that.<br />
<br />
One possible limitation is that it only places the contents of A4:A6:A8 on the first line of the group of data coming from the Monthly sheet.&nbsp; See below for a variation if you want this data on All of the lines.<br />
<br />
The code also uses some techniques you may find useful as you learn more about VBA<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you trying to download over data connection or WiFi? We would suggest doing it over a WiFi connection to get better results and uninterrupted download. If it shows the same error message, we would suggest following the steps provided on this

<p>I am not sure about the Chinese keyboard, but when I tried to install the US keyboard on my German language 640 XL, I ran in to the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that the US English keyboard is delivered as a phone update, unlike the other keyboards. So I went to
<span><span><span><span><strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update &amp; security </strong>&gt; <strong>Phone update</strong></span></span></span> and requested the phone to update immediately. That solved the issue.<br />
</span></p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            C7 - Crackling noise or a crackling burst during call</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys.. My phone has started making a crackling noise during the calls. It's happening not that frequently. You can say it can be heard in 3 out of every 10 calls. I used my SIM in another phone for 2 days but didn't observe the problem in another phone.
 It sounds like a cracker bursting and happens suddenly. anyone with the solution..?? could it be related to earpiece speakers?? and my phone has been opened twice by nokia care. anyone thinks that it might be related to any lose connections. Please shed some
 light..</p>

<p>My phone has the same problem. It is not happening every time, but during some calls or while hearing music there is this bursting sound. My phone was not opened ever so I don't think that is the problem. It is something wrong with the hardware.</p>

<p>hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>how about try to insert a sim card into your device? have you tried? maybe its a speaker problem. we can never tell if we will not send the phone to the care center to have it checked there. :) but im also wondering if it is a hardware issue, well, it should
 happen everytime you receive calls or make a call using your phone.&nbsp; right? :) but since you tried inserting your sim card to another phone well we cannot assume as well that it is a sim card issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hahaha, i think its better if the care center will take a look on the phone so that they can check on the hardware. :)</p>

<p>I would prefer to live with this crackling sound rather than sending it to a nokia care centre.&nbsp;:smileyhappy: Had some bad experiences with ncc. We users treat our mobiles as our babies.. lol.. nd care centres don't show any kind of care towards them.</p>

<p>I am noticing this issue during the calls only. And I know nothing is wrong with the network as my family members are also using the same network and they are not experiencing any kind of issue. And my SIM is almost new. Ichecked it by putting it in another
 phone. SIM is totally fine.</p>

<p>check if the problem appearing at low singal aeria</p>
<p>it maybe because of low reception level so it cost this problem</p>
<p>remeber the antenna is down build in where we usally hold the phone so when on a phone call few bars may drop more and thats making the call quality bad if is poor singal</p>
<p>so check while on phone call , if singal levels are down to 1-2 bars</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if this is not the problem then:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>reinstall the software via pc<br />
if is a bug it should be fixed or maybe not appearing so often this problem</p>
