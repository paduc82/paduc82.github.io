<h2>            Driver Error AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5000</h2>
                    <p>I use an HP Pavilion dv6-3118ez with RAM upgraded to 8GB running windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Problem is that the driver for the amd mobility radeon hd 5000 has stopped working since my update from windows 7 to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i get this every time the computer starts:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6cc10ed-da71-46d0-82b7-802a248404b0" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>my device manager and GPU meters tell me this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3599da1f-106a-46e3-99d1-10f45be828f3" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>as i am not <em>that</em> tech savvy i think it should come as no surprise that i'm at a loss here. Does anyone know what i can do?</p>
<p>notice: i've tried reinstalling the driver from AMD and from HP, but to no avail. i've also tried updating or reinstalling the driver in device manager, and i've checked windows update more times than i can count. still nothing. a solution to this would
 be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>All&nbsp;drivers would not be compatible with Windows 10. I suggest you to check if AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5000 is compatible with windows&nbsp;10 or not.</p>
<p>Refer the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-IN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-IN</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If not compatible, I suggest you to install the latest&nbsp;driver from the manufacturer's website in compatible with Windows 10. If there are no compatible
 drivers download the one which supports for Windows 8/8.1, follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
a. Download the latest Application from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.&nbsp;<br />
b. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the driver&nbsp;setup file and click on ‚Äò<strong>properties</strong>‚Äô.&nbsp;<br />
c. Click on the ‚Äò<strong>compatibility</strong>‚Äô tab and check the box ‚Äò<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for‚Äô
</strong>and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.
</span></p>

            <p>the only drivers i could find from HP are the ones for windows 7, so i reinstalled those with compatibility mode for win 7 and now my device manager gives me this:</p>

            <p>ok so i just fixed my hp pavillion dv7-4177nr entertainment notebook. after more than a day with this problem. it started when i tried to play age of empires 3 after i upgraded to windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>First, </strong>I went to hp.com. Found my product, and clicked drivers. i searched under windows 7. found the (software framework) driver. Downloaded and installed it. reboot.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>Second, </strong>I went to control panel/ system/ device manager. found my hd graphics card under display adapters. right clicked and uninstalled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>Third,</strong> I went directly to (http://support.amd.com/en-us/download ) and went to drivers. now heres the tricky part. dont download the auto detect tool. look to the right and scrool down. my graphics chip is a ati
 radeon mobility hd 5000. again this is miss leading. because on the right of the screen under (
<span>Radeon‚Ñ¢ R9 200, R7 200, HD 7000, HD 6000, and HD 5000 Series) there is a link for 32 bit windows 10. which is what i have... but if you scroll one more section lower youll see
</span></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>(AMD Mobility Radeon‚Ñ¢ Notebook Drivers) thats what you want. i clicked the 32 bit windows 10 link. downloaded and installed. And i got a error box saying i had no drivers installed for my hardware. This confused me a bit. reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Finally, </strong>I went to device manager again. right clicked on my graphics card. and selected update drivers. i clicked browse my computer. then clicked select from a list. and i saw a driver there i hadnt seen before. it was for a radeon hd
 5470. i installed it. during installation my screen went black a few times. normal i thought. then it went black and stayed black. i waited for about twenty min with no result. so i held down the power button untill it shut down. i took the battery out and
 did a soft reset by holding the power button down for about two min. then when i rebooted my resolution had changed and i didnt get the error box on startup. i went to device manager and display monitors. it says i have a radeon hd 5470 functioning properly.
 and a radeon hd 4250 working properly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. nothing ive read online has helped me, but this did. let me know if anyone can shed some light to why this worked.if it doesnt work for you write me back. between steps i did try to run a windows 7 graphics driver in compatability mode.
 between step two and three.</p>

            <p>thanks, that seems to have worked, even though things didn't happen as you described them. i installed the hp software framework and rebooted, at which point i noticed that windows update had updates for me, one of them being an update for AMD mobility radeon
 hd 5000 series. so i gave it a go and rebooted, got the error message again and from there on it was pretty much as you described under "Finally, ...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is running smoothly again and my computer doesn't seem to be overheating anymore at every slightest bit of effort i put it through, so everything seems to be fine now EXCEPT that onenote doesn't want to open anymore (at all) and firefox will only
 do so in safe mode. These are, in theory, things i could live with but i would greatly appreciate a solution nonetheless. i'll also see if i can find something and post it here if i do.</p>

            <p>ok, it didn't work after all. windows update has seemingly installed <em>another
</em>driver update for my amd mobility radeon hd 5000, this time breaking it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tried what you suggested step by step, but that didn't work either. I'll try it again with running a win 7 driver in compatibility between steps two and three and keep you posted on the results.</p>

            <p>Download the latest version of catalyst from amd's website NOT hp because not every card the manufactrer's update works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always update from amd's site and have had no issues what so ever, you may also need to download a chipset update if your machine has a amd chipset in it for improved 10 support</p>

            i've already searched through the hp website, including the site you posted and nothing there was of any help whatsoever. since i bought my laptop in 2010 and hp doesn't have anything for laptops from before 2013 except "check windows update" i doubt i'll
 be getting support from hp.<br />

<h2>            Is short boot test fail &#40;error 1000-0146&#41; reason for desktop flickering and high cpu&#63;</h2>
                    Dell inspiron 6000. Windows xp professional sp 3. Three weeks ago my computer started beeping loudly upon startup and the desktop icons flicker. The touchpad stopped working for a while but for the most part that is fixed. I installed malwarebytes' that
 removes about four trojans and tried updating all of the drivers. I have done a system restore about 3 times. When I ran a drive test, there was a short boot test fail error 1000-0146. When my app icons start flickering my cpu jumps to 100%. Pushing any button
 usually makes it stop for a bit. Is this a compatibility problem with my software or is the short boot failure causing this. Help!

<h2>            Uninstall KB3176936</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen more entries about this issue but I couldn't find a fix on them..</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the KB3176936 installed I had all kind of issues so I made a lil research and it seems that update is the issue, I would like to uninstall it. As you imagine I couldn't do it the traditional way so I need heeelp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I tried:</p>
<p>- Uninstall from "Installed updates" window.--&gt; No "Uninstall" option</p>
<p>- Restore point --&gt; I did a few days ago, then blocked autoupdates, but that one was never removed. Now all restore points are gone so nowhere to restore to.</p>
<p>- Reset the laptop --&gt; Was ready to go the hard way and reset it all. But when i try it says it failed and no change was made. (Although if it did work, it would auto update again and we would be at the same spot)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is a fairly common issue...... is there a way to get rid of that thing?</p>
<br />

<h2>            Zoo Tycoon 2 goes through the installshield but then disappears and won&#39;t allow us to play it.</h2>
                    we just bought this Zoo Tycoon 2 game also and are having problems. &nbsp;It goes all the way through the installshield wizard but then disappears and won't allow us to play. &nbsp; We've uninstalled and tried several times, still won't work. &nbsp;We even went back
 to the store and exchanged it thinking it was just bad software! &nbsp;What a disappointment not to mention $40.00 down the drain. &nbsp;Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

<p>However, from that error there is a reference that&nbsp;"A driver switched stacks using a method that is not supported by<br />
&nbsp;the operating system. The only supported way to extend a kernel&nbsp;mode stack is by using

<p>The problematic driver is the vsdatant.sys and it appears to be causing a "stack overflow".</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Guthaben - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> starbury360  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Guthaben</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo zusammen,</p>

<p>leider konnte ich keine 100% Antwort f√ºr mein Problem finden.</p>
<p>Ich habe vor einiger Zeit einige Xbox Live Points erworben. Diese wurden nach der Umstellung auf Echtw√§hrung umgerechnet.</p>
<p>Einen Teil dieses Guthabens habe ich ausgegeben jedoch sind noch knapp 30‚Ç¨ auf dem Konto.</p>
<p>Eine Auszahlung ist wohl nicht m√∂glich wie ich bereits in Foren gelesen habe oder?</p>
<p>Leider kann ich auch mein Gold Konto nicht mit diesem Guthaben verrechnen denn die Zahlungsm√∂glichkeit wird zwar angezeigt, ist jedoch zur Auswahl nicht m√∂glich.</p>

<p>Gibt es bis auf den Verkauf meines Accounts und dem Ausgeben des Guthabens f√ºr Sachen die ich nicht brauche eine andere M√∂glichkeit das Guthaben zu nutzen?</p>

<p>Vielen Dank im voraus f√ºr die Hilfe.</p>

<p>Hallo, eine Auszahlung des Guthabens ist leider nicht m√∂glich.</p>
<p>Die Goldmitgliedschaft konnte vor der Umstellung bereits nicht mit Points erworben werden, weshalb es auch mit dem Guthaben nicht funktioniert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zudem ist das Verkaufen eines Accounts/Profils/Gamertags laut den Xbox Live Nutzungsbedingungen nicht gestattet.</p>
<p>Siehe dazu Punkt 1.9 </p>

<p>Wobei das umgewandelte Geld irgendwann verfallen wird, weswegen er es nicht zu lange behalten sollte.</p>
<p>Kauf dir DLCs und/oder Spiele, wenn dir was gef√§llt. Das Guthaben h√§lt noch √ºber ein Jahr, in dem Zeitraum wird sicher noch was rauskommen, was dir gef√§llt.</p>

Ctrl + C Will Not Work</a> <br />
<br />
It looks like the most of people experienced this problem due to some third party application which was running in background and they manage to resolve this by uninstalling that software or changing its settings.<br />
<br />
You said that you upgraded to Windows 7. When upgrading from some previous version of Windows it might be helpful to check integrity of system files, to do this try that:<br />
<br />
press <strong>WinKey+R</strong> &gt; type <strong>cmd</strong> and press enter &gt; type
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and press enter (it will check for integrity of system files and repair them)<br />

<p>Hi freebird6566,</p>
<p>a) Did you make any changes on your computer prior to this issue?<br />
b) Is there any particular service which is not getting started?</p>
<p>This behavior can occur if the service is disabled or if the service is disabled for the hardware profile that you are currently using.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs follow these steps to manually start the service.</p>
<p>1.Click Start, type services.msc, press enter and then click Services. <br />
2.Double-click the service that did not start. <br />
3. Click the General tab. Verify that the service has not been disabled in the Startup Type box. If it has, click Automatic to have it start when you start the computer.</p>
<p>Refer:<br />
Some services do not start in Windows Vista<br />

            Hi Candi, 
<br />
<br />Currently, there is no way natively to connect your stream to your Apple TV. However, 3rd party apps exist if you want to go that route. 
<br />
<br />Check out this link:
