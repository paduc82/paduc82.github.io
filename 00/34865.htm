<h2>            Can&#39;t finish installing drivers</h2>
                    <p>Three main problems that prefaced my current situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Built in camera not being detected (sometime in the past month or so)</li><li>OneDrive for Business not syncing after upgrade to Office 2016</li><li>Chrome repeatedly crashing without any error notifications</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I took several actions on each item, including updating drivers and running hardware and device troubleshooting, which led led to another puzzling issue. After making changes to the system, troubleshooter informed me that the PC needed to be restarted. So
 I did. And after every reboot it tells me the same thing: Restart your PC to finish installing drivers and updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what to do next?</p>

            <p>Two things. Right-click on the Command Prompt icon and choose "run as administrator". See if that helps</p>
<p>Secondly do I take it from your post that you only have ONE user account on the computer?</p>
<p>If that is the case then you <strong><u>MUST</u></strong> read this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Do NOT use Windows 7 with only ONE user account</u></strong>. In Windows 7, the built-in Administrator account is disabled by default and although it is possible to enable it, that process may be beyond what you feel comfortable with.<br />
WHEN, and not IF,you have problems accessing your ONE user account, you will have tremendous difficulty if you only have ONE use account.</p>
<p>You need to forget anything to do with XP, and create a User Account with Administrator privileges, (call it Admin or similar) and give it a password. Keep this account for emergency access and for elevation purposes. Then change your User account to a Standard
 User account.(There is absolutely no need to run as an administrator on a daily basis in Windows 7 - Windows 7 has the "right-click-run as administrator" function for when you need admin privileges). You will be much safer and better protected doing this.<br />

    <title>Hard drive detected as RAW in Vista &#47; Windows 7. Works fine in XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pnwk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard drive detected as RAW in Vista &#47; Windows 7. Works fine in XP and Linux.</h2>
                    I have an external hard drive wich Windows 7 detects as having a RAW "Healthy (Primary Partition)". When I plug it into an XP machine, it works fine. I allso regularly use it in Linux (Ubuntu 8.10). I have allso recently tried to use it with a friend's
 Vista PC, but the same error occured. Their XP machine could acces it.<br />
<br />
I do not believe it is a usb-related or enclosure related problem, as my brother uses the same model enclosure with Windows 7 RC.<br />
<br />
This must be a Vista / Windows 7 issue.<br />
<br />
One thing that might help: It seems like whenever I plug it into an XP machine, it won't safely remove it, even though no program is acessing it. (I searched for processes acessing with Process Explorer).<br />
<br />
It was originally formatted in Windows 7 RC (thus ntfs3).<br />
<br />
It seems like this poster had the same problem:<br />
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/723c1e5d-54c6-45db-8d6c-e43790c89586/<br />
(It does not seem to have been solved)<br />
<br />
I do not have the backup facilities to reformat the drive at this time. Thus I would like to find another solution.

            Hi Pnwk<br />
<br />
It's likely to be a FAT32 / NTFS issue.<br />
<br />
Check what file system is on the XP machines that can read the drive and the filesystem that is on the drive itself.&nbsp; If it's FAT32, you will be the third person who has had this problem.<br />
<br />
For some reason Vista doesn't seem to like reading a FAT32 external drive... you can get the same problem with XP if one is fat32 and the other is ntfs.<br />
<br />
My work around is to plug the drive into a machine that likes it, then use the network to transfer files to the machines that don't.

Never ever approach a computer saying or even thinking "I will just do this quickly".<br />

Thanks for your quick reply.<br />
<br />
It is definitely formatted ntfs.<br />

I like your workaround, though :) . Sadly I wil only be able to use it for the next few days while I am at home.

            OK I reread your OP and obviously I missed the formatting part.&nbsp; D'oh!<br />
<br />
So the win7 machine that was used to format it (via usb, I assume) now denies all knowledge?<br />
<br />
Is the jumper on the drive set to master, cable select or slave?<br />
<br />
If it's master, try cable select and vice versa.&nbsp; It shouldn't work at all as slave.<br />
<br />
<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
I've been kinda busy lately and forgot to check back here.<br />
<br />
Just some feedback:<br />
<br />
I still have the issue with the drive. I believe it has something to do with the way in which the different versions of ntfs works. It seems XP and linux still work with the drive as if it is an older version of ntfs, while Windows Vista &amp; 7 treat it differently
 somehow.<br />
<br />
Meh, at the moment I use an XP&nbsp;VM to acess my dirve. It works, but is not near ideal.&nbsp;One day I will format it again (maybe in XP this time around) and hope for the best.<br />
<br />
Thanks
        </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same problem with Seagate ST9250827AS Momentus 5400.4 250 GB.</p>
<p>The drive is in portable box and uses with different machines.</p>
<p>Now it works fine in XP, but has RAW file system in Windows 7.</p>
<p>It has already happened twice. First time I recovered my data and formatted HDD. But the same problem happened again&nbsp;not long ago.</p>
<p>It's not a good solution to recover data and format the drive&nbsp;periodically.</p>
<p>Does anyone have better solution?</p>
<p>Are there any suggestions about the cause?</p>

            If the drive did not originally come in that portable box then the box's electronics is not compatible in Vista / Windows 7.&nbsp; Hard drive conversion boxes are not all created equal.&nbsp; Several of these just do not work in the newer Vista or Windows 7.

<p><span>I
 was looking for such cases and found plenty of them. I don't think that the problem is in hardware.</span></p>
<p><span>And
 this HDD in this box worked fine for some months.</span></p>
<p><span>The
 drive now has RAW in Win7 and NTFS in WinXP even without portable box, connected directly to SATA.</span></p>
<p><span>What
 could happened with file system? What makes Win7 to think, that HDD doesn't have any file system when WinXP finds NTFS without problems?</span></p>

            I have had this issue occur three time with three different drives on an HP laptop and a Dell laptop. In all cases the data remained on the drive, was readable by Linux but the drive was reported as RAW format on Vista and Windows 7 machines. For some
 reason the format of the drive seems to simply change inexplicably from NTFS to RAW.<br />
<br />
I have been searching the web for a solution because I am now facing this issue for the fourth time in 3 years and on a new drive. This is definitely NOT a hardware issue. Does anyone have a solution for simply rewriting the drive format descriptor without
 screwing with reformatting the drive?<br />

                    I've got a few of these Microsoft bluetooth dongles that comes with the bluetooth keyboards and mouses and would like to use the dongle for A2DP as well<br />
<br />
Previously I've managed to get it to work with Broadcom's software but unsure why it refused to work now<br />

Any suggestions for how I can get A2DP running?

<p>Hi akromatic,</p>
<p>Windows 7 does not include a Bluetooth audio-class driver. A2DP support and drivers are provided entirely by third-party Bluetooth software.</p>
<p>You will have to download the drivers for the blue tooth device from the manufacturer’s website and if they do not have the drivers then a work around that you can try is to use it in the XP compatibility mode.</p>

            I'm not sure how XP mode would give me native support for bluetooth audio and if my computer system can handle it as its fairly old, I'd understand Windows 7 does not support bluetooth audio but there is no other drivers that I can download from manufacture's
 website other then ones supplied by Microsoft as it is a microsoft branded bluetooth dongle from a microsoft bluetooth peripheral.<br />
<br />
I've tried using 3rd party BT software but it doesn't seemed to work. I've tried Broadcomm's installer.

            <p>Windows 8 also doesn't include proper working A2DP support and Microsoft has tried to block install of Windows 7 Broadcom Bluetooth drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was having problems which meant that a Samsung HS3000 Bluetooth wireless headset was no longer working correctly with a HP Pavilion G6 laptop after upgrade from Windows 7 64bit&nbsp;to Windows 8 64bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workaround solution I found was to </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Download and attempt to install the latest HP Broadcom drivers for my HP laptop under Windows 7 64bit (<a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp52501-53000/sp52717.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sp52717.exe</a>) from
<a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp52501-53000/sp52717.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp52501-53000/sp52717.exe</a>&nbsp;via this HP support page
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=ob-93400-1&amp;cc=uk&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4063&amp;product=5116748&amp;sw_lang" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=ob-93400-1&amp;cc=uk&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4063&amp;product=5116748&amp;sw_lang</a>=</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) The initial automated install will extract files to C:\SWSetup\SP52717 by default but then fail during install</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Make sure that you have fully uninstalled any previous paired Bluetooth devices from within Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Devices and Printers list</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Consider whether you want to reboot just to make sure things are reset and clean then go into C:\SWSetup\SP52717\Win64 and manually run Inst.exe (not the main Setup.exe as that's blocked)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) After install reboot to make sure drivers are fully installed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) On restart go to Desktop and then Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Devices and Printers list &gt; Click 'Add device' and make sure your Bluetooth device is in pairing mode so it can be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) During install you will likely get one or more crash reports while a discovering Bluetooth services panel is onscreen. Give each a little bit of time and then clear/close them leaving main panel in front.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8) After a while of no apparent activity right click Start bar Volume icon and choose 'Playback devices' - hopefully you should now see expected 'Bluetooth hands free audio' or equivalent new device in your playback devices list :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9) Do one further reboot to clear Bluetooth services panel and hopefully find everything working normally as expected - i.e. Bluetooth headset should get priority when it's switched on, otherwise sound comes out of laptop speakers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps others...and that Microsoft and Broadcom get round to releasing full A2DP support drivers for Windows 8 soon!</p>

            Good luck. Spotify actively resets itself to load at Windows startup. This has been a complaint in Spotify user forums and on Reddit for years. I eventually threw in the towel and now I only use the Spotify web interface on my PC.

    <title>Windows 8.1 Limited connectivity randomly started happening after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omar_tarek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Limited connectivity randomly started happening after resetting router.</h2>
                    Hi guys, i am sure you've seen this before, a lot of people have passed on this issue, the one when you get "Limited" and a yellow mark on the internet connection icon, i'm on
<strong>Lenovo G510 laptop using Windows 8.1</strong>, And i've tried almost everything that's out there on the internet, from
<strong>resetting the TCP/IP</strong>, doing the <strong>ipconfig/release ipconfig/renew</strong>, installing the driver manually and choosing the one with the manufacturer's name, trying to connect manually to the network,
<strong>r</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>esetting WinSock</strong>,</span>&nbsp;<strong>cleaning my DNS cache</strong>, changing my DNS server to openDNS once and to Google's once, i did all the power-related
 solutions(like unchecking the box which allows windows to close the driver and stuff like that) NOTHING WORKED, i get a connection for some random intervals of time, and then whoops, no internet connection, a few things came to my mind as i read through the
 internet and tried to solve this issue,<strong> the issue is solved once the network adapter is reset through the troubleshooter</strong>, i don't want to reset my adapter every 5 minutes, this whole problem started when i made a reset to my router which is
 something the ISP asked me to do for a fault on their end that required a router reset, so i thought maybe its the router not the laptop, but every other device is connected normally to the router, also my router configuration is supposedly good enough after
 the reset, when i did the reset i changed the SSID(i think that's irrelevant), i also tried changing the channel ID from auto(1) to 9 on the router's page(as some people suggested) didn't work(so i changed it back), now here's the part that i understood from
 the error report i got from the troubleshooting of the network adapter :<br />
<br />
<strong>Result of diagnosis: Problem found</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Root cause:</strong><br />
<strong>This computer is continuously switching between two or more wireless routers or access points</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Detailed root cause:</strong><br />
<strong>Excessive roaming (between access points, within a profile or a preferred network)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Repair option:</strong><br />
<strong>Select one preferred network</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Windows Help and Support can provide more information about how to prevent your computer from continuously switching between wireless routers or access points.</strong><br />
<br />
I've read a comment that the router CAN drop a signal even if its wired correctly and working fine and that may cause my laptop to try to connect to another available network which causes the problem, one thing that i'm not sure of, is that when i try to connect
 to my network, there's another network that i can reach one of its signals and that network is set to Connect Automatically by Windows, when i uncheck that in the tray and go back, it goes back Connect Automatically even if i'm already connected to my network(I'm
 not sure i explained that good enough but i hope someone understands it, its the blue thing that appears on the right when you want to connect to a network and then appears all the networks around you, i have 2 available, one which is mine and the other is
 just there, probably a neighbor's(it is password protected), anyway that one always has a checked box of Connect Automatically), also i'm always connected to a
<strong>VM</strong> network, and recently i was connecting to some <strong>VPN</strong> networks, but i uninstalled my
<strong>VPNs</strong> to try to figure out the problem on that error's point of view, but to no avail...<br />
<br />
Excuse me if i didn't provide enough information, please ask if you need more information to analyze the problem, cause i really don't know, i'm tired after 6 days trying to fix this problem, if you have anything that might help please share it with me.

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse stopped working suddenly.</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp; My Sculpt Comfort Mouse has stopped working all of a sudden. I was writing my notes in notepad and after a while when I tried to start the mouse it doesn't work. Tried replacing batteries but of no use. Upgrading drivers didn't help. The sculpt
 keyboard is working fine. I tried across two machines and having same issue. The blue laser light beneath the mouse is died. However, when I switch on the mouse off (power on) the blue light blinks for a second. Not sure if this is a hardware problem. I bought
 this mouse in Jan'2014 and was working great until today!! Please help. <br />

<p>The game has a known bug and one recommended workaround is to play offline by disconnecting your console from the network until the publisher issues a patch update to fix the problem. Let us know how you get on.

    <title>Xbox App crashes when uploading captures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> countdown3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox App crashes when uploading captures</h2>
                    <p>When I try to upload clips, the app crashes at 98% and doesn't upload the capture.&nbsp;This is very frustrating because I can't upload captures that I&nbsp;saved to OneDrive previously. Sometimes it seems trimming the videos into shorter segments gets them to upload, but this doesn't even work consistently; they usually still fail.</p><p><br /></p><p>I've googled around and a lot of others have had this issue with no apparent solution, but the posts I&nbsp;found were from months and months ago, so I'm hoping maybe there has been a fix since then?</p><p><br /></p><p>I&nbsp;tried resetting the app and even downloaded the beta and tried that one instead and still have the same issue. I'm trying to upload clips from PUBG&nbsp;if that's relevant. (The captures were taken on my Xbox, then saved in my OneDrive and I&nbsp;am trying to bring them from OneDrive to Xbox Live (since they've been deleted off my Xbox's local storage).</p>

<p>PhidzMac02,</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply, but I don't see anything in that link that addresses my issue. There is a lot of troubleshooting there for people having trouble recording clips on their PC, but I am not trying to do that, I don't even play from my PC.&nbsp;I&nbsp;am just trying to upload the clip which was recorded on my Xbox and saved to OneDrive. I have figured out that clips over 40 seconds seem to crash it, whereas shorter ones don't. But this is a pain because if I&nbsp;have a 2 minute clip,&nbsp;I need to cut it into sections to upload it and it looks bad trying to piece it back together.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>Others have had this problem too, but I&nbsp;don't see a solution in their forum posts either:</p>

</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you for bringing this up. Normally, you should be able to upload clips using the Xbox app on your computer. Regarding your concern, can you tell us if you were able to upload clips before using your Xbox app? If so, there's a possibility that the app got corrupted on your computer. To resolve this issue, I suggest that you run the Windows app troubleshooter to scan and repair the Xbox app. You may refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>If the issue persists, I also suggest that you reset the Xbox settings on your computer by performing the following steps:</p>
<br /><ol><li>Press the Windows key on your keyboard, and then click the Settings icon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select System, and then select Apps &amp; features.</li><li>Find the Xbox app, and then click on Advanced options.</li><li>Click Reset.</li><li>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</li></ol><p><br /></p><p>Do get back to us with the results.

<h2>            Windows Keyboards Driver Update Deleted Type Cover Driver</h2>
                    <p>Windows automatically installed uodates including a keyboard update. &nbsp;Since the update installation, my Surface Pro 3 will not recognize my type cover. &nbsp;The backlights for the keys do not come on, the keystrokes dont register any response, and the mousepad
 does not do anything. &nbsp;I have performed a two button restart, deleted the HID drivers in the ketboard driver manager, performed a scan for new hardware in the driver manager, restored my Surface to before the update and reinstalled updates, and none of these
 cause my type cover to register or for the type cover driver to show up under Keyboards in the device manager.</p>

    <title>Check Keyboard Shortcuts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> osterpenpen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Check Keyboard Shortcuts&#63;</h2>
                    I have a video capture card installed in my computer. For reasons I cannot derive, the application for it opens whenever I press F10. I never set up a shortcut for it and it did not have this behavior under Windows 7. The application does not natively
 support such a shortcut itself that I am aware, at the least none that I ever enabled. I would like to disable this behavior.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am a somewhat advanced user, so any suggestions on how to fix this up to and included manual registry edits would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I will continue to research this on my own and post if I find a solution independently.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for being a part of Microsoft Family. This issue usually occurs if the keyboard drivers or keyboard utility drivers are not updated or due to compatibility issues. I would like to know some information about the issues so that we could help you
 better.</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model number of the computer?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried updating the drivers from the computer manufacturer's website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try installing the latest keyboard driver or keyboard utility drivers from the computer manufacturer's website or from Windows Update and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If installing the latest drivers did not help, then try installing the keyboard drivers or Utility drivers in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</p>

<p>This issue is caused either driver or program compatibility issues. I would like to know the application that you are using for Video Capturing Card.</p>

 compatibility mode.</p>

<h3> chuckrjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Install I.E. 11</h2>
                    Somehow I managed to lose Windows 7 Professional 64bit Internet Explorer 11.&nbsp; I tried the Features Off/On with no luck.&nbsp; I tried to download and install with no luck.&nbsp; I first ran it from the Program file and all I got was a NOT RESPONDING message.&nbsp; I
 believe I need this so Quicken will run. I tried downloading an update which was not compatible, probably because I.E. is not really installed.

<h2>            Windows firewall blocking native MS apps</h2>
                    <p>Hi, after installing a new motherboard and reinstalling Windows 8.1 I've been getting error messages when trying to launch apps from the metro screen.</p>
<p>Native apps like Mail display messages like "Cannot connect to (account name)" Store says it's not available and try again later with error code 0x80072efd. Other third party apps say I'm not connected to the internet (which I am and can reach websites through
 different browsers like IE and Chrome).</p>
<p>Disabling AVG does does not correct the problem. Shutting off the Windows Firewall through the control panel does nothing, but disabling the firewall from the Services tab of System Configuration and restarting makes everything work again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've tried
 running the Apps Troubleshooter, Windows Update Diagnostics and checking the time and date. Also ran wsrest.exe from the admin command prompt. Store license is in sync and automatic updates are on. I can check for and receive updates through the Control Panel,
 no problem. Display adapter drivers are the most current from AMD.</p>
<p>Have re-registered Store by using the following at admin command prompt:</p>
<p>" powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.XML " (without quotes).</p>
<p>Have also check the following registery key:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModel\Repository\Packages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and determined that Packages has SYSTEM set as its owner.</p>
<p>I cannot currently un-install any of the apps because I cannot launch the Store to re-install them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts as to what I might try next?</p>
<p>Thanks, Randy.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Randy,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue and thank you for providing a detailed information on your issue. However, there are few more steps that we can try to diagnose the root cause such as incorrect TCP/IP settings,
</span><span>third-party application conflict. <span>Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Check the proxy server settings.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so, follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. Open<strong> Internet Explorer.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b. Click <strong>Tools</strong> and then click <strong>Internet Options.</strong>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. Then click the <strong>Connections</strong> tab. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d. Then click the <strong>LAN Settings </strong>button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>e. Then <strong>Uncheck </strong>the check box against ”<strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN”
</strong>option.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>f. Click <strong>apply</strong> and then <strong>Ok.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Try to reset the DNS, Ipconfig, winsock entries and check if it helps:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so, follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>key, click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> (<strong>Admin</strong>).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow.</strong></em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Command prompt Window will be open.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing <strong>ENTER
</strong>after each line:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>ipconfig /flushdns</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>ipconfig /registerdns</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>ipconfig /release</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>ipconfig /renew</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>NETSH winsock reset catalog</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>NETSH int ipv4 reset reset.log</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>NETSH int ipv6 reset&nbsp;reset.log</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Exit</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Restart the computer and then check if it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I the issue still persists, then try method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There could be possibility of some background programs conflicting with the smooth running of the computer. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind
 of startup is known as a "clean boot". A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</em></span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Amit, thanks for your suggestions and quick response. Unfortunately neither method corrected the problem.</p>
<p>The check box against "use a proxy server for the LAN" in LAN Settings on the Connection tab in Internet Options for IE was already unchecked. R<span>esetting the DNS, Ipconfig, winsock entries through the admin command prompt seem to go OK--no
 error messages--but after restarting, the same problem continues.</span></p>
<p><span>After completing a clean boot, still no luck so there doesn't appear to be any software conflicts with these native Microsoft apps.</span></p>
<p><span>Since Windows Firewall seems to be blocking the apps, I tried to add an exception but couldn't find anything like Mail or Store on the list of programs. I tried to browse to the where I think the apps are on my C drive but couldn't open the
 folder due to lack of permissions. I took ownership of the folder (C:/Program Files/Windows Apps) but don't see one listed that says Mail, Store, Weather, etc. Am I looking in the wrong place?</span></p>
<p><span>Any other suggestions would be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>Best, Randy.</span></p>

            <p>Hi, am still having problems.... Was hoping some other suggestions might be coming in the future.</p>
<p>I looked around on the web for a few hours this weekend. Others seem to be having the same problem but with minor variations (like maybe just the Store not working) but no solutions.</p>
<p>Should I post this question in a different forum?</p>

            <p>Hi Amit, thanks for the link but I have read and tried to allow apps to receive information through the firewall, but I don't find the exe file that is being asked for. I opened Windows Firewall and click on Allow an app or feature through Window Firewall
 then Allow Another App. On the list there isn't a program that says Mail, Store, etc. When I click on Browse and to go C:/Program Files/WindowsApps I see folders that correspond to some apps (Microsoft.BingFinance, Microsoft.BingFoodandDrink) and there are
 usually three each with long file names. Here's an example of one:</p>
<p>Microsoft.BingFinance_3.0.4.298_neutral_split.language-es_8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>Microsoft.BingFinance_3.0.4.298_x86__8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>Microsoft.BingFinance_2015.201.1617.1157_neutral_~_8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>Each folder contains different files and folders and none contain the exe file the firewall is looking for.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if this is a practical solution. Even if I could allow a app through the firewall wouldn't I have to do that for all the apps, even third party ones? I tried Restore Defaults with Windows Firewall, but the apps will not launch. Shouldn't restoring
 the defaults to Windows Firewall allow the native Microsoft apps though?</p>
<p>If you have any other suggestions, I'd be glad to try.</p>
<p>Best, Randy</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for the information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try to check the issue on a different user account. </span><span>If you create new user account nothing will be lost, it is only the thing that it would be in the other user account which you are using right now. However creating new user account is
 a diagnostic step, if everything works fine in new user account we can easily move the files and programs to new user account.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, for now please try to create new Microsoft user account as an administrator from the link provided below. Make sure you should follow the steps mentioned under
