<h2>            Disable Word Online&#39;s &#34;Welcome Back&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to disable that stupid "Welcome Back" when I open a document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not help, and often will take me to places in the document where I DON'T WANT to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The graphics for Word online are nicer, but these idiotic features keep me from wanting to use it.&nbsp; Features like this, and the way they are forced upon us with no way to disable them, make me distrust MS in general and keep pushing me away from Microsoft
 products.&nbsp; In fact, I now use MS products so little that I really can't say anything more about Word other than the graphics because these policies make the products so frustrating.</p>

            Hello Jeramee, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are very annoyed by Microsoft Word's pop-up "Welcome back, pick up where you left off". I know how unpleasant this can be sometimes for you, no worries, I can help you to resolve this.
<br />
<br />
I am a Directly.com expert for Outlook.com and I am sorry to inform you that you have posted this thread in the wrong forum. The correct forum is
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum">
<em><strong>Office</strong></em></a><strong><em>&gt; <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word">
Word</a>.</em></strong> <br />
<br />
It is important for you to post the thread in the correct forum so that users equipped with the right expertise can better serve you.
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you can do this by a registry fix by deleting all the subkeys in the folder make the folder read only:
<code>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Word\Reading Locations</code> <br />
<br />
Helpful reference: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/310516/how-to-add-modify-or-delete-registry-subkeys-and-values-by-using-a-reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Hope it works! <br />
<br />
Best wishes, <br />

<p>This is an issue with Word Online, not Word on a PC.&nbsp; I'm accessing it in my tablet, so your registry key fix is wrong.&nbsp; Please read before suggesting wrong answers next time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched for 20 minutes already to find a the right forum, so if this is the wrong one, then just move this question into the correct one like admins from every other forum I've ever been on can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I've over 2 hours just trying to post a couple tech support questions.&nbsp; My other question is about changes to Win 10 as I'm in the market for a new laptop.&nbsp; Just to make things worse, when i try to type on any Windows product lately (including
 Word Online &amp; this help forum) I'm getting constant typing errors that i don't have on any other app or website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I'm nearly to the point that I'm ready to completely ditch Windows &amp; MS because I'm so frustrated.&nbsp; It shouldn't be this difficult just to fix a problem that Microsoft has created.</p>

            Hello Jeramee, <br />
<br />
I am sorry for the mistake, and I know how frustrated you are right now. I am trying my best to help you to resolve this expeditiously as per your expectation.
<br />
<br />
Until someone who has a better idea, I regret to inform you that this is not possible on Word Online. The registry fix was actually a workaround of the official feature, modifying system's files.
<br />
<br />
If you are a programmer, you may consider making a JavaScript script for your browser as a workaround. ;)
<br />
<br />
As for your second issue, it would be great if you post it as a separate thread and describe your problem clearly so users on this forum can look into it and assist you. (What is the error, how long has this been an issue, what have you done that possibly caused
 this, what are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far) <br />
<br />
Without any information, I guess it is just a browser-related issue? Try with Microsoft Edge instead since Office Online is optimised for it.
<br />
<br />
I am sorry that I cannot resolve your issue, but I hope I have pointed you the right direction.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all the problems I've had today (including having to reset my password yet again for MS products, which took hours, and finding out that there are no good work arounds for the problems with Win 10), I'm ready to just leave Microsoft products altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not willing to waste my time searching for answers that do not exist for MS products.&nbsp; I've lost an entire afternoon of productive time and I'm feeling disgusted with MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For years, I've been able to fix all my software issues (and problems for other people too) myself.&nbsp; Now, MS makes their products with problems that have no answer -- except to switch to other platforms &amp; programs.</p>

            Hello Jeramee,
<br />
<br />I am sorry that to hear that you are very displeased with Microsoft Office products. I can empathise how you are feeling right now—productive software are supposed to optimise your workload, not add additional stress on you.
<br />
<br />As Microsoft products are designed to have the best balance of personal and business user needs, it will not be best for anyone. Personal users prefer minimalism, while business needs require more complex functionality.
<br />
<br />Specifically the welcome prompt you are hating, it is an obligation by Microsoft to the law to make their software accessible to blind people by creating this pick up where you left off which creates resume reading pane feature on the screen it makes working with document with screen reader very difficulty for the disabled community.
<br />
<br />I hope my answer is helpful to you. :)
<br />
<br />Is there anything else I can help you with?
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Sutharsan

<p>It's great that there are features to assist disabled people, but that's not an excuse to annoy everyone else by not being able to turn these features off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the second issue, sorry, but no.&nbsp; It's incredibly annoying to type anything into this site now, and I've spent hours searching for answers only to find out that the bugs are the features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again, I'm using my mobile, not a laptop with different browsers to choose&nbsp; from.&nbsp; Also, after all the problems I'm having with MS products now, why would i want to install another MS program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a carc* of trying to be everything to everyone.&nbsp; This a case of making useable products.&nbsp; MS keeps making things more difficult to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*That's what got entered when i typed "case".&nbsp; I'm tired of fixing 5 errors per sentence with this sure.**</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
When using the Outlook for Android app, clicking the attached file to an email will automatically download and&nbsp; it will be saved on your device. Have you tried checking all the folders listed under the internal storage of your phone? Also, Can you tell us any
 troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?

<p>Please re-read my post and the thread it was on. This is about embedded pictures that just appear in the body of the email not attached files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont have an issue with other file types e.g word, pdf. When a picture is embedded in an outlook email on android it says it downloads when you initially click on it but it doesnt save anywhere.&nbsp; There are multiple posts on your forums with this same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution has been to set up my outlook account to work via gmail. Click on the embedded picture in gmail (yahoo.. basically any other email application) and it immediately saves to phone picture gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide a response to the question posed.</p>

<h3> cpe57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does it take so long for email to show up as sent as well as slow to receive</h2>
                    I have been using Outlook for about a month now and find it to have several odd behaviors.
<div>Basics. I have three accounts running: 2 with gmail and one with iCloud.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All the initial syncs have taken place, my inboxes have less than 10 messages in them, and I have deleted loads of old stuff.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, here is what I get.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. If I send an email it will take over 15 minutes to show up in the "sent" box, while in Entourage it was there instantly. The same applies to a deleted email.&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. I have noticed that some of my email will not show up in my inbox for days (up to 5) after it has been sent to me by someone. This happens in the gmail accounts. However, if I open up Entourage I can get them instantly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have run Outlook and Entourage side by side and independently and the pattern is the same. Entourage is instant. Outlook lags for a long time. This is very frustrating when one counts on the timeliness of email.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance</div>

<p>I purchased Lumia 2520, Offline map is one main reason. However, it seems that in a remote area without wifi and celluar signal, the Here map is not able to position itself by GPS. Also, I did not find Nokia Drive app for Lumia 2520 which make the navigation
 useless. Please fix the offline GPS problem and add Nokia Drive, it is essential and also keep Nokia product consistency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another problem is the touch keyboard, when using desktop mode, the keyboard does not pop up automatically when click on any input field and won't disappear automatically. If I manually activates the keyboard, the window won't move up so the keyboard overlaps
 the input field. This is very annoying. Please fix it.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I already tried before which did not work. I tried again, it won't work. If you turn off celluar and Wifi, the location looks like it still works, however once you make a reboot, then the location won't work by using offline GPS. The
 green circle is always flashing and it won't go to solid green. I&nbsp;use other GPS sattellite app to check the GPS status, it cannot get the position as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For popup keyboard, yes I knew I can scroll the window, however, it is very annoying.</p>

<p>Hi Lumia9000,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cellular dataconnection or WiFi iwll be used to <span>accelerate</span> first GPS positioning. This is called A-GPS. If no data connection is availible only GPS instead of A-GPS will be used. Without A-GPS positioning will take up to 15 minutes. I would
 recommen to activate any data connection to benefit from A-GPS. The amound of transmited data for A-GPS is very small. Dataconnection only supports first positioning after GPS was disabled for some time. After device gots GPS position data connection will
 not be used anymore until you disable and enable GPS again. I hope this information will help you. For more information search for AGPS at wikipedia.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why I need offline GPS is that it is very important to use in remote area. There is no celluar data/wifi availaable, also it is important to use when I travel overseas so the data roaming can be avoided. If it takes 15m to find the satellite, to me it means
 a failed product. The old N85 and HTC HD2 and Lumia 900 I owned before are able to get signals pretty quick without using any A-gps. The lumia2520 is large, it should have stronger attena and position quicker. I hope Nokia can do sth. and also bring Nokia
 Drive to 2520.</p>

<p>Positioning time has nothing to do with antenna size. Did you read wikipedia article about AGPS? It is mainly depending on time it takes to get ephemeris and almanac data. First positioning time could take
<strong>up to</strong> 15 minutes. Standalone GPS could also get positioning in approximately 30 secound if setallite data still availible. This means: if you have use GPS short time ago the data is still valid. If you turnes GPS off for a long time or if you
 moved a big distance with GPS switched off satallite data is not valid anymore and then it may take
<strong>up to</strong> 15 minutes. Depending on current sitiuation it may also&nbsp;go faster.<br />
<br />
This is technical reason and will occure with all GPS / AGPS devices.</p>

<p>Thank you,&nbsp;I worked on&nbsp;GPS system/program before so I&nbsp;am sure the attenna is a big factor&nbsp;of GPS.&nbsp;Anyway, Lumia 2520 is a bit slow to find the satellites but I can live on that. So now what I really need is Nokia Drive, a voice-guided navigation on 2520.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How can I redirect the PST file path for Outlook 2010, 2007 and 2003 to a network folder via GPO for existing Outlook profiles&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been racking my brain trying to move the default PST file's path&nbsp;to a network share, for all of my customers that are using Outlook 2010, 2007 and 2003 via a GPO.&nbsp; I have not had much success.&nbsp; I am able to get it to work for new Outlook profiles,
 but it doesn't work with existing Outlook profiles.&nbsp; I can't blow away everyone's profiles to have new ones generated in order get the default PST path changed.&nbsp; I have downloaded the ADMs for all three Outlook client versions I mentioned above, so I have
 the correct options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying to move the PST from the default, local path on the user's PC to a network:&nbsp;
\\file_cluster_name\PST\username\username.pst</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook 2007 and 2010 can be done through the GPO, but as I said it only works on new profiles - not existing ones.&nbsp; Outloook 2003 is done through a registry hack, but I cannot find out where this is.&nbsp; Can someone PLEASE provide some step-by-step guidance
 on how I can accomplish this?&nbsp; I'm in a production pickle and really could use some substantive, step-by-step assistance.</p>

            <p>You are aware storing pst files on a network share is not supported and can result in corrupt pst files and&nbsp;loss of data?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AFAIK, you can't change the location using GPO - you need to edit the profile to change the path. Depending on the type of account and the number of accounts in a profile, there could be several keys that need changed and the keys aren't the same for every
 user. </p>
<p>Have you looked at using a PRF to update the profile? </p>

    <title>Converting old presentations with templates applied to the current - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dianahbr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting old presentations with templates applied to the current version of PowerPoint with a new custom created template applied&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have read through the thread for this and it was very confusing because templates are not the same as themes and that seemed to be confusing everyone. I have created a beautiful new template&nbsp;<strong>and</strong> theme for presentation for my very large
 company. I have many, many older presentations created in 2010 and 2013 templates
<strong>and</strong> themes. I want convert those presentations from the older versions to the newer versions. The template seems to be the problem. How do I remove and replace the template&nbsp;<strong>and</strong> theme for these long presentations? I figure if
 I can get the new template applied it will be easy to apply the new theme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you remove the old template?&nbsp; How do you remove the old theme? Is this possible? In Word you can go to Options &gt; Add-ins and on the Template and Add-ins window select the Normal.dotx template to revert and get rid of the formatting from any applied
 template. Kind of like formatting the document as .txt. Is there any way to strip a PPP?</p>

<p>You can't strip a theme/template from a PPT file but you can apply a NEW theme or template to the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose the Design tab</p>
<p>At the right of the Themes gallery, click the down-pointing triangle with bar over it to open the gallery.</p>
<p>Click Browse for Themes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now navigate to wherever your new template is stored and choose it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it said "Browse for Themes" and you're choosing a template (POTX).</p>
<p>You DID mention the confusion between the two.&nbsp; It *started* at Microsoft; no wonder it's spread so far and wide.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<p>Hi BrandyLaws,</p>
<p>It’s &nbsp;not feasible to change the default appointment duration for Mac. We can only change it manually. &nbsp;However, we can do this for Windows systems.</p>
<p>This is &nbsp;a feature by design. About your requirement, I suggest you post &nbsp;at this link:

<h2>            Surface Pro &#40; 1st gen &#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to use Windows 10 on my Surface Pro and each and every time I had to restart my tablet, the screen would stay black and have to restore the tablet to 8.0 and then start all over. Similar results all five times. I would expect you guys
 ( MS ) would at least the drivers or whatever is the issue wouldn't cause this on your own products. I just am afraid of ruining all my setup to simply get the same results on my tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anyone please tell me if that issue was fixed recently? Last tried was almost a month ago. Think when it went public at the event. Other than that while it worked it was great and I do love my Surface :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you in advance,</p>

            <p>Hi JED40900,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>I understand that it has not been a very pleasant experience for you to lose your emails after renaming your account. You can use the recover deleted lost email feature in Outlook.com to bring back your lost emails.
 You can refer to the solution article below for the steps:</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0000ff">Restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com</font></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Also, when you chose to rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked you –
<strong>‘Where do you want to save your emails?’</strong> You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account. If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will
 be the name of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under
<strong>‘Folders’</strong>. And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If the self-help recovery did not retrieve the emails, you need to provide us your old and new account name on the private message tab that I have created. This will help us in identifying the possible cause of the
 issue and in giving you additional steps to recover your emails. We also request that you post your answers to the questions below for more details about your issue:</font></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><font>When did you rename your Microsoft account? </font></span></li><li><span><font>Did the data loss occur right after you rename your Microsoft account or was the data still there for a brief time?
</font></span></li><li><span><font>Do you have any issues logging in before noticing data loss or did you reset your account password prior to the incident?
</font></span></li><li><span><font>Did you clicked the deactivate button before the issue occurred? </font>
</span></li><li><span><font>Do you have folders? Are they nested? Are the missing emails from the inbox or folders?
</font></span></li><li><span><font>Description of the data loss ( All messages before date, date ranges, estimated number)
</font></span></li><li><span><font>Did you have any issues logging in before noticing data loss? Do you have to reset your password?
</font></span></li><li><span><font>Did you click any link before the issue occured?</font></span></li></ul>

            Version of Outlook?&nbsp; Normally, you would start a new email, open one of the Inbox emails, drag its attachment to the new email, close this Inbox email, open the next, drag its attachment to the new email, finish the new email, and send it.

<h2>            Office 365 installation stuck at &#34;we&#96;re getting things ready&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi MS Support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded Office 365 from my Microsoft account. When installing it, it is stuck at an orange pop up saying "were getting a few things ready"</p>
<p>it has been like this for hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My connection to internet is fast</p>
<p>2. I haven't install office product before on this laptop</p>
<p>3. I've been using uninstaller from this site&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8.</p>
<p>4. My laptop is using windows 10 x64 bit, and i try install office 365 x64 bit and also x32 bit but still stuck.</p>
<p>5. I am using student license for office 365 from my university account.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c895405d-8065-4b88-a204-00d21fa0feef?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c895405d-8065-4b88-a204-00d21fa0feef?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>UPDATE: </strong></span>The problem has been fixed and I have successfully installed office 365 proplus in my laptop. The solution that worked for me was an
<strong>install Toolkit</strong>&nbsp;from this link. The toolkit is located at the bottom of the&nbsp; left pane&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The tool will ask you for certain specs of the office product that you want and will generate an installer package either .exe or .msi Use that installer to install Microsoft office. I had selected .msi for the setup type and it worked for me absolutely
 fine ! without any problem !!</p>

<p><span>1. Navigate to Task Manager&gt;Processes and Details&gt;kill all Office installation

<p><span><span>2. Use the easy fix tool in

            yes! I have already told you that I did that but still no success. I have used the easy fix tool to completely remove previous installation. Additionally I have also used Microsoft install and uninstall tool and Office support and recovery assistant but
 that also didn't help a bit.<br />
And yes it is working absolutely fine on other laptop under the same network.

<p><span>Hi MUHAMMAD,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates and sorry for my late reply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please first follow the steps in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manually-uninstall-office-4e2904ea-25c8-4544-99ee-17696bb3027b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the article</a> to perform a manual uninstall to make sure you have uninstalled all Office 2016 applications on this laptop. Meanwhile, I suggest you check whether you have enough space on C disk drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As I notice that the configuration file may have some error and it seems that you don’t run the download command when using the deployment way, I suggest you do the following again after manually
 uninstalling all the possibly installed Office 2016 applications.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Navigate to
<a href="https://officedev.github.io/Office-IT-Pro-Deployment-Scripts/XmlEditor.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://officedev.github.io/Office-IT-Pro-Deployment-Scripts/XmlEditor.html</a> to create a customized configuration file.

 is not responsible for the information you receive from the third-party linked sites or any support related to technology.</span></em></p>
<p><span>2. When creating the file, I suggest you not add the source path and check if the configuration file can be opened in IE. The file looks like the following.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;Configuration&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Add OfficeClientEdition="32" Channel="Monthly"&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Product&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Add&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Updates Enabled="TRUE" Channel="Monthly"/&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Display Level="Full" AcceptEULA="FALSE"/&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/Configuration&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Follow the steps in

the article</a> to install the Office 2016 applications.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you still can’t install the applications, you may need to turn to the laptop troubleshooting as the issue only happens on the specific laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>First of all I have mentioned in the beginning that it is a fresh install so there is no point in uninstalling it in any way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>second I did download and afterwards installed the product via the development tool. I have followed all the steps correctly.</p>
<p>and lastly there is no fault with my laptop it is absolutely fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is by far the worst installation experience I have ever had with any software and Microsoft support has proved to be useless. They always come up with their 2 or 3 tools and some typical answers that too after keeping you wait for so long. When these
 tools fail Microsoft fails to give any other practical solution that might actually work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Totally Disappointing !</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S I have found a fix for the problem and have updated my thread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks !</p>

</p><p>The tool will ask you for certain specs of the office product that you want and will generate an installer package either .exe or .msi Use that installer to install Microsoft office. I had selected .msi for the setup type and it worked for me absolutely

It works for me. Thank you!

<p>Hi Phil,<br />
<br />
As the case has been closed by the related team, I'd like to write a summary to help other members easily see the information.<br />
<br />
When problematic users access a specific site, they get the error below:<br />
Sorry, something went wrong.<br />
<br />
It is caused by enabling the proxy settings in the environment.<br />
<br />
Make sure that the environment's proxy is turned off.<br />
</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, please feel free to post&nbsp;a new thread, and we will continue to assist you from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Sheen</p>

    <title>Pivot Chart Select Data Source Buttons Greyed Out - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pivot Chart Select Data Source Buttons Greyed Out</h2>
                    <p>I've created a new workbook and in it I created a new pivot table and chart.&nbsp; When I right-mouse-click on the chart and choose Select Data then the Select Data Source dialog box opens.&nbsp; However, only the Switch Row/Column button is active.&nbsp; Under the Legend
 Entries section (on the left) the Add, Edit, Remove, Move Up, and Move Down buttons are all greyed out.&nbsp; Under the Horizontal Axis Labels section (on the right) the Edit button is greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Office 2013 from my current Office subscription.&nbsp; The workbook and worksheets were left at their defaults.&nbsp; Protection was not turned on.&nbsp; How do I enable editing within the Select Data Source dialog box?</p>
<p>

            To solve this problem, you should do a clean uninstall and reinstall of Skype on Mac. For instructions, look into answer provided by Rhiza_E in following thread

<h2>            screen goes blank during calls</h2>
                    Of late when making a call on my lumia phone the screen goes blank and I have to press the side button twice to restore the screen when I wish to switch to speaker or terminate the call. Any suggestions? I have trawled through settings to no avail.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is usually caused by something obscuring the proximity sensor such as a screen protector. If it goes blank when near you ear, that's what the phone is supposed to do. The screen is supposed to come back on after you move the phone away from your ear
 though.</p>

            Check out following help from Microsoft on this issue
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/264299/word-program-is-not-restored-or-maximized-when-you-click-the-program-b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/264299...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Try following one by one and see after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />4. Sometimes, this is caused due to application not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.

 bizarre OLE_Link symbols. &nbsp;I have about 30 of them. &nbsp;Anybody know what they mean? &nbsp;From what I read briefly online they seem to be a bug. &nbsp;How do you link somewhere in a document I wonder? &nbsp;

            "Place in this document" refers to bookmarks that you insert via Insert tab | Bookmark. Bookmarks created automatically by Word, for example when you insert OLE links, are also listed, but these should be ignored in the context of creating hyperlinks.
