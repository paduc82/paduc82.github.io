<p>Hi Chandimal,</p>

</p><p>Glad to hear the issue is resolved. I am here to share the summary of the issue so that other community members who got the same issue can quick find the useful reference. So, please kindly also mark this reply as

<p>1. The Hybrid traffic was going through the Proxy, which to some degree&nbsp; prevent the communication with MFG.</p>
<p>2. The domain which was registered in another tenant. Although removed from the previous tenant, MFG still got some stale records which did not allow your domain registered in MFG again.</p>

<h2>            OneNote Notebook Sharing</h2>
                    I created a OneNote notebook on my personal drive that I then shared to a shared network.&nbsp; I find that when I open the notebook from the shared network and make changes, those changes are not reflecting back to the personal drive version even though everything
 displays as syncing correctly.&nbsp; Am I missing something?&nbsp; Shouldn't the shared notebook tie back to the source?

<p>It sounds like you "shared" by making a copy from one network drive to another network drive.</p>
<p>This doesn't work, as you have seen ....</p>
<p>A Onenote notebook may have only <strong>one</strong> master/original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The correct procedure would have been:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>close the notebook which is on H in Onenote</li><li>move (not copy) the notebook to the other network drive</li><li>re-open it from the new location (+ other people from their computers)</li></ol>
<p>Because it seems your "old" notebook on H misses all changes done to the shared one, you can just close and delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember: There can be only one (Highlander)</p>

<h2>            Windows Device Recovery Tool 3.13.36001 error&#58; Operation ended with failure &#40;Alcatel IDOL 4S open market&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to remove the insider build of Windows 10 from an Alcatel IDOL 4S phone and restore it to its retail package however, I'm running into the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Operation ended with failure</p>
<p>Software installation failed. Please try restarting your device, and try the software installation again. If your device is not detected please use button 'My device was not detected' on Welcome screen."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the things I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Frantically retried about a blazillion times.</p>
<p>2. Switched to another USB cable (in case the one I had is somehow broken or worn.)</p>
<p>3. Tried the Windows Device Recovery Tool on a completely different computer (in case there was some sort of problem with my first computer.)</p>
<p>4. Tried an earlier version of the tool with the network cable unplugged. (My thinking here was that it might have detected that I had already previously downloaded an image file and would install from that but it instead just complained that it couldn't
 find a network connection and forced me to upgrade to the latest version once I plugged the network cable back in.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought my phone back in November 2017 directly from the Microsoft online store. So the phone isn't really THAT old. I just need help as I'm not sure what else I can do to recover my phone's original software. Any help would be helpful and appreciated.
 Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi JC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a dedicated support for Windows phone running <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider">
Windows Insider Program</a>. We would recommend that you reach out to them to get the best in-depth resolution for this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Further testing yielded the same results</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem stated in my original post appears unlikely to be with insider builds of Windows 10 as I just tried to restore an Alcatel Idol 4S phone that's never had an insider build on it. So I doubt that Windows Insider Program forum would be of much use
 in this regard.</p>

Your phone should now reset and restart itself. (It might take
 a while for the reset to finish.)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The hard reset operation will take a while to complete and will show spinning gears before it reboots your device to factory settings. Usually it will finish within 30 minutes but can, in some rare cases, take up to a couple of hours. Afterwards, proceed

    <title>Greek language proofing at OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> panagiotis brd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Greek language proofing at OneNote</h2>
                    <p>It is presented ultimately the following issue with the Greek language and the automatic correction .</p>
<p>When I press T which stands for the greek letter T or τ&nbsp; , automatically it adds the second letter A or in greek A α and it instantly forms the word Τα or τα ( means The in English ) .</p>
<p>The problem is when I need to write another word that starts from T it messes the new word by adding A after T .
</p>
<p>It comes out Ταην which is wrong , the correct word is Την . I do not actually press T and then A but it automatically adds A after T when I only press T .&nbsp; This happens only in OneNote from Office 365 32-bit .</p>
<p>Practically , I must always delete A that presents after T so as to form the needed word .</p>
<p>Other example:</p>
<p>the word is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Τρένο</strong></span>&nbsp; so when I press T then α is automatically added and since I type the other letters as we normally type words , the result is the word
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Ταρένο</strong></span> which is not what I was writing but what it came out cause of this bug .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the greek language proofing after uninstalling it and it persists .</p>
<p>I cannot think of any other solution .</p>
<p>Any suggestions ?</p>

    <title>Creating Custom Fields, mapping them across Outlook applications. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john0814  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating Custom Fields, mapping them across Outlook applications.</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to create custom fields such that information stored in a cf "migrates" to another outlook app, if an item is moved.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; Create a new task in Tasks, with the use of a custom field created off the developer tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their is some problem in the creating of custom fields where you need to create the same field in each app, i.e Mail, Tasks, Calendar, and data placed in a field in on app (tasks, e.g.) doesn't "flow" from one app to another with a drag and drop.&nbsp; Non custom
 fields data does flow or move with the item. I.e. a task with a "subject" field data filled, when dragged and dropped onto the calendar will have that data appear in the subject field on a calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>To your answer though, I know the data isn't transferred from Item to Item - that is IMO a design flaw that should be remedied.&nbsp; It would increase the value of attempting customization by non-developer types.&nbsp; (folks like myself.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>However, I wouldn't hold my breath about that capability to ever see the light of day. This would be one seriously involved change to Outlook not to mention whatever would be involved with adding that functionality to the web based UI. Add to that, having
 dealt with custom forms/custom fields now for some 15+ yrs, personal experience is that there is a notable decline in the use of custom fields with each passing year.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
To verify if the issue is software related. We suggest that you perform a soft reset. Press
<span>and hold the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>Power</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>button</span>
 until your phone vibrates and restarts. <br />
Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Let us know the results.<br />

            Hi Sue,
<br />
<br />Click in the first paragraph on the new page. 
<br />Press Shift + F1 (Windows)
<br />(Mac - View &gt; Reveal Formatting)
<br />
<br />What does it say?
<br />Here's how to post a screenshot:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />(Per Bob Jones (aka Cybertaz), the parts about screen capture only apply to Windows. On the Mac you would use Cmd+Shift+4. See his screenshot for various shortcuts. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9f7b1e7-d1fe-4ebd-bda2-a4f311fd2eca?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.c...</a> )
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.

<p>In your screen shot, the little squares in the left margin&nbsp;indicate that text flow formatting (Paragraph&nbsp;dialog box)&nbsp;has been applied to text paragraphs. Most likely, this is "Keep with next" formatting which forces a paragraph to be on the same page as
 that of the following paragraph. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to modify the styles involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More specifically, if the paragraphs in question are formatted with heading styles, you'll have to modify the headings so that you turn off "Keep with next" and possible also "Keep lines together" and "Page break before."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click in a heading style and, in the Apply Styles pane (Ctrl+Shift+S), click the Modify button. In the Modify Style dialog box, click Format &gt; Paragraph &gt; Line and Page Breaks. See screen shot below.</p>

    <title>Outlook.live.com Junk e-mail filter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pvc1403  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.live.com Junk e-mail filter</h2>
                    <p>I usually use Office Outlook to read my mail. It is linked with POP service to my outlook.com email account. Unfortunately I often miss an email because it is moved to the "Junk email" folder on outlook.live.com. I have searched for hours and have concluded
 that there is no way to turn the junk email filter on outlook.live.com off. So now I have to check the junk email folder on line every day to make sure I don't have legitimate mail there. This is worse than receiving junk email - especially because I hardly
 ever get junk email. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you can add recipients to the "safe senders" list but often I get mail from people I don't contact regularly. It makes much more sense to allow all mail through and then block junk email manually by adding them to the blocked senders list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft can you please give us the option to turn this filter off. Then those people who do get a lot of junk mail can turn it on and people like me who never get junk email can turn it off.

            Hi PvC, <br />
&gt;&gt; <br />
I usually use Office Outlook to read my mail. It is linked with POP service to my outlook.com email account.
<br />
&gt;&gt; <br />
Is there a reason why you are using POP instead of letting Outlook set it up as an Exchange account? That would solve the problem - you'd see the junk mail folder and could whitelist addresses right from Outlook.
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, no, there is no way to turn the junk filter off.&nbsp; You can vote for the suggestion&nbsp; at uservoice:&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/601444-the-new-outlook-com/suggestions/32625482-turning-off-spam-filter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/601444-the-new-outlook-com/suggestions/32625482-turning-off-spam-filter</a>

<p>Thanks for your quick response. I set this up a long time ago and at the time the Exchange option (also imap) did not work for me but I can't remember why. So POP was the only solution. Have been living with this junk e-mail issue for a long time but because
 I missed some inportant mail today, decided to try to fix it. </p>

            Hi 
<br />I understand that it can be very frustrating when your emails go into Junk mail folder. Yes adding to safe Senders list is one way of circumventing emails going into the Junk mail folder.  Are you  noticing any pattern on the emails that are being sent to the Junk folder such as the content of the email and the domain of the sender?
<br />Below is a link from the Outlook Postmaster on how Junk Mail is processed.
<br /><a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a>
<br />Some things to do:
<br />
<br />If an email that should be coming into your Inbox not Junk Right click it and Mark Not as Junk It this will send it back to your Inbox. 
<br />By marking Not as junk the system will learn and put those emails into the Inbox as compared to just dragging them back into the inbox. 
<br />I have seen that some people create rules to send all emails to inbox but the junk mail rules run before other rules created so that would not help. 
<br />Life of Junk Mail it is automatically deleted every 30 days. 
<br />
<br />Reach out for help:
<br />Within your Outlook application click on the ?  and then help there you can type in your description of your problem. Give information as to emails that should not be going into junk. We here are only Community Advisors the help will open a ticket directly with Microsoft. 
<br />Junk Mail rules will not go away nor should they. Your Junk Mail would be flooded with thousands of emails per day without them. 
<br />You can also Click on the feedback to add information as to Junk Mail requests you may have. 
<br />
<br />I hope in some way I have helped. I do understand how frustrating it can be. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

            &gt;&gt; I set this up a long time ago and at the time the Exchange option (also imap) did not work for me but I can't remember why. 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />What version of Outlook did you use then? Outlook 2003 only supports pop and imap to outlook.com, outlook 2007 needed updates to support exchange - 2010 and up should work fine as Exchange. 
<br />
<br />There may be other similar suggestions there- that was the first one with a lot of votes on the first page using the search term i entered. It's hard to say what they will do - i know they are looking at ways to improve the filter but i don't know if turning if off is under consideration - most complaints are that it lets too much spam through and lacks options to delete the most obvious spam.

<p>Thanks for all your suggestions.</p>
<p>The inbox rules does not work. </p>
<p>The mails that are going to the junk folder have no unusual content - they are usually just mail from people who write to me for the first time (I always mark mails as "not junk" when I find them to avoid the problem in future).</p>
<p>My version of Outlook is 2007. I might revisit the Exchange problem / option when I have a bit more time (these little things always suck up so much of your time). I was hoping for a simple solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't understand what the harm is in giving the user an option in this matter. Surely it is not that difficult.</p>

<br />The inbox rules does not work. 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />The run after the junk mail filter, so any mail that gets filtered won't be processed by rules,. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />My version of Outlook is 2007. I might revisit the Exchange problem / option when I have a bit more time (these little things always suck up so much of your time). I was hoping for a simple solution.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Switching from pop to imap would give you access to the junk folder but putting names in outlook 2007's safe list won't sync back to the server unless you have it in as an exchange account.

    <title>Lumia 550 losing charge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dlcmso  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 550 losing charge</h2>
                    <p>Recently purchased a Lumia 550 for my mother so it can sync with her MS band (she's almost 80 and loves it). I am a happy Lumia 735 owner. She lives alone, leaves the phone plugged into a wall charger overnight and when she turns it on in the morning it
 shows as 100% charged. By 3pm it's at 40%. Specs say we should be able to expect 28 days idle.
</p>
<p>We've tried all the usual things, making sure any apps are off etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the patch released on 2 August that refers to fixing a problem that was causing the battery being drained likely to fix this or should we be attempting to return it to the reseller (this is not easy as we live 1000kms apart)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked forums here and elsewhere and the issues described don't quite match this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mother is of a generation that is used to managing 'cordless' devices well and making sure they don't run out of power. As an aging person, the phone becomes something of a safety device for them - this issue means that she won't take it with her to hang
 out the washing because she'll be using up power she might need later. I mention this because I think it's important to remind ourselves of the many important and ordinary ways this technology operates in peoples lives. There are many talented, hardworking
 people at Microsoft and all along the delivery chain so I'm not posting in criticism, only hoping to reach the best people to advise me. Thank you</p>
<p>Ps the topic options didn't really suit this question. I think I needed 'device' or 'hardware'?</p>

            Wow. I did not know there was an official WM6 upgrade for your device. Try deleting the partnership on your device and PC. Reboot both and connect again.

<p>I've done as suggested and it gave the same result. I have no problem synchronizing it in Windows XP with Active Sync. Only with Vista I am having problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really don't want to re-install my Vista, is there any other that I should be looking to resolve this issue? Googling my error log or Event ID didn't give no searhc result.

I still can't sync after following your advice. I have another Axim X50V with WM2003 SE and it got the same exact problem. With my other WM2003 SE, I can't even create Partnertship. Sync Center displayed as Guest which I could only browse the PDA and sync media
 files. It won't sync with my Outlook 2007.<br />

<p>I created a standard user just like the advice of the blog, I got an error pop out upon clicking Set up your device in WMDC.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see screen capture. <a href="http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd7/silverlight168/WMDC.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My motherboard has 6 USB ports and I also have Firewire/USB combo&nbsp;pcix card. That's a total of 9 USB ports on my system. I tried each one of them with the craddle and to no result (same errors Event ID 6 &amp; 8). Just to make sure that I don't
 have a problem with the craddle, I connected to another system with XP Pro installed and it syncronized using ActiveSync.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, just to eliminate whether my current system has a hardware issue, I dual boot my Vista Ultimate with XP Pro.&nbsp;I installed ActiveSync 4.5. Both my Axim X50V WM6 Classic and WM2003 SE are able to synchronized with Outlook 2007 in XP
 Pro but not in Vista Ultimate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error with Vista is really mind boggling. Any other advice? <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fWindowsMobile%2fWebResource.axd%3fd%3dNySzF1eivP_rMoc50GQJzcvS4MHMOEKwYrCIgDtzuzlw7GsNki3H_INlfYaLgkxFSSG0MZbJ1z6uFFjZvu3APg2%26amp%3bt%3d633263991144971555" /></p>

<p>It sure has been an interesting thread silverlight168!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't imagine what is causing the issue.&nbsp; Thanks, BTW, for providing the picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankly, if it were my device, I might consider the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the device works with XP so clearly there is nothing wrong with the device.&nbsp; My first shot would be to delete the partnership then delete the device from Device Manager.&nbsp; Reboot the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the device, I would remove the existing partnership and soft reset the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now connect ...&nbsp;(and I'll pray) and hopefully it will do what it is supposed to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other item I might have done if it were my device is to Hard Reset rather than just removing the partnership and soft resetting&nbsp;the device but you may not want to do that ... yet.</p>

            Thanks for replying but I have a feeling you didnt read all of my post. I said it it claims I need more RAM even though i have more than enough. &nbsp;I have over 400gb free space on the active partition. I'm using a Western Digital Black 500gb HDD. I also
 tried using a Toshiba Pro SSD 128gb. I has the same error trying to upgrade to windows 8. It always succeeds with a clean install even 10240 but I need to be able to complete an in place upgrade for it to activate properly and get the free upgrade to win 10
 when its available.

            I finally got it to work using msconfig to disable all&nbsp;Microsoft services on startup then I enabled a few at a time then tried the update each time after about 4 attempts&nbsp;it eventually worked it just skiped the pc check. I'm not really sure what ones I
 had enabled but I know all networking, wlan, storage and windows update services where running. The weird thing is everywhere I checked it said 4gb of ram but I downloaded belarc advisor it said I had 4gb of ram but only 32mb of ram installed in the one&nbsp;dimm
 slot I was using with a 4gb stick. that 32mb was the same thing the pc check was seeing and storing in the c:/~Windows-BT/Panther directory.

<p>This formula will return a blank if A3 is blank. You'll get #N/A if the date in A3 is before the year in cell B1. For example, if B1 contains 2010, entering 01/01/2008 in A3 will cause the formulas to return #N/A. To suppress this, use</p>

<h2>            DEAD&#47;BLACK LCD Lumia 925&#47;930</h2>
                    <p>I'm a huge Windows Phone supporter. Been in the Lumia series from Lumia 800 to 920, 925 and 930.</p>
<p>However, first I have experienced my Lumia 925 LCD suddenly going dead/black. </p>
<p>Phone is still running/working since I can feel the touch/vibration on the device.</p>
<p>I was first frustrated about this error but I got over it and bought the 930 - which I have loved with the Win Phone 10.</p>
<p>But the nightmare is back!! Now the Lumia 930 have done the exact same thing. LCD is dead!!
</p>
<p>The phone being 25 months old, there is no warranty and the unofficial repair company sayes the repair is 400 USD!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to know is... Are any of you guys in this forum having the same stories???</p>
<p>Is there any Lumia/Windows department to contact regarding this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really loving the Win10 and i'm close to buying af Lumia950 - but then again! How stupid can I be!!&nbsp;</p>

            Hello, 
<br />I am Rob Independent Advisor, I am here to help you to solve your issue.
<br />Thank you for contacting the community It is a pleasure for me to help you out.
<br />-
<br />Try opening the PST as a file:
<br />Open and close Outlook Data Files (.pst)
<br />
<br />Select File &gt; Open &amp; Export &gt; Open Outlook Data File.&gt; Select your PST
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/open-and-close-outlook-data-files-pst-381b776d-7511-45a0-953a-0935c79d24f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/open-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if all your info is contained in the pst to isolate the issue from the PST import process. 
<br />
<br />-How your account was configured in your old account, POP IMAP Exchange.
<br />-How did you backup the old data to a PST you have now?
<br />
<br />NOTE: take in account when you perform a PST backup from Outlook you only export what is stored on cache, if you are using cache mode.
<br />Example if you have configured (as default) 12 months cache, only Outlook will export 12 months emails to a PST. 
<br />

            Go to File, Account Settings, open the account settings dialog. Double click on the account - is the slider set to 1 year? If so, the mail imported and synced up to the server but is not stored offline in Outlook.  You can set the slider to sync all.

<h2>            Huge Office Cache folder fills up hard drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Looks like this is quite a common error.</p>
<p>Found this old thread but no official solution apart from deleting the cache files.</p>
<p><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/f768abbc-6690-4a6e-b683-edea0424e4e9/huge-officefilecache-folder?forum=officeitpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/f768abbc-6690-4a6e-b683-edea0424e4e9/huge-officefilecache-folder?forum=officeitpro</a></p>
<p>Anyone know if this is resolved yet? Client not happy with installing script to delete the files every 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The client has set the days to keep the cache lower and deleted the cache but it just grows again.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think your answer might be for another issue? The Link you sent me was for OneDrive and team sites...This issue has got nothing to do with Team sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue my client has got is that his OneDrive for business is filling up his user's hard drive. Not one user, but an enterprise, cant tell him to go and partition all his hard drive's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just want to make sure I have got Microsofts answer correct here because it sounds ridiculous, and i think you represent Microsoft?</p>
<p>You are asking the users to repartition their drive because&nbsp;onedrive&nbsp;fills it up? Is it just me or does that not sound right to you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not something i can recommend. Think we might rather log a call with Microsoft. I was under the impression that OneDrive for business is a feasible tool lately but looks like still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>

            <p><span>Hi TheWall_RSA,</span></p>
<p><span>I completely understand your annoyance with OneDrive for Business (Groove) filling up your hard drive. Please understand that there are some limitations with this client.
</span></p>
<p><span>The reason I gave the UserVoice link in my last post, for you to vote for the requirement “OneDrive for Business should sync document libraries as well” because currently the new sync client is syncing personal
 documents only. And this is why the users who wants to sync their document libraries along with personal libraries can’t use new client, which is better and more reliable than OneDrive for Business (Groove).
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Till the time the new sync client is not supporting document libraries, we will have to continue using OneDrive for Business and have to use workaround like deleting cache or moving OfficeFileCache folder
 to make the space in hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your understanding.</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook not receiving contact form emails from our domain &#40;of same name&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am not very technical so when you reply could you bear this in mind!&nbsp; We've recently changed our wordpress contact forms (our web guy did it) to stop spam coming through.&nbsp; He's implemented SMTP but now we're not receiving emails from our site when they are
 addressed to the email account ending with the same domain name.&nbsp; They work if we send them to a different email address.&nbsp; Our web guy says it's probably an Office 365 issue - can you advise how I unblock whatever is causing these emails to not appear?&nbsp; They
 show in the website log as successfully sent but aren't anywhere in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS.&nbsp; I've tried a message trace but these emails are not showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, my understanding is that the users who have the same domain, and this domain is the same as your site’s domain, when the emails sent from your site, the users can’t receive the emails. Please clarify if I misunderstand
 your text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, may I know if the all users are using Office 365 Exchange Online mailboxes and can’t receive the emails sent from your site?&nbsp; If so, please contact your IT admin ( Office 365 admin) to help check if he set up the correct DNS
 records( MX record ) for this domain. In general it looks like contoso-com.mail.protection.outlook.com. &nbsp;For more details, please refer to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider?view=o365-worldwide</a> &gt; Add MX record to route email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the suggestions above don’t work, I’d like to collect the detailed user’s email address for the further troubleshooting, you can provide it to me via

            The simplest fix is to go back to the store you bought it from and ask for an exchange of the "defective product". MS doesn't really have any mechanism that I know of to replace PKC PINs. The PIN is a one-time use code to retrieve the Product Key.<br />

                    <p>For a query based on a table, I want to add a new field which sums the values in three existing table fields. If the total is less than 10, place a value of 1 in the new field. If the total is 10 or more but less than 20, place a value of 2 in the new field.
 If the total is 20 or more, place a value of 3 in the new field. Please help. Thanks!</p>

            First, you don't add a field in a query, you add a column. You can use a nested IIF for this:
<div><br />
<div>TotalGroup: IIF(A+B+C&lt;10,1,IIF(A=B+C&gt;20,3,2))</div>
