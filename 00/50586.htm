<p>I finally got to the sound directory from the icon and changed the settings to the external speakers, but it did not work.&nbsp; I did not realize that I had to restart my computer for the changes to take effort.&nbsp; The next day when I cut my computer on everything
 worked great through my external speakers.</p>

<h2>            Now that M&#36; de facto killed Skype on XP, the fate reached Win7 too</h2>
                    <p>Just updated Skype to 7.40.0.103 on Win7, it doesn't connect, but the infinitely rotating arrows on the blue spot are very nicely animated.<br />
Functionality and user experience, the M$ way. I learned already that M$kype is getting worse and worse with each and every new version,<br />
the only reason why I risked the update was the naive hope, that it repairs the month-old problem of connecting to my friends skype running on XP.<br />
Well, in a way I accomplished the goal: skype functionality is now equal on both machines. Too bad, that they are equally defunct, instead of equally working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything for the profit, don't give sheeeeet on customers, M$. The braindead-friendly Win10 must be pushed at any price, no matter how crappy it is, UX-wise..<br />

<p>Connectivity issues generally exist due to some locally on your computer or network blocking access to Skype services.&nbsp; Other times the blocking can be on the ISP/Country level. &nbsp; Windows XP has the addition of having more security-related connectivity issues
 due to outdated components and other limitations.&nbsp; Connectivity is still possible on either of those systems.&nbsp; Additionally you must be using Skype 7.31 or above to get connected to the Skype network.&nbsp; Older retired versions will either be unable to connect
 or stay connected.&nbsp; I mainly use Windows 7 and 10 machines on a daily basis without issue.&nbsp; To attempt to resolve your issue, try my removal tool.&nbsp; It will perform some resets that may help.&nbsp; You can then reinstall the latest version of Skype.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have problems, try renaming the Skype folder located in %appdata% to something else like Skypeold (when Skype is not running).&nbsp; This contains your history and last connection information.&nbsp; Sometimes the reset of that information can resolve
 connectivity issues.&nbsp; If you need to restore you prior history you can always transplant you history file (main.db) back into the new Skype related subfolders that are recreated (when Skype is not running).</p>

<h2>            XBox Movie is in French despite location settings Canada&#47;English</h2>
                    
<p>Something is going on with my XBOX after latest software update. Even my default location is set as Canada/English some movies previews are in French. I just purchased a new Spider Man and the movie itself is in french and there is no option to change the
 language even the preview was in English.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
The console's language/locale settings don't have anything to do with the language you get the movie in. The movie language is dependent on what country your Xbox LIVE account is actually registered under.<br />
<br />
If you're in a country that supports multiple languages they should be selectable if you follow the directions

<p>I understand that and the settings of my account and console were in sync as Canada/English. The preview of the movie was in English. When I purchased it it was in French and I was never asked about what language to choose. This looks like something wrong
 in the xbox video marketplace functionality. The actual movie is "The Amazing Spider Man". I had to go on the marketplace from my PC and buy English version of this movie since I could not find it using the console. I called support and got a credit for the
 points spent on French. In case this is a new and expected functionality, it is very confusing from user point of view: preview is in English but the movie in French.</p>

<p>I had this exact same issue with Star Trek: Into Darkness. I was also able to receive a credit for it once it started playing in French. Could this be because I live in Sudbury, ON - not far enough from Quebec?</p>
<p>There really needs to be an option to purchase in different languages.</p>

<p>I have had this issue for over a year and it is hit and miss. Customer support says they will escalate and they don't... sure I get my money back but the very next day I end up with a movie with English title but French language spoken. Frankly, I have NEVER
 witnessed such unprofessionalism. If freaking Netflix can do it why can't MS????!!! I am seriously considering ditching MS and moving to MAC. The customer support is the worst. I sent my complaint to the BBB in the US and Canada and Facebooked it. People in
 Belgium are having the same pathetic issues with Xbox movies. Whoever is responsible for uploading and monitoring movies needs to be terminated asap. I have asked for the department heads name and a call back... tick tock</p>

<p>I just tried watching a trailer for RIPD on my xbox one and it was in French. Even though the description only lists English. Another trailer I tried was English. I get directed to French Microsoft sites on occasion when checking my hotmail account settings.
 It gets annoying when Microsoft assumes we are all bilingual.</p>

<p>Hi there, Grid. </p>
<p>Is there a sentence or is it simply just saying "Error"? </p>
<p>You could try a hard reset - hold down the console's power button for 8-10 seconds until the console powers off completely and you can see the orange light on the power supply unit. Leave the console off for a couple of minutes and then power it back on.
 Attempt to try and change your privacy settings again. </p>

<p>Try to change your privacy settings via your Xbox &amp; Xbox.com, if neither work. Try MeanMachines suggested answer and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Im not sure that it would help, but you could always try clearing the cache, just incase, or uninstalling just the account profile and redownloading it.</p>

<h2>            People Tags not Transferred to OneDrive &#40;Windows Photo Gallery 2012&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When sending photos to OneDrive to share with others, there is a problem with some of the tags:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The people/face tag does transfer, but it is blank (name is missing - but an "x" shows up so it can be delted)</p>
<p>2. Location/Geotag does not transfer (Should at least be a basic tag in OneDrive).</p>
<p>

            <p>
</p><p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</span><span>I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing. I would like to
 ask you:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Are all the Windows Updates installed?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Are you using any third-party security software on your computer?</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may try to download and install the latest drivers available through the support website of AMD and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Open the link above and&nbsp;search the driver for the graphics card that you are using.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also refer,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, try the following methods and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate
 software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‚Äò<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>‚Äô.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Disable Antivirus</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have installed any third party security software like antivirus or firewall, I would suggest you disable them temporarily and check if
 it works.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Important Note:</span></em></strong><em><span>Antivirus software can
 help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're
 connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.
</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information was helpful. Let us know the results once you have tried these methods.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you</span></span></p>

<p>To delete your account you will need to contact Microsoft. If you click on Support at the top of the website, from the drop down list choose contact us. After selecting the problem you are having you will then be given options on how to contact the correct
 department at Microsoft.</p>

<p>MenacingWalnut Hey there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot completely delete an account. From what I could understand from your post, this support page
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a> will help guide you through how&nbsp;to free up your email address to place another gamer tag on it. Simply go to that page and go to the section titled</p>
<p><strong>"Can I switch my gamertag to a different Microsoft account?"</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a side note, please refrain from using profane language on the forums. Although profanity is censored here, it would be a lot easier for us to understand your post if we did not have to read asterisks. Help us to help you :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Cloud.</p>

<p>Ok..well, let me just state this plainly: &nbsp;you cannot delete and account. &nbsp;At least not in the sense that you are wanting. &nbsp;All you can do is call Support and have them cancel the account. &nbsp;All that does is lock the account out from use from you or anyone
 else. &nbsp;The problem is that the account itself is still around...doomed to float forever in the severs. &nbsp;At least until MS decids to purge it for nonuse. &nbsp;I know this from personal experiences that I do not have time to type and from the fact that it has repeated
 on this site hundreds (if not thousands) of time. &nbsp;Another side effect that the GT you had cannot be used again by you or anyone else. &nbsp;One day, perhaps when/if they announce another console, they might start purging tags for nonuse but that has never been
 (contrary to what you will see posted here by some) an annoucement from MS about starting that process for the 360 era. &nbsp;It was only announced for the orignal console.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Wireless Adapter - Setup Blocked by group Policy&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running windows 10 Pro - I am trying to install the wireless adapter - however in devices it tells me setup has been blocked by group policy (which I have not altered and have even disabled all policies via group policy editor).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In device manager I get an error 48 telling me the driver has been blocked as it has known issues with windows and to contact the vendor, which is Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried downloading the latest drivers for the product from the update catalog and manually updating them - yet the driver still gets blocked by so called group policy.,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be most appreciated before I return my device.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for the prompt response, unfortunately I have tried both methods and still the wireless adapter will not install. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manager tells me the device is known to have issues with Windows (Error 48) and to contant the vendor - Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all settings in Group Policy and cannot see any reason for this happening.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you follow the first steps a few threads above, and you come onto this step,</p>
<p>I found that going into hardware and devices, troubleshooting the device, it may say that windows update needs to be altered to allow instant updates if yours does not work, if you do that, let the troubleshoot complete, then uninstall and delete all drivers
 relating to this adapter, I had mine plugged into a sub 3.0 port, I switched to a 2.0 port, plugged it back in and it installed the correct drivers first time and is now working correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the sound of it, its most probably or corrupt driver file to begin with. so hopefully this helps you out as it did me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit&#58; Lite-On LH-20A1L-06 DVD causes black screen after login.</h2>
                    Hello Windows community,<br />
<br />
I just reinstalled Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit as part of my annual cleanup process. Before the fresh install I was encountering a mouse hang issue, which was difficult to track, but typically occurred when opening an item (even then it was not an exact science)
 or clicking a link. Although, It was not present during the most intensive issues like copying a&nbsp; 6 GB to an alternate drive, while downloading 600 MB file, and running multiple apps. Well it may occur on the initializing the previous load test, but was not
 sustained.<br />
<br />
My first encounter with DVD drive was during my preparation for the fresh install. I rebooted and HDD light was posted red with no flicker and seemingly little HDD noise. I opened the case and pulled all but the primary OS drives SATA cables. Windows immediately
 started up. I thought that was odd, then during an instance of the black screen I reached in and I yanked just the DVD SATA cable out and everything went back to normal.<br />
<br />
All my drivers appear to be up to date, as I downloaded the latest drivers for my EVGA 680i-A1 motherboard, EVGA/nVidia 8800 GTS, sound card and rest of my hardware. I have 6 GB RAM, which I thought might be the problem (bad module), but after pulling it out,
 inserting half starting system then the other half and starting, I realized it's not memory based and system consumes only about 30%.<br />
<br />
I've seen threads related to PS2 mouse input fixing the issue, but since I can clearly track this to plugging in my<span style="font-weight: bold"> Lite-On LH-20A1L-06 DVD
</span>drive how should I proceed.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, my system is fully up to date in terms of Windows updates and I have attempted running the Windows Update Driver for the DVD drive, but Windows says it's the latest and LiteOn's site was not much help, as the drive is a bit old.<br />
<br />
Any assistance would be fantastic as I am either in the game for a new DVD drive (which I don't I need) or running down an alternate driver or replacing the cable (next on the list).<br />
<br />
-Ryan<br />

            you can get a new dvd burner for 20 dollars, i think you should try..<br />
<br />
Also what brand power supply do you have in the computer,and how many watts and how many amps are on the 12volt rail?<br />
<br />
You should also try a new cable on the hard drive too, this can also cause these issues.<br />
<br />
Try removing the x-fi sound card , these are notorious for causing issues with windows 7.<br />
I had nothing but problems with them and windows 7.<br />
<br />
Do you have your power options in the windows control panel set to spin down the hard drives?<br />
set the power options for "High Performance" and check it's advanced options to be sure it's not spinning down the drives.<br />
After resetting your bios, did you go through it and set it manually? you may need to set the dvd drive to IDE mode.<br />

                    <p>I have been having BSOD's intermittently for some time now and I suspect it is a driver issue.&nbsp; I ran Driver Verifier and it did indeed crash, with the bluescreen saying "DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION".&nbsp; Upon opening the minidump with dumpchk.exe, it
 doesn't appear to pinpoint any specific driver and instead tells me it is probably caused by ntkrnlmp.exe.

            Hi Claire, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .
<br />
<br />Edit - I'm off for the night, I will have a look in the morning if that's Okay?

    <title>Windows 10 persisting Black Screen issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mangotrevor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 persisting Black Screen issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I turn on my MSI-win10 laptop the screen remains black, only to flicker occasionally between the completely "off" black and the "faux" black typical when first turn on any screen.</p>
<p>From listening to my HDD, it sounds like the machine is otherwise booting normally. This issue persists even after multiple forced restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A week prior to this...</p>
<p>I experienced what I belived was a GPU issue. Upon waking up my laptop from sleep, the screen would be plagued with unexplained tearing, noise, and other visual artifacts. The problem intensified the higher my display brightness, and the more taxing my power
 usage setting (on power saver and low brightness the issues were only somewhat noticeable). I did a check and all my drivers looked to be up to date. The next morning I turned on the device after leaving it off overnight and it started and performed flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Potentially relevant specs:&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSI GE70</p>
<p>3.2 GHz Intel Core i7</p>
<p>12 GB DDR3L SDRAM</p>
<p>NVIDIA Geforce GTX860M</p>
<p>1024 HDD 7200rpm</p>

<p>
</p><p>My wife that had her account running for years recently got a windows 10 uptade on her laptop, ever since, she can't use Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When she wants to log in, she's asked for parental autorisation, cause for some reason, your update decided she was 4 y/o now ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to give her this access, your site just won't work and bug before delivering the autorisation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>xxx</p>
<p>
</p><p>And finally, when we try to create a brand new account, the service does not work ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was already bothered by your continual attempts to force us to use microsoft accounts to use skype instead of our regular email adresses or skype login, but this has reached a point where the only rational thing to do is to move on another platform.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>The reason&nbsp;why Skype accounts are being updated to Microsoft accounts is because&nbsp;we want to focus on&nbsp;allowing you to login-in with a single sign-in across Microsoft services with just one password.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft requires users to provide their date of birth</span><em> in compliance
</em><span>with applicable laws and regulations to protect children's online security. Users will get this error when users input an incorrect birthdate or is not in the right age to use Skype.
<span>And this interrupting message will keep on appearing until you verified you're an adult.</span><span>
<span>One of the commonly used methods, which is <em>approved </em>
under regulation, is to charge a small nonrefundable fee to a credit or debit card. However, if you don't have or can't use a credit or debit card, you can send us proof of age to validate you're an adult. See

<p>Sir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can censor everything you want, you still do not adress any of the issues I have with Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, why do I get an error message when I want to allow my wife (since for your system I'm her father ...) "<span>TraceId: X+IUrxjLbkSNmcia.3.41.28".</span></p>
<p>Since the other solution of creating another Skype account (which was not available last time I tried as I said and as neither you or your other moderator collegue answered why), now requires
 my cell phone number to be provided, and which is not acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is using GDPR as an excuse to do exactly what GDPR is aimed at, collecting data they don't need, cause you would be shutting down Skype tomorrow if everyone had to give you their ID or cell phone number to keep on using it. Since existing user
 can use Skype without providing that kind of information, there is no point in forcing new users to do so.</p>
<p>I don't need Microsoft to exercice my parental control, thank you for your concern ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is exactly why I don't and will never own an Apple product. Freedom. I don't want to be forced to give away my personnal datas, nor to be forced to use specific programs to acess my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for you to understand the extent of the issue here, I was considering buying a brand new Surface Pro as personnal and professional laptop. I am now reconsidering since I see that Microsoft is going down the wrong path.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 microphone low volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martynasm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 microphone low volume</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking through the internet and all the community messages I came up with the idea, that the problem is with the driver compatibility. I have also noticed that for some reasons integrated microphone is set to be recognized as a headset microphone
 (Came up with this since it seem to work like one). What I mean with this is that when I am speaking 5 centimetres from microphone people can hear me as before in win8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking that the problem remained in the drivers so I went to Device Manager and under sound, video section updated my Realtek HD Audio Manager, it updated, but did not solved my issue. Did a rollback issue remained. (was one of the solutions I found
 on the internet for previous win versions)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In speech recognition to set up the microphone it seems to hear me perfectly, no matter what distance it still performs the same. Tried multiple solutions of set up - all 3 possibilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my recording devices section under right click on my volume icon in taskbar, it gives me the same performance as I mentioned in skype, If lets say I clap half a meter away from microphone it will only go up by 1 bar, but if I clap right in front of microphone
 it will go full green. Was messing around with recording devices levels and decibel levels, going from 10 to 20 slightly increases the volume. Messing around with enchantments also gave nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling device and deleting drivers and installing the latest ones also did not lead me any further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume it is all based on driver compatibility, since I cannot find any solution anywhere yet and it starts to come out on other hardware as well. Invidia update is available, Invidia states it is compatible with win10, but when I press install after a
 while it will give me error saying that it is not compatible with my system. Doing a roll back option it will give me the same error, so now I am stuck at the current version that was lastly installed on win8.1 platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time is the key now.&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            <p>Well for the settings, just go to search and type: Manage Audio Devices</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still desperate for the solution. I tried the compatibility mode with the latest driver installation, but it seems that compatibility mode does not recognize windows 10 platform, I am sure it should be able to do
 that if it would be properly compatible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting more and more confident that it is a driver issue, since I have tried everything by now and it does seem that moderators don't follow this issue even though more and more people face this incompatibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar problem was occurring all the time when migrating between new OS.&nbsp;<span>XP to WIN7,&nbsp;</span><span>WIN7 to WIN8,&nbsp;</span><span>I noticed people
 were facing this issue and it was all due to Realtek Drivers that had to be updated. Can mods confirm any of my theories, that it is the same as in previous builds, or we will further on will have to fight wind mills till one day it will be sorted out?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Really frustrating when someone calls me via Skype to jump on my Lumia.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem on my XPS 15. On the skype forum a solution was posted yesterday by techfreak which has worked for me. It involves replacing the realtec driver in 'sound video and game controllers', with microoft's generic driver. To do that you search
 for the update on your computer and then select the high definition audio device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The post is here:&nbsp;http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-desktop-client/Help-Windows-10-Microphone-not-working/m-p/4077140#M361141</p>

<p>Never though about this solution, I was thinking it will be updating same as online search, but it did the opposite installing the default ones.</p>

            <p>I had the same issue but, one of the replies/suggestions put me on the right track.</p>
<p>1) click on [sound] (in the control panel)</p>
<p>2) Manage Audio Devices</p>
<p>3) Click [Recording] Tab</p>
<p>4) right click on the default microphone</p>
<p>5) Click on [Properties ] button</p>
<p>6) Click on [levels] Tab</p>
<p>7) Adjust microphone level to 80</p>
<p>8) Adjust microphone boost to +20 dB</p>
<p>
</p><p>watch the level indicator meter thing to make sure your background when you are not talking is 1 bar or less.</p>
<p>If it is higher you may have to play with the 2 adjustments so your background noise doesn't drown you out.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

            <p>This is a different issue for different drivers I think. For people who use Realtek HD Audio Driver my solution is the answer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have tried your method long time ago. To clear things out I managed to find a solution. your suggested method helped nothing so as many other suggestions found on internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to begin with these were the steps I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Start &gt; Device Manager<br />
2 Sound, Video and Game Controllers &gt; Realtek High Definition Audio&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 Right Click &gt; Update Driver Software...</p>
<p>4 Browse My Computer for Driver Software...</p>
<p>5 Next window choose "Let me pick from a list of device ..."</p>
<p>6 In a new window choose driver which has no numbers on it (generic driver) NOTE: A pop up notification will appear saying that it may damage your performance, click OK.</p>
<p>7 After installation click finish/close NOTE: DO NOT RESTART PC YET! Press "No"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that every time when you reboot PC it reinstalls the "better" fitting drivers to your PC so in this case it will only work once till your next reboot when performance of your mic will get messed up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8 Close the Device Manager</p>
<p>9 Start &gt; type "change device installation settings"</p>
<p>10 Choose "No, let me choose what to do" and "Never install driver software from &nbsp;windows update" this will prevent the roll back of Realtek driver to the broken one.</p>
<p>11 Adjust microphone settings to your needs and you are good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, for me the last 3 steps are unneeded since Windows Update provide me with wrong drivers ex: Toshiba touchpad driver when my PC is Asus and they release compatible drivers. So in this case I prefer to update them manually rather
 than by Windows Update, for others it might be more important so once a compatible driver is released revert last 3 steps to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Yes do this automatically (Recommended)" and you will be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this solves everyones headache and this post can now be marked as [Answered] since I got my solution, cheers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Martynas.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am having the same situation with my Dell since the upgrade. I found out about the problem trying to utilize my webcam to make a video. No audio. I went through all of the driver updates, and spent about 2 hours with Dell Customer service dialed&nbsp;in to
 try to fix it with no results. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand enough about this to start playing around with drivers. I am very frustrated, as Dell's solution is to send my computer in for service, but I am believing that this is a windows issue and not a hardware issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a layman's solution to this that will make sense to the average user???</p>

<p>Hi, you never know what your avatar is doing while you sleep but I doubt it's trying to kill you, maybe it feels lonely and wants a cuddle, Could you try powering the console off and remove the power cable from the console, press the power button several
 times. Reconnect the power cable and see if the issue persists please, also try giving the power and eject buttons a good clean with a soft dry cloth.</p>

At this point it sounds like your console could use some love.<strong> I would suggest setting up an&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 Repair</a>.&nbsp;</strong><br />

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Type Cover Stopped Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jml_tlh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Type Cover Stopped Working</h2>
                    <p>The type cover on my Surface Pro 4 suddenly stopped working. &nbsp;There are several similar issues on this forum, but none quite fit what I am experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried cleaning the contacts, doing the 2-button reset, using system refresh, and finally I "restored" windows from a USB drive. &nbsp;And then it worked again! Until the next day, when the type cover no longer worked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I tried 2-button reset again, didn't help.&nbsp; I did a little more research, looked at the device manager and noticed only the HID keyboard driver showed up. &nbsp;I saw online that upgrading Windows 10 to version 1703 seemed to fix things for some folks experiencing
 this issue, so I tried that, and it worked again! Until the next day. &nbsp;I tried 2-button reset again, didn't help. So I tried downloading the latest firmware and drivers from Microsoft; no help. I ran the SFC utility, it didn't find any issues. &nbsp;I created a
 new USB restore drive, and restored from it, but that didn't help this time! &nbsp;I have not tried restoring from my "old" USB restore drive, because I think that may be a temporary fix, but wouldn't help permanently. I have taken the type cover off and &nbsp;put it
 back on, giggled it like crazy, etc, but I really don't think this is a hardware problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as a final step, I am going to re-image my machine. &nbsp;In the meantime, any suggestions? &nbsp;I'd be willing to buy a new type cover if I thought it would help (my type cover is a #QC7-00001). I'm tired of spending 3 hours a day trying to get my keyboard to
 work!</p>

<p>Ruth,</p>
<p>My contact gave me the following for you to try (this is only for non US typecovers for&nbsp; SP4). Please let me know if you try these and results either way:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Workaround #1</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Power+volume up to boot into UEFI settings.</span></li><li>
<span>Choose Devices.</span></li><li>
<span>Toggle Type Cover Port&nbsp;off and&nbsp;then on.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Workaround #2</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Check Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard and ensure that Filter Keys is disabled.</span></li><li>
<span>Check BIOS and make sure Type Cover is enabled in Devices.</span></li><li>
<span>In Device Manager, click on the View menu &gt; Show Hidden.</span></li><li>
<span>Under HID (Human Interface Devices), scroll down and find Surface Pro 4 Typecover Integration &gt; right-click - Uninstall. (chose option to delete driver/software.)</span></li><li>
<span>In Device Manager, under Keyboard, if you do not see the type cover, no need to do anything else. I;&nbsp;if you do see it, right-click, uninstall (check to remove software).</span></li><li>
<span>Shut down (hold shift for a clean shutdown).</span></li><li>
<span>Hold power and volume up&nbsp;for 30 seconds. The device will flash to EFI and back until it eventually powers off fully.</span></li><li>
<span>Power on the device. Now the keyboard should work, and all the drivers should be re-installed that we removed earlier.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            How to recover my music library stored on my computer.</h2>
                    Most of my Windows Media Player Music Library is missing, is there a way to recover these files?

            I notice you have posted in the XP section - is that correct? XP is no longer supported so you may need someone who still has access to WMP in XP to answer your Q - but the key point here is that none of your music files are stored in WMP -&nbsp;the library
 'reads' the files from their original location. So - if the missing items are still in the music folder on your PC - yes, you can restore them to WMP. If the original music files are&nbsp;gone you would need to try recovering them using a media recovery tool (Google
 the free version of 'Recuva' there may be a version available for XP). Get back if you need more detail.... R.
