<h2>            Microsoft Office 2010 Product Key Problems</h2>
                    <p>My computer was running Windows 8.1 but suddenly crashed. I was able to refresh the operating system and get most of my files back. I had Microsoft Office 2010 on it for years but now its missing. Tried to reinstall it but when it goes to activate it says
 the product key is invalid. It was ok when it asked for it to reinstall?</p>
<p>How do I re-activate the software if it says the product key is no longer valid?</p>

    <title>Starting over due to certain OCD issues one might have - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Starting over due to certain OCD issues one might have</h2>
                    
<p>This isn't a QQ post at all, I am truly curious as to who may have restarted due to a quest being glitched in the game (or multiple quests) and your OCD for perfect completion kicked in?</p>
<p>I myself have restarted about 5 times now.&nbsp; Seems everytime I get in my 30's or 40's I come across a quest I can't complete where reloading previous saves or turning off the console then turning it back on didn't fix it.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I am enjoying the crap out of this game.&nbsp; The fun factor far outweighs the negatives.&nbsp; I don't mind restarting.&nbsp; Although I have yet to complete anything in the main questline past retrieving the horn for the Greybeards.&nbsp; I explore alot
 and do a ton of sidequests.</p>
<p>One thing it has done for me though is let me figure out what type of character I enjoy.&nbsp; I learned I dislike how destruction is in this game, one hand and shield is fun but easy mode once you hit Daedric items (without enchants btw, I never level enchanting
 or alchemy on any playthrough).&nbsp; I enjoyed it but on Master difficulty it became boring to me quick.&nbsp; I thoroughly enjoy dual wielding, have yet to do two hand and really love my Rogue character.&nbsp; Restarted the Rogue twice before I fell in love with my Dark
 Elf.&nbsp; I have a thing about my character looking just right &gt;.&lt;&nbsp; I'm planning on doing a 1h and shield conjuration type character for my 6th run and I PRAY I can finally stick to one character.</p>
<p>Back on topic though, has anyone else restarted for some reason?&nbsp; I know there are tons of OCD people out there like myself who just has to have something perfect about their playthrough :D</p>

<p>LOL.....I feel your pain...LOl</p>
<p>seriously, I have the same feelings....although I have been able to restrict myself to just 3 re-starts, each time putting about 30 minutes into character creation....</p>
<p>this last one I created I believe will be the one to finish the game....</p>

<p>I've restarted twice. &nbsp;The first time I had 60 hours in. &nbsp;The second time I had 80 hours. &nbsp;For me, it seems like it's always about finding the perfect mix of skills for my tastes. &nbsp;My second character was a Thief/Assassin, but at some point I realized that
 most of those points I'd put into Pickpocket weren't going to do me a lot of good against really important, high level enemies. &nbsp;It's fine for stripping the weapons away from a bandit marauder, but what good is it against a lich? &nbsp;So I tried the "pure" mage,
 with high levels of Illusion, Conjure, and Alteration. &nbsp;Once I had maxed out a lot of those, I left myself room for a few sneak and archery perks as I continue to play...these were the ones I really liked, and I don't feel like I've wasted anything. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't think there's anything unusual about restarting and getting your character the way you want it.&nbsp; It's a long, deep, complex game, and there's sure to be a bunch of DLC to play later.&nbsp; You definitely want something you're comfortable with.&nbsp; And like
 you said, the fun factor outweighs everything else.&nbsp; I've never been bored doing a quest twice, especially with characters that are different from each other.</p>

<p>I think I may have restarted the most times here and for the smallest and dumbest reasons.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I think tottal I have about 10 or 12 restarts, with &nbsp;each of those getting to at least lvl 10 some were in their 20's when I restarted.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>But now I have 3 characters I have stuck with. 1 I don't play since he is too powerful. The other 2 are awesome since they deal a lot of damage but I built them to have some sort of weakness.</p>

<h3> gogo spasic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t open JPEG photos and mp4 videos in camera roll folder neither mp3 files.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I don't know what has happened, but suddenly I was not able to open any of my photos (JPEG) and any of my videos which were in C partition (My documents in any folder) and in camera roll folder downloads...etc.... also my mp3 files got damaged and wont open,
 even though the size of all files are original. when I try to open them with windows media player the wont open, but when I open them in winamp songs start playing from the middle of the song and wont show the duration of the song.I tried everything but nothing
 seems to work. I transfer all of the corrupted files on my external drive and re-formatted my drive but after installing the new windows, it didn't work again. It's strange, because in the same folder JPEG photos cant be opened but the PNG photos work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post printscreen links and try to show you everything I got. Please please help me with this, because I had very important files, especially videos which were new ideas for my own songs, Id be the most happy if you help me to open them. Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here we are:</p>
<p>I have corrupted or damaged files on my external drive and in the WindowsOld folder but I cant open them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one of my folder where PNG files are good, but JPEG dont work, please take a look&nbsp;http://prntscr.com/5sf6nv</p>
<p>This is what I get when I try to open the photos&nbsp;http://prntscr.com/5sf7a8 (even though I try any of the others viewers to open, it wont work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I get when I try to open a video&nbsp;http://prntscr.com/5sf8kg</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I get when I try to open my mp3 files.&nbsp;http://prntscr.com/5sf96b but when I put it in winamp It works but from the middle of the song&nbsp;http://prntscr.com/5sf9r6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only my mp3 files folder saved before this happened, but unfortunately I didnt do the backup of the photos and videos. Its frustrating because I dont know what caused this, I'm afraid it might happen again. Maybe it has something to do with ZUNE software,
 I have windows phone and maybe the synchronization damaged this. Everything worked fine I dont know when and how it stopped working</p>
<p>....Please give your best and try to help me! Greetings from Macedonia</p>

</p><p>I would like to inform that you may not be able to recover the data as you copied/backed up the corrupted data. If you would have taken backup of data when it was working fine (when you were able to open all files in the C: partition) then we would have
 tried to restore data without any issues but the data here&nbsp;is corrupted now. The data corruption would have occurred due to Virus infection.</p>

            <p>Yes, as long as you have install media for the corresponding 64 bit version of Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

</p><p><strong>If you don't have 64 bit install media, see the following:</strong></p>
<p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>

<h2>            I have the right GPU to record with Game DVR, but I still can&#39;t record with game DVR.</h2>
                    <p>(While I was writing this question, I got a link from a person that has the same question. Read that first: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/games_windows_10/xbox-app-dvr-is-really-strange/19c7946b-f0e6-4611-b314-7bf6688c00c4 )</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I want to record gameplay but it says that I'm unable to record because&nbsp;it says that I&nbsp;don't have the right GPU for that.</p>
<p>My GPU is an AMD Radeon R7 240 (and yes the Radeon R7 is listed at one of the GPU's u need to have to record with Game DVR). I'm not 100 percent&nbsp;sure about that, but I'm a quintillion percent sure that I have an AMD Radeon R7 240 with 2GB of DDR3 RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So&nbsp;I followed the instructions what Harshavardhan Rathod (a support engineer) said in the post I gave you the link at the beginning of this post. And the problem is still there. I really don't know what to do. Can someone help me?!</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for your drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<h2>            DPC Watchdog Violation when scanning computer using Avast or Malwarebytes, browsing internet. and when computer is idle</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having problems figuring out whats causing multiple DPC Watchdog Violations.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres what I've observed so far:</p>
<p>1) I can boot normally without any problems. I can go to Safeboot but Safeboot with Network disables internet usage.</p>
<p>2) If I'm browsing the internet using Google Chrome, the error can occur within minutes or hours after I opened the program.</p>
<p>3) Malwarebytes can run normally but after 2 hours of scanning, I can either get the error or the computer becomes unresponsive and I have to perform a manual restart. No DPC error message.</p>
<p>4) The same thing happens with Avast but I noticed if I use Smart Scan the computer freezes either at 6% or 7% and the error message appears.</p>
<p>5) If the computer is left idle, in at least 3 hours, the computer will get the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been reading up on solutions posted in other forums and none of them have worked for me. Here are some of the solutions that I've tried so far (I may have forgotten some of the other things I did:</p>
<p>1) Disabling Fast Startup</p>
<p>2) I've used Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool and it never indicated any problems with the RAM sticks.</p>
<p>3) Used sfc /scannow multiple times. There was one occasion where it fixed a problem, I think it was Command Prompt related. But the error still happens.</p>
<p>4) Uninstalled Malwarebytes, Avast, and multiple programs that I don't frequently use.</p>
<p>5) Used chkdsk and Error Checking. No problems were detected.</p>
<p>6) Updated windows as soon as they were available.</p>
<p>7) Updated multiple drivers for the ethernet controller (Killer Ethernet), wireless adapter (DWA 125), and sound controller (Realtek).</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the specs of my computer:</p>
<p>OS Name - Microsoft Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Version - 10.0.10586 Build 10586</p>
<p>System Type - x64-based PC</p>
<p>Processor - AMD FX 8320 8-core processor, Bios P1.6</p>
<p>Motherboard -&nbsp;Fatal1ty 990FX Killer</p>
<p>Memory - 8GB XPG Adata</p>
<p>Storage - 1.5TB Western Digital Green</p>
<p>Graphics Card - MSI R9 270x</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the latest dmp file:</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhwjHHB8KKS1aJefj2q07awEdr8</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are running both Avast and Malwarebytes Pro that is a must not do. Uninstall one.<br />
Frankly I would uninstall both and use Windows Defender which in Window 10 is a full<br />
antivirus. (See TDSSKiller.exe note below first.)<br />
<br />
Uninstall and run their removal tools.<br />

<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff545448%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff545448%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</span></a>
<p><br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable</p>
<p><br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If Driver Verifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we <br />
can analyze it. </p>

<h2>            My computer isn&#39;t detecting my second monitor</h2>
                    <p>Both monitors are plugged into my computer. The main one uses a DV-I input and the secondary one uses a VGA input. Not only will the secondary monitor not display anything, but my computer isn't detecting it at all. How can I fix this?</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In regards to your concern, please help me with the following questions:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the build version of Windows 10 installed on the computer? (Type
<strong>Winver</strong> in <strong>Run</strong> command)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you tried to connect the second display monitor on a different computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are few things which are responsible for the external monitor display issue with the computer.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>路<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Cable connection is not correct or corrupted cables.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>路<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can try the following steps and check if that helps:</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1: Check the cable connection as any loose connection may cause the external monitor with display issue or not get detected on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: Update Display drivers using device manager as well as from the manufacturers website.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article:

<p style="margin-left: 39pt"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<strong>msinfo32</strong> in Windows search bar and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 39pt"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Look for BIOS version/date section and check the version and installed date.</span></p>

<p>The computer is a Lenovo Erazer X315. The version of Windows 10 is Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.648). I have not tried to connect the second monitor to another computer. I'll try that later.</p>
<p>I'm nearly certain that the cable connection is good. As for updating drivers, what drivers would I update? The computer doesn't show any drivers for the second monitor.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Mehul,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern, disabling other services is just&nbsp;to make sure if any other programs are causing the issue. It helps in identifying the cause of the issue.

<h2>            defrag Windows 10 ssd - &#34;gone&#34;</h2>
                    <p>when I click the Defragment and Optimize Drives after typing in "defrag" in the windows 10 search window, nothing happens.&nbsp; nothing.&nbsp; And even bringing this up see image below, and clicking "Optimize" nothing happens.&nbsp; In the past, a few days ago, a dialog
 box opened giving me some options.&nbsp; now the "Analyze" function isn't even available.&nbsp; WHAT HAPPENED!?</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>NOW WHEN I CLICK ON WHAT I'M POINTING TO IN THE PICTURE BELOW OR WHEN I CLICK ON OPTIMIZE WHILE WITHIN "FILE EXPLORER" NOTHING HAPPENS.&nbsp; Am I making myself clear?&nbsp; Before I could choose to optimize and trim at will, now I can not as nothing happens when
 I click.&nbsp; GET IT?! &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. I understand that you're having issues on running Photo Gallery as you're receiving the error message "WLXPhotoGallery.exe Entry Point Not Found". I will assist you on your inquiry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate that you've mentioned the troubleshooting steps that you've made to rectify the issue. Because of this,
<span><font color="#000000">please uninstall your Windows Essentials using a CMD (command) line parameter. Note that this is different from the regular process of uninstalling a program as this process
 deletes all sub folders on your system resetting every set up you made to default. To do this, please follow the instructions on the link below:</font></span></p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back. I would like to clarify if your statement "went off line" means that you disable your internet connection and proceed downloading the offline installer. As for the error you received, this normally happens if you are installing a
 version of Windows Essentials lower than the one installed in your computer. What I can suggest is to follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>1. </font></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-uninstall-ui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Uninstall</font></span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>
 Windows Essentials.</font></span></p>
<p>2. Delete the Windows Live folders (if any) found on the following directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>C:\Program Files\Windows Live</div>
</li><li>
<div>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Windows Live</div>
</li></ul>
<p>3. Disable third-party firewall installed. (Enable after installing.)</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>4. Install Windows Essentials using this
</font></span><a href="http://g.live.com/1rewlive5-all/en/wlsetup-all.exe??WLXID=42b04cc6-d3fa-43ee-a647-b3c50c84402b&amp;RID=02cd1a881a6&amp;TID=1369500548294&amp;lid=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>installer</font></span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>.</font></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our support specialist needs you to do a clean uninstallatio of the program first. To do this, please follow the steps within this
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-uninstall-ui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Do not install the program yet. Run FixIt tool for the installation issues

<p>Also, please run <strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SFC</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Afterwards, reinstall Essentials using an offline installer. The offline installer differs from the regular installer that constantly uses internet connection which can
 be halted by the computer's firewall or other third party software. The procedures and where to download the installer is on the link below:</font></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Recovery Disk Failure to complete &#34;Reset this PC&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevebuchanan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Recovery Disk Failure to complete &#34;Reset this PC&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I upgraded my Lenovo laptop from Windows 7 home to windows 10 home. The upgrade finished successfully, so I created a recovery disk. I&nbsp;then booted off the recovery disk with the intentions to reset this pc to factory settings. I ran the "Reset
 this PC" utility --&gt; Remove everything. This ran for about 45 minutes.. It got to around 98% complete and failed. I then went into "Advanced Options" and ran the Startup Repair, and re-ran the "Reset this PC" utility. This failed again. I then looked into
 it further and&nbsp;ran&nbsp;the following from a command prompt:</p>
<p>bootrec /fixmb</p>
<p>bootrec /fixboot</p>
<p>bootrec /rebuildbcd</p>
<p>bootrec /scanos</p>
<p>(There was one OS listed)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After attempting to boot my laptop, and waiting on a black screen for an hour, I attempted to "Reset this PC" again. This failed again. So I ran the "Startup Repair" and this&nbsp;failed (Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I run Reset this PC - Keep everything I get the&nbsp;following: The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also getting: Required drive partition is missing..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the bootrec /scanos yields 0 OSs, and when I boot "no operating system found" the files are still there. So I am confused on whats going on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Steve </p>

<h2>            Problem with 4500MHD to read Sony .mts files</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded a PC to Windows 10. It works quite well, except for reading some videos that I recorded with a SONY CX550 cam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the files are OK, but some are just messed up : the video is displayed in 2 seconds (it should be around 60 s) and the numbers indicating the length and the position in the video are messed up : it shoes a startind time that is non zero, and a finishing
 time that is zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had problems before with these videos on this PC, and this video is OK on another PC (more recent one) with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The graphics driver is Integrated VGA Engine in GM45 Chipset (Intel GMA X4500MHD) and the main specs are the following :</p>

            <p>Thanks for the help !</p>
<p>
</p><p>The player I am using is the "default" Windows 10 player; This is what I get :</p>

<p>
</p><p>Notice that the time is not correct : the length of the video is 1min and 10s !</p>
<p>
</p><p>The exact same files is displayed OK on another PC running Windows 10 (also a more recent PC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Windows update. No success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video driver is the lastest available (no driver provided by Intel anymore) :
</p>
<p>Mobile Intel 4 series Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to install the driver in Compatibility mode and let you know.</p>

            <p>Hi Francois,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to update the video driver from the device manager and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and select <strong>device manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand display adapter and right click on installed driver and click on Uninstall.</li></ul>
<p>Restart the computer and check if Windows automatically installs the required driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some more information (quite weird! ):</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the computer with a different display, with a DVI cable, and no speaker connected.</p>
<p>The video is displayed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I connect a cable to the green soudn connector, the computer "sees" that is has been connected and the video is NOT displayed OK (Realtek chipset integrated on .</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use a HDMI video connection to the monitor (which adds an Intel sound device in device manager), then the video is NOT displayed OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the probleme is somehow related to the management of the sound</p>
<p>The audio hardware is the following :</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">Audio</td>
<td>Type</td>
<td>Realtek ALC888 HD Audio CODEC on-board</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Channel</td>
<td>7.1 Channel</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep investigating.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some features that were available in previous operating systems have been improved in the Windows 10 interface. Please provide answers to the questions below so we can determine why you are facing difficulties in adding or setting themes in Windows 10:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you attempt to change the theme on your computer?</li><li>Do you get any errors when applying themes the usual way?</li><li>How long have you been using Windows 10?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can choose your theme for Windows 10 by opening <strong>Personalization</strong>. Follow these steps to check the suggestion yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on an empty space on your desktop.</li><li>Choose <strong>Personalize</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Themes</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Theme settings</strong>.</li><li>Choose what theme you like to set.</li></ol>
<p>

<p>Go to Settings&gt;Personalization&gt;Themes.&nbsp; There's a link there to go to the Store to see a bunch of spectacular slideshow themes.&nbsp; See them here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/themes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Themes - Microsoft Windows</a> .&nbsp; You can download them, open and they will install there in the Themes list for you to switch between.&nbsp; Just make sure the Screensaver in Lock Screen settings stays
 set to None because there's an annoying bug in some that set it to timeout after one minute to Blank or Bubbles.&nbsp;

<p>

    <title>Vista Service Pack 2 conflicts with ESET Smart Security 4.0 and ESET - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken -  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista Service Pack 2 conflicts with ESET Smart Security 4.0 and ESET NOD32 Antivirus 4.0</h2>
                    
<p>Info below was taken from the ESET Knowledgebase<br />
<br />
We have received reports that, in some instances, Service Pack 2 for Microsoft Windows Vista and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 conflicts with ESET Smart Security 4.0 and ESET NOD32 Antivirus 4.0. The conflict results in the real-time file system protection
 in both programs and the Personal firewall in ESET Smart Security being disabled when the computer starts. When this occurs, the ESET icon next to the system clock turns red, notifying users that maximum protection is not ensured.</p>
<p>If your computer is currently experiencing this error, please <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;id=SOLN2254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here</a> for a list of workarounds.</p>
<p>A fix for affected systems is currently in development and will be released as soon as it has been thoroughly tested.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">FAQ<br />
<br />
</span>
<p><strong>Which ESET security products are affected?</strong><br />
All 4.x builds of ESET Smart Security and ESET NOD32 Antivirus are affected. ESET Smart Security 3.0, ESET NOD32 Antivirus 3.0 and ESET NOD32 Antivirus 2.7 are not affected.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When will a fix for ESET Smart Security 4.0 and ESET NOD32 Antivirus 4.0 be available?</strong><br />
Since this issue potentially affects all customers using version 4.0 of ESET security products with Microsoft Windows Vista and Microsoft Windows Server 2008, the fix for it must be thoroughly tested to ensure the issue has been resolved. We expect to release
 it soon, but cannot provide a specific date at this time.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How will the fix be delivered?</strong><br />
The current plan is to provide the fix via normal update channels, which means it will be downloaded and installed automatically by all copies of ESET Smart Security 4.0 and ESET NOD32 Antivirus 4.0, without any need for a computer restart or user intervention.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Which operating systems are affected?</strong><br />
Microsoft Windows Vista and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 with Service Pack 2 are affected. RTM and SP1 versions of these operating systems are not affected. Microsoft Windows 2000 and Microsoft Windows XP are not affected.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why is it taking so long for a fix to be made available?</strong><br />
Low-level changes made to the Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 operating system kernel by Service Pack 2 introduced an incompatibility with how the internal modules of ESET Smart Security/ESET NOD32 Antivirus 4.0 interface with the operating system when
 the computer starts. Because the issue does not occur in a consistent fashion, it was difficult for ESET's test engineers and developers to reproduce the issue and then identify the underlying cause. As soon as it was identified, ESET began developing a fix.<br />

            Hi, RedEnderGamer14
<br />
<br />Follow these steps, they are to repair any problems with your applications, I hope you can solve the problem.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />
<br />Sfc / Scannow
<br />
<br />DISM.exe / Online / Cleanup-image / Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe / Online / Cleanup-image / Restorehealth
<br />
<br />The execution of these processes may be delayed, do not forget to restart the computer to apply changes.
<br />
<br />If it works, follow these others.
<br />
<br />Any corrupt DLL files are best performed using built in utilities or using a repair upgrade method: 
<br />

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that the components of the update was not completely loaded. Is "update for windows 10 Version 1703"&nbsp;failed to update the exact error message you received? In the meantime, I suggest that you download our
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooter</a></strong> as your workaround. After the troubleshooter&nbsp;is done, try running the Windows Update
 again and install any available updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

                    <p>Is anybody else having trouble with adjusting screen time limits for their children on their account?</p>
<p>When I try to adjust the screen time for my child it DOESN'T ACTUALLY CHANGE and my child is still locked out from his Windows user login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried switching the restrictions slider to 'OFF' but even then the changes are not applied and my child is still locked out from his Windows user login as if restrictions are 'ON', but they are not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been like this for about a month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this problem, adjusting screen time and restrictions happened almost instantly now it doesn't happen at all.</p>
<p>Anybody else affected?</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying to my question.</p>
<p>Unfortunately your suggestions DID NOT resolve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's exactly what I did and what I saw onscreen. Read carefully, I hope I explained it in length and accuracy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I clicked on your link in your post to 'FAQ's about family safety' and read all the guides. Interesting read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried Method 1 as you suggested. I clicked on the link in your post on my PC and it started up the family safety troubleshooter. The troubleshooter then said it WOULD NOT RUN on my version of Windows! Doh!
</p>
<p>I am running Windows 10.</p>
<p>(Microsoft has to work on that!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried method 2 as you suggested. I logged into Windows, used Microsoft Edge to sign into my Microsoft Account, went to 'Family' page, clicked on 'Screen time' next to my child's name.
</p>
<p>The screen time 'Set limits for when my child can use devices' Slider was set to 'OFF'. 'Applies to Windows 10 PC's'.</p>
<p>All the 'Choose the times' boxes next to the whole week were grey. I couldn't edit them which is fine because the slider is 'OFF'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the slider to turn it 'ON'. The time choosing boxes went white and could be changed by the arrow drop downs. I chose 10:30PM as the log child out time and unlimited as the daily max hours allowed for all days of the week.</p>
<p>I refreshed the screen and the 'ON' and times settings remained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the slider again to turn it 'OFF'.</p>
<p>I refreshed the screen and the 'OFF' setting remained. I then signed out of my Microsoft account and closed Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted my computer,</p>
<p>then I then switched user on my PC to my child's account and he couldn't log into Windows! A pop up message said:</p>
<p>'You have exceeded your screen time limit! Come back at 5:22PM on 30/03/16'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the SAME ERROR I was trying to find an answer to in the first place! Why would Windows not let my child log in when I have set his screen time restrictions to 'OFF'?</p>
<p>and Why 5:22PM? It's a strange time?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past I had set his log out time as 10:30PM on school nights.</p>
<p>In the past, when I had adjusted screen times, the changes reflected almost immediately and showed the log out time on the Windows PC notification bar (bottom right corner of screen, near the battery indicator, time and date, sound and network status).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted my PC a number of times, </p>
<p>logged in and out of Windows a few times (my log in works, my child's keeps saying 'come back at 5:22PM)&nbsp;</p>
<p>and also logged out and in AND refreshed the Microsoft account page to make sure it says screen time restrictions are 'OFF' which it does and I still my child can't log in to Windows?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY? and what can I do? &nbsp;My child is frustrated he can't log into the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody else have the same problem?</p>
<p>Can anybody help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replies very welcome!</p>

            <p>I couldn't get many answers from the Microsoft Community forums on why my problem was occurring. I guess there's not many people answering questions at the moment or nobody knows WHY my screen time limit changes were not working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Shubham for offering your suggestions. I did try them but they didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I resorted to removing my child from my account and then adding him back again. I had to confirm the 'removal' and then the 'adding' through his email account which I have access to because he is still a minor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have my child's computer use monitored and safe again and his screen time limits within negotiated boundaries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would still like to find out why the problem of "changes to screen time limits not taking effect" occurred in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anybody knows, please reply.</p>
