<h2>            Audio Problems - Recording &#47;w programs such as Fraps, Action&#33;, and ShadowPlay etc.</h2>
                    <p>First and foremost, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am honestly not the best when it comes to things like this but I'll do my best to respond as soon as possible for any questions needed to help me resolve this problem. That being stated is - I have a particularly odd problem where my audio works just fine,
 I can hear it when I play games or music however, no recording devices such as Action!, Fraps, or even ShadowPlay, picks up audio. At first I thought it was just the programs having problems but I can't for some reason record audio at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried figuring it out myself at first and checking online but I've yet to have good results. I'll use ShadowPlay as my main example for what I found. When I have something else set as my main audio device i.e. my television being where the sound comes
 from, it'll work&nbsp; and record audio - only if my laptop has been restart. If I switch it to my laptop being the main audio device, it'll stop recording the audio and if I attempt to switch it back, it still will no longer work still.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've yet to test whether or not keeping my laptop as the main audio device and restarting will make it work again and actually record the audio. I have sent Nvidia a ticket as well about my problem to see if it's just on their side though I doubt it is if
 I'm facing this all across the board with all my programs. My other laptop however, works completely fine but this new laptop is the only one having the audio problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this been a problem in the past and if so, is there a way to fix this? Thank you very much sincerely in advance.</p>

            <p>Update: I have this issue now resolved.<br />
<br />
Apparently, one of ASUS pre-installed programs was the root cause. I have a G752VL. Uninstalling these two programs for the most part solved my issue:<br />

    <title>locked out - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            locked out</h2>
                    I Just purchased an all in one Dell with windows 10 that was a display model. The store cleared all the data so we could start fresh, which was fine except they did not tell me the password for the RetailAdmin or the password for the fake name they put
 on the sign in. I had been able to login under the fake name until today when I changed the username and created a new outlook email. When I logged out and then tried to log back in, it won't accept the password I set up. I am prompted to enter my Microsoft
 password. None of the passwords I can remember work. Now I can't get in at all. HELP!

            Hello,

Does it still give you option to log in to RetailAdmin account? If yes, it's still in Retail Mode and you need to disable that mode to use normal accounts. So log in under RetailAdmin and disable retail mode first (part 2 of this guide):

Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.

If that does not work, download, create a bootable copy then perform a direct clean install.

Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10

When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key. 
Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windo

            If you're prompted for a Microsoft Account password then it means you have set it up as a User on the PC, and will need to remember the password to sign in.  

Do you see any other Sign In Options below the password box to select:  PIN, etc.  If you try to put in a failed password, does it give you  hints you set up?  

You said you changed the store's Dummy account to one of your own.   How could you not remember what the account is that you just set up, or whether you used a MS Account which apparently is the case since it wouldn't ask for the password for one otherwise.  

But if you cannot remember the MS Account password which you would have had to insert just today when you said you set up the account, you can go to  https://account.microsoft.com/account?lang=en-gb to change your password, then try the new password until the PC recognizes it.  

You can also sign in with the Hidden Administrator to set up another account and remove the other one:  https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-ena

            Your best option is to clean install Windows 10 on that Dell All-in-One

Click this link:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10
to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file which you can later burn to DVD
 
Then, insert the bootable Installation Media, Start your system, on the Dell logo press F11 to open the Temporary Boot Menu. Choose the Installation media and boot from that . . .

Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers

If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may

            I really don't see how that update can cause the problems you describe as it just puts files in the Windows side by side (WinSxS) folder.
<br />
<br />
Can you confirm by uninstalling that update and then see if the problem goes away.<br />
<br />
I have a suspicion that it's something else.<br />

<p>Hello Spice!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums! I understand that this particular situation can be frustrating to go through. Now, just to clarify, have you already tried to delete the club and if so, is that when it notified you that the club will be deleted
 in seven days? Also, if you haven't deleted the club, I would suggest using these steps to delete the club.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If you want to delete a club you‚Äôve created, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>From Home, scroll to the Community tab and select <strong>Clubs on Xbox</strong>.</li><li>Select the club that you want to delete.</li><li>Scroll to the <strong>Manage</strong> tab.</li><li>In the club settings, go to <strong>Ownership</strong> and select <strong>Delete club</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If you have further questions or concerns do not hesitate to reply back letting us know. Again, thank you for posting on Xbox Forums!&nbsp;</p>

            I completely disabled the useless Windows Media Center by going to control panel, programs, turn windows features on or off, and expand Media Features and uncheck windows media center. &nbsp;this is how I avoided the win+alt+enter shortcut.

    <title>Cannot turn off the on screen keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glvision  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot turn off the on screen keyboard</h2>
                    It sounds like a dumb question but I can't seem to find the solution. When my wireless keyboard has a conflict of any sort and stops working, it's great that I can use my mouse to go to the accessibility options and get the on screen keyboard to use in
 order to re-install the software, re-sync my bluetooth settings or whatever. Once I get it all working again, I am hard pressed to find a way to turn off the on screen keyboard.&nbsp; I cannot find anything in the help index or anywhere for that fact about turning
 it off once you have turned it on. For now, I'm just closing it down after my PC boots each time which is very inconvenient as it seems to add time to the boot sequence as well. What am I missing for something that should be so simple. I can write code but
 I can't turn off a keyboard?

    <title>Problems with mouse pointer, menus, tabs and videos - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with mouse pointer, menus, tabs and videos</h2>
                    <p>Hi, a few days ago I noticed that my computer mouse was flickering all the time, any videos I tried to play just flickered with no volume and when I try to open a new tab in my browser it always opens 2. I cannot log off of facebook properly because the
 options only flick up for a second and then disappear. This also happens with most things where there is a drop menu and I cannot highlight script to copy without doing it several times. I checked all drivers and programs are up to date. I have no plug ins
 or add ons to disable. I think it is some kind of virus, but after exhausting every virus and malware program, none can find it. At my wits end, I reinstalled Windows 10 completely and it is still having the same problems. Many thanks to anyone who can help!</p>

            Thanks Michelle. I just tried a clean boot, but it is still the same. It did come a little better when I reinstalled windows a few days ago, and the problems are half as bad as they were. I can play movies again now and I don't always get two tabs opening
 at once now, it only happens occasionally, also the flickering Mouse has stopped, but the drop menu problem is the same and highlighting is still glitching.&nbsp; Cheers, Kathy.<br />

            I just started it in safe mode. It seems to take away the problem of multiple tabs opening at once. But I still had problems with highlighting and drop menus and the Mouse acting like it's been double clicked, when it has only been pressed once etc. Thanks

            I won't get v.1903 for at least another 2 months, but previous feature updates have taken about 1 hour and 40 minutes to install, measured from the beginning of the download to when I'm back on the desktop, ready to work. And my PC is so old that the user
 guide was drawn in a cave.

<p>I had a Lenovo laptop that I had updated to 1809 via USB stick when 1809 first came out and luckily didn't have any of the issues widely reported with 1809. Yesterday I decided to give 1903 a try. I checked for updates before I did anything and was surprised
 to be notified that there was an update for 1809. I had just done the patch Tuesday updates a few days before. I went ahead and installed the 1809 update before I tried 1903 update. Unfortunately, I did not note the KB number of 1809 update and it is no longer
 listed in my update history after completing the 1903 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing the 1809 update Windows update said I was up to date on 1809 and did not give me the 1903 update that way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the update now button at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That downloaded the Win10 update assistant. Using that it took about 45 minutes to download the 1903 update and It took about another 45 minutes to install it. It then reached the point where it said the computer needed to be restarted. After the restart,
 the screen said it would take a while and the computer would restart several more times. The whole process took another 2 hours. I did finally end up at the lock screen where I could enter my password. I had no issues with signing in and It appeared that everything
 was working properly. I had no issue with missing files or any other problem that has been reported by others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent the next morning (today) checking that my settings had not been changed and confirming that all my programs were still working. I also found that my printers had no problems printing properly. I also had no issue connecting to my network shares on
 my other computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me updating this Lenovo laptop took about 4 hours from the start of the update process to be able to log into it again. I spent about 4 more hours checking that everything appeared to work correctly after the update.</p>

<p>Computer #2: Another Lenovo Laptop (newer than the previous one) but currently running version 1803. I decided to try the off-line upgrade using a USB stick to see if that would work. I had previously made the USB stick using the media creation tool and
 I am not including the time for that in the update time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I had to do was plug in the USB stick and click on the setup.exe file. I did this with no internet connections running to ensure nothing new was downloaded. Everything progressed normally and the computer restarted several times during the install. From
 clicking the setup file to Getting the login screen took about 4 1/2 hours. So just a bit longer than the other Lenovo laptop I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This one also seems to have all the programs still working and none of the settings changed. It also would appear that I have not lost any files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did, however, have quite a bit of trouble with my home networking sharing after this update completed. Everything had been working previous to the update but immediately afterward some of my computers did not show up in the network window. I checked everything
 and it didn't seem that any of my network or sharing settings had changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several restarts of the computers and routers they did show up, but I was unable to open the shares. I would get messages that I did not have permission to access the computers or files and to contact my system administrator. Of course, I am the administrator
 and was logged into the main account that is properly set up as an administrator account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I poked around all day on each of the computers attempting to find a cause but could not find the problem. Eventually, I regained access to each of the computers and all the shares but I did not change any settings on any computers or network routers to
 make things work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear the Windows networking problems continue unabated. Other than that 1903 seems to b working fine on these two computers.</p>

<h2>            How many apps that support the new Timeline feature by now&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I updated to 17074 recently to experience the wonderful new feature----timeline. To my disappointment, it seems that few apps in my computer could support this feature. Specifically, only Edge is shown in my timeline. And obviously, Edge isn't the only app
 I use on my computer. Office 2016 and many UWPs are frequently-used. I saw many apps appearing in timeline from the picture on the official website. That is the timeline I desire, not the one on my computer! So I am wondering if there are any problems with
 my windows 10 or the feature by now is just very "basic"?</p>

<h2>            Skype 8 - How to disable messages coloring&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I've got an update of Skype - my current version is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">8.10.0.4.
</span><span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">And I really don't like the coloring of the chat messages.
</span><span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">They have the blue-purple, orange-red and pink background gradients - and different contacts have different colors in one chat (probably skype shows colors the people selected, not what I selected).
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">I have a poor eyesight. Text
<strong>must</strong> have a good contrast - it's basic rule of my eyes health (and actually of everyone's eyes health).
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">That means: the black text on a light background or white text on a dark background. Same for all messages. No excess coloring.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">But I cannot find a setting to select non-gradient, calm color for all messages in my Skype. How to do that?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">Or rollback to the old version without all that colored stuff is only option?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1&#58; WiFi dropping and&#47;or &#34;Limited&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Since installing 8.1 Pro, I'm having issues with WiFi dropping internet connectivity and always showing "Limited" when clicking on the system tray icon.&nbsp; When I troubleshoot the problem using the&nbsp;system tool it is always the gateway that is&nbsp;faulty.&nbsp; I have
 uninstalled/reinstalled the device drivers several times, installed the newest drivers directly from Intel, restarted the computer, etc.&nbsp; I can&nbsp;restore connectivity by turning&nbsp;WiFi off then back on, but the connection will drop at what seems to be random intervals.&nbsp;
 My applicable system&nbsp;specs are as follows;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Lenovo&nbsp;Y510P&nbsp; Laptop</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>Intel Centrino Wireless-N 2230</p>
<p>Apple Time Capsule router w/newest firmware</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Needless to say this is quite an irritating bug that didn't exist prior to the update to 8.1&nbsp; I hope this can be resolved quickly. Thanks!</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Anannya,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply! I know that my modem/router are working properly as there are several other devices in the house that have not suffered connectivity issues.&nbsp; This problem is unique to my laptop only after updating to 8.1</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Something that did make the disconnects slightly less frequent was to disable any "WiFi Assistants" from Intel running in the background.&nbsp; However, it is still happening occasionally.&nbsp; Prior to installing 8.1, I could count the number of WiFi disconnects
 on one hand over the last several months.&nbsp; After 8.1, it was several an hour.&nbsp; This makes me think there is a software issues.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

 any luck/know of any upcoming patches?&nbsp; Thanks!

            <p>I have the same problem. Did everything. Read the web. Installed 8.1 twice. Now back to factory settings. Have all the latest updates on everything. I too believe it is a hardware issue.
</p>
<p>I own a laptop I bought at BestBuy only 6 months ago. It drops on me after several minutes. I reset my router, called the cable company, called Microsoft and still no fix. Help! I'm not going back to 8.1 until I read there has been fixes. I read tons of
 statements where many are having this same problem and we all have different machines but all having it none the less??????

            Same computer system as the user above however, I cannot connect AT ALL unless I plug straight into the router. Makes having a laptop very inconvenient.&nbsp;

<div>I have reinstalled drivers, Updated my IP settings, run an IPConfig - very frustrating. I am at the restore point which is obviously a last resort. What can we do?!

            <p>Hi BHEDU,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Well after going back to factory settings a 2nd time. Suddenly wifi no longer worked like when I first got my computer and ran all the updates and kept on top of them. I manually updated my driver the 2nd go round. Not understanding why after going back
 to my factory setting that suddenly wifi no longer worked like before. Makes no sense after wiping the drive. Worked great before with no wifi drops. So, yes I decided if it is going to drop on 8.0 then I will go ahead and once again update to 8.1 since I
 like some of the new features. I am now able to browse the web, watch online videos and so forth. No drops until I run Second Life browser. A virtual world software. It drops about 10 or 15 minutes when logged on. Never had that issue before either. At least
 I can browse the web now. Not sure how it fixed that issue. All I did was reinstall 8.1 again. Did all the updates on my laptop Gateway and Microsoft. Microsoft tech told me the power settings effect the wifi. I got mine on balanced with "never" as the choice
 to turn off display and put the computer to sleep. Not sure if that helps or not. No idea. ?? Odd that it stays logged on now without a drop except on that one software I run. I did reset my router (Again!) and changed the channel it was on. There is still
 issues here however if I can't run my software program. I keep reading post all over the web. Too many people are having this same issue. It can't be on the&nbsp; manufacturer's end since so many have this problem and we all don't own the same equipment.&nbsp; I'll
 keep reading and hopefully someone will come along with a fix. sorry your having it too. So far this laptop has been excellent for the price otherwise. Runs better than the many HP's I had that cost twice as much. I still run Windows 7 on a mini desktop pc,
 so I have that option if all else. And on the last note...I run a smartphone and a nook hd tablet in my home and the wifi never drops on those at all. Even though it was dropping after the 8.1 update. You tell me???? LOL</p>

<h2>            windows 10 display issues</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Dear community</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have used windows 10 since the day it officially anounced. base on 3 months usuage, i have 4 major issues about display since the first day of using 10. But I was hoping the threshold or driver's update can solve it. However,
 until now, the build 10586, these problems still presist, so...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">1. firstly, see this gif:&nbsp;https://i.gyazo.com/da7765a7395e30f759e574a9715650e5.gif</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have a main monitor which is on the left screen and right is my laptop screen.</p>
<p>the main monitor is drived by my Nvidia K2000m video card (the laptop screen is drived by intel), and this browser is also runed by it, when i full screen it on the right and drag it to main monitor and full screen without stop it on it, i will give me black
 windows. this happend to all software which drived by Nvidia card. This problem can be solved by disabling the intel integrated card and only using the Nvidia card. But I still count as an issue, I dont want to disable my integrated video card forever. By
 the way, I have all driver to be up to date, and the 2 display identities are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Full screen issues. I saw a lot of post about this issue in the community and looks like it is not been full solved or maybe I did not find a solution. For some games, such as Warcraft III, when I start it with exe file, it will do this way: open-&gt; black
 screen in a sec -&gt; show the game in full screen in a sec -&gt; black screen a sec -&gt; back to desktop with the game minimize on the taskbar. no matter how I click it, it will do the same thing again and again(with no error pop up). this mostly happened to some
 old games which were made before 2006 ish. no matter about how I change the compatibility setting or display setting. all dirvers are up to date also. For now, the only solution I found is to run the game in windows mode instead of full screen mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. scaling issues. there is no issue when I only use the nvidia card which means disabled the integrated card. if i run the dual display card mod, i cant change the scaling setting. In nvidia control panel, there is a scaling setting about perform scaling
 on (GPU/DISPLAY) and a check box that said ‚Äúoverride the scaling mode set games and program". these 2 setting are locked on uncheck and display when i am running the dual display card mode. no matter how i change the setting to GPU, after i click apply, it
 will auto swtich back to display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Jump back to desktop issue. So when i am doing something in full screen, such as watch movies in full screen or playing full screen games or even when i typing this post. some times it will auto jump back to desktop without any error pop up or windows
 pop up. the browser wont jump back to desktop but the major frame is not the browser but the desktop(my typing are not in the box). I digged some info about it and found some people are saying that the task scheduler may schedule some app which caused that.
 i have already disabled all schedule task but the problem still presist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>these 4 issues never solved from insider preview to now for me, so I hope someone can help me.</p>
<p>thanks and finally here are some spec about my laptop and hope these are useful.</p>

            The scaling issue has been present since Windows 10 launched. I've posted multiple threads on Intel's forum explaining the issue about full screen scaling which worked fine in Win 7, 8, 8.1 using integrated graphics but ever since upgrading to Win10, there
 has always been black bars on any game running a res lower than native 16:9 1920x1080 on my laptop. This is not an issue when using my dedicated GTX 860M mobile gpu for games but only present when running any game off the Intel HD 4600 on board gpu.
<br />
<br />
Its been months since Win10's release and despite now 5-6 different drivers being released, they are still unable to provide us a solution to what seem like a simple problem AMD and Nvidia managed to resolve within a week of Windows 10's launch. Currently they
 point the finger at Microsoft saying it is something on their end that needs to be addressed first before the issue is resolved. None the less, going into month 5 soon and any older game that does not support my dedicated gpu or 16:9 resolution (i.e Elder
 Scrolls Morrowind or Just Cause 1) will continue to have obstructive black bars on either side of the game window. Not rendering the game unplayable, but certainly hindering what should be a seamless experience.. Something we all had in previous versions of
 Windows... A "full screen" scaling feature taken away for some reason.. and never restored.

            <p>I have the exact machine/CPU and have been experiencing the same issues.<br />
I was able to resolve most issues including #1 by doing the following.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Uninstall existing HD 4000 and K2000M drivers from Device Manager (not sure if this was actually necessary... you may lose your display so be&nbsp;prepared&nbsp;to RDP)</li><li>Download the latest drivers for the K2000M and HD 4000 (3rd generation Core family)
<strong>from NVidia and Intel </strong>respectively.</li><li>Install drivers (I started with&nbsp;K2000M followed by HD 4000)</li><li>Restart</li></ol>
<p>I believe the problem was caused by the HD 4000 drivers installed by the OS (dated July 2015). The drivers from Intel appear to have resolved the issues.<br />
<br />
I still have problems with HDCP content. Cannot get it to play though the K2000M (i.e. external monitors) unless I first disable the HD 4000. Seems HDCP content is locked to the one display adaptor.</p>

<p>I tried ur way it helped me solved the scaling issue which I listed as #3</p>
<p>but for #1 and #2 the issue still maintain</p>
<p>I can try to force size the resolution by using regedit to let the game to full screen to run</p>
<p>but this method does not work on every game I found have issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still thanks for help</p>

<h2>            Ipad Cannot connect to Laptop&#39;s hotspot</h2>
                    I have asked this before, but answer was no help whatsoever. My laptop makes a wireless network, but ipad cannot connect to it, it only has the loading sign forever. I have now used all of my mobile data on my phone hotspot and need a settings setup, which
 makes a normal, working, not pain-in-the-*SS Hotspot. I have an acer, and i will not call customer support for apple and microsoft, i tried and they know nothing. i have reset my network settings on both ipad and laptop, but the laptop is the problem.

<p>
</p><p>Make sure that the person you're calling is also using an updated version of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check your connection. Once Skype detects a weak connection, the call quality is reduced to try and stop the call from being dropped.</p>

<p>One more update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to using 8.15, when I was on an older version, the other party could see my video.&nbsp; I couldn't see theirs except for 1 - 2 mins at the beginning of the call, as described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating to 8.15, the other party couldn't see my video anymore, and neither could I see their video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could see my own video on my half of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the "share video" set during the call.</p>

<p>Try checking your connection. If your audio or video calls freeze, your video looks block-like or has motion blur, it might be your internet connection (or your friend's) causing the problem. If Skype detects a weak connection, it will reduce the quality
 to try and stop the call from dropping altogether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also check the connection of your contact.</p>

    <title>&#91;SOLVED&#93; Control Panel Crash in Windows 10, with a brand new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benji_27  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Control Panel Crash in Windows 10, with a brand new PC...</h2>
                    <div>Hi,</div>
<div>I just bought and installed win10 on a brand new PC, and I got some troubles.</div>
<div>
<p>Shortly after installation, the file explorer started to crash on startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you clicked on the "folder" icon, the screen just flashed and nothing happened.</p>
</div>
<div>I have used the recovery function to restore the PC, and since then the file explorer is working normally.</div>
<div>
<p>But I just found out that the control panel is not working (same symptoms : the screen flashes and nothing happens, and the file explorer closes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot change the "theme" of the desktop as well (crash of file explorer)</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>There is no error message showing, but it sometimes look like the command line window (or a window with black backdrop) is opening for a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Restoring the PC is not changing anything.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>When trying to start the .cpl files from the file explorer, some apps are working and some not.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Not working (file explorer crashing) :<br />
wscui.cpl<br />
appwiz.cpl<br />
desk.cpl<br />
powercfg.cpl<br />
ncpa.cpl<br />
firewall.cpl<br />
irprops.cpl (doesn't crash file explorer, but nothing happens)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Working:<br />
itnetcpl.cpl<br />
main.cpl<br />
intl.cpl<br />
timedate.cpl<br />
sysdm.cpl<br />
bthprops.cpl (WIN10 control panel)<br />
telephon.cpl<br />
joy.cpl<br />
mmsys.cpl<br />
sapi.cpl<br />
hdwwiz.cpl</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I have also noticed that I cannot install Dropbox, because the software crashes on startup.</div>
<div>
<p>I have not installed too much fancy things yet.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Origin and steam are installed, the MS C++ redistributable library 2005, 2010, 2012 and 2013 (both X86 and 64bits), and the control panel for the video card...</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>My PC is build from the following components: <br />
Intel Core I7 6700K<br />
Motherboard Asus Z170I pro gaming<br />
Video card : ASUS STRIX-GTX980TI<br />
SSD Samsung 500go<br />
HD HItachi Desktar 4To<br />
Memory : Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Any idea what could be wrong with my PC?</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>During my first Install, there was a version of Norton antivirus installed (I do not know how it got there. Co-installed with my motherboard or video card software?), and I'm leaning towards blaming Norton...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not resinstall it, and everything seems to be working...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled my printer software (HP Officejet) without any problem.</p>

            Hi Lindsay,<br />
<br />
Recording button is available only when you are making or joining a Skype for business meeting, not just sharing desktop with others or just in a Skype for business call.<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you can record 2 meetings. So, it shows skype for business works fine. So, to better understand your situation, I‚Äôd like to collect some detailed information:<br />
1. A screenshot of the more options ribbon.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d23656c4-fbd9-47f2-becb-dc4552897ace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d23656c4-fbd9-47f2-becb-dc4552897ace" /></a><br />
2. Do you make a Skype for business meeting with others who are also using Skype for business?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Edward

    <title>Problem printing from Edge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alansharkis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem printing from Edge</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>This is a strange one.&nbsp; I have three computers on my home network, all via Ethernet to the router.&nbsp; My printer goes wirelessly from the router.&nbsp; All three machines are the same brand, although different models and different ages.&nbsp; Two of them were upgraded
 to Windows 10 from Windows 7, and the third one from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the computers that was an upgrade from Windows 7 has the following problem when trying to print from Edge:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The document appears in the queue with N/A in the "pages" column but doesn't print.</li><li>If I try to delete the document from the queue, it says } "deleting," but won't delete unless I reboot, or use the print troubleshooter to clear the queue.&nbsp; The troubleshooter finds no other problems.</li><li>Meanwhile, until the&nbsp;offending document&nbsp;is cleared from the queue, nothing else will print.</li><li>If the computer and printer are kept powered on, a couple of hours later, the document will print, even though the queue has been cleared.</li><li>I can print normally from any other application.</li></ul>
<p>Neither of the other two computers exhibit this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told that there may be a problem with printing from Edge if I'm also running Eset.&nbsp; So, I opened Eset and set it to run in interactive mode.&nbsp; A number of screens popped up, but none of them had anything to do with printing, the port the printer is
 using, or the printer's static IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote to Eset about this problem and I anticipate a reply from them in the next two or three&nbsp; days.&nbsp; If they send me anything helpful, I'll comment here.&nbsp; if not, I'm hoping somebody here will have an answer for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I made Firefox the default browser on that computer.&nbsp; I also installed a plugin to Firefox that lets me print selections from a Web page; something that Edge cannot do because it also won't accept plugins.</p>
<p>

<p>I guess you didn't read my entire post.&nbsp; The printer functions perfectly from all other applications.&nbsp; It's only Edge that gives me this problem and only on one of three upgraded computers on my network.&nbsp; I tried doing just what you suggested on the machine
 with the problem and wound up with two instances of the printer in my devices and printers folder.&nbsp;

            I am having the same problems with printing from edge. It hangs up the print queue and no other programs can print. I am also using Eset. Very likely an Eset problem. Also, Edge is a piece of junk! I've gone to using the old explorer that's built into
 edge. Goto &nbsp;the . . . and click on "Use the Internet Explorer".

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
3rd party antivirus programs play havoc with Windows. Uninstall Eset <br />
and use Windows Defender which is Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. <br />
Despite the negative and misleading hype Windows Defender and the <br />
Windows Firewall are true superstars.<br />

IE11&nbsp;is not built-in to Edge, rather there is a link to it included in Edge.<br />
In Windows 10 you can run Edge or Internet Explorer 11 (Start Button -<br />

            <p>The problem with Eset on that one computer is that the subscription was just renewed and it's running Eset Smart Security 9.&nbsp; I keep getting advice from Eset that is consistent with Eset Smart Security 8 on how to send them firewall logs.&nbsp; The procedure
 doesn't work for Eset Smart Security 9.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can work around the problem.&nbsp; I made Firefox the default browser on that machine.&nbsp; Firefox, by the way, can take plugins (hint, hint Microsoft!)</p>

            <p>C'mon, Rob.&nbsp; We both know that third party antivirus programs work just fine.&nbsp; I've had years of experience with them.&nbsp; As for anti-malware, Eset Smart Security has that covered with more configuration options than you can imagine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, I have three machines on that network, all running Windows 10 and all running Eset Security and only one of them is giving me trouble printing from Edge, and as I replied to Jimcrooker, I made Firefox the default browser on that machine and all
 is well now.&nbsp; In addition to solving my problem with printing from Edge, Firefox gives me many other&nbsp;benefits.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come to think of it, I just put a fourth computer on the&nbsp;network.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;platform is Ubuntustudio and&nbsp;if I get any more Microsoft nonsense, the other three will be running&nbsp;one Linux distro or another very soon.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
No you might think that but I definitely do not, and especially with Windows 10.<br />
As I indicated 3rd party antivirus play havoc and are probably the leading cause<br />
of corruption and other issues in Windows 8-10. And they are not needed as<br />
Windows Defender provided superb protection and the best compatibility out <br />
there.<br />
<br />
Do as you wish, it is your computer, but I would ditch any 3rd party antivirus.<br />

            <p>I have also used third-party AVs with Windows for many years...ending with Windows 7. &nbsp;Problems with Avast, AVG, and Norton products cured me of that and I switched to MSE with Windows 7. &nbsp;Starting with 8 I have just stayed with Defender. &nbsp;I decided to try
 Avast and AVG in couple of VMs running 7 and 8 before upgrading to 10 to see if comments in the forums were really true. &nbsp;I found out that Avast in particular seems to mess up upgrade installations of 10 and when removed and then reinstalled after uprading
 continues to be problematic. &nbsp;I found out what people were saying the forums was pretty much true. &nbsp;Avast and AVG seem to haven fallen behind recently. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with Rob completely.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but Windows XP Mode isn't available in Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp;&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p>Some possible solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>See if the applications will install and run as described on the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Make older programs run in this version of Windows</a> web page. </li><li>Upgrade the computer to Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate to run Windows XP Mode.</li><li>Install a retail version of Windows XP using <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VirtualBox</a> on Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; Please note that VirtualBox isn't a Microsoft product and isn't supported or endorsed by Microsoft.&nbsp; However, I use it every day to run earlier versions of Windows as virtual machines on Windows 7 and have found it
 to be very reliable. </li></ul>

<p>Hi Uma..</p>
<p>Now that you mention Turbo C, it is a 16-bit software.</p>
<p>I want to share a little knowledge about compatibility mode, but correct me if&nbsp;i were wrong.<br />
First,&nbsp;Intel or AMD&nbsp;processors have several modes to operate. <strong>Real mode</strong>, first introduced in Intel 8086 once upon a time, operates in 16-bit.<strong>Protected mode</strong> introduced in Intel 80286. At that time there was no way to return
 to real mode once the CPU entered protected mode, except by resetting the processor. Intel 80386 featured<strong>Virtual 8086 mode</strong>, that is, ability to switch back to real mode and then return to protected mode. Long later, AMD Opteron features<strong>Long
 mode</strong>, that is, operates in 64-bit.</p>
<p>If the previous paragraph is too technical, I am sorry. Now, in windows XP or Vista or 7 (32bit), Windows normally operates the CPU in<strong>protected mode</strong>, that is, 32-bit. Next, Windows emulates 16-bit environment using its component called NTVDM
 (NT Virtual DOS Machine). NTVDM relies on<strong>virtual 8086 mode</strong> feature from your CPU. That is why Borland Turbo C (16-bit) can run on Windows XP 32-bit, because virtual 8086 mode is available in protected mode.</p>
<p>When you meet Windows 64-bit, Windows operates the CPU in <strong>long mode</strong>. In Windows 64-bit, there is no NTVDM. Why? Because<strong>Virtual 8086 mode is not available in long mode</strong>. Therefore, Windows 64-bit cannot emulate 16-bit any
 longer. But Windows 64-bit are able to run 32-bit software because&nbsp;32-bit instructions are compatible with 64-bit (x64) processor architecture.</p>
<p>Workaround for this disability is to install 16-bit softwares under virtualization software, such as Windows XP mode (not available in 7 Home Premium), or a free software<a href="http://www.dosbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DOSbox.</a></p>

<h2>            Undetectable flash drive&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    A flash drive became undetectable by my computer after I hibernated it with the flash-drive in. I still hear the "bee-boo" sound that something was connected, but I can't open the drive. I can, however, open the drive on another computer. When I plugged
 a different flash drive into my computer, I could get on it. So, if it isn't the port or the flash drive, then what is it? This problem needs to be solved WITHOUT formatting, because I have very important files on there. (By the way, I have tried rebooting,
 but it didn't work)

            <p><span>Hi Shake,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            I'm not sure which drivers to select. Nothing is correctly&nbsp;labeled.&nbsp;
<div>Another problem just arose too: it isn't detecting the ezcap capture card I have anymore either along with the flash drive.<br />
<div><br />
<div>The computer with this problem is a Windows Vista Ultimate (64bit)</div>
<div>Service pack 2 is installed.</div>

            The drive doesn't appear in Drive Management, so I can't change or edit the usb drive letter.
<div>In "Device Manager" my flash drive appears as a "USB Mass Storage Device" with a black and yellow exclamation point next to it. I c.licked on it and this is the error I found in its properties:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>This device cannot start. (Code 10)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click 'Check for solutions' to send data about this device to Microsoft and to see if there is a solution available.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the device, but I get a message saying "the device failed to install properly"</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />

            <div>&lt;&lt; I can, however, open the drive on another computer. When I plugged a different flash drive into my computer, I could get on it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>The drive could be starting to fail. To be safe, copy your important files using another computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>You can try deleting the INFCACHE.1 file. See the following article for instructions:</div>
