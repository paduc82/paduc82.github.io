    <title>Audio waveforms do not show in Windows Movie Maker - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Audio waveforms do not show in Windows Movie Maker</h2>
                    <p>Even though I have the waveforms enabled (the button under the View tab that says "waveforms", I have pushed that button), for some reason audio waveforms don't show. On my old laptop with a corrupted operating system, waveforms will show just fine. But
 on my brand new laptop with a brand new installation of Windows 10, waveforms don't show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I load a video into movie maker, it loads fine. The audio loads fully, and if I play the video, the audio can be heard just fine. However, I do not see any waveforms. I have tried zooming in, changing the thumbnail size, changing from widescreen
 to standard. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the program, TWICE. This makes editing my videos a time consuming process, because I cannot see where audio starts and stops, therefore I have to playback, pause, and trim over and over and over again. I use
 this program because it has always been easy for me, and I will not move to a different video editor just because this program won't do one simple thing that it should be doing. So naturally I want to fix this problem, relatively quickly, and all advice is
 welcome :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I only use video files which are .wmv format.</p>

            <p>My question is about Windows Movie Maker, NOT Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not trying to open a video file with Movie Maker. I am trying to view the AUDIO WAVEFORMS in Movie Maker, which are not showing, even though I have the waveforms button ENABLED, AUDIO WAVEFORMS DO NOT SHOW. That is the issue that I am trying to solve.</p>

    <title>Favourite Syncing Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Favourite Syncing Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several problems are occurring with syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Microsoft Edge: When Sync is on, NOTHING Syncs. The fav folder (within Edge) has never once been populated, it is as if Sync doesn't work. I have already reinstalled Edge many times to fix this, personally I don't see it getting fixed at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When favs are deleted from IE (either directly from folder or side tab) they appear again. Despite turning Sync on / off (via settings) they just keep coming back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has been happening for weeks now. It is driving me insane, why cant this synced folder be accessible via OneDrive or something where I can manually just adjust? Did you really need to make it hidden?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note this has been going on for weeks now, despite restarts, reinstalling of Edge, deleting while only one device is connected, turning off syncing while deleting. It is like Favourite has no concept of deleting!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the comp sends a message a delete a favourite, what address does it make this request to?</p>

<p>Formatted comp, reset phone 4 times and still the issue persists. I think it is safe to say this is beyond a generic 'click here to fix' issue. Ofc you have an 'excellent' design system where you cant delete favourite folders on Lumia, I cannot believe how
 stupid this sync issue has become.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Format AND reset both happened with NEW profiles, as in no backups being used. Honestly if this cant fix the issue then it is safe to say this problem ISNT at my side. When the phone resets it adds the standard 'phone' folder to favs, that gets added and
 removed of desktop but remains on phone. Also despite formatting Edge STILL doesn't sync despite following your steps.</p>

<p>How do I monitor my phone, this is a two way sync issue. Despite multiple resets (hard wipes) on my phone it still has wrong synced folders. I have tried all the approaches to this. So I am thinking either my fav on desktop is bugged OR fav on phone is bugged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After playing around all day I 'feel' the issue is phone related (or at your end). There is no reason why when folders are wiped that phone should have old folders. Once I click sync on phone it regenerates many of the folders on desktop. It is as if my
 phone is the sync host and it makes no sense at all. When I remove sync of phone I can delete fine on desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am strongly convinced my phone is causing this (despite many hard wipes) I feel a solution must be phone related.</p>

                    <p>I'm in in a odd situation here. just updated my windows 7 ultimate SP 1 64 bit to Windows 10 Pro 64 bit build 10240 , but after the update when i logged in to my account Screen Blacks out completely only with mouse cursor. but after getting task manager
 with ctrl+alt+del , i can use process - open file location to open a file explorer . and after i updated my AMD APU via device manager graphics works fine enough to let me play even 3D games except desktop is still completely black. That's why i said it's
 odd? And also i can't open settings app to update my windows. when i try to open it it freezes that explorer window and do nothing even for hours. and also because i can't access settings app i can't create new user accounts too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;faster than 7 in my friend's laptop &nbsp;with e450 APU and programs run with the same speed as windows 10 ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>so i would recommend if you have a AMD e450 APU use win 8.1 Pro because it has official drivers and supports only up to windows 8.1 .&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My computer clock won&#39;t keep time</h2>
                    My computer clock won't keep time. What can I do? I have replaced the battery. I have reset the time servers, I have changed the time via cmos. When I set a time, the clock "stands still".&nbsp; The analog clock animation in 'change date and time settings'
 appears to work... second hand moves, digits tick along... but as soon as I am not looking, there is no apparent movement. I'm baffled. Any help?

<p>Did you change the CMOS 2032 battery?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I too am befuddled by that behaviour.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is a problem on the main board.&nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that it "remembers" the last date/time, suggests the battery is working, but the crystal that runs the clock has a problem.</p>

<p>Yes, I changed the CMOS 2032 battery out twice, and checked the replacements on the voltmeter, showing at least 3v each (although the original was kaput). I'm close to throwing in the towel on this one, but I've never seen the like before. I suppose it could
 be as you suggest that there is a 'hardware' problem in the clock. We'll probably never know unless there are any other ideas. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Putting shortcut to a partition or folder on taskbar</h2>
                    With XP, I was able to get a shortcut to My Documents on the Quick Launch bar. Now I have a new laptop running Windows 7. So far I like it overall, but with the libraries it takes extra clicking for me to get to my documents (on the D partition). How can
 I get a shortcut to that partition onto the taskbar (I want to pin it there, obviously). I want to be able to click on the shortcut, and be taken straight to all teh files and documents in the D partition. If need be, I can put them all inside a single folder,
 and then link to that folder.&nbsp;

            You can create a folder, dump links in it, then put that folder as a toolbar on the Taskbar. &nbsp;But if you're going to have to have 2 clicks anyway (show the folder menu, then click the shortcut), why not just skip the folder and use the jump list? &nbsp;Here's
 how:
<div><br />
<div>Drag the folder (Documents) to the taskbar. &nbsp;When you let go, it will pin itself to the Explorer icon. &nbsp;Then you can either drag-up from the Explorer button (or simply right-click it) to see your favorite set of destinations).</div>

<h2>            Help requested with installing 2nd &#38; 3rd SATA HDD as storage devices in desktop PC</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Sir/Ms,</p>
<p>My name is Leon and I recently assembled a new desktop PC based on the Windows 7 64 bit. My Windows 7 works fine out of my system HDD, but now I am trying to install a 2nd &amp; 3rd SATA HDD as storage devices in my desktop PC.</p>
<p>When I connected up the additional SATA HDDs, a message flashes saying "Device driver software not successfully installed". When I double click on it, it says "USB Controller x No driver found" but the second line says "WDC WD10EARS-00Y5B1 ATA tick Ready
 to use".</p>
<p>The SATA HDD does not appear in "My Computer" screen either.</p>
<p>Later when I restart the computer, it hangs after the BIOS start-up page with a blank screen with the words "Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a Key".</p>
<p>The computer only works thereafter if I disconnect both additional SATA HDDs.</p>
<p>Kindly help advice. I never had this problem in my 5 other PCs with Windows Vista.</p>
<p>With kind regards,</p>
<p>Leon</p>

<p>First after install you need to go into the BIOS and check the BIOS sees the drives correctly.&nbsp; Then you need to tell the BIOS which is the main hard drive that it will be booting from.</p>
<p>Once this is done, startup into Windows and provided you have the motherboard chipset drivers installed correctly in Windows, it should see and install the correct drivers for the hard drives.&nbsp; They will not appear in My Computer at this point in time.&nbsp;
 Right click on My Computer and select Manage.&nbsp; On the following screen, click on Disk Management.&nbsp; They should now show up on the right hand side but as unpartitioned and unformatted drives.&nbsp; Click on one of them, create a partition and format the drive, and
 ensure Windows has assigned it a drive letter.&nbsp; Do the same with the other one.</p>
<p>Now they should show up in Windows Explorer.</p>

    <title>Duplicate achievement entries for the same game. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gojjaet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate achievement entries for the same game.</h2>
                    <p>Running Geometry Wars 2 on Xbox One using 360 backwards compatibility causes two separate entries to appear in the achievements list.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The duplicates are not simply a rendering issue as the Xbox&nbsp;website and the console show the same duplicated&nbsp;result. I asked a friend to boot up the same game on his profile and the same problem was created for him.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Out of the two achievement sections for this&nbsp;game, it seems gained achievements are associated with one and only the 'time played' is associated with the other making it seem as if there is a database problem within Xbox Live&nbsp;servers&nbsp;for this game.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Being achievement enthusiasts, my friend and I&nbsp;would like to clean our profiles&nbsp;up.</p><p><br /></p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRW5CAW.img" /></figure>

<h2>            Outlook Mail &#34;No synced yet&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new laptop (Lenovo G50) which came with Windows 8.&nbsp; Having used Windows 7, and not wishing to learn how to use Windows 8, I straightway downloaded Windows 10.&nbsp; Clicking on the Mail box in the start menu, and completing all the Settings,
 the Mail simply says "Not synced yet".&nbsp; No help or remedy is offered.</p>
<p>I have trawled the web for a solution, followed some promising suggestions, read a lot of incomprehensible geek talk, and mostly comments from similarly frustrated users.&nbsp; But have found no solution.</p>
<p>To use my yahoo e-mail, I have to use the Yahoo web site, with all its frustrating features and irritating adverts.&nbsp; I have revisited this problem three times over the past month hoping someone out there finds a solution, but am no further forward.</p>
<p>I am also mystified as to how Microsoft can allow such a major issue to fester and tarnish their reputation.</p>

            <p>Dear Syed,</p>
<p>Thank you for your prompt response.&nbsp; I have discovered the problem.&nbsp; It seemed as I had to set up a Microsoft account,&nbsp;my yahoo&nbsp;mail&nbsp;should be under Outlook.&nbsp; Now I have added it under Yahoo!Mail, and the problem seems to be solved.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But can I remove&nbsp;my yahoo address set up (incorrectly) under Outlook from the list on the left of the Mail window, which still says "Not synced yet"?</p>
<p>Regards, Gerda</p>

                    <p>When I try to delete e-mail from my Junk e-mail folder in Windows Live Mail 2012, I get the message "An unknown error has occurred".
</p>
<p>I have also Reinstalled TWICE</p>
<p>I checked \AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Junk E-mail folder and it is empty.
<br />
I deleted all junk email directly out of the folders in my main sssstorage area.</p>
<p>I tried going off-line to delete the messages but I still got the "An unknown error has occurred" message.</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7. Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome back to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span><span><br />
<span><br />
I have few questions for you in order to get a better understanding of this issue.<br />
</span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>What version of Operating system are you running (Windows Vista or XP)?</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Does it support EAX "</span></span><span>Environmental
 Audio Extensions "?</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you need information on EAX Games?</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>The EAX is to create more ambiences within computer and video games by simulating a real-world audio environment.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. &nbsp;We cannot download EAX.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is a feature included with the sound card.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
2. EAX 5.0 is present in Sound Blaster X-Fi sound cards. <br />
<br />
3. Here is a link that provides you more information on Sound card that includes EAX:</span></p>

<h3> cwinterb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista x64 Ultimate - Unable to print from 32 bit applications</h2>
                    
<p><span>I am running Vista x64 Ultimate SP2. I have an HP LaserJet 1018 printer connected via USB. The printer is not shared; it is used from the local machine only.
 It is set as the default printer.<br />
<br />
I can print fine from any 64 bit applications. For example, I can print a Test Page, or from Notepad, or from the 64bit version of Paint.NET.<br />
<br />
However, I am unable to print from any 32 bit applications. For example, I can't print from Word 2007 SP2 or any other MS Office app. I'll use Word as an example:<br />
<br />
- Create a document, hit CTRL+P to print<br />
- The Print dialogue pops up.<br />
- The LaserJet is selected in the Printer drop-down, as expected<br />
- Click OK to Print and get, "Windows cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup."<br />
- Click on Properties and get, "Word cannot bring up the properties dialogue because the printer returned an error."<br />
<br />
Other 32 bit apps behave similarly, or tell me I need to install a printer despite showing the LaserJet in their Print dialogue.<br />
<br />
When&nbsp;I look in TaskMgr I see multiple instances of splwow64.exe running, one for each failed attempt to print. There is nothing related in the EventLog, as far as I can see.<br />
<br />
I have tried everything obvious:<br />
<br />
- Removed printer drivers and reinstalled (HP v.6.2.1.0) via printmanagement.msc<br />
- Stopped and restarted the Print Spooler<br />
- Checked my&nbsp;Windows Updates are current.<br />
- Installed Vista SP2 in the hope this would resolve it (it didn't).<br />
<br />
Any other ideas gratefully received, before I resort to paving my machine and moving to the new Windows 7 RC!</span></p>

Here is one other thing you can try to see if it will resolve your issue.<br />
<br />
Use User Accounts to turn off User Account Control <br />
1.&nbsp; Open User Accounts. To do this, click Start , type accounts in the Start Search box, and then click User Accounts in the Programs list.&nbsp;
<br />
2.&nbsp; Click Turn User Account Control on or off . User Account Control permission " title="User Account Control permission "&gt; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue .&nbsp;
<br />
3.&nbsp; Click to clear the Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer check box, and then click OK .&nbsp;
<br />
4.&nbsp; Restart the computer.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Have you ever been able to print from 32 bit applications on this 64 bit system?<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this resolves your issue or if you need further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>The rules engine reported a failed VL activation attempt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mauurgp  say:</h3>
<h2>            The rules engine reported a failed VL activation attempt</h2>
                    <p>windows 8.1 on a dell studio laptop (originally came with vista).</p>
<p>upgraded 3 days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>clicked on the 'event log online help' for this error message and get a 'page not found'.</p>
<p>viewed the 2 threads with similar titles and they dont help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I successfully activated windows 8.1 when I installed.</p>
<p>not sure what this error message is about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>according to the logs; the 'security-spp' service starts, then about 30 seconds later logs this error message, then shuts down the service for 2 hours, then starts it again only to repeat the cycle; ie, this error is appearing every 2 hours for the past
 2 days (yesterday and today).</p>
<p>
</p><p>im not experiencing any 'problems', per se; I just started viewing the logs to get familiar with 8.1 when I found this; not sure what it is, and not sure if I should be concerned.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Mauurgp,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you can provide more information regarding this issue. Please answer these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Apart from upgrading to Windows 8.1, did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2) When exactly do you notice these warnings in the Event Viewer? Is it when you launch or work on any particular application on the computer?</p>
<p>3) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would first suggest you to check if these warnings are caused by any corrupted system files or any integrity issues on the computer. To check this, let’s run an SFC Scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Run an SFC Scan</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The “<strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong>” command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard and select “<strong><em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em></strong>” from that menu.</p>
<p>b) On the command prompt window, type the following command, and then press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 1in"><strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in">
</p><p>c) Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, you may refer to the article given below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us with the scan results. You may also place the computer in the Clean Boot state for some hours and check if the same errors/warnings are logged in again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. To perform a clean boot, please refer to the section “<strong><em>How to perform a clean boot</em></strong>” and follow the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows
 8.1 and Windows 8</em></strong>” from this link:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may please note that performing a clean boot does not fix the actual issue. It just helps us in identifying the root cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “<strong><em>Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</em></strong>” given in the
 section “<strong><em>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</em></strong>” from the same given link.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 8 and Windows 8.1”, to reset the computer to start as usual from the above
 link.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. Please get back to us with the troubleshooting results.</span></p>

            <p>thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>1 - i installed office 2013; no other software installs; no hardware changes; some system settings changes at the time of install - all 'pc settings' changes I believe</p>
<p>2 - I don't experience&nbsp;any operability problems; no symptoms per se - I just was looking at the logs and found this.&nbsp; the image I included shows 3 instances of the warning message, all exactly 2 hours apart.&nbsp; I think I was surfing the web at that point,
 but the warnings were a continuation from the afternoon which I wasn't even around - the computer was just sitting idle all afternoon</p>
<p>3 - no 3rd party programs installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I received a few more of the warnings this afternoon; but unfortunately, last night during a system update my computer lost power and wouldn't boot today so I had to do a system restore.&nbsp; it appears that i didn't lose the logs; but obviously that greatly
 complicates troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>did the sfc scan, and it found no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>since this is a new install with just office installed on top, ive technically been running a 'clean boot' the whole time.&nbsp; msconfig confirms that there are no non-Microsoft services running and taskmanager confirms there are no startup items to disable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you again for the help</p>
<p />

            <p>How about a response from MS on this issue that continues to plague Windows. I am now on Windows 10 now, several variations (Home and Pro), and even had this problem with Win10 Insider Preview. I know this is an old thread, so I am posting in several of
 these requests for assistance that have gone unanswered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My particular situation is the same as the poster, and I have been researching a solution for it. I had this issue in Windows 8 (home and pro) after a clean install of both Win8 and Office 2013 Professional (Volume License). It occurred again after the 8.1
 update, even after a clean install of both, as well. Now, it is occurring in Windows 10, as previously stated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has nothing to do with system files being corrupted, so skip the SFC /SCANNOW advice. This is limited to the activation of a volume license on several variations of Windows OS. What is needed is</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange part is that Office shows inside each app that it is indeed activated, so why is Windows Event Viewer continually trying to activate it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same listing in Event Viewer in each version of Windows I listed:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;General:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rules engine reported a failed VL activation attempt.</p>

            Seriously mate, have you *EVER* solved anything with sfc /scannow or clean booting? Is this all MS ever suggest these days? Whatever happened to thinking and proposing solutions based on your knowledge rather than pasting the same rubbish that pollutes
 all the other posts on this forum?

            I currently see these Warnings on a Server 2012 R2 which has never had Office installed on it and was never an upgraded OS. Like the original post says they happen every 2 hours, nothing I am doing or the software on the server is running every two hours.
 I got nothing to go by, they just show up in the log&nbsp;

<h2>            Nothing fits on screen.</h2>
                    <p>Hello all and good day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I'm having issues with Windows 10, which is fine, it's brand new. Going to be some hiccups along the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I find that I am having trouble using anything as nothing fits on my screen as it should, I've tried changing the screen resolution, the magnification, size of text, etc. To elaborate I mean my PC is reading my screen bigger than it is, and treats
 the border as if there is still screen there (If that makes sense) </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't figure out what to do to make everything fit seamlessly. Is it time to upgrade my monitor?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Scroll down to find fix</p>

            right click on your desktop, open "display settings" choose "advanced display settings"and then "display adapter properties"then there are more settings in the "list all modes" option....this is where I discovered my solution...I hope it helps ;)

<h2>            About the GPU in the Surface Book 2 15&#39;&#39;</h2>
                    I just got The Surface Book 2 15" with the i7 and GTX 1060 GPU. I simply want to know if the GPU is located inside the tablet part or in the keyboard. This matters since you can detach the tablet from the keyboard and could potentially mean that the tablet
 mode would be limited to a much weaker integrated GPU when detached. I hope that's not the case, but I need to be 100% sure.&nbsp;

<p>Listen Fabian, If you were going to be a condescending a**hat about it, then why even bother replying? Your first mistake was assuming too much. I did extensive research on the Surface but I had conflicting reports on where exactly the GPU was located. A
 review site said it was at the base, but Microsoft Support told me it was on the Tablet. So kindly go **** yourself and have a sh*tty day.&nbsp;</p>

            I just got my magicolor 2300 from a state sell today. I saw where some=one said to set it up as a network printer and use 2430dl driver. It works!!! on Win 8.1.&nbsp; You have to set the network addr up in the menu with the menu select buttons on top of the
 printer. Then with the driver I had to say a local printer then create a new tcp port. Set it as the same addr you used on the printer. You need to know what addr your network is you are installing the printer into. Mine is a standard home network 192.168.1.1
 some people may have 192.168.0.1. I set the printer to 192.168.1.20 so it would be high enough not to overlap the dynamic addrs. To bad this printer is printing in just Blue.&nbsp; Well thats my 2 cents good luck...

<h3> gordon jones churchmouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Credentials aren&#39;t allowing network and HomeGroup connections Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 devices: Dell Desktop, Dell Laptop, Surface.&nbsp; The first two worked on local WiFi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Got the Surface, all 3 are now on Windows 10 with Office 365.&nbsp; Tried to sync them on OneDrive.&nbsp; OneDrive said my path was too long, so I renamed the computers to GORDON1, GORDON2, and GORDON3.&nbsp; Fought for 2 days to get them sync'd.&nbsp; Finally found where the
 network credentials can be modified (Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Credential Manager).&nbsp; The "old" device names were there, and I removed all 3 on all 3 machines, then added all 3 back on all 3 machines, using the new computer names.&nbsp; Also gave each of them the
 same user name and password, using my Microsoft Account PIN as the password.&nbsp; Now my Microsoft Account has them listed under the new names.&nbsp; Under "Sync Settings", I have everything turned on.&nbsp; I created a new network&nbsp;GORDONX and joined all 3 to that network
 as WPA2-Personal, and gave all 3 the same (new) security key, allowing network discovery. I try to&nbsp;share them with the same homegroup, and am told that "Gordon on GORDON-DELLAP has created a homegroup on the network".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I try to link GORDON2 to GORDON1, and it asks for my credentials.&nbsp; I answer with the common name and password, and get the "The user name or password is incorrect" message.&nbsp; I look for a way to delete the homegroup under the old names, but can't find
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pray tell, what did I do wrong, or not do?</p>

<p>You think that answers the question SG?&nbsp; I don't !&nbsp; No mention of windows 8 in the question, and deleting a home group isn't the problem, Network Credentials is the problem.&nbsp; Must be hundreds of posts from people who, like me, have lost a network link to
 another PC after installing Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Running multiple gadgets - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Running multiple gadgets</h2>
                    In Vista, you could run a bunch of gadgets (more than what would fit in one column on the desktop)&nbsp;and have multiple "pages" of them in the sidebar since you could click the little arrow at the top of the sidebar to switch between the "pages".<br />
<br />
My laptop runs at 1280x800 native resolution and I have 10 gadgets I run. 7 will fit in one column and could switch to the second column to see the other 3 (less used) when needed.<br />
<br />
But since there is no sidebar in Windows 7, how do I run more than one column of gadgets and just have the one column show at a time and switch between the "pages"? Right now, all 10 are on the screen at once which is not what I want.<br />

            For those gadgets which are less important you can choose Opacity 20% so they almost gonna look like they weren't on the desktop, but you can still see them by simple hovering a mouser over them.<br />

7 Sidebar gadget</a> created for Windows 7. It behaves almost like a sidebar from Vista.. but it has some disadvantages. It's not possible to have two columns, and also it's not possible to hide this sidebar and every window in full screen mode will be shown
 next to it. Maybe it will be improved in the future.<br />
