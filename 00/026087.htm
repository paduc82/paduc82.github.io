<p>Hi Gerhard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you looked at what it says under<strong> Start-&gt;Power</strong>? Sometimes it says there things like
<strong>Update and Restart</strong>, <strong>Update and Shutdown</strong> and such. If it does, you should use that (one of those) option(s) rather than using Restart under Check for Updates. Bit of unfinished work, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>

            64 bit. I am not sure about clean installations. I think I haven't done any of them since I installed Windows 10, which was two years ago. I have Windows 10 Pro Edition, 16 GB RAM, Intel Core I7 7700K processor, ASUS Z-270-K motherboard, GTX 980 videocard.<br />
<br />
So, I see that a new&nbsp;<span>17738.1000</span> version of Windows Insider is ready to install. I restart my computer and it starts to update. When the update reaches 81% my computer restarts. After that it boots my system, but
 it is&nbsp; on&nbsp;<span>17713.1002 version like before. However, Windows still asks me to restart the system in order to install updates. When I do that it "</span><span>just restarts or turns off normally,
 without updating anything".<br />
</span>I've looked through those threads: <br />

<p>Ok, thanks, that gives me something to work with but alas not a reason for your failure.</p>
<p>A couple of remarks though:</p>
<p>Two years is a longish time but as you are on slow, it should certainly not be the cause.</p>
<p>Do you have (or ever had) any 3rd-party AV installed? Or software like cCleaner, Backup software, etc?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any external USB drives attached to your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, while these should not be the cause, they are notorious weak points, causing many issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid that unless the above is true, the chance of finding the exact cause is pretty small. Almost always it's far easier to do a Clean Install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, it so happens that the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
17738 ISO</a> has just been made public. It might be worth a try to download that, mount it and try the update from that. I don't give it much chance of succeeding though, sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let me know if I can help you further, ahem, for example with doing a proper Clean Install.</p>

<p>@Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is looking like something has been corrupted in the posters system from the past. Sometimes these problems carry through with all the upgrades. Just installed 17738 32bit clean in VMware for our friend EQuito, works like a charm as there were issues in
 the past with the 32bit installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest clean installing the 64bit ISO made available today and go from there. One can spend days looking for something, whereas a clean install takes like 15 minutes and up and running without all the stuff that accumulates over the years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if the poster would require a refresher on clean install, but this post will guide you. Make sure you do a custom install, and remove all existing partitions and allow windows to make new ones. When you get to the screen asking for a key, just skip
 this as windows will activate as soon as you go online.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just follow the steps in the above post. You will have to make a bootable flash card using Rufus or any choice you prefer, unless you want to burn the ISO to DVD. It just has to be bootable.</p>

<p>I have Kaspersky Free Antivirus. I don't have any external USB Drives attached right now. Computer doesn't show any error messages about failed update (or any error messages at all).</p>
<p>By the way, I had a similar problem with&nbsp;17692.1004 update. It was my antivirus that didn't let my system to update. But there was at least a black screen that said "Changes made to the system are being reverted" and an error code&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0xc1900101.
 It is nothing this time.<br />
Well, guess I just have to wait for the next Insider release. Thanks for the help though.</span><br />

    <title>How do I indent one line not whole paragraph&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reedinnc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I indent one line not whole paragraph&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to indent the lines below the first sentence of a paragraph to make a list like this:</p>
<p><span><strong>Originally wanted new car</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offered large incentive bonus</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Financing</strong><br />
</span><br />
But with the second paragraph, ALL the lines keep tabbing instead of just the ones below the first sentence. I've tried various things and can't stop the first sentence from tabbing with the rest (hitting enter, enter+Shift, highlighting just the ones to tab.)
 They keep lining up like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Decided on used</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Cheaper&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Less taxes</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Less insurance</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I want it to look the same as the top:</p>
<p><strong>Decided on used</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Cheaper</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Less taxes</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>less insurance</strong>.</p>

            In reviewing my previous post - seems that leading spaces on lines 2 &amp; 3 of the copied example got stripped as well so just to make sure there's no mis-understanding, going to use a period in place of a space to simulate the desired indentation

            Whatever formatting was used didn't come through in the post so everything looks the same.
<br />
<br />In the examples you included in your post, going to assume that what you want things to look like is as follows (I added spaces for line 2 &amp; 3 just for the sake of getting things to look properly as per the assumption)
<br />
<br />Originally wanted new car
<br />      Offered large incentive bonus
<br />      Financing
<br />
<br />If the assumption is correct and you're using SHIFT + ENTER at the end of each line in the paragraph as per the example - the way to get to where you want is to highlight all the lines in the paragraph --&gt; right click --&gt; select Paragraph --&gt; in the Format window that appears on the right side of the Indentation block,  go to the Special DropDown box and select &lt;Hanging&gt; --&gt; choose the size of Indent. That will cause all subsequent lines after the first to be indented by the length of the Indent just entered

    <title>Outlook storing old Autodiscover information - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom_iu8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook storing old Autodiscover information</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have recently migrated from on-prem Exchange 2010 to Office 365. In doing so, we created a hybrid environment. With this hybrid environment in place, some users' Outlook clients were set up before the Auto-Discover settings in DNS were changed to Office
 365, and Outlook used "webmail.OurDomain.org", which pointed to our old Exchange server, to start getting mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that we are ready to decommission the Exchange server, I created a CNAME record in our internal and external DNS to point that Webmail address to outlook.office365.com. Now, these users' Outlook clients give them a warning that webmail.OurDomain.org
 does not match the certificate from outlook.office365.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want Outlook looking for this old webmail address at all. There is no mention of it in our DNS records anymore, save for that CNAME record pointing Webmail to outlook.office365.com. I tried the Autodiscover Test from within Outlook, and this is what
 it gives me for Internal and External URLs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internal OWA URL: https://outlook.office365.com/owa</p>
<p>External OWA URL: https://outlook.office365.com/owa/OurDomain.org</p>
<p>
</p><p>The External OWA URL is the only place in this test that OurDomain.org is mentioned. How do I tell Outlook to "forget" about this old webmail address and only point to outlook.office365.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Tom</p>

<p>Hello Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, if the OurDomain.org is the suffix of your Office 365 for Business account in cloud, the Internal OWA URL and External OWA URL shows correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if all the users in your organization are hosted on Office 365 cloud currently? Or they are hosted on-premises but will be synced to cloud? If so, it is suggested the
autodiscover.outlook.com</span> which points to office 365 cloud. Please confirm it on your side. Note: This record doesn't apply to Exchange hybrid deployments.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an KB may be related to the mentioned warning, please check the solution there and let us know how it goes:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2772058/the-name-on-the-security-certificate-is-invalid-or-does-not-match-the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2772058/the-name-on-the-security-certificate-is-invalid-or-does-not-match-the</span></a></p>

<h2>            Exporting DOCX to PDF, hyperlinks only work on PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello to all, first time poster here. :)<br />
<br />
I couldn't find a satisfactory answer on the board as almost all similar questions and answers were based on Macs, whereas I use Office for Windows. I'm sure this doesn't change the solution, just the method of accessing the necessary areas.<br />
<br />
I'm creating a 100+ page .docx document that contains numerous images and links. The end result was always to export this document to PDF so it can be used in mobile devices as a directory of sorts. This works with no problems whatsoever, and the internal links
 work exactly as expected and take the user to the designated pages.<br />
<br />
The problem I've hit is when I've added links to external resources; the links work perfectly on a PC through Acrobat Reader, but when loaded onto an iOS device, the links to external pages simply won't work. I've tried both iBooks and the Acrobat app, but
 neither allow external links.<br />
<br />
What do I need to do to make external links on my .DOCX document that are preserved through the [Export] function and will work on both PC and iOS? I would love to post a copy of the document for reference but can't due to privacy reasons.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Stephen<br />

<p>Hi Stefan,<br />
<br />
It's not only iOS; after further testing the problem seems to persist on some Android devices as well, depending on the app used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've only got one type of external link in the documents, as a way of helping others navigate around a physical location. By tapping the link it should take them to the designated position in Google Maps. For demonstration's sake, this is an example of the
 type of link being used in the document:<br />
<br />
https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/27Â°27'29.8"S+153Â°02'06.9"E/@-27.4582512,153.0264902,15z</p>

<h2>            Does a sharepoint lists .pst file contain settings, data, or both&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I sync four SharePoint Online lists with my Outlook client(s). Three are task lists and one is a contacts address book. The directory which contains my .ost files has one SharePoint lists .pst file. Does that file contain the settings for my four synced
 lists, or also the most current data? </p>
<p>
</p><p>My real concern is backing up the data. I can sync the same SPO lists to Excel and back those up, but that's unnecessary (and also would not be up to date), if the .pst files contain current data and are being backed up automatically.

            LINEST is a special kind of formula, a so-called array formula. Such formulas have existed in Excel since very early versions in the 1980s, and it has always been necessary to confirm them in a special way. Nothing has changed in that respect since Office
 2003 or Office XP. Or since Office 2000, for that matter. Or Office 97. Or Office 95.

<h2>            Internet Explorer Deletes File After Download is Completed</h2>
                    I slect any file to download to my computer using IE8 with updates installed. After the file download has completed the file is deleted from the save to&nbsp;loaction. I can see the file in the folder as the download is occuring but then it disappears. I performed
 a full search and tried several different locations with no success. I did however create a new user account and ised IE to download to the hard drive and it performed correct. What is the reason for the one account to delete the file automaticly after completion.

<p>Hi,<br />
Which version of Windows? (Including SP level- Windows 7, Vista SP1, XP SP2 ,etc.
<br />
Right-click Computer/My Computer&gt; Properties to obtain this information)<br />
<br />
First (because it's so easy to do) clear the Temporary Internet Files.<br />
<br />
Then, because toolbars and other browser add-ons are installed to&nbsp;a user account, check for an incompatible or malfunctioning add-on.<br />
<br />
Start Internet Explorer without add-ons by right-clicking the IE icon on the desktop. Choose Start without add-ons.<br />
or<br />
from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
If the problem goes away, you have an incompatible browser add-on installed.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Mac progress bar missing after 15.31 update</h2>
                    After updating Outlook 2016 Mac to version 15.31, the progress bar on the Status Bar at the bottom of the window is no longer displayed when I click the Send &amp; Receive button to send or receive new email messages. Other items on the Status Bar (Items and
 Unread) are still displayed as before. This issue appeared on both of my Macs (iMac, MacBook Pro, both running MacOS Sierra 10.12.3), so it does not appear to be machine-specific. I'm thinking it is a bug, but if there is a setting that was inadvertently changed
 with the update, I would appreciate a suggestion for a fix.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need to see the status of this progress bar. If you want to check about the Sync Status of emails, you can press (Command + 7) to bring up the Sync Status window. And if you want to check the Sync Errors, then press (Command + 8) to display the Sync
 Errors window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I would like to know some information to understand the situation:</p>

            <p>Hellow Ruel, sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Status Bar" that I am referring to is the gray bar at the bottom of the Inbox window in Outlook. On the left side of the Status Bar are "Items: (xxx) "and "Unread: (xxx)". This bar has been present in all versions of Outlook and on Microsoft's prior
 Mac email client software Entourage, all of which I have used. I am an experienced Mac user who has used Microsoft software for &gt;30 years, including Office since it was first launched about three decades ago. Before the update to Outlook 2016 Version 15.31
 (170216) â€” the current version, and the version that I am using â€” when email messages were fetched from my ISP server after I clicked the Send &amp; Receive button, a blue progress bar always appeared in the right lower corner of the Status Bar, showing the progress
 as the messages were downloading to my computer. With version 15.31 (170216), this progress bar no longer displays during the downloading of messages. This issue has nothing to do with Sync Status or Sync Errors. It has to do only with display of the progress
 of message downloads while they are active. Messages still download as before, but there is no visual progress cue that is being displayed while the downloading is occurring. If after reading this you cannot figure out what I'm describing, I apologize, but
 I suggest that you fire up a pre-15.31 (170216) version of Outlook 2016 Mac and click the Send &amp; Receive button to initiate the downloading process for a new message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated in my original message, my Mac OS version is Sierra 10.12.3. There is no build number displayed in the Mac window that displays my OS version, but I am using the most recent version as of March 2, 2017. To reiterate, the issue appeared on two
 different Macs, an iMac and a MacBook Pro, both running Sierra 10.12.3, so the issue is not machine-specific</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, and best regards.</p>

            One more thing, Ruel, that might be helpful to show what I am talking about. The progress bar in the Status Bar continues to display as before when a new message is created and the Send button is clicked. The progress bar will display until the message
 is sent. But the progress bar does not display when there are incoming messages.

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing the details to the problem you encountered on Outlook for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test on version 15.31 (170216), when clicking Send/Receive button to download latest messages from inbox it will show the â€œdownloadingâ€ status on the bottom just like this screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa85a8a0-8f43-4f93-b793-49c4b221e3f3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa85a8a0-8f43-4f93-b793-49c4b221e3f3" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Let me know if this is the progress bar you are looking for, if not can you provide us a screenshot. Also I would like to ask if you can provide us a video of the scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps to record a video:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. On the Menu bar, click Go and then Applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Search for Quick time Player and open the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Click on the File option, then click on New Screen Recording, in the opening dialogue box, click on the red button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Select the respective window to start recording. After recording, click on the File option and save.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Attach this to your reply.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Ruel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the progress bar that you show in your message is the one that I am referring to. It is This progress bar is absent in my version of Outlook when messages are downloading to my inbox, but it is displayed as usual when a message is being sent. I will
 be out of town this weekend and away from my computers. I will try to send you a video to you via private link early next week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for waiting. I understand you can download the message without any issues except that it does not show the progress bar on the lower right-corner of your Outlook for Mac client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like you to try and configure the test account I have provided in the Private Message. Since this error occurs on different Mac systems, we can identify if the error is related to the client by testing this account on your side</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to your updates.</p>

            <p>Hello Karin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The location completely depends on how you have downloads configured for the particular browser you are using. The default settings for IE would be to save to c:\Users\username\Documents &amp; Settings\downloads (this may be inaccurate, as it has been ages since
 I have used WinXP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do a search for that file or you can also re-download and make sure you are looking at the SAVE location. Just make sure you are saving it and not opening it from the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps...</p>

            For me it's either slow to load or won't load at all and says to try again later...&nbsp; The only ways I can get emails to load is if I move them to another folder and open them (Firefox) it's been like this for 9-10 months on my 2 pc's and a laptop.<br />
<br />
So annoying it drives me nuts, every day I think about changing to gmail but I'm just too lazy to change the email for so many accounts...<br />

<div>If the issue is mainly happening to one of your accounts, kindly send us the email address that's affected via the private message we have sent you. This will help us more in the investigation.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi EHinshaw2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to gather more information to better assist you with this concern. Please answer the following questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>What browser are you using?</li><li>Are you using the classic Outlook.com or the new Outlook.com UI (Outlook.com Beta)?</li><li>Is the issue also happens when you hover the mouse on other images in your Outlook.com emails?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I would suggest that you try using a different web browser and check if the issue still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your update.</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>I open Outlook with the Microsoft app at the bottom of my screen, and I am using the current Outlook, but not the new one.</p>
<p>I do NOT have the issue if I open Outlook with Chrome.</p>
<p>The issue happens with any image when I open Outlook directly with Microsoft.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. If you're using the Outlook application, you may try to run a repair and check if the issue still occurs. Repair usually fix Office applications that are not working properly. You can refer to this

<h3> jack smook  say:</h3>
<h2>            lumia 830 alarm volume</h2>
                    Prior to updating my Lumia 830 to the anniversary update on Tuesday, the alarm on my phone woke me up no problem, after installing the anniversary update, with the sound set at 10, I can barely hear the alarm going off and I've slept in twice and was late
 for work.&nbsp; Is there a bug or how can I fix it so that it's loud again?&nbsp; The phone ringer and playing music are just fine.

            Hi Jack,<br />
<br />
We would recommend performing a soft reset. When apps aren't launching or phone isn't responding to any commands, this can fix that. For soft reset, click

            If that didn't made any difference at all, we need to perform a hard reset. First, you need to back up your files as this will literally removed all apps, messages, media, personal settings etc, and bring back your phone to factory settings. For hard reset,

&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting in the forum! As I understand you are unable to download apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpapps/windows-8-phone-cannot-download-apps-receiving/a044f9c4-9b45-4e67-bbce-e51a4bb41097">
here</a> there are only two options to solve this issue; Hard reset or replacement.</p>
<p>A hard reset will erase all your information. But you can back it up and restore, most of it:</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Reading pane email contents sometimes dissapears and other graphical glitches</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm on Outlook version 1704 (Build 8067.2018 Click-to-Run) currently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook remains open on my right monitor permanently while I use my left monitor to work. &nbsp;Sometimes I've noticed going through various emails I will see the message content in the reading pane for a split second, and then it goes white. &nbsp;Sometimes I've
 noticed even in the middle column the grouping gets messed up, like there are two "Today"'s. &nbsp;Sometimes I don't see the text in my email in the middle pane unless I click on them. &nbsp;The fix is to close outlook and then re-open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a known graphical glitch for this build of office? &nbsp;I've search about my reading pane issue and the only thing I can come up with are tons and tons of posts about the folder view going missing. &nbsp;I've never had that happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also at one point when I was in my Inbox I used to have an Unread filter in the top and clicking on that showed just unread messages in the current inbox folder. &nbsp;That went away at some point (not sure if it was part of an update or what). &nbsp;Now I had to
 create a search folder called Unread Mail and favorite it so it shows at the top. &nbsp;</p>

<p>KJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I did not get back to the thread yesterday.&nbsp; The UI glitch issue was caused by a feature flight that has been disabled.&nbsp; The Outlook Team will fix that issue before re-enabling the flight.&nbsp; Disabling Hardware Graphics is just a standard troubleshooting
 step for UI issues.&nbsp; We did not have any confirmed evidence it was affecting the issue.&nbsp; You should not see the UI glitch issue again on the Insider or Current Channel builds you are on now. &nbsp;</p>

<h3> armourworx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exchange Online MX records</h2>
                    We have Google Suite emails for our domain that we use with Outlook.&nbsp; I have one user who needed to be able to sync his Outlook email/contacts/calendar with his home PC and phone. I setup an Exchange Online account for the one user. However, it modified
 the MX records on our domain hosted by GoDaddy. I had to go back and update the MX record to point back to Google as the email stopped working for all of the other users. GoDaddy said you cannot have two Email providers as you only want one set of MX records
 for one email provider. Does anyone know of another solution?

<p>Hi Sadsdsda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, when you try to search for a specific Chinese word in the notebook, OneNote only searches the titles not the text. To clarify your situation, we need to confirm some information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. How do you search the Chinese word? Do you search it in the search box?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2b80b92-9d81-4601-8890-62e5a9a613d3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2b80b92-9d81-4601-8890-62e5a9a613d3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. After you insert the Chinese word in the search box, do you click the <strong>
Find on page</strong>?<span>&nbsp; </span>Based on our test, if you click on the search box then insert the word and click Enter, it will only find the result in title. But if you use
<strong>Ctrl + F</strong> or <strong>Find on page</strong>, it will show all the results on the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6b4088f-f57d-4508-8e6d-f45e6e7a3461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6b4088f-f57d-4508-8e6d-f45e6e7a3461" /></a></p>

            Hello Tisky, thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I use the search box to look for a specific Chinese word in a large number of pages located in the same section of a notebook.
<br />
<br />
As shown in Capture 1, I was trying to search for all instances of the Chinese word "è®€è€…" (reader) in all the pages under the same section. OneNote told me there were "no matches". But in fact, dozens of pages in the section contain the word.<br />
<br />
Capture 2 shows what happened after I clicked "Find On Page" - I was brought back to the page I was on prior to the search, and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Capture 3 shows what happened if I searched for an English word (Churchill) instead. A list of all the pages containing "Churchill" came up, even though the word is not in the title.<br />
<br />
So I am quite sure there is something wrong with Chinese word searches.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Sadsdsda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To move forward, weâ€™d like to confirm that whether you have installed the Chinese (Taiwan) language pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52891399-85ac-423a-978a-523cfb461294" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52891399-85ac-423a-978a-523cfb461294" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, please download the language pack then see whether the problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please make sure you have added a Chinese (traditional) and associated fonts to your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky </p>

<p>Hi Sadsdsda<span>ï¼Œ</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you please try online repair to check whether the problem still persists, you can follow the steps below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button, and select <strong>Programs and Features</strong> on the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>2. Right-click the Microsoft Office product you want to repair, and select <strong>
Change</strong>.</p>
<p>3. From the "How would you like to repair your Office Programs" screen, select
<strong>Online Repair</strong> to make sure everything gets fixed, and then select
<strong>Repair</strong>. The <strong>Quick Repair</strong> option is also available, which runs faster but only detects and then replaces corrupted files.</p>
<p>4. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

<p>Hi Tisky</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for keeping you waiting. I have not tried that yet, but since the problem happens on every one of my machines I suspect that it is a kind of systemic flaw which might not be fixed by the repair function.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, does the problem happen to you as well? Just create several pages in Chinese but do not include in the title any Chinese characters that you are going to look for, and put the pages among dozens of English notes in a section. Then try to look
 for one or two words from the text. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be grateful if you could tell me what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sadsdsda</p>

<p>Hi Sadsdsda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on our test, we can find the Chinese when we search in the search box. The following are our test result:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c629663-0b1b-429a-8c4a-bf935ff09b32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c629663-0b1b-429a-8c4a-bf935ff09b32" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try Online Repair first, let me know if you have any update.</p>

<p>Hello Tisky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you try opening a new section in a notebook and copying the following Chinese article from the New York Times in its entirety TWICE, i.e. into two separate pages? Then please try searching for the word "å°è±¡", which is the last word of the last paragraph.
</p>

<p>Your computer and the service don't need to have an identical date and time, but if they vary too much it will prevent you from checking for updates. The following steps are the most common solutions for this error code.</p>

<p><em>First, verify that the <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">time, date/year &amp; time-zone</span></span></em> are set correctly</em></p>
