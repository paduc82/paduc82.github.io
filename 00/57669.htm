<h2>            Quick Playback Device switch not working</h2>
                    The quick switching of playback devices that came with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update does not work for me. &nbsp;I click on the speaker icon in the task bar, &nbsp;Click on the little up carrot, and select the desired playback device. &nbsp;Nothing different happens.
 &nbsp;No matter what I select, the current playback device continues to play. &nbsp;Once I select a different device, if I click the speaker icon it shows the new device I selected even though it's not playing from it. &nbsp;Pretty simple so I don't see how I can be doing
 something wrong. &nbsp;Advice? &nbsp;Thanks.

            Hi Nick, <br />
<br />
We got you. Since you tried another device and its working. Have you tried the device that is not working in another computer? (if possible) Have you checked the compatibility of that device to your computer? Is it possible for you to update the driver of that
 device? We need to know so we can determine what's the root, and to provide you troubleshooting steps to address your concern.
<br />
<br />
Thank you.
        </p>

            <p>Maybe I misspoke. It's not working. &nbsp;Here's an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the speaker icon I see my current playing device (Desktop Speakers)</p>
<p>Then I click the little UP arrow and see a list of all my devices currently connected.<br />
If I click on a different device (Plantronics Headphones) it does not change the output to the headphones<br />
If I then click on the speaker icon again I see Plantronics Headphones even though it's still playing out the Desktop Speakers<br />
</p>
<p>This happens no matter what device I click. It shows the device I tried to switch to but still plays out of the device it was on. &nbsp;I have tried this on 2 different computers with all kinds of different devices connected and get the same results. &nbsp;Any help
 is appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Fn&#43;F3 &#40;Wi-Fi On&#47;Off&#41; not working Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I have a Acer Aspire E1-510 Notebook with Windows 8.1 . Recently I discovered that although Wireless works (I'm connected right now) I cannot switch it On or Off by pressing the Fn+F3 combination. The other fn keys like sleep volume and media remote
 work fine but not Fn+F3 (F3 has the Wi-Fi logo drawn on it). Could you help me please?? Thanks in advance.

            <p>Hi Mihai,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was it working earlier?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fn keys pretty much always require vendor specific programs to make them work. Have you installed the proper drivers and software which is required to make them work? If you are unsure of what is the software or the driver requirement please contact Acer
 and ask them to help you on this.</p>
<p>On the Acer community I have found that users have resolved this issue by installing Acer Launch Manager and also by updating
and installing the latest chipset drivers from Acer website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you locate the correct drivers. Download and install the required&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;from Acer website.
</p>

<p><span>Hi
<span>Gamma91,<br />
</span><br />
Can you&nbsp;confirm if you can access your account via Hotmail website (or web mail for non- Hotmail related account issues) to send or receive email? However, there are 2 possible causes why you've encountered this error message.
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Incorrect POP3 settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) - check with your provider if it is required or not.
</span></li><li><span>Firewall is blocking the ports (usually port 25) - Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to
 do so.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Kindly check your POP3 settings, listed below are the information&nbsp;to configure your account.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>POP3 Server:
<strong><span>pop3.live.com</span></strong> (<strong><span>port 995</span></strong>)&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>SMTP Server:
<strong><span>smtp.live.com</span></strong> (<strong><span>port 25</span></strong>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please try to configure your account by following the steps provided in the Solution Article below:<br />

    <title>Latest update bricked my hard drive. What can I do&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cal3b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest update bricked my hard drive. What can I do&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So my Xbox was running perfect, no problems with my hard drive or the Xbox. Last week I powered it up and there was a mandatory update. I downloaded and installed it. The Xbox rebooted and threw up a hardware error code saying I need to contact support.
 I rebooted again and it booted into the homescreen, a message popped up letting me know there was a mandatory update available. I installed it again and again it rebooted. This time it worked I was able to use my Xbox after it updated. Next time I booted my
 Xbox up it did the same thing, I installed the update twice and it started working. Yesterday I picked up a couple games and booted the Xbox up to play. I got the hardware error again. I rebooted, it went to the home screen and told me that my hard drive is
 corrupted. Now the Xbox won't boot at all with the hard drive in it. I don't use my Xbox that much and had less than 100gb on a 250gb drive. The hard drive is a little over a year old I have never deleted anything off the hard drive so it really hasn't been
 used that much. I am very angry over this, the update obviously messed my hard drive up. It is an official Xbox hard drive, I have never had a hard drive break this quickly. Is there anything I can do to recover my saves? Does Microsoft cover damage done by
 their update?</p>
<p>The Xbox is a 4 gb slim that I later purchased an official Xbox 250gb hard drive.

<p>1. You can try to format the HD...this will pretty much delete it all (if it doesn't turn on with the HD in it, can't really do much)
</p>
<p>2. Call Xbox support, explain the problem and ask for their help. Software problems can usually only be fixed by the support teams. And if it is an offical Xbox Hd that shouldn't be a problem at all.
</p>
<p>From experience the best thing to do in situations like this is to send in your Xbox, or at least call them. It usually takes less than 2 weeks to get it back (and they send you a month free)</p>

<p>Sometimes the updates save onto the internal 4gb memory, try removing your hdd then try clearing the system cache for the 4gb device first, update without the hdd &nbsp;connected and then once that is finished power off your console then reconnect your hdd.</p>

<p>Thanks for the answers. Per oOo NATO oOo's suggestion I tried removing it clearing the cache, installing the update, rebooting, and installing the hard drive again. It seems to be working again. Before clearing the cache it wouldn't even boot up all the
 way with the HDD installed. </p>
<p>After I was able to boot with the HDD installed I formatted it. Hopefully it keeps working. Glad I was able to at least get some saves off it.

<p>If it stops working again here some thing I suggest: Do you have an magnets or anything that vibrates near it? That could be a problem. You can also try going to your storage and when your hovering over the hard drive put in this button combo: lb, rb, x,
 lb, rb, x. That will ask you if you want to delete the update. Go ahead an try that. If its working still than good for you!</p>

<p>It worked once. The next time I booted it up it went straight back to the error message with the hardware problem code. Looks like I need to call Xbox customer "service".

<p>Sam Pennie,</p>
<p>The majority of laptops have a Function (Fn) key and F2 combination that will enable or disable charging. There is often software from the manufacturer you can install as well as an option in the system's BIOS.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is to contact the system manufacturer for assistance since there is not an option provided though Windows.</p>

<h2>            Windows services do not automatically start on boot&#47;logon</h2>
                    Every time i boot up my computer and&nbsp; log in, my services do not start. i have to go to administrative tools in control panel and start each one manually. For example, i have to start the themes service, windows installer service, and automatic updates
 service EVERY time i start up my computer.&nbsp; It is a hassle and i would like my computer to start these by itself on boot.
<br />
I already have made sure that the service startup type is automatic.&nbsp;

<br />
The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
The Second Question of Windows Troubleshooting: what is the malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />

            I honestly have not seen this problem before, and I am a computer tech. If I were working on your computer, the first thing I would do is try to re-install iTunes and see if that gets those services back to where they are starting automatically. If it
 does, then that would tell me that whatever caused this problem is reversible. If not, then it would tell me that I have a&nbsp;system configuration or malware problem that must be fixed before the services can start working automatically again. So please go to
 the iTunes website, download the iTunes setup program, re-install it, re-start you computer, and let me know if&nbsp;the&nbsp;bonjour service is&nbsp;running automatically. Then, we'll go from there.&nbsp;

            hello HoSlayer<br />
i have seenthis problem before and TomJuan is correct in his assessment of un installing itunes
<br />
<br />
before you reinstall down load this program and run it look for bonjour or itunes if you find any trace of either program use this program to delete it

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t shut down-just restarts after short blue screen crash dump info collection</h2>
                    <p>I try to shutdown my windows 7 computer and the computer won't shut down (even though it says on the screen it is shutting down). &nbsp;It goes to a blue screen that doesn't stay up long enough for me to read the numbers or all the sentences (the last sentence
 says "collecting information for crash dump,<br />
&nbsp;and then restarts. &nbsp;After it restarts, sometimes it says windows recovered from an unexpected shutdown. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this problem and get my computer to shut down properly (and not restart each time)? &nbsp;I can turn it off by either unplugging it or pushing the button (the button that starts up the computer).</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Gallen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have come across this post and see that you have mentioned in your first post that "doesn't stay up long enough for me to read the numbers or all the sentences (the last sentence says "collecting information for crash dump, and then restarts."</p>
<p>
</p><p>For situation like this we have a feature in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Advanced startup options </a>&nbsp;called as <strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure.
</strong>By enabling this option your computer will not restart automatically and would let you read the error. Note it down and let us know about the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I see that you have&nbsp;found it little difficult to collect the dump files. If you wish our forum moderator will send you a private message in reply to this thread where you will get the step by step instructions to upload&nbsp;the dump files&nbsp;which would be
 easy for us to get an insight on the issue. Let us know if you we can send you a private message with the easy steps to upload a dump file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, adding to Shalini Sampath Kumar on July 7th 2014, I would like to tell you what exactly you have to look into event viewer to investigate the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get in the Event Viewer Window by following the article provided by Shalini Sampath Kumar, try these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select <strong>Windows Logs</strong> on the left side of the window.</p>
<li>
<p>You will see a number of sub-categories. Selecting any of these categories will bring up a series of event logs in the center of the screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Any BSOD errors are listed as “Error”.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Double click any found errors to investigate.</p>
<p>Here you will be presented with any relevant information regarding your errors. Often this will simply display the STOP code reported by the error. However, other errors or warnings could provide clues to your BSOD’s cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the same. We will be glad to help you.</p>

<br />
You could try posting the issue on the Emsisoft Forum and see what they have to say. Maybe it's a known issue:
<a href="http://support.emsisoft.com/forum/56-other-emsisoft-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.emsisoft.com/forum/56-other-emsisoft-products/</a><br />
<br />
As for the MalAware application itself, it only scans for malware. If it finds any, you'll be offered the opportunity to purchase their AV package to remove it, but the tool won't do that on its own.
<br />
<br />
What you can try doing now is to run System Restore and wind back the clock to a time prior to running the app.
<br />
<br />
To do that, proceed as follows:<br />
<ol>
<li>Click Start | Programs | Accessories | System Tools | System Restore.</li><li>Click "Restore my computer to an earlier time: and then click Next. <br />
</li><li>From the calendar which appears, choose a date prior to installing the application and then click Next.
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Windows will take a few mins to run after which the system will reboot. Provided the Restore was successful, you'll see a message to that effect.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Next, go to Start, Run and type: <b>winver </b>and click OK. You should see a window with your name as the registered user.
<br />

            Thanks for responding, J W. I've tried contacting Microsoft in every way, including live chat. Usually they just send me in a loop; when I finally managed to 'chat' online with a real person I was told that Microsoft would charge me $99(!) to 'fix' an
 issue that is none of my fault, with no guarantee of a permanent result. If nothing else, this exchange of emails gave me a clue as to why some people are resorting to piracy and illegal usage. No help there, I'm afraid.<br />

Hi Pearguy, <br />
<br />
Here's an alternative approach in case it helps: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/312295/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

However, be aware that when you navigate to: <b>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WinLogon\Notify</b> that there'll only be a default value in the right hand pane.

The RESETS subkey will be a folder and will be located under the "Notify" tree. <br />

            Hello again Xircal, <br />
Sorry for the delay, I wanted to try as many options as possible before reporting back. I spent more hours than I want to think about searching all over the web and, the bottom line is that so far nothing has worked. There are various hacks and bypasses but
 consensus seems to be that none are permanent fixes and some are likely to do more harm than good. As one guy put it
<br />
"..basically you're trying to beat Bill at his own game, and he didn't get to be a multi-billionaire by losing at it".<br />
The activation pop-up is still appearing with tireless efficiency counting down the days of usage left to me; down to 3 now at time of writing; It reminds me of one of those nightmare car alarms that can't be turned off once they start; I get the feeling I
 could atomize this pc and that damned reminder would still appear.. <br />
System restore won't work, and I've no way to know if that fact is to do with the activation issue or not. I tried it twice, choosing two different restore points, and each time when Windows re-booted itself I got the activation pop-up, followed by the message
 "System restore failed..." No explanation, Didn't want to waste more precious remaining usage time on abortive restore attempts so I did some googling to see if there's a system restore fix and discovered that - apparently&nbsp; - XP is known for having problems
 with the restore tool. <br />
Microsoft support didn't help, they just keep asking for money and/or sending me round in circles.<br />
Truth is that I simply don't know enough about computers to know what I'm doing or looking for. A friend of a friend has offered to bypass the issue for me. No idea yet how successful it will be but, assuming it's legal (ish) I'll post the results when I get
 my pc back.<br />
To be honest I'm now so fed up with Microsoft that the imminent XP support cessation is almost a relief as it's given me the boot up the backside that I needed to try Linux. Don't know how I'll get on with it, some say it's a bit of a shock to the system making
 the jump, but I've never actually heard anything bad about that OS.<br />
Anyway, thanks again for your input mate, I genuinely appreciate it. <br />

Hi Pearguy, <br />
<br />
It can be a bit of a jungle if you're a novice I must admit. I was in that position myself once upon a time and I know how frustrating it can be.
<br />
<br />
Anyway, Windows stores its activation data in two files called <b>wpa.dbl</b> and
<b>wpa.bak</b>. The latter is just a backup file, but both are located in C:\WINDOWS\System32.
<br />
<br />
Before going any further, you need to verify that Windows is configured to show file extensions. Proceed as follows to do that.
<br />
<ol>
<li>Hit Windows key + E to launch Windows Explorer.</li><li>Click "Tools" at the top and then click "Folder Options" in the menu which appears.
<br />
</li><li>In the next menu which appears, click the "View" tab. <br />
</li><li>Verify that "Show hidden files and folders" is checkmarked and "Hide file extensions for known file types" is not checkmarked.
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Here's a picture of how they both should look.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1db4e16-c13d-447f-8b5f-e2ce1be55f37" /><br />
<br />
If you have to change them, click Apply/OK afterwards to exit. <br />
<br />
Next, <br />
<ol>
<li>Hit Windows key + F to launch the Search tool. <br />
</li><li>Type or copy/paste: <b>wpa.dbl</b> and click Search.&nbsp;</li><li>Right click the file and choose "Open containing folder". <br />
</li><li>Close the Search tool because you don't need that anymore.&nbsp;</li><li>Right click the wpa.dbl file and go to Properties. <br />
</li><li>In the Properties menu, click the "Security" tab.&nbsp;</li><li>In the top menu, you'll see a list of users. Click the "SYSTEM" user to highlight it.</li><li>Are all the boxes checkmarked for the SYSTEM user or are some of them blank? If some are blank, which ones are they?
<br />
</li></ol>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> This is the latest fix that's working for Version 1803 breaking networks.  Please try it and report back:   
<br />
<br />- shut all computer and network gear down then start again. 
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />If not then start over and set it up again:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>

<br />
<br />Microsoft apparently has a workaround which does not require enabling SMBv1, for those who rely on the ability to 'browse' the network.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034314/smbv1-is-not-installed-by-default-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403431...</a>
<br />
<br />Explorer Network Browsing
<br />
<br />The Computer Browser service relies on the SMBv1 protocol to populate the Windows Explorer Network node (also known as "Network Neighborhood"). This legacy protocol is long deprecated, doesn't route, and has limited security. Because the service cannot function without SMBv1, it is removed at the same time.
<br />
<br />However, if you still have to use the Explorer Network in home and small business workgroup environments to locate Windows-based computers, you can follow these steps on your Windows-based computers that no longer use SMBv1:
<br />Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start). When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />All Windows devices within that subnet that have these settings will now appear in Network for browsing. This uses the WS-DISCOVERY protocol. Contact your other vendors and manufacturers if their devices still don't appear in this browse list after the Windows devices appear. It is possible they have this protocol disabled or that they support only SMBv1.
<br />
<br />Other things you can try:
<br />
<br />- shut all computer and network gear down.
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc

            <p>Hello Stephen,</p>
<p>Assuming you have the proper cable, yes, you can. In all probability you will need a VGA 15 pin cable to connect your monitor to your laptop. With any luck, your laptop should recognize your external monitor and shunt video to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't, or you need to adjust anything, go to Control Panel, Device Manager, and open that applet. You might have to check two places. The first is Display Adapters - your video card, which is likely onboard graphics part of your motherboard. The
 second is Monitors, which will be where your external monitor will display. What your needing to make sure of is that your video (Display Adapter) points to the external monitor (Monitors).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have specific questions, please post them here. Let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 taskbar &#39;always combine, hide labels&#39; option not working</h2>
                    The Windows 8 taskbar 'always combine, hide labels' option is selected, yet when I open outlook, explorer and Ms Office programs they appear on the taskbar as a new icon. How can I get the option I have selected to work as it is supposed to?

<p>

    <title>Upgrade from Windows 10 s to Windows 10 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrade from Windows 10 s to Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently purchased a Microsoft Surface Laptop, which comes with the Windows 10 S system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 S has prevented me from installing all apps that are not currently in the Microsoft store, this is extremely inconvenient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro by clicking in to the Microsoft store, but every time when I was trying to open up the Windows 10 Pro app in the store, the store window just disappeared. I have no problem opening up other apps
 in the Microsoft store, only with the Windows 10 Pro app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you advise how can I possibly upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot<br />
Scroll down to the bottom<br />
Click Windows Store Apps<br />
<br />
Click Run the troubleshooter<br />
<br />
When complete try opening the Store again.<br />
<br />
Also check if the Store works in another user account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Press Windows key + R<br />
Type: wsreset.exe<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.<br />
<br />
Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.<br />
<br />
You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:<br />
<br />
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/<br />
<br />
If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:<br />
&nbsp;Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive.
 Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Open Start, type: CMD<br />
Right click CMD<br />
Click Run as administrator<br />
<br />
Type each of the following then hit Enter<br />
<br />
taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv"multiple times<br />
net stop cryptSvc<br />
net stop bits<br />
net stop msiserver<br />
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old&nbsp;<br />
rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore<br />
rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download<br />
<br />
When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, make sure you check Windows Update and install all the latest updates.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Locks Up on Shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rzr22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Locks Up on Shutdown</h2>
                    Hi, I am stumped. I have tried and wasted a lot of time trying to fix this issue.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently built a computer for my brother. Here are the specs/parts:</div>
<div>Corsair 16GB Dual Channel DDR3 1600MHz SDRAM</div>
<div>Core i5-3570k 3.4GHz (LGA 1155)</div>
<div>MSI GeForce GTX 660Ti Power Edition</div>
<div>Gigabyte Intel Z77 LGA 1155 ATX Motherboard (GA-Z77X-UD3H)</div>
<div>Seasonic M12II 620w PSU</div>
<div>Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus</div>
<div>WD Caviar Black 1TB 7200RPM HDD</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>During shutdown, be it a restart, shutdown, or just pressing the power button, the Windows 7 shutdown screen would appear, the circle next to "shutting down..." would spin and after a few seconds would stop spinning. The computer would not completely shutdown,
 forcing us to hold the power button to turn it off. I even tried leaving the computer in its locked up state for over an hour and it did not shutdown. During this lockup time, the HDD sometimes sounded like it was still grinding away.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have googled the issue an tried a number of things. Here is what I have tried:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- I have run both System File Checker and CheckDisk.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- I have run CCleaner and cleaned applications as well as fixed registries.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- I tried running the hotfix below, but it said it did not apply to my system.</div>
<div>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977307?wa=wsignin1.0</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- I have run msconfig and have disabled ALL items under the startup and services tab.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- I have disconnected the optical drive from power and SATA.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am still experiencing somewhat frequent lockups during shutdown. Whenever I disabled all processes, I thought I had fixed it as it shut down normally after several shutdowns. Then it randomly started locking up again. I thought I had solved it a second
 time by disconnecting the optical drive. It shut down for 5-10 shutdowns normally until the VERY LAST attempt before I was going to start re-enabling processes it decided to lockup again. Now I am extremely confused and have no clue what to try next.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would you suggest reformatting?</div>
<div>Could this be a driver issue? I installed a number of programs and drivers that came with my Gigabyte driver CD. If so, what should I do?</div>
<div>Could this be an issue with the HDD? I do wonder if this HDD is going bad.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any assistance. If I need to clarify or give greater detail on anything, please let me know.</div>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I see that Windows 7 locks up on shutdown. I will help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.How long has this been occurring?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you would have more problems if the drive was bad, however, it’s worth suggesting to use the hard drive testing utility available from either the drive or computer manufacturers website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1.</b></p>
<p>You can try unplugging all non-essential hardware and restart the computer to see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2.</b></p>
<p>You could try system restore to go back to an earlier date. </p>
<p><b>System Restore</b>: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/system-restore</span></a></p>
<p><b>Important:</b> System Restore will not revert any of the non-system files like documents, email, music, etc. to a previous state. These types files are completely unaffected by System Restore. If your intention with this tool was to recover a deleted
 non-system file, try using a file recovery program instead of System Restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. </span></p>

<p>Hi patrickkruse,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often times users have more than one Skype account with the same email address, so when logging in to the account make sure that the Skype ID corresponds to the one sent to your email. If this does not solve your issue then please get in contact with a customer
 support representative and they will help you solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Juan R<br />
</p>

<p>Thanks Juan,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assumption was not correct, I don't have more then one Skype account. I did resolve the issue by contacting Microsoft via a chat session and the individual I conversed with was able to log into my account (something that Microsoft limits actual account
 holders from doing themselves) and restore my account balance. I must admit that I take issue with Microsofts approach in simply wiping my account balance from my Skype account. I have been a long time adopter of Skype and still hold a valid account. I make
 calls to establish and validate my account and in this case attempted to use Microsofts solution to click on the NON-EXISTENT links to restore my account. I expect more from a company like Microsoft.</p>
