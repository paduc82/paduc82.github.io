    <title>Macro shortcut is disappearing from Word 2010 Startup folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Macro shortcut is disappearing from Word 2010 Startup folder</h2>
                    Our software places a shortcut in the Word&nbsp;Startup folder to a&nbsp;macro located in our software's main program folder. With the introduction of Word 2010, this shortcut disappears from the Word Startup folder from time to time. Our software has always placed
 a shortcut in the Word Startup folder and we have never had a problem until Word 2010. We have been unable to determine why this is happening in Word 2010. It never happened in prior versions of Word. Has anyone experienced this problem and found a solution
 or does anyone have any ideas why this is happening? Thanks.

<p>I assume that by macro you really mean a template/document containing some vba code?</p>
<p>Why don't you install the template/document directly in the startup folder?</p>
<p>I cannot imagine that anything that Word is doing would be removing the shortcut.</p>

            Thanks for your response Doug. Yes you are right. It is a template that performs a data merge function. It takes data from our program and fills data merge fields in the Word doc. We did actually install the template in the Word Startup folder years ago.
 But we ran into issues with updating it for all users on a network so we changed to having a shortcut to it. This way we only have to update the template in our program folder and everyone is sure to get the updated version of the template. I agree with you
 about Word. I cannot imagine Word doing anything either. But we now have 2 different customers complaining of this issue since they upgraded to Office 2010. So I thought I would throw it out there to see if anyone has encountered this. Thanks again!

            Amazing I found this post. I'm having the exact same situation with Excel and Word. I have an Excel addin (*.xlam) for Excel based project management. The user can choose to open it manually or install it. The installation creates a shortcut in Excel's
 startup folder (XLSTART). This method has been working since Excel 2000 through 2002/2003 and 2007. After upgrading to 2010 the shortcut disappears app. every 24 hours.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>This solution is sold to several customers and only the customer who upgraded to 2010 reports "the installation doesn't work anymore" (and only the users at this customer who actually upgraded). I'm using Vista and my customer use Windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have conducted some tests with files in the startup folders. My startup folders are in %appdata%\microsoft:</div>
<div><br />
<div>C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART</div>
<div>C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\START</div>
<div><br />
<div>About files in this folder:</div>
<div>1) A normal textfile (mytextfile.txt) does not disappear.</div>
<div>2) A normal Excel file (Excelfile.xlsx) does not disappear.</div>
<div>3) A shortcut to this Excel file does not disappear.</div>
<div>4) I put a link to an addin in the startup folder. Then I deleted the addin so only the shortcut is left. This shortcut does not dispappear.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The shortcut can disappear WITHOUT Excel being opened: I start my pc (from hypernation). Outlook is now open. I check the shortcuts: OK. I start Word, write something and after 7 minutes I check again: The shortcuts in both Word/START and Excel/XLSTART
 is gone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I suspect it is some overly eager Office component that falsely identify a potential problem??? Or maybe even Outlook? Both my Excel and my Word addin has some Outlook integration.</div>
<div><br />
<div>More facts:</div>
<div>* when I upgraded the 'send as content' (vba&nbsp;ActiveSheet.MailEnvelope) reported an error.</div>
<div>* the mail merge with data in a table (listobject) failed. Only when I saved all files in 2003 format it worked.</div>
<div>* the two errors above has been corrected in a later Office update.</div>
<div>* I have another Excel addin that I have installed as addin (Files &gt; Options &gt; Addins etc). This continues to work as exptected.</div>
<div>* I use Office 365 and installed Office 2010 Pro Plus by download. My customer has a normal entreprise rollout.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know of several workarounds, including the 'proper' addin installation, but I will really be missing this shortcut feature if it is not fixed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any suggestions?</div>

            Thank you for the suggestion. I think you are right, but the kb is about not being able to view a image from Sharepoint in Outlook. Maybe you have another kb concerning the autorevision feature?
<div><br />
<div>But - my latest test indicates that the issue has been fixed in the standard Windows/Office updates. November 29 I placed a new shortcut in the startup folder - and it has not been deleted after 7 days. Before the shortcuts would be deleted every 24 hours.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi Phandler,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your sharing and we are glad to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, I link some table/chart and contents into&nbsp;presentations. Contents changed after source&nbsp;file change. When I reopen it, contents don't display well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To have a better understanding of your scenario, please share with me more info as below:</p>
<p>1. The detailed version number of your OS(Win+R&gt;type CMD&gt;click OK) and Office(File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Does this issue happen to all files even new created or only related ones?</p>
<p>3. Can any other users in your tenant reproduce this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neo</p>

<p>I can't actually link the workbook - it has a lot of internal information that I can't really remove (it would take a long tie to put in dummy info).<br />
<br />
I think I'm just going to have to remake my PPT and put both files on my desktop for the duration of the project. I don't have any problem unless I'm accessing the files from Onedrive anyway.</p>

    <title>Copy Data to Other Sheets&#39; Columns Based on Criteria - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rnunley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy Data to Other Sheets&#39; Columns Based on Criteria</h2>
                    <p>I have one Orders sheet and 12 Month sheets (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc).&nbsp; The Orders sheet has five columns: Dept, Vendor, Brand, Cost and Date.&nbsp; The Dept column has ten different options ie Truck, Car, RV, Boat, etc.&nbsp; The Orders sheet will have all the order data
 for an entire year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Month sheets have the same columns as the Orders sheet excluding the Dept and Cost columns. Instead of one column for Dept there are 10 columns, one for each of the options. These columns will be populated with the cost of each option.&nbsp; This makes a
 total of 13 columns on the Month sheets.&nbsp; Vendor, Brand and Date columns are A1:A3 and the Dept options columns are A4:13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to populate the Month sheets based on the Date column from the Orders sheet.&nbsp; For example, all the orders between Jan 1 and Jan 31 would appear on the Jan sheet, all the orders from Feb 1 to Feb 28 on the Feb sheet and so on for the remaining
 Month sheets.&nbsp; Depending on the option selected in the Dept column of the Orders sheet, I would like the associated cost to populate the corresponding options column on the Month sheet. For example, if on the Orders sheet an RV was entered at a cost of $35,000,
 that cost would be transferred to the Month sheet to the appropriate option column.&nbsp; In this case the RV column.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sum up, each row in the Month sheets would have the Vendor, Brand, Date and Cost in the appropriate option column.&nbsp; This data would be auto populated from the Orders sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a formula that makes this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>i have error handling on it but running without it was the only way to get the true error happening 'error "Automation Error the Server threw an exception,"'&nbsp;at line:</p>
<p>objmergedoc.MailMerge.OpenDataSource "G:\db\Employees\" &amp; [Forms]![001_Start]![Matrix] &amp; "\Entitlement.rtf", LinkToSource = True, ConfirmConversions = False</p>
<p>when i searched for this the best thing i found was that someone else was missing "M$ Exchange DLLs" when they had this issue but i havent started to look at that.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft OneNote no longer syncs with MS servers and will not allow me to sign in again.</h2>
                    
<p>I am hoping that someone here will be able to help me with a problem that I have just recently started to experience with Microsoft OneNote on my Nokia 700.&nbsp; This is the one MS app that I use quite often, as I rather like the layout/organization scheme it
 employs, so the fact that it has stopped working on my phone is extremely disappointing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Everything, including synchronization, has worked fine for some time until yesterday</strong>, when the program started to hang on synchronization.&nbsp; I therefore deleted my MS live account within OneNote on the phone ("Reset Application" option) with
 the intention of starting afresh by adding it once more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, now when I click on the "Sign In" button at the bottom center of the screen in OneNote, the program hangs at a white screen for a while (as if a web page is having trouble loading) and then either tells me that OneNote was "unable to sign me in
 at this time" (even though I never actually got to a sign-in screen) or that I have network connectivity issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The network connection is definitely not the issue</strong>, as I have repeated the same string of problems on my home, corporate and mobile data connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Is there perhaps something in the MS folder structure/cache that needs to be deleted?&nbsp; Thanks for any suggestions!</p>

<h2>            outlook for mac 2016 - repairing main profile fails</h2>
                    <p>When starting outlook I get the message "repairing main profile". After a minute I get the message "You need xxGB to repair this profile". I have enough space available. And still it doesn't rebuild ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: look for the "main profile" via spotlight</p>
<p>Tip2: remove older "rebuilding folders" to free some space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing or renaming the main profile probably will solve this, most mails are kept on the server. But then I loose a lot of rules and optimisations, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a good way to start a working day.</p>

<p>The error message implies that you do not have sufficient free space on your hard drive for the rebuild to succeed.</p>
<p>Any chance you could free up some ore space one way or the other?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, the main profile might not show up through a Spotlight search, but it's located here:</p>
<p>~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not 100% deleting the temp folders created through the rebuilding process will be enough. You'll probably need to remove far more data from your boot drive to be able to proceed.</p>

                    <p>I have a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter connected to an LG HDTV. It worked fine with my Surface PRo 3 on Windows 8.1 I am now running Windows 10 build 9926. When I hit Win+P I can see the device listed, and I can click connect. When I do I briefly see
 the screen, or sometimes just a cursor on a black background, then I am disconnected after about 3 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw an article that mentioned uninstalling the driver, but it mentioned that the driver would be listed under display adapters, and I only see my video card adapter there.</p>

<p>
</p><p>However - I believe it is out of date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft state in their website that the space is unlimited. http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows/outlook/email-storage-limits</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I could not find anywhere a way to even sign up and pay for the Hotmail paid version of 10GB. Do you know any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone knows why messages are rejected because of 'This message is larger than the current system limit or the recipient's mailbox is full. ;' - even if the amount of email I am receiving is not abnormal in any way?</p>

    <title>Enter Network Credentials box prevents access to files shared on home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasackley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enter Network Credentials box prevents access to files shared on home network</h2>
                    <p>My wife's PC has a shared folder that I put on her PC to allow us to share files on our home network. Both this Windows Evaluation version (build 9879) and my copy of Windows 8.1 on this PC insist on demanding me to "Enter Network Credentials" to access
 her file. No matter what user name and password combination I try I am still denied access. I have tried resetting values in the Advanced Settings of Network and Sharing Center per recommendations found on the internet. Nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can go to either of my 2 different versions (64 bit Windows 7 Home Premium and 32 Bit Windows 7 Professional) and freely exchange files with my wife's PC without being asked for anything. So, I can get onto one of my old Windows 7 PCs, get the
 desired file, for transfer to my wifes PC, from this (Windows 8.1 and Windows Tech Eval. OS) PC and copy them to her shared file with no problem. Question is, why do I have to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions to allow me to directly access my wife's shared folder from my "main" PC (this one with the new improved???? OS's on it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am trying to access a shared network drive via VPN. &nbsp;I get a prompt to "Enter Network Credentials" which is correct but no textboxes to actually enter the credentials. &nbsp;I've attached a screenshot. &nbsp;It never actually gives me the abilty to try credentials.</p>

            I have several saved credentials (but there is nothing for that specific purpose -- to access the shared drive I'm trying to access)....but they are all valid and they work for their purposes? &nbsp;For example, I have saved credentials for Outlook (Outlook
 via VPN works great). &nbsp;Its just when I try to access the shared drive from our network, it says I should enter credentials (which it should) but there are no textboxes to actually enter them. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Here's a more accurate screen shot of the problem when I try to map my network drive. &nbsp;Note how this tells me to enter my credentials but it doesn't give me a prompt to do so and it grays out the OK button. &nbsp;There are missing textboxes. &nbsp;It seems to be a
 simple UI bug -- easy to fix most likely:</p>

            <p>Odd, looks like a username \ password is remember somewhere and its trying that. I mapped a drive to a 2012 Server and that prompted for username \ password, entered that and it connected.</p>
<p>

            <p>First, select Tools | Options...</p>
<p>In the View tab, make sure that the&nbsp;'Worksheet Tabs ' check box is ticked, then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, perhaps the separator between the horizontal scroll bar and the sheet tabs has been dragged too far to the left. The separator looks like a small slider; the mouse pointer changes to two vertical lines with left- and right-pointing
 arrows when you move it over the separator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing to try: if the workbook window is not maximized within Excel, double-click its title bar to maximize it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you can try creating a new window on the workbook (Window | New Window).</p>

    <title>Why does my font size change on other computers in PowerPoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rynnix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my font size change on other computers in PowerPoint 2010&#63;</h2>
                    I have presentation were the font size keeps changing depending on which computer I open it on. Each computer has the same licensed font in use however the size of that font keeps changing. The text that changes is not linked to text boxes on the master
 slides. Those text boxes are stable in that the font stays consist; its only the a la carte pieces that change. And it only changes on some computers even though all of the ones I've tested have PP 2010. I've turned off auto-correct, but I see no way to lock
 my formatting. What else can I try? &nbsp;Thanks.

            They're Microsoft fonts that come with Office, like Calibri, and I've also double checked the font folders just in case someone attempted to be adventurous and started deleting something. The fonts are all there.

            <p>I went ahead and did the same thing (but not by accident. Since windows 10 is essentially window 8 with some tweaks to the start menu it should be easy to go from the Technical preview to the final build.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's wait for official word on that though, we don't know what kinds of changes are going to happen before release. This is definitely not ready for primetime, there is no reason to upgrade to windows 10 just to move the start menu and add cortana.

<h2>            Can&#39;t pull pictures or video off of my phone</h2>
                    I'm trying to pull my videos and photos off of my Windows phone but am having trouble syncing it with my computer. When I plug in my phone into my computer, no matter what app I go through, it doesn't see the photos and videos on my phone. Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi ScotMurdoch, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that your issue is related to the fact that you are not able to sync pictures and videos from your Windows Phone with a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also understand that you can see phone folders in Windows Explorer on your PC but you don't see any content in the folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that situation please sync your pictures and videos with OneDrive on your phone as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Select pictures and videos in question, tap on Share, select OneDrive and in OneDrive select folder where you want to locate the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Then, on a PC please sign in with your Microsoft Account that is set up on your phone to the following page:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>right-click on the file that you'd like to save on your PC and select "download".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let us know if that solved your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for posting!</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Agata</p>

    <title>Weird issue with the Outlook 2016 search history list disappearing but - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris_d93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird issue with the Outlook 2016 search history list disappearing but still being clickable when clicking one of the top search results</h2>
                    <p>First off: using outlook 2016, with windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let me walk through whats going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I type something in the search bar to filter through emails, such as [to:"Josh"] (without brackets) and emails filter out properly to match this. Now what happens next is what i find strange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1deaa76-9f11-40ab-b51d-3f6cffeaed3f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1deaa76-9f11-40ab-b51d-3f6cffeaed3f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I click out of the search box, so the history/suggestion box disappears, and it properly disappears. But if i click again, say to expand one of the drop down bars or an email, if i were to click anywhere where the box use to be, it treats as if the box never
 disappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e73c1e5e-d088-45d7-a14b-82b5d5e71848?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e73c1e5e-d088-45d7-a14b-82b5d5e71848?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>For example: in the above image, the list is invisible. but when i click say, last week where the list use to be, the list pops up again and treats it as if i wanted to search for whatever happened to be at that point in the suggestion dropdown. See below
 image for screenshot of when I click anywhere the suggestion list used to be.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c0ac51a-ef4a-4858-9a3f-cf2601e17c5c?upload=true" /></p>
<p>Notice the cursor isn't actively typing in the search box, so the list shouldn't pop up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a little irritating simply because i have to remember to click to the side of the "invisible" suggestion box if i want to select one of the higher up emails.&nbsp;</p>

            I would start with resetting the view - it will wipe out any customizations. 
<br />
<br />Which version and build of Outlook are you using? See File, Office Account for the information. Do you have all updates installed?
