<h2>            super difficult to cancel a subscription</h2>
                    <p>It is super difficult to cancel a subscription. I have an unlimited subscription years ago. Since a year ago, I am not using it any more. But Skype keeps charging 36 Euro from my Paypal account. I have been using one year to find out how to cancel the subscription,
 but still not succeed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the instructional page, I should have seen the purchased subscription on my left menu after logged in. But it is only a recommended subscription package, not clickable at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to get online live chat with skype customer service, but never got connected, always staying in the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to email the customer service, but where is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I am very very disappointed at the Skype service. Who can help me to cancel the subscription as SOON as possible?</p>
<p />

<p>actually what might have happened was in one game you had a clan different then a different game. You can have different clan tags per game. You can not be hacked unless you gave any of your information out about xbox live. Even in party chat watch out because
 alot of people are listening!</p>

<p>Xbox LIVE accounts cannot be hacked using some "hacking tools" as some people may claim. Keep your personal info save and be careful while playing MW2 and World at War.

<p>They can hack your windows ID, recover your gamer tag to their console and then use your credit card attached to your gamer tag. &nbsp;It happened to me. They drained all the money they could as fast as they couldon Microsoft Points. . Microsoft locked me out
 of gamer tag for 25 days and THEN refunded my money. &nbsp;They sent me an apology email and and a code for free 30 days of Microsoft XBOX live that did not even work. The best part was when they cut my service off again because my card was cancelled when they
 tried to bill it.. The same card that they let get compromised and I told them on &nbsp;two separate occasions I had canceled it.. I &nbsp;then had to pay $10 more dollars if I ever wanted to play any of my old saved games again for the my cancelled card charges. &nbsp;LOL

<p>Just to give some insight, it is possible to have an account hacked. Happens quite often actually. And you don't even have to give out any personal information at all. I, for one, have never given any account info to anyone in real life or even on websites
 / computers / written down on a piece of paper...and yet my friends and I got hacked and locked out of our accounts for 24 hours. When able to log back in the next day, we found the same taunting message from the hacker that temp. banned us. After exiting
 the message our systems froze, had to re-boot, and the message was gone. I may not be able to speak for them, but I know nobody has my info. other than anyone working at XBL. So either the previously posted responses claiming it's impossible are mistaken,
 or we're all having our accounts screwed with by XBL employees. And seeing is that I'm sure an employee of this company would never do that, I have to go with hackers on this one.</p>
<p>For a more in depth discussion of hackers on XBL, be sure to visit my thread 'Xbox Live Hackers' (located in general discussion, same as this thread).</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update for version 1803 was unable to be completed</h2>
                    <p>Why have there been so many Avira AntiVir issues dating back to 2017, NOT being addressed by Microsoft? Users receive messages that some apps need to be uninstalled. The app was NOT installed by the users and is not listed under programs available to uninstall.
 The message also states the programs need to be uninstalled because they aren't compatible with the upgrade. My HP Notebook received the first failed message in mid-June and will not upgrade to this 1803 version. I spent many hours on line with MS support,
 without any success for case number #*****. I asked to speak to his supervisor, but was given the opportunity. I expressed my frustration with Microsoft in NOT providing a resolution to this on -going problem. Your MS representative Walter claimed this was
 a unique problem, but the blogs and your MS user forums say otherwise. Our local university IT professionals identified 5 Avira programs/files on the hard drive, deleted them, rebooted the system and these programs were NOT deleted. Looking for a solution.</p>

</p><p>Before I use this next suggestion to&nbsp;visit this <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">article</span></strong> and look for
<strong>using the tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10</strong> section, I would like to know
<strong>WHY</strong> Microsoft has not addressed this for their Windows 10 customers. I have spent countless hours working to resolve this, searching your websites, blogs, forums, virtual and chat lines, MS technical experts and without a solution. The download
 link AppRPS.zip was dated 3/14/2018, it was just now suggested in August and it did not resolve the issue. As I said in my previous post, users forums have been having this problem since late in 2017. MS does not seem interested in a realistic solution for
 their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate feedback and a workable solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I understand your sentiments on this, but this issue has already been address before. Based on the update history provided, all error codes that you have encountered where all point out to a network connection issue. It seems that you were not connected
 because a duplicate name exists on the network. Go to System in Control Panel to change the computer name, and then try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest using the network troubleshooter. Performing it will&nbsp;<span>diagnose and fix common connection problems.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To run the Network troubleshooter</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type&nbsp;<span><strong>Network troubleshooter</strong></span>, and then select&nbsp;<span><strong>Identify and repair network problems</strong></span>&nbsp;from the list of results.</li><li>Follow the steps in the troubleshooter and see if that fixes the problem.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn’t fix your connection problem, try these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reset the TCP/IP stack</li><li>Release the IP address</li><li>Renew the IP address</li><li>Flush and reset the DNS client resolver cache</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To run these networking commands in a command prompt window</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type&nbsp;<span><strong>Command prompt</strong></span>,&nbsp;press and hold (or right-click)&nbsp;<span><strong>Command prompt</strong></span>, and then select&nbsp;<span><strong>Run as administrator</strong></span><strong>&gt;&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>Yes</strong></span>.</li><li>At the command prompt, run the following commands in the listed order, and then check to see if that fixes your connection problem:
<ul>
<li>Type&nbsp;<span><strong>netsh winsock reset</strong></span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span><strong>Enter</strong></span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span><strong>netsh int ip reset</strong></span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span><strong>Enter</strong></span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span><strong>ipconfig /release</strong></span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span><strong>Enter</strong></span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span><strong>ipconfig /renew</strong></span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span><strong>Enter</strong></span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span><strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong></span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span><strong>Enter</strong></span>.</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>After performing the steps above, try updating your computer again and see if it makes any difference.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>You may understand my sentiments, however, I seriously doubt you/Microsoft feels my futile frustrations with the efforts expended on my part regarding this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Changed the computer name, tried again with no success.</p>
<p>2. Ran Network troubleshooter, selected Identify and repair network problems.(it gave no list of results).</p>
<p>3. Followed Command prompt (as administrator), Ran all the commands in order (as suggested).</p>
<p>4. Restarted&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Attempted to run update. Update failed @ 49% with same message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some apps need to be unistalled</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; Avira Antivir</strong></p>
<p>I appreciate your efforts on this issue, but am having real doubts about ever getting a resolution.</p>
<p>This is a home computer used by two retirees who are not IT professionals. We need this computer to operate correctly and efficiently as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really appreciate your patience in this, David. Upon searching, we found a utility that will allow you to delete/remove hidden applications in the registry. It will

show you what programs are configured to run during system bootup or login.&nbsp;</span>You can visit this
<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to know more details about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>IMPORTANT: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article.</em></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Does Not Recognize 2nd Core in Processor</h2>
                    <p>How do I get Windows 10 to recognize that I have a dual core Intel processor?&nbsp; Since I installed Windows 10 from Windows 8.1, with the same third party applications, my PC has become very sluggish, and takes a lot of time to handle input / output in common
 tasks such as Microsoft Excel (latest version as a service), Microsoft Word, and even Gmail in Chrome.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look in Task Manager, CPU, the System reports only one core, not the two that my Intel processor has. I have 16 GB Ram.&nbsp; Often the CPU status will report 80 - 90% but memory use seems to stay well below 50%.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried complete power down / and startup with no Chrome initialization, and just using Edge for the browser, but still have the same issues.&nbsp; I have not changed any other 3rd party apps such as virus scan, One Drive, etc.&nbsp; It appears that the main
 difference between Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 is that Windows 10 is not recognizing the second core.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some setting I need to change to have it recognize the second core and speed up?</p>

            <p>I am having the exact same problem with my Intel Celeron 900 2.2 GHz Dual Core processor on my HP G56. I understand that it is a Wal-Mart computer and obviously won't be as nice or as quick as some other custom jobs (in fact I despise having to use this
 thing as much as I do), but come on! I'd like to be able to use my computer without the&nbsp;<em>one available core
</em>being overwhelmed<em>.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to like Windows 10, but due to it only recognizing the single processor core, I cannot get it to run at a decent speed (it hangs and freezes, and it takes me ten minutes to do something I should be able to do in two).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me you guys have a fix for this.</p>

            No compatibility issues that I can see, and there are no updates either. Windows 10 just seems to refuse to identify my processor's second core. In the computer About page, it shows the proper 2 cores, but when I go into Task Manager and look at the Logical
 Cores, there's only one being used. This is seriously hampering my ability to do anything on this computer, and I really need this thing to run correctly.

<br />
<br />Right click that file, choose Open With - Choose another App - Paint
<br />
<br />In Paint, click Resize
<br />
<br />Set that to 50% width (percentage)
<br />
<br />Save that file with a new name
<br />
<br />That will make the file size 1/4 of what it was (0.75MB)

            While, as Dave M. says, you can use Paint. I prefer the free IrfanView image editor. Google or Bing that name to find its download site. It will have the same name as the product, but with .com on the end.

            Thanks for replying but I may not have used the correct terminology.&nbsp; I took photos with my iPhone SE with IOS12.&nbsp; I downloaded the images to the hard drive on my laptop.&nbsp; I want to email several images at one time but the file size is too large.&nbsp; I want
 to reduce the size of the image FILE not crop the photo.&nbsp; How can I save the image at a lower resolution, if that is what is necessary to reduce the file size?

    <title>Save Files tied to Gamertag&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buu92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Save Files tied to Gamertag&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>First off, sorry if this is posted in the wrong place. The new site layout is atrocious and I can't navigate through it at all. If somebody's gonna move it, please drop me a PM with a link to the new location. Thank you.</p>
<p>Now, I have a simple question: Are game savefiles tied to gamertags? When I got my copy of Fable 2 and it refused to run, I decided to delete and recover my gamertag, in hopes that the game works. Luckily it did. Now today I noticed that all my savefiles
 are gone, apart from the games I have played after that recovering thing and Fable 2 (all new games btw).</p>
<p>I have a HDD where all the saves are stored on and all of them are gone, all I played prior to Fable 2. So, if I'm gonna recover the gamertag again, would I lose my current progress on the new games as well? If that's not the case, why else would my files
 be gone? I can imagine them being tied to the tag as saves are listed with your tag in the HDD menu, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>I mean, ****, all the time and effort I have put into the games are gone due to a game being **** enough to not run properly. I don't want to repeat this mistake again and wanna know beforehand.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>When you deleted your gamertag you likely picked the "Delete Profile and Items" option. This of course deletes your profile and saves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you'd picked "Delete Profile Only" then your saves would have been left in peace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ps. You don't need to delete your gamertag in order to recover it. Just sign out and pick the recover option, then go through the steps as normal. This would prevent accidentally picking the wrong option again.</p>

<p>Damn, there is a "Delete Profile and Items" option? I must have not paid enough attention then.</p>
<p>Looks like it's all my fault then. Damnit. Thanks for the answer, it at least comforts me knowing that the console didn't decide to do this act on its own or something. *sigh*</p>
<p>Somebody can lock this then.</p>

<p>Both are too old. SQL Server 2005 may work if you install the Sp3 for SQL Server 2005. But with SQL Server 2000 you have no chance. You can run in inside a XP virtual machine.<br />
<br />
Also ask the question in the SQL Server forums:</p>

            <p>hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;in vista the defrag process runs quietly in the background</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>unfortunately in vista&nbsp;it does not provide a graphical interface to show the progress&nbsp;as it did in xp</p>
<p>for that you will need 3rd party defrag programs</p>
<p>read the reviews about these <strong>FREE </strong>Defrag Programs below&nbsp;and choose which one you prefer to use</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes.</p>
<p>How large is the volume being defragmented? How much free disk space on that volume.</p>
<p>I recommend you try cCleaner and remove older less important restore points. This could make defragmenting the volume much easier.</p>
<p><span>Select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Disk CleanUp to empty your Recycle Bin, remove Temporary Internet Files and other selected options. I also recommend you click on the More Options tab, System Restore and remove all but the latest
 System Restore point. Run Disk Defragmenter.</span></p>
<p><span>Using the System restore option is most appropriate when your system is running slow and you need to increase free disk space on your C partition. If you have errors which might be resolved using System Restore to put your system settings back to before
 the error first occurred do not use this option.</span></p>
<p><span>If more than one person uses the computer and they have their own user Log on you need to run Disk CleanUp in each user profile to remove all unwanted files.
</span></p>
<p><span>A better programme than Disk CleanUp is cCleaner. Removing System Restore points can be important if you have limited free disk space. The ability to remove them is one of the Tools options. You can selectively remove those created at less important
 times. </span></p>
<p><span>cCleaner also comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors.</span></p>

    <title>Problems installing Far Cry on Vista 64 bit machine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djgriffin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems installing Far Cry on Vista 64 bit machine</h2>
                    I have a vista 64 bit machine (SP1).&nbsp; I have "Far Cry". I have plenty of speed, memory and&nbsp;all of that. When I begin the installation process I get the error "run setup32.exe on 32 bit windows, or run setup64.exe on 64 bit windows!". There is no "setup64.exe"
 on the disc. I have tried running it in XP compatible mode but that doesn't make a difference. I have been to the manufacturers website and they don't seem to have anything that fits this particular issue. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.<br />
Thanks, <br />
DJ

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The error
</span><span>run setup32.exe on 32 bit windows, or run setup64.exe on 64 bit windows
</span><span>is because the setup .exe is not matching with the vista 64 bit operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>Probably during the installation of the game, it should be using the setup32.exe file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to search for the setup64.exe file on the disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not able to find, then would suggest replacing the disk.</span><span>
 There are several sites and this one is for the manufacturer.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on issue description, it seems that the options of right click on Address bar has been changed. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has the default options of right click on Address Bar same and no changes are made. Similarly different options are enlisted when you right click on other folders.</p>
<p>'Copy Address' and 'Copy Address as Text' options are not included on Address Bar when right clicked by default.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you face any issues on Windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Win7 64bit doesn&#39;t enter sleep mode when WSD-device is on</h2>
                    I have a Win7 64-bit laptop and a Samsung AIO. AIO is connected with USB to the router, the laptop connects to the router with WiFi.
<div>The device works perfectly well when connected as a WSD, but when trying to enter sleep mode only turns the display off, while power indicators and cooler continue working.</div>
<div>I've heard of Vista's fix for this issue, or probably any other things will work?</div>

            <div>Dear Amit,</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem that I've mentioned is pretty much common for Win7 users (see by yourself:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.ru/search?q=WSD+print+device+is+preventing+the+machine+from+entering+standby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.ru/search?q=WSD+print+device+is+preventing+the+machine+from+entering+standby</a>),
 and may I be in doubt that standard procedures will work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I didn't know what exactly is preventing my laptop from sleeping, I’ve even reinstalled Windows 2 times figuring out when the issue arises. I’ve also tried to restore the laptop, roll back the drivers. I’ve checked advanced power options and played
 with them, I’ve also asked the laptop to show what prevents it from sleeping (via cmd powercfg commands) where no results were displayed. Now I know for sure, that when I'm connected to the networks where my WSD is located, computer won't sleep.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As to your questions. To put the laptop into sleep mode I may do one of the following things: I press the button, I choose "Sleep" in start menu, I close the lid. Anything leads the display to turn off, but neither indicators, nor coolers won't stop working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>WSD is a Samsung's AIO device. I use the latest software from their website. I tried to use the software from Windows Update, which is a little bit older version, but I didn't see any difference.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It probably would have been the problem of the device, as you said, but just a few days before everything used to work perfectly with the same device and laptop (I've changed my laptop's HDD to SSD, and reinstalled Windows from the official Samsung CD).
 The Power troubleshooter doesn't see any errors as well as the Printer troubleshooter. The sleep settings are set to the defaults.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I’m more or less familiar with these basic tricks, and you can be sure that I’ve tried them before writing here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Don’t you know, what were the fixes needed for Vista to approach this issue? I believe, that the problem should be the same.</div>

<h2>            Change the size of the photo displayed on the lock screen</h2>
                    <p>Since we installed Windows 10 on our desktop the lock screen appears and the photo&nbsp;is gigantic.&nbsp; How do I remove the lock screen or can the size of the photo on the lock screen be made smaller?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, all.</p>
