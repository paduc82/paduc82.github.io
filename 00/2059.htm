<p>Documents are created in Word, not Excel, which creates Workbooks.&nbsp; Hence, my instructions related to doing what you asked for in Word.&nbsp; However, just checking now with Excel, it seems that the process is similar in Excel.&nbsp; You need to have created a template
 in which you customize the QAT and then save it.&nbsp; Then if you create a workbook from that template, that workbook, when first created and when subsequently opened (on the computer on which the template resides) will have the customizations to the QAT available
 for use.</p>
<p>There is one difference however with Excel in that it does appear to be possible to individually customize the QAT for individual workbooks, not just for individual templates as is the case in Word, where you cannot customize the QAT at individual document
 level.&nbsp; Another difference however is that in Excel, customizations at the template and workbook level are added to those made for All documents (sic) Default, so you can end up with more than one copy of the same command on the QAT.</p>
<p>-- Hope this helps.</p>

<p>The document that I am using was created simply as a blank worksheet and not based on any one template except I suppose the default template. So at that point I'm thinking that I need to save my worksheet as a template and then base my current worksheet
 on the newly created template. Is that logic correct? What is the step by step procedure to accomplish my goal in Excel?</p>
<p>Your help is indeed appreciated.</p>

            If you had installed it on a computer and activated this, then you don't require a key again. As Microsoft activation servers store a digital license after the first activation and this digital license will be used for activations on other installations. It will not ask for product key again.
<br />
<br />You will have to first deactivate Office license which was installed on old computer otherwise it will be counted as a license. Hence, if you were allowed installation on one computer, you will not be able to activate on new computer. If your license was for say 5 computer as in case of Office 365 Home, now your validity will be for 4 computers.
<br />
<br />Hence, deactivate first and then install and activate.
<br />
<br />1. Deactivate your existing installation - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deactivate-an-Office-365-install-767E3560-96ED-4B1C-806D-2FE01C529B1B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deacti...</a>

            First we need to know if you took the little used option in Office 2013 and "registered" your license with your email account.  Sounds like you haven't. 
<br />
<br />So, log in to the myaccount site with your email address/password. Check to see if Office 2013 is assigned to your email address. My guess is that it isn't.  In that case you will need the 25 character Office 2013 product key.  After you you run the 2013 installer you should be prompted for the 25 character product key.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work you are going ot have to try a phone activation instead of internet activation. 
<br />
<br />When you phone in, don't reply to the initial prompts.  Just KEEP WAITING until it eventually offers you the option of talking to the "service rep".  Explain that you are transferring to a new computer. They should then allow the activation to go through.
<br />
<br />
<br />Here is help for a common errors you could encounter during phone activation:

<p>I just upgraded to Outlook 2010 w/ BCM... Really nice so far. But several functions are faded out. Examples, Insert Screenshot, Clipart, shapes, etc. Mainly Screenshot. I checked the settings for that menu and they are enabled, but each individual function

<p>Do you have the cursor in the body of the email message?</p>
<p>You cannot insert those items into the To..., Cc..., Bcc... or Subject: of an email message so that are disabled when the cursor is in those areas, but when you move the cursor to the body of the message, they will be enabled if the message is formatted
 as HTML or Rich Text (Format Text tab&gt;Format).</p>

            <p>I did have the same problem, but now everything is good. I tried lots of possible solutions, but I
<em>believe</em> that the changes below did the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Make sure that you are not exceeding any of the limitations of SkyDrive Pro / OneDrive for Business. I tried OneDrive for Business, but I wanted all my files stored both locally&nbsp;and in the cloud. With over 100,000 files, I was forced to switch back
 to the basic/personal version of OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In MS Word ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>File &gt; Options &gt; Save &gt; Save documents &gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;UN-check &nbsp;"Show additional places for saving ..."</p>
<p>&nbsp; CHECK &nbsp;"Save to Computer by default"</p>
<p>
</p><p>File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Save &gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; UN-check &nbsp;"Copy remotely stored files onto your computer, and update the remote file when saving</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, for Windows 8/8.1 ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC Settings &gt; OneDrive &gt; File Storage &gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn OFF "Save documents to OneDrive by default"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck. &nbsp;If the above doesn't work, reply accordingly and I will figure out what else I did that made the difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. As far as I can tell, Microsoft engineers suggest the following&nbsp;for virtually every type of problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Repair MS Office</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Run SkyDrive/OneDrive troubleshooter</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Restart SkyDrive/OneDrive processes</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Try using a different MS Account</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Try while logged out from all MS Accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, NONE of these approaches has EVER fixed any problem with MS Office. On the other hand, I did solve&nbsp;one Office/OneDrive problem by performing a drive-wipe and clean install of Windows and MS Office.</p>

                    <p>I have Photoshop CS4 installation disks that worked with Windows 7.&nbsp; After install of Windows 10 the Setup program does nothing (running as Administrator).&nbsp; No window opens, no error message.&nbsp; Running WinBootStrapper just tells me to use Setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started using Windows 10 due to a HDD failure, so I first loaded Windows 7 (64 bit)&nbsp;as a clean install and then upgraded to Windows 10. Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi Gravey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to know that you are unable to install Photoshop CS4 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Which build are you using?</li><li>Do you face any other issues installing other apps or programs?</li><li>Have you logged in using Microsoft account or local account?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>I suggest you to try to install the app in Clean&nbsp;Boot&nbsp;and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.<br />

<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Note: </span></strong>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" in the above link.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You also need to check if those disks given by Adobe are compatible with Windows 10 or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

            <p>I started with build 10122 I think, but have tried the setup on builds up to 10162.&nbsp; So far no other programs have had a problem installing or running under Windows 10 (although I am having difficulties with web browsers under 10162).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both Windows account and local account, with same results.&nbsp; Doing a clean boot makes no difference either.&nbsp; I also have copied the CS4 files to the desktop and tried the install from there (that's how I installed under Windows 7).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am reading other insiders talking about using CS4 so it must be compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; I am wondering if there is something in my computer environment that is needed, such as Java or something that has not been loaded on my machine?</p>

            I had already tried this approach with no good results.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried both Vista and Windows 7 compatibility.&nbsp; its a shame a single program setup&nbsp;problem will cause me to revert back&nbsp;to Windows 7.

            I tried this. Unfortunately, when it reaches the point where it is going to install Photoshop, Flash, InDesign, etc. the same message appears: Installation failed. The error message is 1603. Another thing that did not work is changing the permissions on
 the spool color drivers, as suggested in another post.

<p>
</p><p>My original media turnouts to be an upgrade version of CS4&nbsp;that I downloaded from the Adobe store in 2009.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my lasts post I re-downloaded CS4 from Adobe (yes it is still available to&nbsp;download - you do not need to log into your account to&nbsp;complete the download).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fresh download installed flawlessly first it asked for my CS4&nbsp;serial number, then it asked for my Elements 4 serial number. Luckily I&nbsp;still had that&nbsp;serial number&nbsp;in an email from 2006!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, my CS4 upgrade purchase&nbsp;and&nbsp;my Elements 4 purchase&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer appear in my "Purchased Items" in my Adobe account. Huh, wonder why that is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, hope this helps someone.</p>

    <title>New SW update issues on my Nokia Asha 311 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n_311  say:</h3>
<h2>            New SW update issues on my Nokia Asha 311</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night I received update for my Nokia Asha 311. Current configuration after update is as below,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SW Details<br />
V 07.36<br />
16-05-13<br />
RM-714<br />
(c) Nokia</p>
<p>Content: mh_059F7M6<br />
V 07.36<br />
16-05-13<br />
RM-714<br />
(c) Nokia</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upgrade via OTA was smooth without any interruptions and phone restarted after the upgrade. I noticed that few new games were installed. But it deleted my Whatsapp application. Also on tapping on Twitter it shows Application Not Found error. Facebook worked
 fine. Mail for Exchange which I had installed from Nokia Store a month back shows the same error as Twitter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anybody throw some light on the above issues?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will Factory reset make them work? What are the implications of Factory reset to my current contacts data?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>factory reset would wipe out the contacts from the phone, so if you do that, make sure your personal data is backupped first (either with Nokia Suite or via "settings -&gt; sync and backup" on your phone).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also did you try reinstalling the mentioned apps from Nokia Store (there should be all there)? in the new SW release, launchers for Whatsapp &amp; MfE should have been included + new version of Twitter &amp; Facebook clients. Did those appear to the phone?</p>

<p>if after removing/reattaching the phone battery the situation remains the same, you may need to take the phone to a Nokia Care service point for reflashing.

I did reinstall WhatsApp from Store. In case of Twitter, I downloaded Twitter for Nokia, which created another copy of existing application. So now I have 2 Twitter apps (icons differ a bit), but on selecting them same application is opened. So not sure what
 is happening. Have downloaded Facebook, but couldnt find anything upgraded about it.<br />
<br />
New issue is, my gmail mails are not getting synced under Mail app. Previously I had all mails, after this upgrade the mail app asked me to configure again, but its not syncing mails.

                    <p>I have an issue where if I open an office file attached to an email, (or try to preview it) then the office application fails to start. If the target application is already running (eg Word is running) then the attachment opens perfectly well. This applies
 to hyperlinks for Internet Explorer and all office documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to set the COM settings, the privacy mode etc and none have made it work. I have uninstalled office and reinstalled it, yet the issue remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I run outlook in safe mode, then the issue is resolved, so I have disabled all COM add-ins (none are ticked or active) yet the issue still occurs in normal mode of outlook.</p>

<h3> thelittleonefr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incoming calls put Skype on hold, android.</h2>
                    <p>So my fiance and I use Skype to communicate over our android devices, (and pc's) and for some strange reason since the new update any time we receive a phone call on our android devices, from a dialled number outwith Skype, our Skype calls automatically
 get put on hold. We cannot chose to ignore the call and continue our conversation, or say "I need to take this" as it's ringing because Skype has automatically been put on hold. So we need to refuse the call, then come back to Skype, take it OFF hold, and
 say whether or not we're going to call the person back who just phoned us.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>How do you fix this so that a Skype call is NOT put on hold when receiving a call from our cells?&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has been going on since the major update this year completely changing the skype experience. We have both uninstalled and reinstalled it, cleared our history, cache and cookies, and I have even had a new phone. It happens when I am talking from my pc
 while my fiance is on skype to me from his android device. The only time this does not happen is when we are both using the desktop version of skype because obviously we don't receive calls through that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Hmmm, if you're talking about the search in these forums, my opinion of that is hmmgn znmonng wnmonz zhgfdkl... I'm biting my tounge.&nbsp; I use
<strong>Google</strong> search whenever possible because it has always worked very well for me, unlike the search in these forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Years ago I worked with a mainframe search engine called <em><strong>Stairs </strong>
</em>which did a great job for searches, probably few have heard of it these days.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Like I said, I use Google for search in Windows 10 and 7.&nbsp; I've used Bing, and it's OK, but no better than Google.&nbsp; I found a bio for Dona at Wikipedia here:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dona_Sarkar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dona_Sarkar</a> , but I'm still not clear what search you're referring to.&nbsp; Maybe Cortana?&nbsp; I'm not a fan of that either - humbug!&nbsp; :)</p>

            The search box coexists with Cortana, but Cortana is not the search (she uses it).&nbsp; The search I am talking about is the main Windows search, found both in the "Cortana" box and in all File Explorer windows as well as other places throughout the Windows
 10 GUI.&nbsp; I am not talking about browser searching.&nbsp; I am talking about Windows searching.

<h2>            Going on a trip and would like to delete all my sign-ins</h2>
                    
<p>Original title:&nbsp;<strong>How do I delete all my sign-ins on websites that I usually visit. I'm taking my laptop on a trip and I want to delete/remove all my sign-ins just in case my computer gets stolen.</strong></p>
<p>I'm looking to delete all my saved sign-ins on websites that I usually visit on a regular basis. I went to Control Panel and Internet Options and deleted everything on the list, temporary internet files, cookies, history, passwords, etc. Yet when I restarted
 my computer but I am still signed into Yahoo for example, when I go to my bank website my bank ID sign-in is still there waiting for me to enter password. I just want to delete or remove all "saved" information such as sign-ins, etc basically everything so
 I would have to re-sign in with an ID. I don't want anything there so if my laptop is stolen there is nothing for people to see. iTunes sign-in, yahoomail sign-in, etc.</p>

<p>Just to be sure you selected these options:&nbsp; in Internet Explorer, click <strong>
Tools</strong> -&gt; <strong>Internet</strong> <strong>Options</strong>.&nbsp; Click <strong>
Delete</strong>.&nbsp; Make sure Preserve Favorites websites data is <strong>not</strong> checked, and make sure the other options are
<strong>all</strong> checked.&nbsp; Then click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>There's also something called Windows Vault.&nbsp; Click <strong>Start</strong>, type
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Vault</strong> in the search field, and click the
<strong>Enter</strong> key.&nbsp; You can delete any saved credentials in here as well.&nbsp; To do so, click on the arrow at the end of the credential.&nbsp; It should give you the option to
<strong>Remove from Vault</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a great trip!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 15 for Mac not displaying contacts correctly</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed the new outlook for mac and my contacts, which have been renamed as "people" in the new version won't display correctly. &nbsp;I've tried everything and spent 1.5 hours on the phone with support. &nbsp;We rebuilt the databases, tried a fresh install,
 everything that the support rep could think of and nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing this issue? &nbsp;I have provided a screen shot which shows my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Scott</p>

<p>I'm also interested in finding a fix for this one as I have the same situation. Additionally, when I search for someone I can get his/her chat history. The default view, without any search is left hanging with the spinning dots.</p>
<p>This whole IM sidebar works correctly on OneDrive page. It just doesn't work on the Outlook.com site.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 Crashes when exporting Calender to Excel</h2>
                    <p>I work in IT and have a user that wants to export their Outlook 2010 calender to an Excel file.&nbsp; The green bar will go about a quarter of the way and then a box pops up saying "Microsoft Outlook has stopped working".&nbsp; First I tried exported 4 months worth
 of the calender, then I tried selecting just one week of the calender and also tried selecting two days that have nothing in the calender and it will not work any of those ways.&nbsp; I did run&nbsp;SCANPST which found and repaired 62 errors.&nbsp; I then ran SCANPST again
 and it found no errors.&nbsp; OS is Windows 7 Pro 64 bit.&nbsp; Not sure what to try next.</p>

            Obviously you will have&nbsp;you files backed up to offline storage drives. Otherwise you are at risk from hard drive failure, theft or viruses like crypto lock. Just update these and copy to the files to the new Win 10 PC.

            <p>Backup the files to an external hard drive and transfer 'em over. &nbsp;Connect both systems on the same LAN, share the folders the files are in and download them to the new system. &nbsp;Make an ethernet crossover cable, connect it between the two systems and do
 as I said for systems on the same LAN. &nbsp;Backup your files to a cloud server and download them to the new system. &nbsp;Purchase (or look for a free alternative) software designed to migrate files to new systems. &nbsp;Hire a tech to transfer the files for you. &nbsp;Remove
 the hard drive from your old system, put it in the new system and copy the files over. &nbsp;Put the drive from the old system in an external enclosure, connect it to the new system via USB or eSATA and copy the files over. &nbsp;Go old school and backup the files to
 CD, DVD or BluRay and copy them over. &nbsp;Use a USB thumb drive and copy over as many files at a time as the thumb drive can hold. &nbsp;Pay the teenager next door to copy the files over (Ya may want to delete the porn first... Dang teenagers). &nbsp;Send the files, one
 at a time, to yourself via e-mail. &nbsp;I'm sure I'm missing a few more ways... &nbsp;Good luck!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Example, if I open OWA in Internet Explorer 11 on a Windows 7 machine and OWA is hosted on Exchange 2013, the HTML copy/paste from IE or any other browser to OWA does not work.</p>
<p>In case I open OWA in chrome or change OS to Windows 10, the copy paste from IE/Chrome works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please suggest.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE uses security zones with restricts access to copy and paste functions of a web browser based on which IE security zone a host is mapped to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also prevent copy/paste in other web browsers by adjusting their security settings for each website. Other web browsers do not have security zones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In IE, go Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default" to reset your IE security settings back to their default settings set by your company's IT department. Save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails may also contain ActiveX controls that try to over-ride IE's security zone settings for copy/paste functionality... ActiveX controls are not allowed to run in emails you view in IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the email contain a button or a hyperlink to copy/paste....?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the built-in keyboard shortcuts (ctrl+c = copy, ctrl+v = paste) if your IT department has configured your IE security settings to allow it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can determine which IE security zone your OWA host is mapped to from the File&gt;Properties menu in IE.... expected for OWA - Internet. The default setting for copy/paste functionality in the IE Internet zone is to Prompt before allowing access to the windows
 clipboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IF you are using a server version of windows and IE, the security zone settings are higher than those of a normal windows client. You should not adjust your security zone settings of IE on a server version of windows. Use a windows client workstation
 instead running windows 7 or higher and IE11 instead.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>These are consumer support forums.... if you are using a work computer, you should in the first instance contact your company's IT department or Help desk... they will be able to reset your IE back to its default security settings if you have accidentally
 made changes yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            windows 7 ie 9 not caching</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure if this is a Windows 7 or an IE 9 question. I have searched extensively for an answer, but can't find one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a new desktop running the above. I switched from an old clunker using XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find with my new system, web pages, images and many cookies are not being cached. When I go to...</p>
<p>C:\Users\xxxxx\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files (xxxxx equals my username)</p>
<p>...I see only a few cookies and a bunch of favicons - no images, no website pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when I go to.....</p>
<p>C:\Users\xxxxx\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5</p>
<p>....the folder is empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I enable my cache to properly store all temporary files?</p>

            <p>If you open Internet Options, is the box unchecked for "Delete browsing history on exit"? When you click on Settings, how many days are you keeping browsing history, and how much space is allocated to it?<br />Check the button next to "Every time I visit the web page." That will keep the latest page info without causing undo traffic.</p><p>Under the Privacy tab, Advanced, how are you handling cookies?</p><p>Is IE not running fast enough for you (as if anything ever is :-)&nbsp; )?

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Delete browsing history on exit" is unchecked. 20 days on browsing history and 250 MB for space. I am allowing first party cookies. In "Check for newer versions of stored pages," I have tried all settings and get the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's almost as if I am using In Private Browsing - I'm not. Because if I were, the favicons would not be there. Besides, I have this problem even when I check the cache before closing the browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long story short....In the past, I have needed to save things from cache that I could not save directly from a website. That's why I would like to see my new system's cache acting as it did on my old XP with IE 8.</p>

    <title>Macro to Format Multiple Worksheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phil hageman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macro to Format Multiple Worksheets</h2>
                    
<p><span>I need a macro to format rows and columns in given worksheets – to work like this:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Worksheet Names: Operations, Staff, Support, [and other worksheets]</span></p>
<p><span>Column widths:<span>&nbsp;</span>A = 2.0, B=13.14, C=10.29 [and other columns]</span></p>
<p><span>Row heights:<span>&nbsp;</span>1=12.75, 2=40.5 [and other rows]</span></p>
<p><span>Align columns center and vertically:<span>&nbsp;</span>B, C, E [and other columns]</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are multiple worksheets and this macro makes them all look alike, without having to go through each one and set dimensions/formats manually.</span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Worksheets(worksheetnames(i))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Columns("A:A").ColumnWidth = 2#<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Columns("B:B").ColumnWidth = 13.14<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Columns("C:C").ColumnWidth = 10.29<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' and other columns<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Rows("1:1").RowHeight = 12.75<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Rows("2:2").RowHeight = 40.5<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' and other rows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Columns("B:B").HorizontalAlignment = xlCenter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Columns("B:B").VerticalAlignment = xlCenter<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Because you have option explicit you must dimension all variables so the correction for I is</p>
<p>Dim I as long</p>

            <p>Not sure if I am interpreting the question correctly. The title refers to disabling the close button and then the text seems to refer to disabling VBA code.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that the title of the post is what you are attempting to do then the following link explains how to prevent the closing of a userform by clicking the cross top right of the userform.</p>

<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Following added as an after thought.</strong></em></p>
<p>You will need separate code&nbsp;that runs on click of&nbsp;a button to close the userform. Something like the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unload UserForm1<br />
