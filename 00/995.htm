<h2>            SAVED DRAFTS VANISHED&#33;</h2>
                    I've been working on an email draft for a week. I add new information and save it daily. On 5/5 I added info, saved it, it showed the time it was saved. When I went back to open the draft a few hours later, it was GONE. It's not in the drafts or deleted folders. I went back into the drafts folder and tried to open up a previously saved version of the same draft, but when I clicked to open it, it vanished. I clicked on another draft and it vanished before it even opened. I tried accessing other drafts by using the down arrow in the drafts folder - each time it deleted the previous draft w/out opening it. I didn't delete those drafts - just trying to open them deleted them. The last two drafts that vanished in front of my eyes went to the deleted folder, but the original draft that I'm most concerned about did not. One of the drafts that I was able to retrieve from the deleted folder contained work I did several days ago, not the current draft. The information is incomplete. It's missing sev

<h2>            Bluetooth&#58; Pairing fails after S&#94;3 Anna update &#40;C6-01, 022.014&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I am rather unhappy about a significant problem after upgrading to S^3 anna 022.014. I have 2 cars with Volkswagen premium hands-free car phones in rSAP mode&nbsp;(which are apparently made by nokia). After the anna upgrade I can't pair the C6-01 mobile anymore.
 Pairing fails after the enter password question. Connectivity is still working on the car that has been paired before the upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both hands free kits work fine with my BB Curve 9300 and my older nokia 6234 (the latter just for testing).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It either needs an update for the bluetooth part on the C6-01 or nokia needs to provide volkswagen with an update for the "premium fse" quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have stuck to nokia phones just for the excellent connectivity with the volkswagen group cars. If this isnt' fixed soon, this will have been my last nokia...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The system worked before, but stopped working AFTER the update. So the update seems to be the problem (not backwards compatible) because the hardware (carkit) didn't change.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>EDIT: Besides, when my information is correct, the units that currently are fitted to VAG cars are made by Nokia.</p>

<p>Same problem here with Opel Zafira Cosmo built-in carkit. Worked flawlessly before the upgrade. With Anna, bluetooth auto-disconnects within a second after pairing. If there is no network (e.g. in underground parking lot), my Nokia N8 connects to the carkit
 and stays connected until the network is found. As I spend many hours in the car, the symbian Anna has made my brand-new expensive N8 totally useless! Nokia cannot deliver me a downgrade to the previous symbian ^3, and refers me to my carkit manufacturer,
 apparently refusing also a patch to make Anna downwards compatible or at least work with Bluetooth. This story makes me VERY very angry and upset. I am a Nokia customer since more than 12 years and was always satisfied. Now I will no longer consider Nokia
 a viable candidate for a new smartphone, unless they provide me a fix ASAP! So much for customer care!</p>

            I guess we'll all have to wait until Nokia provides us with a fix for this problem. I'm happy that I'm not the only one, but I doubt that this fix will be released soon... :(<br />
The more people report their problems, the bigger the chance that Nokia takes us seriously...

<p>I wouldnt mark this as "solved", as there are still issues with the E7 and bluetooth - connectivity to older model car kits / in-dash units.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reseted the phone twice now to factory settings, with no change.</p>

<p>My in-dash player is JVC KD-AVX77.</p>
<p>I have tried with several other phones and&nbsp;pads, they all work and connect smoothly - just not the E7.</p>

<p>I would like this solved properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having to backup and restore the file set is not a good solution, even if it solves the problem.</p>
<p><br />
Nokia need to solve the problem by updating Ovi Suite, providing a driver or whatever the solution turns out to be.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>For stopping emails going to junk or being considered as spam, you can have them added to your safe senders list. You can follow the steps provided below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>At the top of the screen, select <strong>Settings</strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f4b83e9cb-c7e4-46c8-b3d1-cfee017123ae.png" />&gt;
<strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Mail</strong> &gt; <strong>Junk email</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Safe senders</strong>, enter the email address or domain you want to add, and select the
<strong>Add</strong> icon <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2fd8e28612-fbdb-4d28-a4d0-14f7834cfd97.png" />. Email from addresses or domains on the safe senders list don't get moved to your junk folder.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f585c8e38-a5ed-4e66-9c88-2eda60ff35d1.png" /></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;To edit or remove emails or domains from the Safe senders list, select the item in the list and then select
<strong>Edit</strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2ff898dd9b-58c9-422c-b584-87fd6000cbbd.jpg" />or
<strong>Remove</strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f544b13e9-3812-45ee-8461-ef713863ebb3.jpg" />.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Save</strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f8e41dcf4-e2d9-4eee-8c51-3168d8de1b43.png" />.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you might want to change the filter of your junk email. </p>
<div>
<div>
<p>If Outlook.com identifies a message as possible junk email, it may automatically move it to the Junk Email folder. Any malware—potentially malicious software or code—is disabled.</p>
<p>Outlook.com offers two levels of filtering for junk email: Standard and Exclusive.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Standard</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does the typical amount of email filtering. Any message that the filter determines is junk is sent to your Junk Email folder.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Exclusive</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is very restrictive. It only trusts new messages that come from members of your Safe Senders list and your Safe mailing list. It also trusts alerts that you have signed up for and service announcements. All other messages are
 put in the Junk Email folder. </p>
</li></ul>
<p>To change the level of junk email filtering, select <strong>Settings</strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f4b83e9cb-c7e4-46c8-b3d1-cfee017123ae.png" />&gt;

<p>Thanks, Your reply is appreciated.</p>
<p>I already had placed senders in the safe senders and safe lists categories.&nbsp; I also had junk set to standard. I have no 'Rules' set up on my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main problem is that I don't know what is being classified as Junk or Spam&nbsp;ahead of time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp; only find out when someone tries to contact me and the mail is bounced.&nbsp; This is a huge problem when it is, for instance,&nbsp;a health insurance company, and they
 don't notify me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have this problem with my gmail or charter mail.</p>

<h2>            Excel Dependent Drop Down List Help</h2>
                    <p>I have already created a series of drop down lists already both independent and dependent.
</p>
<p>However I wanted to create a drop down list that only appears from a selected variable from another drop down list, how do I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, say that I've got an independent drop down list on column A that allows the option for "red" or "blue", and in Column B I want to create a drop down list (options "1" or "2") that only shows up if I clicked on "red" and if it's clicked on "blue"
 than the cell remains text editable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, that made sense!</p>

<div>I was also hoping if I could get any solution for the transfer of calender entries and address book to ical and vcard respectively.</div>

<p>Ouch, learning on the job is the hard way to do it. But that is life, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to give you some links to "learning" resources that you can use to get up to speed on the basics, and later more advanced stuff.&nbsp; You can also use them as reference materials for future problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Free Tip</strong></p>
<p>Change in computer programs, like Excel, tends to be "evolutionary" rather than "revolutionary".&nbsp; So the basic features and functions documented for Excel 2003 (and earlier) often still apply in Excel 2019 (with a minor adjustment for the change from menu
 to "ribbon" user interface).&nbsp; So don't be afraid to use old tips and old teaching materials. Most of the information in them will still be applicable.

<h2>            Called parties can barely hear me</h2>
                    <p>Since I installed Skype on my new Win10 laptop, the people I call can barely hear me.&nbsp; No matter which party I call, or whether they call me back, they say I sound far away.&nbsp; I have to hold the mic close to my mouth, speak very slowly, and yell.&nbsp; My audio
 is turned up to 100%.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can hear just fine, and the echo test was successful.&nbsp; I have to pull the earbuds out of my ears to avoid eardrum damage.&nbsp; How can this be fixed?&nbsp; I've been using Skype on this same home network for years, with few problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            how do I uninstall only outlook 2007, not all 2007 components</h2>
                    my outlook 2007 is weird; it isn't the same as outlook 2007 on all other workstations in the office. I want to uninstall just the outlook component and reinstall it.

<p><br />
This is not a scenario where running the diagnostics is "likely" to solve anything. Similarly, uninstalling/re-installing would serve absolutely no purpose since the same Outlook profile would be&nbsp;used. From the description "when you start up, it displays a
 dialogue box asking if you want to connect now or work off-line" would suggest that a new Outlook profile get created ensuring that all email account settings are correct (make sure to make the new Outlook profile is set as the default when you open Outlook).</p>

    <title>Maploader 1.1g problems. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Maploader 1.1g problems.</h2>
                    I format mine MicroSD 2GB card and installed new Nokia Mapsloader v1.1g.<br />
I chosed:<br />
<br />
Europe<br />
China<br />
Hong Kong<br />
Taiwan<br />
Oklahoma City<br />
Japan<br />
<br />
Voice:<br />
Swedish<br />
Cantonese<br />
English (US)<br />
English (UK)<br />
<br />
Now some of the swedish character displays with weirds character ex:<br />
Göteborg -&gt; G^|teborg<br />
<br />
Looks like it can't display the swedish åäö correct and replaced it with some weird character instead.<br />
Didn't had this problem with maploader 1.0.<br />
<br />
Also, when i ran the maploader, after a while it shows up an error message, about GDI+ error and i don't know what it's all about.<br />
<br />
But downloading the maps + voices works fine, but i wonder if that GDI+ error that shows up had causing my weird swedish character displays on the maps?<br />
<br />
Anyone know how to fix this, thanks!

            Hi dt888<br />
<br />
I presume that your Windows NET Framework 2.0 and 3.0 are up to date, which Nokia software heavily relies on. This is not an uncommon event "Generic GDI+ Error when saving bitmaps or working with images"<br />
<br />
The chances are if you deleted maps and reloaded, this error might not appear, however there have been other language issues recorded with Maploader v1.1 in the past; it doesn't show properly street and city names with unicode characters.<br />
<br />
I might suggest at this stage "if it ain't broke don't fix it":(

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for this information. I am trying to speed up my Word Starter by disabling things I don't use; so far without success. It takes anything between 20 to 40 seconds to open a document, even a blank one. Do you have any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see you often in the forums. Nice to see you answering so many questions. It's a pity that we can't direct a question to a particular person in the forums!</p>

            Below is a 'copy' and 'paste' of the number one question from my first post, at the beginning of this thread, which is conveniently missed by everybody.<br />
<i><br />
" Could you tell me how I can access the <b>startup menu and templates menu,</b>&nbsp;in Microsoft Word<strong>Starter</strong> 2010. I tried searching the computer with the following but I drew a blank...................."<br />
</i><br />
RickWilliamson has spotted that the main question is being side-stepped. So he is also asking
<i>"Where is the start up menu?"</i><br />
<br />
Therefore, my reply to him above <i>"I am also still waiting for an answer to this question, in my original post on top!"</i><br />
<br />
I have already acknowledged the information I received as "helpful", regarding question number 2. Question number one regarding the location of the startup menu is unanswered.<br />

<h2>            WMDC &#38; AT&#38;T 8525 Quite Frustrated</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi Folks:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I consider myself a pretty tech savvy person but I have no were to go for help on this one.&nbsp; I've checked the web, forums, wiki(es).&nbsp; You name it.&nbsp; Here is my situation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I upgraded my system to a Dell Optiplex 745.&nbsp; I have Vista Business installed.&nbsp; I installed WMDC 6.1 and make required "USB to PC" change on my 8525.&nbsp; I run a lot of third party software on my Pocket PC.&nbsp; Also,
 I have the most current version of firmware from HTC.&nbsp; Some of the third party software includes eWallet, Listpro, MiniMO, and SyncML.&nbsp; I'm able to sync straight away, NO PROBLEMS!&nbsp; I create a new partnership and all seems to great smooth!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is, I've never been able to do this again.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I plug my 8525 in, nothing occurs.&nbsp; Windows Device Manager displays either an "Unknown Device “or "Microsoft WPD FileSystem Volume Driver".&nbsp; The MS Windows Mobile Remote Adapter is displayed under the
 Network Adapters category within Device Manager.&nbsp; I try to launch WMDC and nothing occurs, I take a look at sync center and nothing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some of the other efforts I have tried:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Uninstall and reinstall WMDC 6.1 - I can't get WMDC to launch at all! Sometime the splash screen show but that is it.</span></p>
<p><span>2. I've uninstalled eWallet on my PC.</span></p>
<p><span>3. I've deselected and reselected the USB to PC connection on my 8525.&nbsp; When I did this Vista showed that is found a "HTC USB Sync".&nbsp; That was short lived and didn't show up again.</span></p>
<p><span>4. When I attempt to create a sync via the 8525, it appears to connect to exchange and update; however, it may be connecting via my cellular wireless connection.</span></p>
<p><span>5. I've tried multiple combinations of resetting my 8525, uninstalling WMDC and reinstalling.&nbsp; No luck.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Windows Updates - All Current</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm running the following peripherals on this desktop:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. USB Bluetooth adapter</span></p>
<p><span>2. Dual Monitors</span></p>

<p><span>Since my original post I continued to research this problem but have not found a resolution.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Today I formatted my computer and began from scratch.&nbsp; I kept the AT&amp;T 8525 in the cradle during the Vista install.&nbsp; During the routine auto-configuration steps Vista recognized the Pocket PC
 and auto-installed WMDC.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Wamm O!&nbsp; I could see the device under "Computer" and WMDC showed a connection to the device as well.&nbsp; A reboot later the device is gone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I attempted a new USB port, I attempted to connect it via USB hub, no luck.&nbsp; I'm back to where I started even after a complete rebuild of my system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The one difference is WMDC still launches now.&nbsp; I can see the splash screen but is displays "not connected".&nbsp; I also attempted a soft reset of my 8525.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can someone offer any guidance?&nbsp; My only other option at this point is go back to Windows XP :-|&nbsp; I'd rather not do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks ahead of time!</span></p>

<h2>            Emails being routed to wrong folder in Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Bear with me as this a a bit long. I have set up Rules in Outlook.com to route incoming email to separate folders based on who they are addressed to. But the Rules are not being followed. They are turned on and I have double checked them. This is the Rules
 contents: (note that the formatting is not the way it is in the actual Rules settings - I entered the text in a word processor to remove any traces of my real email.)</p>
<p>

<p>the message was sent *** Email address is removed for privacy ***'</p>
<p>Do the following …</p>

<p>This rule is: On.</p>

<p>and stop processing rules on this message.</p>
<p>This rule is: On.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Messages are not being placed in the 'river' folder. Instead, they end up in the 'brand' folder. I have checked the address of the message and it was indeed addressed to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***'. Any advice on what I am doing wrong?</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t save the changes I have made to my Excel worksheet</h2>
                    <p>The excel file is saved to a folder on shared work, which is accessible by the entire office. However, I have tried to save it to my desk top as well and that doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I hit save, a window comes up which says "Errors were detected while saving '/Users/n4/Desktop/-Lauren's Operations Spreadsheet 2018.xlsx'. Microsoft Excel may be able to save the file by removing or repairing some features. To make the repairs in a
 new file, click Continue. To cancel saving the file, click Cancel." However, clicking Continue does nothing. It appears that the results are the same when I click on Cancel and when I click on Continue. Nothing seems to happen, and nothing gets saved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same notice appears if I try to "save as" a new spreadsheet with a different name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another spreadsheet that is saving just fine. That spreadsheet was a "Saved As" version of "-Lauren's Operations Spreadsheet 2018" but with changes to serve a different purpose while retaining the same format. That excel document has never been saved
 onto Shared work. The path for the problem spreadsheet, where it is currently located, on Shared work, is: PL Share Folder&gt;Client Files&gt;IMMIGRATION&gt;I-485.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened in the past as well. I think normally saving as a new spreadsheet in a different area works, but this time it's not. Any ideas on what I should do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: It appeared that it finally let me save and then a window appeared which said: "Alert -&nbsp; No errors were detected in&nbsp;'-Lauren's Operations Spreadsheet 2018.xlsx'. No repairs were necessary." When I made a change and tried to save again, to be absolutely
 sure, the "Errors were detected" window appeared once again.</p>

<p><span>Hi Lauren,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to your information, it seems that you have tried saving as a new spreadsheet with a different name and changing the "save as"
 to another location but the issue remains.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given this situation, I would suggest you try moving the original worksheets to a new workbook by following steps as a workaround:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.Add a filler worksheet to your workbook. To do this, press Shift + F11.
</span></p>
<p><span>(Note: This sheet is required because there has to be at least one remaining sheet in a workbook after you move all relevant data sheets.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.Group all the worksheets (except the filler). To do this, click the first sheet, hold the Shift key, and then click the last sheet.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.Right-click the grouped sheets, and then click Move or copy. In the To Book list, click (New Book).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4.Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>(Note: These steps should move the active (grouped) worksheets to a new workbook. )</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I would like to confirm following points to better understand the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.If you try to save a new workbook to the original location, does the issue persist? It is to confirm that whether it is caused by network
 location or local location.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.Do other users in the same network encounter the same issue?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.Please share your current

<p>Hi Eli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to move the grouped sheets to a new book, it told me: You cannot copy or move a group os sheets that contain a table. I was able to move one sheet to a new book, however. Then, when I tried to save the new book, it told me that I could not save
 changes due to a sharing violation. I was able to move each sheet one by one to a new workbook and save it on the desktop. I was then able to move that into the file where I need it to be saved to, but a yellow security warning appears which says "External
 Data Connections have been disabled." It won't let me click on the "Enable Content" button. All I can do is x out of the security warning, but it appears again whenever I open the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the old problematic workbook, I tried to save it as a different name and then it said: "errors were detected while saving [FILE]. Microsoft Excel may be able to save the file by removing or repairing some features. To make the reappoint repairs in a new
 file, click Continue. To cancel saving the file, click Cancel." This same box appears when I try to save the file to my desktop. When I go through with it in both cases, it tells be that there were no errors and that it did not need repairs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a brand new workbook and tried to save it to the same area on shared. It told me that I couldn't save it due to a sharing violation, and it tells me to try saving it to a different file. I am able to save it to my desktop. I tried saving the new workbook
 to a different file that is still on shared, and it made me grant permissions, which I did, but then it still wouldn't work. I tried it again with a brand new file and it tells me I can't save it due to a sharing violation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know that at least one other user was having the same issue on a brand new workbook that she had created and that she had tried to save onto our shared netwoek. What ended up working for her was saving the workbook to the desktop and then dragging it
 into the file where it needed to be. I did this same thing with a brand new workbook and it was able to work I am then able to open the workbook and save changes without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it appears that the issues have been saving any worksheet anywhere on our shared network, but it is mostly fine (for the time being) when saved to the desktop and dragged to shared. I do remember having this issue in the past, so dragging from the desktop
 is probably just a temporary solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have another workbook ("Assistants' Spreadsheet") that I've been saving to the same place on our shared network, without issues. I did notice that at the top of this workbook, where the file name appears, it says " - Group." The other test workbooks
 have not said that. So it appears it is possible to save spreadsheets without issues onto shared, but some setting is inhibiting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Excel version is 16.15, so I'm assuming it's 2016? It does say copyright 2018 though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lairen</p>

<p>Hi Lairen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your detailed information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>According to these error message,
</span><span>this issue may occur if Excel cannot delete the original file or cannot rename the temporary file so that the save operation cannot successfully finish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, you could try notifying your network administrator that you need Delete and Modify rights for the appropriate folder on the network drive. You must have Delete and Modify rights
 to save an Excel workbook file with the correct file name in this shared network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I would like to confirm following two points:</p>
<p>1.If you open Assistants Spreadsheet from network shared folder and save it as a different name in the same location, does the issue occur?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Does this issue occur in other Office files like Word?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any concerns, please post back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Eli</p>

<p>1. Yes, the issue still occurs and I am not able to save "Assistants Spreasheet" as a different name in the same folder on the shared network. The only think I could do would be to save it as a different name onto my desktop.</p>
<p>

<h2>            image to text doesn&#39;t copy&#47; paste correctly in One note</h2>
                    <p>hi, </p>
<p>I just discovered the copy text from image option in One Note. it worked great at first. i'm converting number and text data from a scanned image into an excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however after a few times of copy paste, the text/number data does not paste correctly in the same exact excel spreadsheet or a new word doc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have pasted in various ways... as text, as html, keep source formatting etc. but no change here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this screen shot, row 1-9 is what copies and pastes correctly for first few attempts (this is what i want). but copy and paste the same image again renders like row 10 and beyond.</p>
<p>

<div>When I double click on a Word file in Windows explorer or other list, MS Word opens but an error comes up that says it failed to load the file.</div>

            Try this to re-register the file associations with Word: Exit Word if it is running. Hold the Windows logo key as you press R; in the Run dialog box, type winword /r and press Enter (note the space before the slash). After the configuration has completed,

<p>It doesn't matter about the OS of your computer, I have Windows 8, which is the same as my phone and tried to sync with Nokia Suite and it doesn't work, even with USB. I think it is over the whole Lumia range because of the diferent processor to it's predessors.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 techincal preview update 10041 setup issue</h2>
                    The installation was ok until the setup. I encountered the issue after I was asked for my Wi-Fi. The laptop connected and all. And after that step, there was a blank page with nothing but the connection, ease of access and the shut down icons at the bottom
 right corner of the screen. I waited for like 15 minutes and nothing happened. So, I restarted it ( which I how regret). And even after restarting it, there is still a blank page. I think the OS was installed but the setup was not completed. What do I do now?

            <p>Some people might hit an issue where the username and password boxes do not appear or don’t accept input when logging in, which will prevent them from logging in. Possible workarounds include clicking the “Switch User” button, using Ctrl+Alt+Del, or pressing
 the power button on your PC to sleep/resume and try again.</p>

<h2>            Not receiving password reset emails</h2>
                    <p>I tried multiple times to reset my password on a proboards account last night. never received the email in my normal or junk folders. Thought this was a problem exclusive to Proboards but it turns out i am now having the same problem with photobucket, so
 the problem must be with the email. Ive googled past problems on this issue before and made sure to change the filter settings in junk email and also checked my block senders list and no fix.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</span>We'll be glad to help you address this concern by identifying the root cause of it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>We would like you to know that there are a few possible reasons as to why you are encountering this issue. Since you’ve already checked your Junk Mail Filters and Kill/Block Senders List, we also suggest
 that you try checking the following information below to see if this is what causes the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Check the custom filters as it could be filtering messages to some folder or deleting them.</span></p>
<p><span>2. The mail forwarding may be enabled and mails are being forwarded to a specific email.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Try deleting unnecessary messages into your account. Your mailbox might be full causing new messages not to be received.

<h2>            Outlook 2013 &#47; 2016 freezing &#34;unresponsive&#34; on Windows 10 new install</h2>
                    
<p>We just purchased a set of Dell 3570 laptops with Windows 7 Pro installed (64 bit). I upgraded them all to Windows 10 Pro and than installed Office 2016 from our Office 365 portal. 4 out of 5 users are experiencing random freezing, rebooting, or unresponsive
 behavior with Outlook 2016 and Word 2016. I researched this issue and tried multiple fixes without success. I also downgraded to (uninstalled and then installed) Office 2013. This didn't resolve the issue. I've seen where there was an update that was causing
 this exact issue, but no one has KB3114717 installed. We are on a domain and running Exchange locally for Outlook. I'm not using the cloud version of office, only local installations.</p>

<p>Should I open a support request?</p>

<p>Hi PaladinHelpdesk,<br />
<br />
You may take a look at this thread: 
Outlook freezes after windows 10 update (win 10, build 10586.63).<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, since this forum mainly focuses on Office 365 for Business online services, we suggest you post in our
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016?sort=lastreplydate&amp;dir=desc&amp;tab=threads&amp;status=all&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=all&amp;tm=1463131419833">

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've updated to Oulook 2016 and I cannot access the additional mailboxes I had configured (all shared folders). I receive the following error message: "The set of folders cannot be opened. Microsoft Exchange is currently busy. If this message is still displayed
 in 30 minutes, contact your Exchange administrator".&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's been way over 30 minutes and nothing has changed. Any ideas? Thanks!</p>

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hello John
<br />
<br />Since you're using Outlook 2013 is there a reason that you don't want to configure the government email account in OL'2013? 
<br />
<br />Would suspect that the account would be configured as either an Exchange or IMAP account when you enter the email address/password for the account which means that all email would remain on the server as long as you don't take any kind of measures to permanently delete anything.

<br />The reason why I cannot connect through Outlook 2013 as you suggest is that Outlook cannot find my settings.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Just to confirm, are you saying that if you enter the email address/password, it won't automatically configure the account?
<br />
<br />If yes, do you have the settings that need to be entered? Also, if this is an Exchange based account, you cannot manually configure the account. It would mean that &lt;auto-discover&gt; is not properly configured on the server.
<br />
<br />If it's supposed to be an IMAP account, you can manually configure the account in OL'2013 with the correct settings provided that you have them.

<h2>            product didnt download</h2>
                    I just spent 139. on the office student package and it did not download and I did not get a copy emailed to my email with my receipt. I hope that I didnt just lose 139 dollars. I am a really displeased with what just happened and everytime I try to install
 it, now it says there is a problem. Yes there is a very big problem now....I feel that I just got scammed.
