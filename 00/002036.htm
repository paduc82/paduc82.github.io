<h2>            Lumia 950 reboot issue after a year of use.</h2>
                    <p>My Lumia 950 went out of warranty in January. Last month, I visited authorised service centre with frequent battery drain and overheating issues. Phone was at times sluggish. They said over the counter It's normal behaviour. No technical check was done.
 Last Wednesday, got updated software under automatic updates. Current OS build is 10.0.15063.35007.
</p>
<p>Post&nbsp;update phone was hanging and rebooting frequently. Tried following: -</p>
<p>1. Removed SD card as it was popping messages like SD card needs repair. Must have done it at least 6&nbsp; 8 times. Put it back as it's removal was not making any difference.</p>
<p>2. Contacted tech support. It redirects to b2x.xom. After trying self-help, contacted service technician. As directed, downloaded "Windows Device Recovery Tool". Followed all steps as suggested. Thereafter had to install individual third party software and
 synchronise contacts across three mail accounts. This was yesterday. Windows subsequently downloaded some more updates.
</p>
<p>3. Today morning, again noticed rebooting issues. It happens randomly when U launch anything. Mail / WhatsApp video. Some stability is achieved by removing applications that I use often. Gmail and WhatsApp. But have retained office mail account. These 2
 apps, moved to my Lumia 630 and are working fine. (Had junked this 630 when windows announced it's not entitled for win 10 upgrade and WhatsApp announced end of support!)</p>
<p>4. Contacted B2x.com again now they have advised to visit service centre.</p>
<p>5 Checked community pages. Most of users who have faced this issue either got replacement / faced problem in 2016 when build version was different and in one case, someone applied paper filling near battery.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Just wanted to add, twice after reboot, the screen turned yellow. I physically removed battery in those cases and put it back. (Must have gone through atleast 20 reboots in past couple of days)</p>
<p>7. Wanted to understand if battery is the root cause or software version or there is a third cause?.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've already been advised by B2X to visit the service center, it will be best to have your phone checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For future queries, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

<p>Few updates.</p>
<p>1. Could not visit service centre due to timing mismatch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Battery is working exceptionally well. A month back I had to charge 3 to 4 times a day. Now it's lasting almost full day.</p>
<p>3. Reboot problem has reduced to once or twice a day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Thrice, it happened at same spot. I was in lift, trying to read a WhatsApp message. Wifi got disconnected. And when both sim operators got disconnected, phone rebooted. Will try simulating issue again.</p>
<p>5. not yet installed back Messenger and Authenticator applications. Rest all aps are re-installed.</p>

            There is a difference between an update and an announcement:
<br />
<br />When you make an Announcement, it becomes prominent on the group page and the Home page (where it highlights the posts from your Groups and the people you Follow). Second, the Announcements always appear in the Yammer Inbox for any group you're a member of. Third, based on their notification settings, the Announcements can go to the emails of the members of the group. 
<br />
<br />The result is that a lot more people are likely to read Announcements than regular posts. The approximate average is that 5 times as many people in the group are likely to read and act on your post. To maximize the results, see the Advanced Strategies section below.
<br />
<br />All Company announcements are sent to all users' Inboxes and to all users via email regardless of their notification settings.

    <title>Are Attachments from Older Messages Auto-Deleted after a Certain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> renaessance  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are Attachments from Older Messages Auto-Deleted after a Certain Point..&#63;</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to recover attachments from older e-mails in Outlook.com (i.e. the new Hotmail)..? I have a message that's only a year old, appears to have an attachment in the message lisings pane, and in which the sender refers to including said
 attachment directly, but for some reason, there's absolutely NO sign of the attachment in the message pane itself. &nbsp;I can't find a link, an icon, no drop-downs referring to attachments or their retrieval, nada. &nbsp;(And when I forward the message to another e-mail
 account I have elsewhere, there's not attachment btw.) &nbsp;I know this message -used- to have a document attached to it.. so.. where did the .doc file go..?? &nbsp;Does Outlook delete attachments after a certain period of time now..? &nbsp;It's a .doc file, so there's
 no reason for it to be on Outlook's "protected" file type list, and as it's a time-sensitive issue, I'd really like to get at it. &nbsp;Thankfully the rest of the message itself is still there, but the -attachment- &nbsp;is
<i><b>nowhere </b></i>to be found, &nbsp;Can anyone please help?

<p>Well, you can set slide transitions to 'push' one slide out of the way with the next one and I guess you could have two identical slides with different transitions and use buttons to jump to one or the other. Sounds like a lot of hard work though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you sure what you are seeing was a PowerPoint file, or were these in Flash or some other format?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, the error message says the file is corrupt and you mentioned that the file is located in recycle bin, I would like to explain that the OneNote client can’t sync a notebook in
 the recycle bin. If you still can see the content in your client app, please try the steps below to see the result:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Go to File &gt; Export &gt; Notebook &gt; OneNote Package &gt; Export &gt; Save to the location you want to save.</span></li><li>
<span>Open the exported local notebook in your OneNote app &gt; File &gt; share &gt; OneDrive &gt; Select the storage location of the file on the Online &gt; move.</span></li><li>
<span>When the notebook is moved to the online location, that means you have created the new notebook in the online location and it will sync between your client and online.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, I hope that you can provide the following information so that I can help you better:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Please go to File &gt; Account &gt; Product Information and provide us the screenshot about that. To protect your privacy, please help us mask your email address.</span></li><li>
<span>Can you still be able to see the contents of the affected notebook in your client?</span></li><li>
<span>Please send me a screenshot of the error message you encountered.</span></li><li>
<span>Have you ever had any action before such an error occurred? If so, please provide specific operations.</span></li></ol>

 when he started talking about the security system I needed to buy I said I'd need to think about it so he left me a note with the information and hung up. Should I do a factory reset? If so, how do I do that?</span></span></span>

            8000 messages? That's a pretty huge number and I'm thinking it might be one of the factors as it also freezes while you're in messaging/while you're texting. But as I mentioned above and as you are waiting for it, updating the device is the best thing
 to do.

            in which case, i would just clear everyyhting off the phone and make a backup to cloud service and / or PC, and give the phone a hard reset and re-install everything, so you have a clean fresh slate to begin with. If its been overloaded with all those
 messages, a spring clean would do it a ton of good mate.

    <title>Outlook.com breach&#59; app password&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joseph_n_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com breach&#59; app password&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For a personal account, I use outlook.com with 2FA. Microsoft advised me of possible fraud, and my account history shows two "successful login[s]" from locations where I was not present. There seem to be only these possibilities: someone or something had
 my credentials and 2FA was defeated; or someone or something had my credentials, which included an app password; or there was a more insidious technical breach; or the "successful login" indication was incorrect. Is that right, that those are the only possibilities?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most likely of those, if those are the only options, i think, is that someone sniffed my credentials, including my app password. But how likely is that, if I'm pretty much always on a VPN? Someone would have had to sniff my credentials at a time when
 I was using an app password without the VPN on an app that passes the credentials in cleartext. Doesn't seem all that likely....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My asking these questions is partly to get a handle on the vulnerability, and partly to get a handle on app passwords. I use them rarely. But here's one issue: I had to enter the app password into Outlook for Mac ver. 16.24 (from Office 365). According to
 a MSFT page, that app should support MFA. But it didn't; it would connect only with the app password. Now it appears I have to bear the risk of using the app password everywhere. Is it passed in cleartext?

<h3> hairyloon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N73 Volume problem</h2>
                    
<p>The volume (up) button on my N73 has died.</p>
<p>I am not convinced it would be an easy repair, so I am wondering if there is another way to turn up the volume, and perhaps lock it on full.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>How do you make a Yammer group PRIVATE once it&#39;s already set - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you make a Yammer group PRIVATE once it&#39;s already set up&#63; &#40; mistakenly made it PUBLIC&#41; Don&#39;t want anyone to be able to &#34;join&#34; it</h2>
                    <p>Our Yammer group should only be for the select users. (Private) We don't want anyone being able to "Join" the group. How do you make it PRIVATE after it's already been set up as PUBLIC?
<br />
Can you &nbsp;send me the directions: i.e. is it Under Settings or Profile or Admin? &nbsp;Is it at the top of the page? I need specific directions on where to go to change that feature.
<br />
I've looked everywhere (under Search) and can't find it. I hope I don't have to delete the group and then start a new one so I can change it to PRIVATE. It's got to be easier than that I hope!
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Liza,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting. A group admin can change the group from public to private.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Please click on the gear symbol at the top right of the Group page</li><li>You would see the option to check the option to make the group public at the lower part of the setting page</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>This will make your group public to private. Please revert for any query regarding Yammer.</p>

                    I am continually having to reconnect Outlook to the server at my workplace.&nbsp; I normally connect wirelessly, but I have tried a hardwire connection w/no luck. My network and sharing center shows I am connected but any attempt to send an e-mail brings a
 message that Outlook is not connected to the server.&nbsp; I've turned the Work Offline icon on and off but the default seems to be Off. Does anyone have any idea how I can make On the default?

            Hi Todd,<br />
<br />
There are several reasons as to why your Outlook keeps disconnecting from the Outlook server. A network interruption while connecting to the internet is one of the possible reasons for this concern. Do you access your account online through Outlook.com or do
 you use the Outlook app on your computer? If you're using the Outlook app, have you installed the latest Office update?

<h2>            How to type on a PDF file in OneNote Android</h2>
                    Hi, I want to type (and not handwrite) comments on a PDF file in OneNote. I only can type text next to the file or above or below but not on the PDF. I am working on Samsung Andriod tab and there is no "Type quick access" in the toolbar. Anybody know how
 I can do that? Thanks!

            Where is the document saved? Automatic versioning via File | Info requires that you have saved the document to OneDrive. If it is saved locally, you have to create your own backups (for example by enabling the "Always save backup copy" option at File tab
 | Options | Advanced).

<p>Hi ANDOAK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my knowledge and test, I don't get the related settings and shortcuts to move bullets from a cell to another cell directly. I try use a macro to achieve the same effect but bullets cannot copy and paste from a cell to another cell actually. Only
 the text will be moved. If your table is similar with the following table, we could use the following marco to switch the adjacent cells. (Note: The third column is the extra column to store temporary cut variables.)<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fbe488b-364b-431a-9f31-3d0765cfa7ad?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fbe488b-364b-431a-9f31-3d0765cfa7ad?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, you move the first row A woman to the second row by pressing <span>
Alt+shift+arrow down. The number 1 and 2 will be switch as well. It's not the result you desired. Run the macro
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/create-or-run-a-macro-c6b99036-905c-49a6-818a-dfb98b7c3c9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
which has been assigned with a new keyboard shortcut</a>, you could switch number 1 and 2 again.</span></p>
<p>The resut is as below:</p>

<h2>            shortcut to apply rules in Outlook for mac 2011</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set many rules&nbsp;&nbsp;in Outlook for mac 2011 and would like to trigger all of them with a shortcut.</p>
<p>Indeed, at present this is only possible via a menu and two submenus.</p>
<p>How can this be done with a keystroke?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Gérald</p>

            <div>No need for AppleScripting that. You have the option right there in the System.</div>
<div>In Yosemite (but it also exists in previous versions of the System), </div>
<div>you need to open the System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts and </div>

<div>All in the menu title field, then assign the shortcut of your choice.</div>
