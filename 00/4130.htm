<h2>            Outlook 2010 installation Error 25541. Failed to open XML file</h2>
                    I had previously installed the Beta Office 2010 suite. When that ran out I purchased and installed Office 2010 Home and Student.&nbsp; The Beta Outlook still worked fine for reading email, so we continued using it for several months. Finally my wife wanted
 to be able to send emails from this computer also-so I purchased the stand alone Outlook 2010. There was no Office 2010 Beta&nbsp;Outlook program to uninstall in the programs install/uninstall. I have tried installing the stand alone Outlook several times. Each
 time I get this error: Error 25541. Failed to open XML file C:\Windows\Microsoft.Net\Framework\v2.050727\CONFIG\machine.config,system error: -2147024786

<p>
</p><p>What may be suitable is to select the cells then go to <strong>Format&gt; Cells - Alignment

    <title>Enabling Legacy text form field but keeping the rest of the Word Doc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 1 buff boy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enabling Legacy text form field but keeping the rest of the Word Doc editable</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created an employment contract template which incorporates Legacy text form fields, and using bookmarks means that entering certain personal details into these fields will auto-populate them as necessary throughout the rest of the contract. Additionally,
 the contract has several clauses which sometimes need to be deleted or occasionally edited slightly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I am facing is that the Legacy text form fields don't function unless the&nbsp;editing is restricted to filling in forms&nbsp;, but&nbsp;in doing so,&nbsp;means the clauses that occasionally need to be deleted or edited cannot be changed. I've attempted to use the
 'exceptions' function and select the clauses I wish to be removable, but even then, this makes the Legacy text form locked and unusable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question: is there&nbsp;a way I can allow my optional clauses in the contract to be removed or edited, BUT ALSO set the Legacy forms fields to function in their required 'restricted - filling in forms' mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I'm somewhat tech savvy and manage to work out things through trial and error, please know my Word knowledge is limited when it comes to Macros and/or Visual Basic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Scott. </p>

<p>As you are using Word 2016, I would strongly recommend that you use Content Controls rather than Legacy Formfields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greg Maxey has a lot of information on his website on the use of Content Controls, including information on Repeating Data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start with the following page, at the bottom of which are links to about a dozen other pages on Greg's website that deal with various other aspect of Content Controls</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://gregmaxey.com/word_tip_pages/content_controls.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you want to continue to use Legacy FormFields, if you insert Section Breaks in the document to separate the part that contains the formfields from other parts of the document that you need to be able to edit, then, when applying the protection,
 you can select to which Section(s) of the document it is to apply.&nbsp; Note however, even then, the protection does impose some restrictions on what is possible in the unprotected part of the document (and, it is for that reason that I recommend using Content
 Controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your helpful reply Doug. I initially thought your suggestion of dividing the contract into sections would do the trick. And... it almost did! You have managed to help me solve the issue of keeping some paragraphs editable and some locked,
 which is wonderful. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I am now having however is that I have a paragraph regarding salary, and in one legacy form field I enter the amount offered per hour, which them auto calculates&nbsp;another legacy form field which multiples the hourly rate by 38 to display the amount
 earned per week. When the entire document is locked it works perfectly, but doesn't seem to function when I divide the contract up into sections, and lock this specific section.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this in mind, I have experimented with your suggestion of using content control instead, and I see the benefits. As a result, I have changed all my existing legacy forms that required data to be repeated exactly throughout the contract into content
 controls. Success! I cannot, however, for the life of me figure out how to achieve the 'divide by 38' calculation with two content control fields, only seeming to be able to do it with at least one legacy form and one 'quick part', and even then it will only
 work when the entire document is locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the link to the gregmaxy site, which I have studied for hours and hours. I've attempted his suggestions, but when it comes to adding coding to visual basic, I get lost and cannot personalize the code to do what I'm after (I have no experience
 in coding I'm afraid, so have just been fiddling around blindly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any possible way to enter into a content control a dollar value, and have another content control display the calculation of this number multipled by 38, while keeping the document unlocked? I'd be forever grateful, and have tried over the past
 few days without success before posting a request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Re the Legacy Formfield issue, did you have the Calculate on Exit box checked?&nbsp; As I cannot replicate that issue, i<span>f you send me a copy of the document, referencing this thread in the covering email message, I will investigate
 the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than having the result appear in another Content Control, if you select the Content Control into which the amount will be added and insert a bookmark around it, then in the other location, use a field construction as shown in the following screen
 shot</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa5f8c08-5d08-4f00-b7a9-d6cc23a70fb8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa5f8c08-5d08-4f00-b7a9-d6cc23a70fb8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The bookmark is indicated by the [ ] around the content control into which the Rate per hour is inserted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the field codes are toggled off, and the field is updated, the amount will be shown as below</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here's my scenario - I am exporting a document view from a SharePoint document library to an Excel spreadsheet (both 2013). This spreadsheet is stored on a USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also copying the same files over to the USB key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to replace the URI in the <strong>Name</strong> column with the <em>local

<strong>Find</strong> command does not seem able to locate the URI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>

            Hi KE_999,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your clarification.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After exporting a document library to a Excel file with Export to Excel in SharePoint Online , the file name is linked to the file in the team site. If we would like to change the link to a local file, we need to change the hyperlink manually. There is no out
 of the box feature to buck replace these hyperlinks in Excel with large of items in it.<br />
<br />
Your understanding is highly appreciated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley

    <title>OneNote Mobile sync issue on Windows 10 Mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julienshep  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Mobile sync issue on Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    <p>Everything worked as normal until recently. I typed in some info on a OneNote page in Win 10 Mobile, and it won't sync with desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked OneNote Online, and the online version of the notebook is synced with desktop, but the pages in OneNote Mobile aren't synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to close the notebook in desktop, the sync window keeps staying there forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59cf8ac8-1dfa-425b-a47e-44accdada718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59cf8ac8-1dfa-425b-a47e-44accdada718" height="430" width="766" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also on Win 10 Mobile, this screen keeps going on forever, after I tap close the notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a10db4d0-18aa-487c-82e4-04c37b267628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a10db4d0-18aa-487c-82e4-04c37b267628" height="713" width="402" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to figure this out as I use it for work. Can you have some advice of what I can do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I tried to close the notebook in OneNote Desktop, clicked cancel when the small sync window appeared, and the section that won't sync was moved to Misplaced Sections.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meantime on OneNote Mobile, a small triangle appeared near the problematic notebook. I try to close it, the screen goes on and on. When the Win 10 Mobile operating system locks the screen, the progress is lost and I have to start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicked "Cancel" on the sync page that goes on forever on the phone, closed the notebook, opened it again, the sync icon stays there forever and the content I typed into OneNote Mobile doesn't get synced with OneNote 2016 on Desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do the same thing on OneNote 2016, "Close the notebook", then opened it again, then "sync this notebook". Sync progress halts again at 99%.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sync between OneNote 2016 and server seems to work fine now.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I created 3 pages in 3 places: OneNote 2016, OneNote Online and OneNote on Win 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcc78847-665a-4846-9936-ffa8394b6855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcc78847-665a-4846-9936-ffa8394b6855" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d64a2fc-5447-4dcb-8058-5eb5671dce48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d64a2fc-5447-4dcb-8058-5eb5671dce48" height="158" width="327" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f74e3617-7596-45fc-b3b8-655909877047" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f74e3617-7596-45fc-b3b8-655909877047" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The pages created in OneNote 2016 and OneNote Online sync, but the page from OneNote on Win 10 Mobile doesn't sync.
</p>
<p>The sync between OneNote Mobile and server is broken, same for both notebooks.</p>

    <title>Using OME to view encrypted mail. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using OME to view encrypted mail.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been testing email encryption in my organization and have run into an issue. Many users in the company have the outlook mobile app on their phones and view and respond to emails that way. So far, if a user received an encrypted email on their phone
 and they try to open it they are asked to download the OME Viewer, then go back to the mail, press and hold on the HTML attachment and select Open in OME Viewer. So far no one has been able to get this to work. Pressing and holding does not open any kind of
 new window to be able to select opening the attachment in a different application.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been true for emails received in Gmail and Outlook. Very few users use the native iPhone Mail app so I have not tested it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be great.</p>

</p><blockquote>No Assad, you can not! there is no way to insert a user form in Excal 2016. You must use excel 2011 or a Windows version to insert a user form.
</blockquote>
<p>Hi Bob, many thanks for this info. Very useful to decide whether or not to upgrade to Office 2016. &nbsp;I am using excel 2011 for Mac and was waiting for the new excel version for Mac (2016) to enjoy some improvements. But it seems that I'd better stay with
 my present 2011 version, as limited as it can be, where I can insert &nbsp;an user form and proceed in my work. &nbsp;I am astonished by Microsoft producing a new version of excel that is worse than the previous one.... Explanation? Hopes for an improved version soon?</p>
<p>Thanks and best regards.</p>
<p>Giorgio</p>

            <p>That's ok, Microsoft is clearly sleeping as well. To take such a significant feature out of Excel for MAC is ridiculous!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a VB programmer for a number of years and in the past five years had to support the mini application written around VB for Excel. The differences between Windows and Mac versions have just caused&nbsp;me to go in a completely&nbsp;different&nbsp;direction and
 stop using MS tools. This 2016 forms thing is the straw that broke the back.</p>

<p>Go to File and then Account Settings in Outlook, select Change for the affected email address and then click More Settings and then select the Advanced tab. At the bottom of the page is Deleted Items and make sure the first box is unchecked. Be sure and
 complete the process by selecting Okay button which will take you back to the Account Settings page. The click on Next and then Finish. Close Outlook and restart. Now go to the Drafts folder and delete the messages.</p>

<h2>            I Need Help Accessing My Old Hotmail Account. Please assist&#33;</h2>
                    I have an old hotmail account that I cannot access (removed PII). I used that account for many old social networking sites and I can no longer access those sites because it says that my email no longer exists or it's blocked. However when I ask for a password
 retrieval on those social networking sites, it sends the email to my old hotmail (removed PII) without a problem. My only issue is that I cannot access my old hotmail email account. I made that account nearly 10 years ago, and I'm desperate to be able to log
 back in it. I even tried making a brand new email address using the exact same name as my old one and it wouldn't let me because it said that name is taken. I have IMPORTANT pictures and messages that I cannot access anywhere else unless I have my old email
 address given back to me. I'm in dire need of assistance. All I want is my email address verified again. Please assist me because I've gone through all possible routes and even called the 1-800 number but it was of no help t

            <p><span>Hi LaurenWalker,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>There is a possibility that you renamed your account. When a user renames an account, the old account name will be the ALIAS of the new one.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Example: <br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** was renamed to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></p>
<p>
<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** will become the alias of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>In this case the you won't be able to log using their old account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
Please use your newly named account for log in details. For more information about renaming process, please follow this link.

            I have tried to retrieve my account that I believe was hacked because it sent out 300+emails to people I never even heard of.&nbsp; Regardless, I have followed the proper steps to recover this account and now Microsoft has me locked out of it and they say I
 did not prove it is mine.&nbsp; Why would I waste all this time trying to get it back if it wasn't.&nbsp; I have had the user name pghfanone for 25 years and I want it back period.&nbsp; I think that a customer support system without human contact is a bit ridiculous.

<h2>            Messages sent from shared mailbox&#47;delegated mailbox not saved at all &#40;Outlook 2011, Exchange 2010&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This questions is about Outlook 2011/Mac, though possibly related to problems I read about concerning Outlook 2010/Win. I also posted in the Outlook 2011 forum, but was suggested to try here as well.</div>
<div>If at our university people add a second mailbox (shared) using their own credentials, almost all seems to work fine, except when one sends an e-mail from the shared account. Before, the e-mail was sent, but did not end up in the Sent Items of the shared
 account, but instead in the DRAFTS folder of the personal account. Now whether or not it is by design that messages sent from a shared account are saved in the shared account or the personal account, having it saved in the personal DRAFTS folder is always
 wrong.&nbsp;</div>
<div>This happened&nbsp;both in Entourage 2008 Web Services Edition with Exchange 2010 (it was no problem with Exchange 2003), and in Outlook 2011 with Exchange 2010. I had all people with this problem make a rule to move those messages from the personal drafts
 folder to the shared Sent Items folder, but the messages were apparently still flagged as Draft; after a resync, the messages will reappear as unread, and the options for the mails are like the options for a draft (Send button, etc.).</div>
<div><br />
Since we installed rollup 5 for Exchange 2010, the behaviour has changed: Messages sent from the shared account now simply disappear all together. These people have full access permissions on the shared mailbox, and can drag messages to both sent items folders
 without problems.<br />
<br />
Anyone with an answer?<br />
And anyone with the same new behaviour?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Bert</div>

            It is definitely an issue with the Mac client as it works for me fine with OWA and Windows Outlook 2010 (even better after hotfixing the original problem that the sent mails had been stored in the personal folder).
<div><br />
<div>However also for me (Mac Office 2011 v14.3.7 with Hosted Exchange) sent items from within the shared mailbox are not stored at all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>I tried more or less everything:</div>
<div>a) implementing delegate in the shared mailbox with all rights for my personal account</div>
<div>b) implementing "I am delegate for the shared mailbox" within my personal account</div>
<div>c) Changing the rule for storing sent items in the Web interface (OWA) like storing in "sent &amp; from" ...</div>
<div>No success at all.</div>
<div><br />

<h3> seed guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook changes recipient email address after I hit send</h2>
                    
<p>I have 2 contacts for each person in my company - one for their regular email address and one for sending text messages to their cell phone&nbsp;from my Outlook account (this is very cool and easy to do, by the way).</p>
<p>For one employee, I start typing in the address and Outlook populates the rest automatically with the correct email address.&nbsp; When I hit send, I go to my sent items and in pops the message using the alternate text messaging address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is particularly annoying to him because his text service breaks each message into multiple messages and&nbsp;beeping with a new message every few seconds.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

 and it uninstalled Office. Geesh!! Then I went "online for additional help", and here I am.
<br />
<br />
Four questions:<br />
What happened?</p>
<p>How do I fix this?</p>
<p>How do I get Office on physical media that I can hold in my hand and use to re-install if I have to?</p>
<p>How can I prevent this from happening again?</p>

    <title>Cannot upgrade from IE 6 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot upgrade from IE 6</h2>
                    <div>*** Please note this is Internet Explorer 6 ***</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I am&nbsp;helping&nbsp;my son with this computer and we have installed a fresh install of Windows XP Professional Version 2002. I logged on Internet Explorer to perform the Windows Updates and Internet Explorer is causing all sorts of problems. This is an older XP disk
 and it contains IE 6 which I know is no longer supported. But, it will not let me update it either.&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;Explorer is crashing very frequently or if I am lucky enough to make it to the Windows Update page, I scan for updates and get this error "The website
 has encountered a problem and cannot display the page you are trying to view. The options provided below might help you solve the problem."
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I installed Google Chrome and it seems to be working just fine. But you cannot perform windows updates on a browser other than Internet Explorer... I tried. This computer is on my existing network with 2 computers that are on the internet just fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone could offer me some advice, I would be very appreciative. I know a pretty decent amount about computers, but this one has me completely stumped! :(</div>

            <p>This might be worth of trying, but Im not tested this... I think I have been struggling this kind of problem earlier. Its related on IE 6 and Windows Update. Windows Update can't be loaded from IE 6, you must download browser update offline and install it
 locally. I have included download of IE7 and IE8 here. I recommend IE8, because its latest release of IE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download IE7 for Windows XP here;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download IE 8 for Windows XP here;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=43" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=43</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After download, open the package and install newer browser. After you've installed it, try Windows Update again. Please inform if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit; You must install SP2 before these updates. Its available here;</p>

            <blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
OTOH you don't need to use a browser to get updates.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use AU.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may also be able to use Help and Support for its Support tab because I think it used to open with the old forums without having to have IE open the pages either.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly you can access
 the KB site using just H&amp;S and IIRC you can even access WU the same way.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now having a broken IE might also mean have a broken H&amp;S but that would refine your symptom description from being a problem&nbsp;about just IE to a more general problem with the OS browser
 support.</p>
<p><br />
BTW one thing that you should try, in case your crash symptoms are mostly&nbsp;due to&nbsp;incompatible add-ons, even though you do not have a Manage Add-ons command in IE6 you can still dramatically change such symptoms by using the&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uncheck&nbsp; Enable third-party browser extensions</p>
<p>(requires restart)</p>
<p>in&nbsp; Options, Advanced tab, Browsing section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think you may have to recheck that if you actually get to WU (or maybe it is just WUC) because it requires an ActiveX add-on be used to manage the updates.&nbsp;&nbsp; Best to use AU to get your updates IMO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>I have no need to sync the e-mails so I have not tried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case it is sufficient to see all new messages in the "buffer" of my operator's web-mail and not to see any old ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My "Inbox" contains only the new and undear nessages as I move all old ones to subject specific folders once they arrive at my laptop and keep them there "forever". So to me it would be a waste of space to keep the old messages on the phone as well.</p>

<p>You need to use the Nokia Ovi&nbsp; Suite -application. Connect the N97mini in the PC suite -mode to it. From the sync pages select what and how you want to sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that this applies only when you have connected your N97mini to your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to sync while unconnected then that's another story which I can't talk too much about.</p>
<p>I have adjusted the priorities so that my phone is always on top. Mind you, I don't need to sync with other people. My needs are thus different from those who use this for business purposes on a shared calendar.</p>

<h2>            Extra &#38; on my urls</h2>
                    <p>Hi<br />
Recenty Ive noticed bing ads is adding an extra &amp; on my urls when user click on my ads.<br />
My URL are formed like this</p>
<p>Final Ad URL: www.example.com?param1=something</p>
<p>Shared Account URL: {lpurl}&amp;param2=something</p>
<p>Click URL:www.example.com?param1=something<strong>&amp;&amp;</strong>param2=something</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice, when URL is concatenated by Bing Ads to mix both Final URL and Shared Account URL, an '&amp;' appears on the middle, causing duplication of symbol on my urls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what this is happening? It didnt happen before, this account hasn't been changed in a long time.</p>
<p>

<h2>            mail merge for mac 2016 only sending email to first one or two people from excel spreadsheet</h2>
                    <p>First, let me say that I know how to use mail merge. People have told me that mail merge for a mac does not work. However, I have used it before successfully.
</p>
<p>When I preview the merge in word, it shows all 200+ recipients with correct information. However, when I finish and send, my sent folder only contains the first two. What causes this and how do I fix it?</p>
<p>I have attempted to rearrange the spreadsheet, but no matter the order, only the first two are sent.

<p>
</p><p>Someone please cross post this to the several threads related to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has to do with<strong> tables in your word documen</strong>t, possibly only tables that you have inserted a merge field into - maybe some less exasperated soul can test that one out for us. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are Welcome and I will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following steps might help you configure Microsoft Exchange account on Mac Mail:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1. </p>
<p>Open&nbsp;<strong><em>Mac</em>&nbsp;<em>Mail</em></strong>. If this is the first time you have run&nbsp;<em>Mac</em>&nbsp;<em>Mail</em>, the Add Account wizard will be displayed, in which case you can skip steps 2 and 3.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2.</p>
<p>Click&nbsp;<strong>Preferences</strong>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<strong><em>Mail</em></strong>&nbsp;menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3. </p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Create an account</strong>&nbsp;button to open the&nbsp;<em>Add Account</em>&nbsp;wizard. This is located under the Accounts list, on the bottom-left of the window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 4.</p>
<p>Enter your name in the&nbsp;<em>Full Name</em>&nbsp;text-box. This is what most people will see when you send them an email. Type your email address in the&nbsp;<em>Email Address</em>&nbsp;text-box. Enter the password for the&nbsp;<em>mailbox</em>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em>Password</em>&nbsp;text box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 5.</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;<em>Incoming&nbsp;Mail&nbsp;Server</em>&nbsp;page, enter the following information: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account&nbsp;Type</strong>: Select&nbsp;<strong><em>Exchange</em></strong>&nbsp;from the drop down menu.</li><li><strong>Description</strong>:&nbsp;Enter a name for this account so you can identify it. This is only visible to you.</li><li><strong>Incoming&nbsp;<em>Mail</em>&nbsp;Server</strong>:&nbsp;Enter&nbsp;<em>exchange.livemail.co.uk</em>.</li><li><strong>User&nbsp;Name</strong>: Enter your full email address.</li><li><strong>Password</strong>:&nbsp;Enter the password for the&nbsp;<em>mailbox</em>.</li><li><strong>Outlook&nbsp;Web Access Server</strong>: Enter&nbsp;<em>exchange.livemail.co.uk</em>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Step 6.</p>
<p>Leave Authentication&nbsp;<em>set</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Password</em>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>, then enter the following information on the Outgoing&nbsp;<em>Mail</em>&nbsp;Server screen:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outgoing&nbsp;<em>Mail</em>&nbsp;Server</strong>:&nbsp;Enter&nbsp;<em>smtp.livemail.co.uk</em>.</li><li><strong>Use&nbsp;only this server</strong>: Tick this box.</li><li><strong>Use&nbsp;&nbsp;Authentication</strong>: Tick this box.</li><li><strong>User&nbsp;&nbsp;Name</strong>: Enter your full email address.</li><li><strong>Password</strong>:&nbsp;Enter the password for this&nbsp;<em>mailbox</em>&nbsp;(the same password&nbsp;that you entered on the previous screen).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Step 7.</p>
<p>Change Authentication to&nbsp;<em>Password</em>. Click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;and then confirm the details you have filled out and click the
<strong>Create button. </strong>Change Authentication to Password. Click <strong>
Next</strong> and then confirm the details you have filled out and click.</p>
