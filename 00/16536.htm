<h2>            IM login enable&#47;disable</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Experts,</p>
<p>One of our customer raised the below query:</p>
<p>Customer:<br />
-&nbsp;Has 2 domains. Lets call one A and the other B<br />
-&nbsp;Hybrid O365 model is set with A, and B is just tacked on as separate domain<br />
-&nbsp;A doesn’t run Lync<br />
-&nbsp;B does run on-premise Lync <br />
-&nbsp;The B on-premise Lync is not integrated with O365 in any way or shape (expected to close shortly and users will switch to Yammer fulltime)<br />
-&nbsp;The users are not assigned Skype E3 license</p>
<p>Right now the migrated users in O365 from domain B have option to try to sign in into IM inside O365. This fails, as there is as mentioned no Lync on-premise integration with O365.<br />
The users from domain A, with no Lync don’t have this IM logon option.</p>
<p>2 questions:<br />
-&nbsp;Can the IM login be globally disabled? <br />
-&nbsp;If not, what is synced AD attribute that triggers appearance of IM logon? <br />
o&nbsp;Is it SIP in proxyaddresses? <br />
o&nbsp;Or one or several Lync specific AD attributes?</p>

<p>Hi BalamuruganGanesan,</p>
<p>Based on your description, I understand that you want to disable the IM login option for all users in Outlook Web App.</p>
<p>If this is the case, please follow the steps below :<br />
a.&nbsp;<b><i><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a></i></b></p>
<p>b. To display the settings for instant messaging in the default OwaMialboxPolicy:<br />
<strong>Get-OwaMailboxPolicy OwaMailboxPolicy-Default | Format-List *instant* </strong>
<br />
c. To disable instant messaging for all users who are assigned the default mailbox plan, run the following command:<br />
<strong>Set-OwaMailboxPolicy OwaMailboxPolicy-Default -InstantMessagingEnabled $false</strong></p>
<p>If anything is misunderstood or you encounter any issue while following the steps above, please feel free to post back.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Poppy, </p>
<p>Many thanks for the response. </p>
<p>There is follow up question – and that’s if we are interested in on per-user basis – what is triggering the appearance of this logon option? Which if the AD attributes will do that?</p>
<p>As the customer is not sure they want to perform a Tenant level policy adjustment.</p>
<p>Please advise. </p>
<p>Many thanks. </p>

<p>Hi BalamuruganGanesan,</p>
<p>This appearance of this IM logon option is triggered in Office 365 instead of local AD. &nbsp;<br />
If you want to disable the IM functionality from Outlook Web App for individual users, please follow the steps below:<br />
1. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><i>Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</i></b></a>.</p>
<p>2. Run Windows PowerShell to create a new mailbox policy. For example, to create a new mailbox policy which is named Policy1, run the following commands:<br />
<strong>New-OwaMailboxPolicy -Name Policy1</strong><br />
<strong>Set-OwaMailboxPolicy -Identity Policy1 -InstantMessagingEnabled $false</strong><br />
3. Apply this policy to a user such as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, run the following command:<br />
<strong>Set-CASMailbox -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -OwaMailboxPolicy Policy1</strong></p>
<p>Please feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Poppy</p>

<h3> admin &#40;admin&#41;4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Rules</h2>
                    <p>When outlook rule is created , does it filter based on latest email only or all mails throughout an email chain?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example :&nbsp;</p>
<p>rule is to move message to folder x based on words in subject title "position list".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest email subject do not have this phrase but a previous email in the same chain has "position list" in subject</p>
<p>Understand that particular email would have been moved to folder x but how about the latest email?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to avoid a situation where someone replies to a message and changes subject but the new mail still gets affected by a rule due to an older mail in the same chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Once you have created a rule in your Outlook account, this will take effect on emails that falls under your criteria. Regarding your concern, if someone replies to an email that falls under your rule and decided to change its subject, this won't be affected
 by the rule anymore and it will show up on your Inbox folder.<br />
<br />
You can validate that by sending an email to your account first and set the subject that falls under your rule. Once you receive the email, try to reply to it and change the subject to see if it will show up on the Inbox folder.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need clarifications.

<h3> knighttof7  say:</h3>
<h2>            BIOS-BOOTMGR</h2>
                    <p>While trying to repartition, my system froze. On reboot I get "No Boot mgr" that's it. nothing else works accept to ,CTRL+ALT+DEL, which will reboot to same screen. I had previously partitioned to C: and D: in win 10 insiders build 16325, or 16255.</p>
<p>Now I tried to use a win 10 system repair disk from a regular win 10 build and it froze on language selection, the first blue screen to come up, Same again x3. Nothing new retained on reboot without repair disk, default boot .This is an Acer with win 7 AMD
 64 bit originally so I'm not understanding why I cant access the original internal backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to find a repair disk for my specific build but not exactly sure if I'm on the right path.</p>

<p>Hope you have a backup.&nbsp; It sounds like in the repartitions you got into the System partition that does not have a letter.&nbsp; You may have to reformat the drive and reinstall Windows and then do the partitions again.</p>
<p>Maybe if you have access to another computer you can download the Media Creation Tool and do a custom build and format all the partitions but the D: drive which I assume has just data.</p>

<p>its possible D was unlabeled. both C: and D: had data. I know I tried shrinking and expanding both and thinking I would have to format or assign as basic or dynamic and never got the chance. don't know if that's relevant.
</p>
<p>My media creation tool does nothing and the only way I can get to bios is to kill the power and take the battery out of the mother board. save for that and the CTRL+ALT+DEL. its frozen.
</p>
<p>I'm not concerned with files. I have those on a stick. I'm just trying to get the thing to breath,</p>
<p>even with 7 if I have to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anything I can download and burn to disk that will jump start this thing ?</p>

<h2>            samsung focus wont load certain web pages</h2>
                    so monday night my samsung focus sgh-i917(mango update installed and working perfectly for past couple months) started acting up, would only load certain websites with IE, "whats new" would update in the people hub, but wont connect to facebook chat, Hotmail
 would sync, but my AOL account that i had on it would not..you could type in Google.com, and it would load, and you could search,but type in Yahoo.com,&nbsp; and it would time out or give the message "trouble loading page". Facebook.com works fine in the browser,
 Hotmail.com wont load in the browser, etc.<br />
<br />
so i called the att tech line, guy had me delete the browsing history,power off the phone. he told me he was "removing me, then re-adding me to the network"..turn the phone back on, works perfect..until the next day, started doing the same thing as described
 above..so i went to the ATT store, girl put in a new SIM card..fired it up, worked perfect..until the next day..<br />
<br />
went back to the store for a second time, guy had me call the warranty line. they had me do a master reset on my phone, which i was not too thrilled about..that did not work..after i did that, i couldnt even setup my windows live account on the phone, kept
 saying "cant connect"<br />
<br />
so they sent me a new phone..got it around noon yesterday. by 1pm, i had installed all the latest updates and Mango....guess what? new phone wont let me connect to add my windows live account..IE is doing the same as orginally described..google, facebook.com
 will work...yahoo and other various sites will not<br />
<br />
so i went back to the store yet again, guy there couldnt figure it out after trying everything he could think of, and they told me to come back sunday when their "windows phone expert" is working....<br />
<br />
i can make phone calls and send texts just fine.<br />
<br />
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE?!?!?!?!?<br />
<br />

 much as a network problem...best of luck, you're in for some headaches lol

                    <p>Nokia 1520 shut down without warning in spite of the battery shows 70% left in it. It didn't happen before. Was this has to do with windows update? The system is on windows 8.1.Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Different Apple ID and Microsoft account issue</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
There are several topics about "Different Apple ID and Microsoft account issue ", but I didn't resolve my issue using them. Also Microsoft support asked me to post on community.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
I use different emails for my Apple ID and Microsoft account.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
1, I purchased office 365 home subscription for one year on my iPad with my Apple ID in Dec 2014</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
&nbsp; &nbsp;Everything works fine at this time</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
2, Three month later, I was asked to purchase a subscription on my iPad, and I did for one year subscription again in Mar 2015. (I had two subscriptions. I was stupid and I didn't notice that I had two subscriptions. )</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
3, The first subscription has expired in Dec 2015</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
4, My office 365 setting page now says "Your subscription has expired"</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
&nbsp; &nbsp;I still have active subscription on my Apple ID, but it seems the subscription is not linked to my Microsoft account. I can use office for iPad with my Microsoft account only on my iOS.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
I guess my second subscription purchased on my iPad is not linked to any Microsoft account. What should I do?</p>

</p><p>Please correct me if I am wrong, you're trying to add a mobile number and name to your existing contact's profile, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is indeed what you're trying to do, I regret to inform you but that is not possible in the new Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding a contact that does not have a Skype account (mobile or landline number) is different, you will need to call the number first to be able to add it on your contact list. But if you want to add a certain information to your existing contact's profile,
 it's not possible.</p>

<p>Almost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to add a landline. With name and phone number. </p>
<p>That is the majority of my current contact list, and when we are on vacation, that is what we use Skype for. It is also what we use Skype for the majority of the time we are home. Skype to landline.</p>
<p>I have been a Skype customer for years. We use the service for most of our long distance.</p>
<p>I have always been able to add a landline contact, with name and phone number.</p>
<p>Currently I am trying to add Knightsbridge Currency Exchange, which I use to buy foreign currency at home and on the road.</p>
<p>I am now able to save their phone number but I cannot enter "Knightsbridge".</p>
<p>That is what I want to do and what I have always done.</p>
<p>If this is not available to do on the new Skype, can I revert to the old Skype?</p>
<p>Why would you change this. I pay for this service, Canada and USA. I am not getting what I am paying for!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype "aircor"</p>

<p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please correct me if I am wrong, you're trying to add a mobile number and name to your existing contact's profile, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is indeed what you're trying to do, I regret to inform you but that is not possible in the new Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding a contact that does not have a Skype account (mobile or landline number) is different, you will need to call the number first to be able to add it on your contact list. But if you want to add a certain information to your existing contact's profile,
 it's not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further questions and clarifications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that is too bad. I am also a long time costumer calling land lines and cell phones with credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why did you change a very good app that worked perfectly for something that cannot do what it used to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you planning to take out that good feature of being able to call phones from the computer?<br />
Is that feature too good for the costumer and don't give enough money for the greedy corporation?</p>
<p>I am really disappointed that Microsoft bought Skype and now it is ruined.</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, I think you are using a business account. If you want to use a new tenant, you can sign up a new Office 365 account and purchase Office 365 business premium plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to add the Office 365 business premium plan to your tenant, please follow the link below and go to Office 365 admin center. Then go to Billing &gt; Purchase service, you can find and purchase Office 365 business premium plan there.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to Restore envelope icon to Dock for New Messages</h2>
                    How can I restore the envelope icon to Outlook on my dock -- it used to display the envelope to notify me of a new unread message, but I ran a "clean-up" program to free up space and now the envelope icon doesn't appear. &nbsp;I've seen answers to this question
 on discussions for PCs but am looking for the solution for the MAC version.

            I suspect that if checking the preferences does not fix the issue, you'll need to re-install Office. Running those 'clean up' applications can do some really bad things to Office. We've had updaters fail to update after users ran things like monolingual.<br />
<br />
If you need to gain space there are other ways that are safe to find large files.<br />
<br />
Re-install Office 2011<br />

                    <p>Excel 2013 keeps crashing whenever it is saving a temporary file (autosave). I tried turning save autorecover information off but it keeps saving temporary files every now and then (even if less often)&nbsp;and crashing the program. It is an incredibly annoying

<h2>            Whatsapp not working on Lumia 640 &#40;Win 10&#41;</h2>
                    Today I updated my software and now I cannot use Whatsapp anymore. When i open it, it says it's loading, but it crashes eventually. I restarted my phone&nbsp; and reinstalled Whatsapp multiple times, but the problem wasn't fixed. I even tried Whatsapp Beta,
 but again, it didn't help.

            WhatsApp started to work after almost 2 days of loading issues. I believe was caused by recent updates to the app. But, it suddenly happened again...then once again started working. So I am hoping it keeps working.

<p>As many other apps besides WhatsApp don't work, I think the reason is not WhatsApp but the OS.</p>
<p>Ofcourse WhatsApp is for many people the most important app.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate
 if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Are you getting this whoops! message while opening&nbsp;MSN on MSN app or on website too?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Have you tried any other web browser to open MSN? If yes, was the result same?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I would suggest you to open msn home page from Internet explorer and see the difference. If still you face issue in opening MSN page then try to follow the troubleshooting steps provided below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First try to run the fixit provided in the following article and see if it helps you to fix the issue. This fixit diagnose and repair IE problems that make IE slow, not secure, unstable or crash,
 caused by add-ons not working or inappropriate security settings. </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Fixit doesn't help, lets try these methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There could possibly be a problematic add-on which might be causing the problem. Let’s try the following to see if an add-on is causing this issue. We can do this by running Internet Explorer
 in <strong><span>No Add-ons</span></strong> mode. If the problem is not present in No Add-ons mode we can diagnose that it is an add-on that is causing the issue, and from there we can take steps to locate and disable
 the add-on. To open <strong><span>Internet Explorer</span></strong> in
<strong><span>No Add-ons mode</span></strong>, please do the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>Open the desktop, and then tap or click the Internet&nbsp;Explorer icon on the taskbar.</span></li><li>
<span>Tap or click the <strong>
<span>Tools</span></strong> button, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Manage add-ons</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Under <strong><span>Show</span></strong>, tap or click
<strong><span>All add-ons</span></strong>, and then select the add-on you want to turn off.</span></li><li>
<span>Tap or click <strong>
<span>Disable</span></strong>, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Close</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<strong><span>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</span></strong></li></ol>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Delete the browser cache and check. Follow these steps to do so.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Start Internet Explorer 11.<br />
b. On the <strong><span>Tools </span></strong>menu, click
<strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong>. If you can't see the Tools menu, press Alt to display the menus.<br />
c. Click the <strong><span>General</span></strong> tab.<br />
d. Under <strong><span>Browsing History</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>Delete</span></strong>.<br />
e. In the <strong><span>Delete Browsing History</span></strong> dialog box, click to select the following check boxes, and then click

f. Click <strong><span>Close</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong> to close the
<strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong> dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If issue persists and the issue is specific to some websites then&nbsp;I would suggest you to open that websites in compatibility view and see if it helps.

    <title>Hyperlink Volatility Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gary&#39;s student  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlink Volatility Issue</h2>
                    <p>I am having a small problem with volatility in a UDF associated with hyperlinks.&nbsp; The UDF is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public Function hyperAdd(r As Range) As String</p>
<p>Application.Volatile</p>
<p>hyperAdd = "no hyperlink"</p>
<p>If r.Hyperlinks.Count = 0 Then Exit Function</p>
<p>hyperAdd = r.Hyperlinks(1).Address</p>
<p>End Function</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In A1 I enter:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.abc.com</a></p>
<p>In B1 I enter:</p>
<p>=hyperAdd(A1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and B1 displays the correct result.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I re-select A1, and in the formula bar, change &nbsp;abc to nbc, B1 does not change.</p>
<p>I have to select A1 <u>again</u>, touch <b>F2</b> and then <b>ENTER</b> to get the function to update!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone verify this?</p>
<p>Is this normal behavior or is it Excel’s problem or is it my problem??</p>

            <p>I can reproduce the problem, and it appears to be a bug in the way Excel handles changes to hyperlinks to me. Changing cell A1 does trigger a recalculation of the UDF, but apparently this occurs after the cell's
<em>value</em> has changed but before the cell's&nbsp;<em>hyperlink</em> has been updated. Very strange...</p>

<p>No. Currently available WP 7.x devices are only able to run apps written with C# (and Silverlight or XNA framework). WP8 devices will support app written with native C++ as well, but no Java support still.</p>

<h2>            Music stops half way through slideshow video</h2>
                    The music stops half way through video at the same point but does not start again. It plays through to the end in playback as you are editing but once converted to a video and it is played in windows media it stops at the same point each time. The video
 length is 2.30 minutes and the music track is 1.30 minutes. Can anybody help?

            Thanks for taking time to reply, but you didn't address my question. I've already followed this guidance. My Facebook app is already marked as do not run in the background, and today it consumed 43% in the background and 0% 'in use' or foreground. No other
 battery saving tips will help because it's all being consumed by Facebook, and isn't lasting through the day. I've solved my immediate problem by uninstalling Facebook.

<p>I installed the Facebook app from the store. It has a different icon.&nbsp; The original (which was pre-installed) was a blue background with white letter 'F'. The new app is a blue background with a white overlay, and a blue 'F'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only is the user interface in&nbsp;the app different, but I no longer see the latest Facebook post for each of my contacts in the People app. They were there yesterday with the old app, but now gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the bright side, this app appears to observe the 'do not run in background' setting, so unless I open the app, it is not using processor/battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really liked the old feature which was integrated with the people app, but at least I have the option to use Facebook on my phone and still get through the day on one charge.</p>

    <title>Add-in with helper workbook--is there a better way&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoss n. feffer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add-in with helper workbook--is there a better way&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want users to be able to directly edit settings currently contained on worksheets within an add-in.&nbsp; Worksheets within an add-in can't be made visible.&nbsp; So what's the best way to do it?&nbsp; Maybe putting the settings in an auxiliary regular workbook that
 is opened and closed with the add-in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the summary, here are the details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working on converting many of the tools I have in my personal macro workbook (Personal.xlsb) to an add-in (.xlam) that others can use more easily.&nbsp; Some of my macros use the worksheets within Personal to store settings (which usually remain hidden, but
 can be made un-hidden by macro or manually).&nbsp; I want those settings to be available to the user to view or change&nbsp;however they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, once&nbsp;I make the workbook into an add-in, the sheets&nbsp;cannot be made visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first idea to work around this was to have an auxiliary workbook (.xlsx) that is used only for these settings.&nbsp; The workbook could be opened when the add-in loads and saved and closed when Excel exits.&nbsp; But it changes the way Excel behaves in a far-too-noticeable
 way:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>Without the add-in</td>
<td>With the add-in</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1. On startup</td>
<td>If Excel is loaded without a file, a new blank workbook is created.</td>
<td>Hidden auxiliary workbook is opened, but empty Excel window is visible instead of a new blank workbook.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. On exiting</td>
<td>When the last open workbook is closed with the Excel window "x" button, Excel also exits.&nbsp; (If it is closed with the document "x" button, Excel remains open with a blank window.)</td>
<td>When the last visible workbook is closed (regardless of which "x" button is used) Excel remains open with a blank window.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think I could work around issue 1 by checking to see if there are other workbooks open when my add-in loads (i.e. did they open Excel using a file name or not) and if not, add a new workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2nd issue, I'm not sure about.&nbsp; I don't think the Application.WorkbookClose event gives any information about how the workbook was closed.&nbsp; So I could make it always stay open after the last visible workbook is closed, or always exit Excel after the
 last visible workbook is closed.&nbsp; Either way, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
sometimes</span> the behavior would be different from how it used to behave before my add-in was installed (and different from what the user would expect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to use a helper workbook and have Excel behave the same way as before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a better way to give the user access to the stored settings, without using an auxiliary workbook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One idea I have is to use a temporary auxiliary workbook.&nbsp; In this case, the settings would be stored in the add-in, but would be copied to a new workbook by the user's request, and copied back to the add-in also at the user's request.&nbsp; When copied back,
 the temporary workbook would be closed.</p>

<h3> soft-spec  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Office 365 Original Message Missing</h2>
                    <p>I sent a message out and a person responded. His settings are to include the original message in with his response. I receive the response and the heading of the original message but no text from the original message so I do not know what he is responding
 to because we send the messages with the same subject back and forth several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The odd thing is that if I view the message on my iPad, I see the original message--but when I view it on my computer or on my iPhone using Office 365 Outlook, the original message text is missing. What's up with that? Is there a setting on the Exchange
 Server that is off. I see the message threads for other messages that people reply to.</p>

            <p>Hi Soft-Spec,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, there is no such settings in Office 365. </p>
<p>As the issue is a little odd, to narrow down the root cause of the issue, I’d like to collect the following information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Regarding “I see the message threads for other messages that people reply to.” Do you mean that the issue occurs to specific person? I suggest you ask him to confirm if he remove the original text manually when replying your email.
</li><li>Please sign in to OWA and check if the issue persists there. </li><li>If possible, please also let the sender reply your message from web service and check the result.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Pamela,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. According to my experience, the Outlook client is not able to remove the original part of the message.
</p>
<p>I understand that you can view them in the iPad, as this issue is a little weird, can you access the
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA</a> and check it works fine? Because we need to make sure the root cause is not related to the backend.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, I wonder if the Outlook client is the latest version. Please navigate to File &gt; office account &gt; update options to check it.</p>
<p>Can you let the sender send you a test email, save it as an attachment and send it to me via private message?
<span>&nbsp;</span>Open this email &gt; click File &gt; Save as…</p>
<p><span>I have sent you a private message. Please click on the link below to access it.<br />

            I had the person whose responses were omitting the original message thread send a message to the test account that you suggested. He said he sent one so that you could review it. Did you check it? Did it reveal anything?

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the information.</span></p>
<p><span>I have checked the email thread both in OWA and the Outlook client and I can see the complete original message.</span></p>
<p><span>To further investigate the issue, I would like to confirm whether the issue just occurs on the specific email thread or all the threads.</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, to see if the issue is related to your Outlook client, please
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new profile</a> for your account and ask the sender to send test the emails to test the issue.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Pam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, you can check if the issue also occurs to other users. Then we can confirm if the issue is indeed related to your side.
</p>
<p>I have received the test email and it works fine on my side. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, to confirm if it’s an Outlook client issue. I suggest you disconnect the account from Outlook client for a while, then just use the OWA to receive this email and check if the issue persists.

            No updates to report. We have asked our friend Jim whose emails fail to include the original messages to forward his responses to us instead of replying . . . sometimes the original message is included with his forward and sometimes it is not. The issue
 remains only with the one friend and his messages are a problem for me as well as for other Outlook users.&nbsp; As a result, we are attributing it to something on his end.

            <p>Hi Pamela,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>As the issue only occurs on one sender, it is possible that the issue might lie on the sender side.
</p>
<p>I have checked the sender and he is using another email system not Exchange Online.</p>
<p>Given the situation, from Office 365 side, what we can do is to disconnect all other connections for now and only use OWA to receive the emails. If the issue persists, you need to contact the sender for further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
