            Hy!
<div><br />
<div>It seems that you have a hardware failure. No laptop will turn off touchpad while it's located on a desk. If you have a USB mouse, connect it to the laptop and check wheter it's working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can also go to Control Panel --&gt; Mouse --&gt; Pointer options and check for anything like 'Turn off automaticly' or something similar.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the touchpad still doen't work, reply to me with a bit more specific infromation about your computer (Windows version, exact laptop model etc.).</div>

<h2>            Win 10 Creators update - broke AMD A6, then downgrade to Win 8, now Windows Update process sticking....</h2>
                    <p>My HP Pavilion dv6 with an AMD A6 processor &amp; 4gb of memory had been sluggish after a forced upgrade 12/24/17 onto Windows 10 Creator. The problem was that my CPU was typically stuck running at about 50% usage even when idle.&nbsp; I had successfully reset this
 about 8 weeks before by going to:&nbsp;"Control Panel &gt; Recovery &gt; Open System Restore" and had a checkpoint that allowed me to revert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not so lucky after the 12/24 update. Tried to revert, but there was no previous checkpoint now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was told to try rebuild (clean install) after having downloaded an iso of 1709 and installing trying to keep apps and data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having been extra cautious in the past, I had a fully working Win 8 install on a different laptop disk that had worked on this PC before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you follow this, the disk that I had in there with Win 10, had been a Win 7 drive that got updated. I pulled it out and replaced it with a disk that now boots Win 8 and has most of the applications that were on the newer O/S but have not been updated
 since around 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a Win 8 internal disk running but am having similar issues with the CPU running at around 30% when it should be idle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main difference now though, is that when I see that the CPU is being taxed - I can open Task Mgr and see that under Processes, I see Service Host: Local System (14) with a listing for Windows Update.&nbsp; Unlike in Windows 10, this service can be stopped
 and the CPU returns from breathing hard back to a resting 3-8 % usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now why would I want to kill Windows Update? - Well, because, after running overnight, it still hasn't updated anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which on some of the line items listed produced essentially "not found" errors on the dll requested, so I'm stuck in the middle of update Hell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my hardware is too old to run Win 10&nbsp; ver. 1709 it would seem that I should be able to downgrade to 8.1 with some level of stability. I was reasonably happy with Win10, but not when I have to constantly guard against abusive updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Merry Christmas from Redmond.... buy an Intel based Surface (or else)&nbsp; :-(</p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting the <strong>Windows Update Components </strong>does not stop or disable the
<strong>Windows Update Service</strong>. Upon downgrading, you can only downgrade to the previously installed or factory installed operating system on your PC. Performance issue causes does not only come from the Windows Update Service, performance issues could
 also happen due to some other applications or because of your CPU capabilities itself. What we can recommend for now is running the
<strong>Microsoft Easy Fix tool for optimizing Windows speed and performance</strong>. You can download the tool by clicking

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Gregs Response:</span></em></strong> - My reason for the "resetting" is that my CPU percentage jumps to about 30% and stays there for hours on end but no Windows Update ever takes place.&nbsp; However, if I
 drill down into "Task Manager &gt; Processes &gt; Service Host (14) &gt; Windows Update" -&nbsp; I can stop that process and the cpu returns to normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am half expecting it to want to update to 8.1 during all the activity, but there is no indication after literally overnight of running at this clip, that anything has been done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After running off and on like this&nbsp;for over a week (stopping Windows update manually), I found a GUI under Settings that told me that I had 97 updates to do and gave a list of them (none being Win10). I went for it and happily, after several hours, it then
 reported that it was ready to update to Win 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, another several hours later, I experienced a login that had mouse activity (or touchpad) but showed no cursor and a CPU that was running at 30% constantly again. The mouse cursor returned after several times of unplugging the usb.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time it was reportedly the service that provided low level access to imaging devices. Windows said that if I stopped it that it would become unstable and reboot. I let it run and hours later stopped it expecting the worse. Instead, after it quit, the
 CPU returned to normal and the only thing that happened was that after quitting and restarting Outlook, it crashed once. When restarted again, it was fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So today, it seems that there are more updates coming related to Win 8.1 but overall more consistent performance than the last Win 10 Creators update which I'm still digging out from.</p>

<h2>            INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE in Windows 10 after running Hardware troubleshooter</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I could not access my USB flash drive. Checking in Device Manager said there were no drivers installed. I've been able to access the flash drive loads of times before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried updating the drivers but it couldn't find any. I then ran the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and it claimed the problem was fixed but needed a restart. When I did so Windows gave a BSOD and INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive works fine in my parents' laptop and as a music stick in my car.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot start Windows 10 Home (1709) in either normal mode or Safe Mode. Startup Repair fails to fix the problem and there are no System Restore points to go back to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried restoring drive C: from my morning backup - it restored OK but did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been into the Recovery Console Command Prompt and run bootrec /rebuildbcd, rebuilt the BCD after backing it up and this didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran bootrec /fixmbr and bootrec /fixboot - neither fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into DISKPART I notice I have neither a Boot nor a System partition any more, but I can see all the volumes including the hidden 450 Mb one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My boot drive is a SSD and I have 2 standard HDDs too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do next to get my Boot and System partitions back and get Windows to boot again! :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Steven</p>

            Hi Steven.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug the hard drives while you troubleshoot because the System boot manager may have been derailed to another hard drive if you can't see  System Reserved or EFI System partition on the SSD now.  
<br />
<br />This is easier to see if you boot a partition manager like free Partition Wizard and post back a picture  showing all drives attached and all listings columns, which we read like a doctor reads Xrays:  <a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.partitionwizard.com/download.html</a>
<br />
<br />Using Diskpart you'd run List Volume and then Detail Volume to see which is System or Active flagged (for Legacy installs Active flag points to the System partition).  
<br />
<br />It might be possible to start Windows by running Startup Repair from booted media with the other drives unplugged.  If not, everything possible is here for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then I'd save time by rescuiing any files needed then do the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Remember to keep the other drives detached during install or else it can derail the System boot files to another hard drive which is what you may have now.  Once installed you can post back a screenshot showing all drives attached for us to analyze.  
<br /> <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />If it's a Legacy BIOS then to avoid interference with another drive make sure the SSD remains set first to boot in BIOS setup.  If UEFI then it needs to stay Windows Boot Manager, booting media from the BIOS Boot interrupt key only as a UEFI device.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for the quick reply!</p>
<p>Just to let you know that I won't get chance to try any of this until later this week at the earliest.</p>
<p>However will I be able to create a bootable CD using the free version of Partition Wizard? If not how will I be able to run it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a legacy BIOS on mine (home built but getting old now!) and the boot order is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removable</p>
<p>CD</p>
<p>SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see screenshots I'm uploading. I'm guessing the problem is that I do not have a Boot partition and my C: drive is incorrectly marked as a System partition? This laptop I'm using has drive C: as Boot and the 'SYSTEM RESERVED' partition marked as System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CHKDSK found a lot of issues and fixed them but the second time came back clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see I tried rebuilding the MBR but my PC still won't boot up (same error).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you advise what I should try next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

            if it repaired file system errors in system files then they may have become scrambled and unable to boot Windows.<br /><br />What we see is that she is self booting because it is March system which means it contains its own system boot files. However in an MBR Legacy BIOS install it should also be marked active which points the BIOS to the system partition.<br /><br />So boot the partition disk, right-click C to mark it active.

            Then run startup repair from the bootable Windows media a few times. The partition disk may also have a rebuild MBR function that will help achieve this if you run it first after marking active.<br /><br />Otherwise if you have successfully exported and then rebuilt the MBR there really isn't anything else you can do except one last resort if you cannot bear the thought of losing that particular install. Keep in mind that if you follow the install I linked you will have the best install in the world, so keeping this one may not be worth fussing with much longer.<br /><br />The Last Resort is to boot the partition manager and Shrink C by about 50-100 GB.   then boot the Windows Media and select the shrink space only to install Windows. If this works it will configure a dual boot menu where one of the choices may start the old install. If so I will give you steps to remove the old install after moving the boot manager to the new one. If not you can set up the new install following the tutorial I pro

<h2>            Clean Install Windows 7 SP1 &#40;64 bit&#41; Error 8024402F</h2>
                    <div>*Edit - I've been redirected to networking from the Windows Update team.*</div>
<div><br />
</div>
After performing a clean install of Windows 7 using the SP1 64 bit DVD, I am receiving the 8024402F error.
<div>I have done this same install on 2 computers this past week and had the same error on both computers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Things that I have tried that do not work:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Tried bringing this laptop to my home network to install updates</li><li>I have tried running the Microsoft Fix It tool</li><li>Disabled automatic updates with all the tick boxes</li><li>Changed DNS settings</li><li>Disabled Firewall</li><li>Installed TinyWall&nbsp;</li><li>Installed .net 4 using web install</li><li>Upgraded to IE9 using offline installer</li><li>Tried running a Bat file which disables and enables services</li><li>Deleted / Renamed the SoftwareDistribution folder</li><li>System readiness tool</li></ul>
<br />
<div>Things to Note:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I am able to use Windows Update properly on many other computers just fine. Only not the ones freshly installed to SP1</li><li>Yes, I am able to connect and browse the internet</li><li>All drivers appear to be working correctly</li><li>I have checked my router and nothing appears out of the ordinary&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>
I'm sure there are more that I can't remember.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have done this same process probably about a hundred times with no problems using this DVD and going straight from SP1 to install the 100+ windows updates. Only within the last week or two something has changed on the Windows Update site that no longer
 allows me to start installing Windows Updates from a newly formatted drive with W7SP1.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Were there some changes in Windows Updates in September/October? Is there a patch for this?</div>

            <p>SUCCESS!</p>
<p>Here's what I discovered, see if it works for you as well.</p>
<p>Apparently my ISP (mediacom) was blocking traffic for Windows Update. I installed a free VPN client to go around them and installed all updates. Now that the machine is updated, I don't need the VPN client to do the optional updates.</p>
<p>Since the initial SP1 update was failing, and Windows 7 32 bit was successful, I can only assume that either update server or type of traffic for Windows 7 64 SP1 is different. I didn't do a packet capture so I can't say for sure.</p>

<h2>            Forza Motorsport 4 - sterowanie</h2>
                    
<p>Witam</p>

<p>Mam takie w sumie głupie pytanie ale dla mnie ważne.Otóż przymierzam się do kupna gry Forza Motorsport 4 i na razie grałem w demo tej gry niestety w demie jest głupie sterowanie na padzie (trzeba grać tymi gałkami) a ja wolałbym grać "krzyżakiem" i dodawać
 gaz np. klawiszem A a nie jak to jest w demie klawisze RT z tyłu pada.Czy w pełnej wersji jest możliwość zmiany tych ustawień na padzie?Proszę o odp. właściecieli Forzy 4 :)</p>

<p>Pozdrawiam</p>

<p>polecam jednak przestawić się na klawisze i gałki analogowe; przyciski zwykłe to funkcja zero-jedynkowa, czyli albo dodajesz gaz albo nie, nie ma możliwości ustawienia "siły" gazu, tak samo skręty - jak chcesz skręcić delikatnie, jeżeli na krzyżaku masz
 tylko skręt, bez ustalenia jego wychylenia? forza to w miarę mocna symulacja, bez analogów raczej ani rusz; w obecnych czasach wszystkie gry korzystają z ego schematu, spróbuj i naucz się, poczujesz ogromną różnicę jak się już przyzwyczaisz!</p>

<p>Jest możliwość zmiany np. gazu na A. Jednak nie ma możliwości zmiany sterowania na krzyżak. I tak jak wyżej masz napisane, nie będziesz w stanie jeździć samochodami z wyższych klas (A, S, R3 itp) bez odpowiedzniego "dozowania" gazu i delikatnego kontrowania
 kierownicą (analogiem).</p>

In both scenarios, if you click OK, you will have an empty screen with a moveable mouse cursor and then you are stuck.<br />
<br />
I can assure you with 100% certainty that:<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1</b>: &nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Step 1</b>:&nbsp; Booting into Safe Mode will not replace a corrupt dnsapi.dll file<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Step 2</b>:&nbsp; Booting into Clean Boot will not replace a corrupt dnsapi.dll file<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2</b>:&nbsp; Since you cannot boot, you will not be running the System File Checker<br />
<br />
<b>Method 3</b>:&nbsp; Booting into Last Known Good Configuration will not replace a corrupt dnsapi.dll file.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not what LKGC is for, that is not what it does and that is not how it works.<br />
<br />
Now, since I am not engaged by Microsoft as one of their Support Engineer "experts" I suppose you must try the ideas from their "experts" first, so do let us know how that works out.&nbsp; I think it is just more of their

            Thanks for the suggestions. I was unable to do as Praveen suggested. This was in part because the instructions took me to places where my iPad (the only working computer I had) would not access, and when I used the links at work it tried starting to run
 something &nbsp;that the system at work blocked.

<div>So I have a found a repairman man, who took about 5 hours to fix, involving getting an extra harda drive to copy files on to. Five fiiles had been corrupted.</div>

            Even if you were able to do as the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" suggested, those ideas would not help you.<br />
<br />
I was hoping the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" would take a few moments to reproduce the problem, apply those "<b>Methods</b>" and "<b>Steps</b>" and then when then did not work, come back with some ideas that actually do work, but alas...&nbsp; that
 never seems to happen around here.&nbsp; As usual, my expectations of the Microsoft engaged "experts" exceeds reality!<br />

Sounds like you found a good resource though.<br />

    <title>Windows Update 80248014 error and XP mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saltgrass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update 80248014 error and XP mode</h2>
                    <p>I have checked the suggested threads but did not see anything directly related.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am seeing some errors in the WindowsUpdate.log that I am a little interested to find the cause.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My Windows update seems to be working fine, but the errors may be pointing to a future problem.</p>
<p>I believe the errors started when I installed XP mode on my Windows 7 x64 Ultimate 6 month old system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My other system without the XP mode does not exhibit the errors.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Before I uninstall the XP mode to test, I would like to know if someone has any insight into the situation or a suggestion for a solution.</p>
<p>WindowsUpdate.log shows the follow entries (many times):</p>
<p><strong>668<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1384<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Report<span>&nbsp; </span>WARNING: Reporter failed to upload events with hr = 80248014.</strong></p>
<p><strong>668<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1384<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>PT<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>WARNING: PTError: 0x80248014</strong></p>
<p>From watching the system is appears the messages are generated when the svchost (668), which holds Windows Update, tries to check for a registry value
 for a 2012 entry.<span>&nbsp; </span>I do not show a 2012 value on either of my systems.</p>
<p><b>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones\Central Standard Time\Dynamic DST\2012</b></p>
<p>There is a 2006 and 2007 entry, but not a 2012 and of course the entry would be in
<em>your</em> time zone entries.</p>
<p>0x80248014 “WU_E_DS_UNKNOWNSERVICE -- the caller has requested some action on a service that is not known to the datastore”</p>
<p>My system clock seems to be synchronizing fine.
</p>
<p>The XP virtual machine has auto updates enabled and has downloaded required updates.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help or guidance..</p>

            I have know about that reference for quite a while, but nothing contained in it to explain the problem.<br />
<br />
Don't know why, but it appears having the XP mode installed is trying to get Windows Update to do something it normally does not do.<br />
<br />
I connected the problem to the XP mode because the errors started the day I installed it.&nbsp; The entries in the WindowsUpdate.log were made at the same time as the referenced registry query, as seen in

            <p><span>Hi Saltgrass,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which updates are you installing?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to install the updates successfully?</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these methods.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Disable the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
security software</a> temporarily.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and
 other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during
 the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>Put the computer in </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Clean Boot</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>state to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow
<b>Step 7</b> from the link to return the computer to <b>Normal startup mode</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span>
</span><span>You can also install the updates (KB number) manually by downloading from Microsoft download center.</span></p>

<h2>            Falsely Accused of Cheating and Reported</h2>
                    
<p>Having had Xbox Live for 9 years, My Reputation has always been "Good" until now. I checked my reputation history on the Enforcement Site and it showed that for that last 6 months, my record has been spotless except for a handful of reports. I got gang reported
 by a group of 6 people and that was enough to drop my reputation from "Good" to "Avoid Me". I now can't find games in Overwatch or Halo. Getting falsely reported has caused me to not be able to play games. This needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>The Reporting System is being abused and misused and innocent people are paying the price for it (while paying for Xbox Live, which due to this, they can't use). I need me profile reputation reset due to a small group of people misusing the Report system.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to navigate to&nbsp;<strong><span>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC</span></strong><span> (click to get permission when prompted) and delete the contents of that folder (delete everything in that folder, but leave
 that folder and everything above it).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Then go back to setting, accounts, sign in options.&nbsp;Your non-working pin will now be gone, and you can just click 'add a pin' and set it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help!</p>

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            Hi Roman, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Roman, thank you for that . . .
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers Website, from there download and install the Chipset driver they recommend, also while there is there is any Intel Software recommended like Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) you should also install that . . .

            The minidump file points to an issue with the ehstorclass.sys (Enhanced Storage Class driver for IEEE 1667 devices) and storahci.sys (MS AHCI Storport Miniport Driver) :
<br />
<br />0x9F_3_EhStorClass_IMAGE_storahci.sys
<br />
<br />The problem seems to revolve around the Crucial SSD:
<br />
<br />DeviceInst is "SCSI\Disk&amp;Ven_&amp;Prod_CT500MX500SSD1\7&amp;7b9b3dc&amp;0&amp;010000"
<br />
<br />Which SATA port is the Crucial SSD connected to?
<br />
<br />Also, can you provide the following file which has more information on the crash:
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP
<br />
<br />The memory.dmp file will be quite large, you could zip and compress the memory.dmp file with a third party application such as 7-Zip.

    <title>Can I Use My USA Xbox In Germany&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cevap95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I Use My USA Xbox In Germany&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I plan on going to Germany for 2 months on vacation. I was planning on bring my Xbox 360 but I had a few concerns that I wish could be resolved with the help of the forums. They are...</p>
<p>-Will I need a power supply converter.<br />
-Will Xbox Live Work. (If yes, will i need to change my region to German instead of leaving it to US.)</p>
<p>-I had also heard that you only have the ability to change your region every six months, is this true?</p>
<p>-Is there some sort of list of games that will be blocked in Germany? </p>
<p>-Is Netflix blocked?</p>
<p>-Will I have problems with getting picture to the T.V. since Germany runs with PAL and US does not. I was planning on using an HDMI if I am able to.</p>
<p>-Will German games not work on my US Xbox, if i were to rent one at the time.</p>
<p>-And if not much of this is possible, where would I be able to purchase an Xbox in Germany, a "German" Xbox, not US.</p>
<p>Please respond and Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can answer a few questions for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe you will need a power supply converter, but I'm not exactly sure how that works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xbox Live will work, however, you won't have access to the same things you do in the US. You can still use your US account, and it should only cause an issue if you are trying to download region locked content. Netflix is only available in the US and Canada,
 so I doubt it will work in Germany. Account migration is only available for a few countries and Germany and the US are not in the list. So you wouldn't be able to change your account's region. You could create a German account if you want though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as playing games on your Xbox, you'll have to check the disc. There are some discs that are region free and will work on PAL or NTSC consoles, but you may run across a lot of PAL discs which will not run on your US console.</p>

<p>I have a conclusive answer to this. &nbsp;You will definitely need a local Xbox power supply, voltage converter, or transformer.</p>
<p>I traveled out to Qatar with my US Xbox. &nbsp;I saw the suggestions here and picked up a local Xbox power supply (For those in Doha, Qatar, I picked it up from Technical Care Centre in the City Center Mall). &nbsp;However, before I tried that, I called the XBox support
 number to confirm. &nbsp;The person on the phone thought I could just plug it into an adapter (no converter or transformer) and confirmed with her supervisor. &nbsp;So I tried it, and tripped the circuit breaker in my hotel room. &nbsp;I reset the breaker and tried the local
 power supply. &nbsp;Thankfully, the XBox seems to work still. &nbsp;Hopefully my US power supply still works when I get back home (they annotated my account and will give me a free replacement if it is an issue, given that it was due to their advice).</p>

 but it still won't work. I also ran a program to fix hardware- driver problems, and still no luck. I tried to do a restore system. followed all the steps, and ok, said it could not apply the setting because the file directory name,or volume label syntax is
 incorrect, whatever that means!! What else could I try??&lt;/textarea&gt;</div>

<p><span>Hi Lin redfern,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 you say it cuts in and out, do you mean to say that the audio cuts in and out while playing files in Windows Media Player?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 this issue happen with one particular file (like mp3) or irrespective of the file that is being played?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you make any changes to the computer before this issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/How-do-I-stop-my-music-from-skipping-or-breaking-up-when-I-play-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How
 do I stop my music from skipping or breaking up when I play it?</span></a></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Uninstall and reinstall the player</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above suggestion fails you may uninstall and reinstall the player from by turning off the feature from Programs and Features.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note that uninstalling Windows Media Player 12 also disables Windows Media Center because WMC uses WMP12 for its operation.</span></p>
<p><span>Also note that this will revert the setting of Windows Media Player to its default setting when it was first installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer this article for help with turning off a feature.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Re-register Windows Media Player</span></strong></p>

<p>Hi No! You might lose a windows update, but all your files and apps will be good. It just installs windows 10 over the top of the OS. It will try to fix windows. It can fix some things. It's worth a try. I don't know why your icons disappeared. You might
 try a sfc /scannow first! It won't hurt any thing and will fix windows files.</p>

<p>Hi Thanks for your reply. That's good that no integrity violations were found. Have you tried a System restore to a time when your icons were working?? If that doesn't work, then you may have to use the HTG link I posted in above reply! Here's how to do
 a system restore. That might work for you!</p>

<strong>nineteen</strong>. It's very weird and i really have no idea why its like this, im a computer nerd so i usually solve these problems but this one really makes my head scratch.&nbsp;<br />

            <p><span><span>Hi,  </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10. </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate you for trying the troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might occur due to some corruption with the graphic card drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to update your graphic drivers from the device manager and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To update the <strong>graphics</strong></span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">drivers</span></strong><span> from device manager please
 follow the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows key + X</span></strong> and click on
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Expand <strong>Display Adapter</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the <strong>graphic card
</strong>and select <strong><span>Update Driver Software</span></strong>.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, I suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the
<strong>graphic card drivers </strong>in the compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Compatibility mode</span></strong></span><span><span>runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps to install the drivers in
<strong>compatibility</strong> <strong>mode</strong> and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Right-click on the <strong>
driver setup file</strong> and click on <strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box
<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this helps. Please respond if you have any further related query.</span></span></p>

    <title>The best region - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The best region</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, i got this idea from the old forums when a lot more people said they lived in iowa then i thought lol. then i got to thinking "i wonder who would have the better players". so my idea was to have a tournament of sorts with multiple people from each region
 (mid-west, south west, east coast, west coast, and people from hawaii and alaska) to see what region seems to have the better players. i think if people were interested i can get set on rules and the bracket. what do people think? we could also do individual
 states as well for a true tournament style bracket (if people wanted it to be longer).</p>

<h3> paradoxofpurple  say:</h3>
<h2>            All non-windows processes suspended at startup</h2>
                    For the last month or so, all programs that I try to open start as suspended- &nbsp;I have to go in to resource moniter&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;and resume them, otherwise I could literally end up waiting hours for them to start. Not a problem with opening windows explorer,
 task manager, etc. Also not a problem with programs set to run at startup.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Don't know if this is significant, but &nbsp;nothing is under "analyze wait chain", and when I hit resume, about half the time a box comes up that says it was suspended by another user.</div>
<div>I've run virus scans, found nothing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought I had fixed the problem by uninstalling Firefox, but no dice, problem came back. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Are you logged into administrator account?<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you follow these methods and check if they help.<br />
<br />
<br />
The could also be related to memory problems. I'd have you run Memory Diagnostic tool and check if the issue persists.<br />
Diagnosing memory problems on your computer</span><br />

<br />
<br />
It can also due to virus infection, I'd have you run a full scan using your updated security software or use
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Safety Scanner</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Test the issue in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the issue does not occur in safe mode, I'd have you put your computer in a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a> state and check if the issue is related to a third party software conflict.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Test the issue in a new user account.<br />

            Thanks for your help! I am on administrator, I've already run virus scans, memory diagnostic, scandisk, uninstalled the programs I &nbsp;installed just before the problem started. &nbsp;I noticed I'm also having problems getting my network and sharing center to
 open.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It runs a little better when not connected to the internet, but only for about ten minutes after booting. &nbsp;It's also running quite a bit warmer than usual, cleaning the fan helped a little but I think I need to have someone open it up (it's a laptop, and
 I'm not comfortable peering into it's guts).&nbsp;</div>
