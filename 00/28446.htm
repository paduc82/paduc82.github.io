<h2>            Understanding how to limit user access on Mobil Devices.</h2>
                    
<p>1st Question, There are 2 different APPS on Apple Store and Google Play, OWA and Microsoft Outlook for I-os and Android. What is the difference between them? Which one should I use?</p>

<p>2nd Issue, We have 2 different type of mobile devices: devices owned by the Company and devices owned by the employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1st questions: If I turn off Active Sync for a user will the individual device apps still work if I unquarantine the device?</p>
<p>2nd question: If I turn off Active Sync for a user will the user still be able to access Office 365 Mail on the Web?</p>
<p>3rd question: This question mainly applies to devices owned by the employees, When we want to deactivate a user's device, the device will of course quit syncing with the servers and receive no more data. What happends to the data already on the device. Will
 it be deleted when the APP is uninstalled or will the device have to be wiped to remove all the e-mail data it has already acquired.</p>

<p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p><em>Q1: There are 2 different APPS on Apple Store and Google Play, OWA and Microsoft Outlook for I-os and Android. What is the difference between them? Which one should I use?</em><br />
A1: The feature of these two app is quite different. See feature in 
OWA for IOS and feature in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-mobile-setup-Help-7dabb6cb-0046-40b6-81fe-767e0b1f014f#BKMK_Android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook for android</a>.<br />

</em><br />
<em>1st questions: If I turn off Active Sync for a user will the individual device apps still work if I unquarantine the device?</em><br />
<em>2nd question: If I turn off Active Sync for a user will the user still be able to access Office 365 Mail on the Web?</em><br />
A2: We can setup the policy to allow some of the mobile to access the mailbox. <br />

<h2>            Taskbar problems, Start menu slow &#38; Search doesn&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>Hi! Since 3 days back my whole computer has been wierd and slow. Normally when I start my computer I get to the Desktop directly after writing in my password, now it's loading for like 30 seconds.
</p>
<p>The Windows Start Menu opens up 5 seconds (it's not instant) after clicking the icon and when I'm clicking on the search icon nothing happens.&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>When I go to Settings/Control Panel and search for "Search" and click on "Cortana &amp; Search setting" nothing happens, I just get back to the start page of the control panel.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c93847be-8d55-4df2-ba41-99d5876bfd22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c93847be-8d55-4df2-ba41-99d5876bfd22" /></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've been searching around and found that this was an issue 1-2 years back (2014-2015). Neither of these tutorials on how to fix this worked for me. I've tried following: &nbsp;<br />
- Removed and rebuild in the Indexing Options.<br />
- <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Troubleshoot Search and Indexing</span><br />
- Adding following command into "powershell":&nbsp;<em>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</em></p>
<p>- Changed keyboard language<br />
- Create a new admin user<br />
- Tried the thing about go to the Task Manager and look for Cortana or Search and End Task, but I couldn't find any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing works. Please does anyone know how to fix this, it's very annoying that my computer got slow and I can't search for things. Note: I can search if I'm open the File Explorer..<br />
<br />
The computer is also much slower to turn off.<br />
<br />
Here's some info about the computer (Not sure if all is nessesary...):<br />

<p>
</p><p>Device manager: (have read things about audio inputs and keyboard with display can cause this problem (?) I'm using Logitech G15 Keyboard)<br />

            Lawrence, I've searched around in hours and tested most of the things, trust me I didn't only read the first topics that appeared. I haven't tried to reinstall it yet since It's my work computer and reinstall it is the very last option.. I would love some
 professional support from Microsoft. I have used Windows 10 for like 4-5 months and have worked like a dream but now it all suddenly got slow and I can't search on it.<br />
<br />
I read on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/317gce/windows_10_search_bar_not_working/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/317gce/windows_10_search_bar_not_working/</a> loads of people that has this
 problem, some got it fixed and many doesn't.<br />

<p>My Start menu starts lagging (~3 seconds until it opens) and Search no longer works. This seems to happen randomly after the computer's been on for a while. Restarting Search, and Powershell re-registering of
 stuff have failed to fix it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ah you meant in the Search Results under Settings/Control Panel?<br />
The "Change how Windows searches" is the exact same as Indexing Options. </p>

<p>Hi Neal,<br />
<br />
I've received the screenshot. Before moving forward, please involve your global admin to confirm some more information:<br />
1. Whether you have enabled ADFS in your tenant? What's the ADFS version?<br />
<br />
2. Please expand the <strong>Error details</strong> under the error message "<em>The device authentication failed</em>", and capture a screenshot of it.<br />
<br />
To upload screenshots, you can click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then click the icon of Insert/Edit Media&nbsp; .<br />
You can mask the domain information in the screenshot for security concern.<br />
<br />
3. Please provide us with the account you used to activate Office, I've sent your private message to collect it, you can check the message here
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations .<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
James</p>

<p>Hi Neal,</p>
<p>To find the root cause, we need to know some information. After checking your account via PM, it is a federated account. I suggest you involve your Office 365 administrator (responsible person) in this thread to help collect the following information.<br />
1. &nbsp;What’s the version of ADFS server?<br />
2. &nbsp;Does the issue occur to other users using 15.21.1?<br />
3. &nbsp;Do you configure device registration in ADFS server?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Johnny Zhang<br />

<p>It looks like the issue is with the local user account not ADFS. Do you have any other suggestions on additional steps (See below).</p>
<p>I have met with my Office 365 Admin and we found an interesting item. I created a new user on my Mac and I can install Office 365 successfully. I &nbsp;did the following on the User account and cannot fix the issue:</p>
<p>Followed this procedure with reboot prior to reinstall.</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint 2013 Table - Clicking link &#38; change cell color with vba before going to linked slide</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone - I have a table in a PowerPoint 2013 presentation and each cell in the table has a word with a hyperlink to another slide in it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to do is when I click a link in one of the table cells is to change the background color of the cell and then go to the desired slide. I have the code to change the color and I know how to do the hyperlink but I cannot figure out how to
 select the cell that the hyperlink is in to change the color. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very familiar with Excel VBA but this works quite different so am having difficulty getting to where I need to be.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated and thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>The object model for tables in PPT is a mess; it'll fight you tooth and nail. &nbsp;And it'll win.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you were to create your table (sans hyperlinks) then copy it to the clipboard, paste special/as EMF, that'd give you a graphic you could ungroup a couple of times. &nbsp;Each of the original table cells will be a rectangle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can apply a Run Macro action setting to either the shape representing the cell or the text in it and have it run a macro like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub RunMe(oSh as Shape)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;With oSh</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(255, 0, 0)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;End With</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is, once you assign a Run Macro action setting, PPT no longer recognizes the hyperlink you might have originally assigned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the text in the shape is the number of the slide you want to link to, we can make that work. &nbsp;Otherwise, you'll have to get trickier, eg. by adding a .Tag to the shape and picking that up&nbsp;</p>

 &nbsp;Does anyone know how to get rid of it completely? &nbsp;Thanks.

            Yesterday my screen started flickering and my anti-virus program found a virus which took a lot of getting rid of.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>But the flickering continued.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Then I saw that a new program had been installed. I didn't intentionally install it.
<div><br />
<div>
<div>The program was Express Files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I closed it via the tray and then stopped the running process.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I used Revo to &nbsp;uninstall it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>After the self uninstall Revo pointed to around a dozen registry entries that still needed to be removed, which I did.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After that the flickering stopped!</div>

<p>hi osama,</p>
<p>firstly, i’d like to confirm if the private group you mentioned above means the
<strong>distribution group</strong> as the screenshot shows below:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=566246dd-f7df-4355-9797-c921545aa760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d566246dd-f7df-4355-9797-c921545aa760" /></a></p>
<p><br />
if yes, to prevent individual users(not including other admins) from creating and managing distribution groups in office 365, you can refer to the link you mentioned above. and those steps will not affect the created distribution group.</p>
<p>after performing the steps&nbsp;in the article, only admins can create and manage the distribution groups, end users cannot create and manage them anymore. here is an example. end user cannot see the&nbsp;<strong>distribution group</strong> in
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">owa</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=59e10f2d-8b82-4172-a380-b5e47e4ff27a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d59e10f2d-8b82-4172-a380-b5e47e4ff27a" /></a></p>
<p><br />
if the private group is not the distribution group as screenshot shows above, please share with us&nbsp;the specific screenshot of the private group. to upload screenshots, you can click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> in the forum and then click the icon of <strong>
insert media</strong>.</p>
<p>we appreciate your efforts.</p>

<p>hi osama,</p>
<p>ok, i totally understand that you want to prevent users from creating owa(<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a>) groups. firstly, i’d like to check if have created any customer owa policy in

<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=fee66f62-1ac2-432f-8dae-d5dd67d5ff00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dfee66f62-1ac2-432f-8dae-d5dd67d5ff00" /></a></p>
<p><br />
if you didn’t have created any customer owa policy, please try the following steps to achieve your needs:</p>
<p>1. connect to<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> exchange online using remote powershell</a>.<br />
2. run the following command.<br />
set-owamailboxpolicy -identity default -groupcreationenabled $false</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d4a27f2c-f19a-45b9-873f-ed37866204f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd4a27f2c-f19a-45b9-873f-ed37866204f8" /></a></p>

</p><p>Some of our documents created in Word 2016 are showing formatting errors when they are opened in Word 2010. Additional indentation and blank pages are coming up when we open the document in Word 2010. Does anyone have any idea about this and what can be

    <title>Outlook removes spaces when quoting emails with both English and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ecc83  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook removes spaces when quoting emails with both English and Russian text &#40;happens in versions 15.8.1, 15.3, 14.4.8&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a problem with Outlook for Mac. I first noticed a year ago, when I was using Outlook 2011 for Mac. I could reproduce it on Outlook 15.3 and Outlook 15.8 and 15.8.1 as well. It also happens on other Macs of a few people that were willing to check
 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is with emails originating from certain (unknown) versions of Outlook for Windows. Most probably it's the Outlook 2010, but I'm not 100% sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically when replying to those emails the Outlook for Mac removes the spaces inside the quoted message. So far I only saw this problem when replying to an email that is written in Russian, but which also has English fragments. The spaces are only removed
 near the words written in English, while spaces between Russian words are never seem to be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, this is how the received message looks when in Reading mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34324f63-eb17-4f9d-9cf9-3429b4ce3c64" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click "Reply" or "Reply To All" on this email this is how this same text looks in the quote inside my new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f721b184-edc1-4a61-b73d-4b51057df650" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>In my organization we rely a lot on the email threads to follow the discussion, and this issue makes it almost impossible to use Outlook for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked into the source HTML of the message and I didn't find any special symbols in the spaces in the original message, and in the new email (where the old one ie quoted) the spaces seem to have been completely removed, so it's not an issue of a spacing
 or anything like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can provide an .eml message that has this issue to a Microsoft employee, if this is indeed a bug.</p>

            <p>Okay, while trying to strip sensitive information from the email's headers I think I have found what the issue is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason one of the outlook versions puts the English words inside the Russian text into the Span tags, while stripping the spaces in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, my problem is that Outlook for Windows processes those correctly, without removing the spaces from quotes.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> dmkkg  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to retrieve&#47;show user input info on a report</h2>
                    In a query user has to key in two dates for Date of Sale field criteria (Between [Include Sales FROM:] And [Sales TO:]).<br />
<br />
I would like to show these dates on a report based on the query but not sure what to put in the Control Source of the text box which will show the dates.<br />
<br />
I can create a text box on the report and ask the user to key in the dates in there but want to avoid asking for the same information twice.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to point to the information keyed in the query?<br />

            You can ether reference the parameters in the text boxes' ControlSource properties, but I would normally include the parameters in the query's select clause as well as its WHERE clause, e.g.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PARAMETERS [Include Sales FROM:] DATETIME, [Sales TO:] DATETIME;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT *, [Include Sales FROM:] AS SalesFrom, [Sales TO:] AS SalesTo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM [YourTable]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE [Date of Sale] BETWEEN [Include Sales FROM:] AND [Sales TO:];<br />
<br />
You can then simply bind text box controls in the report to the SalesFrom and SalesTo columns, or you can reference them in a single computed text box control, with a ControlSource property such as.<br />
<br />
="Sales from " &amp; Format([SalesFrom],"dd mmmm yyyy") &amp; " to " &amp; Format([SalesTo],"dd mmmm yyyy")<br />
<br />
Rather than using system generated parameter prompts, however, you might like to consider the more developed approach of referencing controls on a dialogue form.&nbsp; The dialogue form can either be opened first, with the report being opened form a button on the
 form, or the report can be opened and set up to automatically open the dialogue form.&nbsp; You'll find an example of the former as MultiSelect.zip, and of the latter as ReportDialogue.zip, both in my public databases folder at:<br />

            Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I am a bit confused by a couple of things and would appreciate a little clarification.<br />
<br />
I have entered the PARAMETERS in the dialogue box that opens on clicking the Parameters button in the query design ribbon.&nbsp; I assume this is where they should be entered.<br />
<br />
When you say SELECT clause, is this the same as Criteria in the query?<br />
<br />
Where do I enter FROM and WHERE in the query?<br />
<br />
I have not yet looked at the alternatives you suggest but will do so and perhaps use one of them (if I understand them!!)<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            What I posted is the SQL statement of a query.&nbsp; You can see this with your query if you switch from design view to SQL view, though Access will have thrown in a lot of unnecessary garbage, which is harmless but distracting.<br />
<br />
The PARAMETERS clause declares the parameters, which is not absolutely necessary but generally a good idea, particularly with parameters of date/time data type as it avoids a date entered in short date format at the prompt being misinterpreted as an arithmetical
 expression.&nbsp; It also caters for regional variations in the date format.&nbsp; Parameters other than those of date/time data type should not be declared, however, if the parameter is being examined for NULL in the query.<br />
<br />
The SELECT clause lists the columns returned by the query.&nbsp; These are mostly columns (fields) from the table(s) used, but can also be expressions, as in this case where the parameters are entered.&nbsp; The column name returned is determined by the AS assignation.<br />
<br />
The FROM clause lists the table or tables which the query uses.<br />
<br />
The WHERE clause includes the criteria expressions which restrict the rows retuned by the query<br />
<br />
You can either amend your query in SQL view by adding the PARAMETERS clause and adding the parameters to the SELECT clause, or you can do so in design view by declaring the parameters through the dialogue as you've done, and adding two additional columns to
 the design grid with the following in their 'field' rows respectively:<br />
<br />
SalesFrom:[Include Sales FROM:]<br />
SalesTo:[Sales TO:]<br />
<br />

            Thank you very much Ken for devoting so much of your time to help me out.&nbsp; You clearly have a very good understanding of Access and your willingness to share that with others is very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Now that I know how to get to the SQL statement, I am sure I'll be able to sort this out.&nbsp; I've had a look at one of the other suggestions you made and I am going to try and use that method.<br />

    <title>Outlook Indent Issue on Replies and Forwards Only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielgit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Indent Issue on Replies and Forwards Only</h2>
                    <p>I have a very odd issue that just seems to have started out of the blue.&nbsp; The issue is that when I reply to any E-Mail I get or when I forward any E-Mail I get from within Outlook, my signature shows up fine, the original E-Mail chain shows up fine, but
 the very first line of my E-Mail is indented 1".&nbsp; I can go into paragraph settings and update it back to 0 and THAT E-Mail is fine.&nbsp; I can also backspace the indention out.&nbsp; That said, I can't figure out how to permanently set up Outlook to not indent upon
 forwarding an E-Mail or replying to an E-Mail.&nbsp; I'm not sure what happened as Outlook has worked fine for a long time and I made no change to start this action; however, again, it just started and won't stop happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?&nbsp; I've tried under paragraph to set as default, I've verified everything is right under Options, Mail, Replies and Forwards, etc.&nbsp; I found one other E-Mail chain from back in 2010 where this exact same thing was happening to someone with the exception
 that it was only happening to him in TEXT E-Mails where mine is happening in HTML E-Mails.&nbsp; If I switch from HTML to Text, it moves the cursor back, but that's still a manual step each time (much easier to just hit backspace twice).&nbsp; I can't imagine there's
 no way to set this up, but I'm finding nothing when searching online that explains how to correct this and I'm finding nothing when browsing through setting options within Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you could offer would be much appreciated.&nbsp; I'm about to just upgrade to a new version of Office as a means to try to correct this (running older 2010 software anyway).&nbsp; Hoping that's not necessary though...</p>

<p>This did not resolve the issue; however, it appears it's only for some of my E-Mails this is an issue.&nbsp; It's like there's odd formatting on those E-Mail chains and I must've just sent a number of E-Mails to those people to come to the conclusion this was
 happening mostly every time when I replied or forwarded.&nbsp; That said, it is still happening on replies and forwards for select E-Mail chains and I'm not sure what would be causing that as, again, renaming the NormalEmail.dotm to NormalEmail.old with Outlook
 closed and then reopening Outlook and trying again didn't work.</p>

            Modern IE and Desktop IE are not separate browsers<strong>;&nbsp; </strong>they are two<strong> modes
</strong>of the same browser, therefore disabling the SSL 3.0 encryption protocol applies to both.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; there are some servers that don't yet recognize TLS encryptions&nbsp;and may not allow you to connect if you disable SSL 3.0

    <title>Any way to format the Table of Contents reliably&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kiril b.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Any way to format the Table of Contents reliably&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to format my Table of Contents in a way so that it does not change indentation, bold/regular/italics, justification, font size, etc. Currently it seems like there is no way to do that. There are a couple of different predefined ToC styles in
 Word 2016 and that's just it. They are plain ugly and do not allow for any customization, so I decided to take care of the formatting myself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the creators of this piece of software haven't noticed we're in 2016 (despite the name of their product) so Word can't automatically populate the ToC as new headings are inserted to the document, or as page numbers change. When I do it manually
 so I can get an updated view of my ToC, my custom formatting is gone. I would like to know whether there is a way to stop Word from reformatting the ToC when a manual refresh of the whole table (not just the page numbers) is performed?</p>

<h2>            How do I report an bug in MS Project to Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I would like to learn where/how to ask Microsoft if they are aware of an anomaly in MS Project 2016 Professional Timeline view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem concerns using custom dates on multiple timelines and what happens/does not happen when the underlying data in the schedule changes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that when using custom date ranges on multiple timelines if a date in the schedule changes, the task name date changes, but the start/end dates on the timeline swim lane box itself does not change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a Scheduler is not aware of this "feature" there will be some disappointing conversations after the execs take a look at the timeline and want to know which set of conflicting dates is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft or anybody else aware of this? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does one reach out to Microsoft and ask?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hi JCWilliamson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't work for Microsoft but I may be able to share your scenario with internal MS folks. &nbsp;But first, can you give clear reproducible steps? &nbsp;I just created a simple two project with two tasks and added two timelines. &nbsp;I set the dates for the second timeline
 to match the initial schedule of the second task. &nbsp;When I increased the duration of the first task, pushing the second task out to beyond the custom timeline - the task dropped off the timeline all together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could share more detailed information, I see if I can reproduce the error as well as share with some other Project MVPs and internal MS folks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tested using Project 2016 Professional version 16.0.6965.2105</p>

<h3> jcwilliamson  say:</h3>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Here is an attempt to make this clear: &nbsp;I have <strong>two timeline bars</strong>, one showing an Initiation Phase the other the Planning Phase. &nbsp;The start/finish dates "outside" the two timeline boxes are the same as the dates "inside" the timeline bar.
 At this point in time, these of course are the beginning and ending dates&nbsp;<strong>of the project.
</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I set a <em>custom date range</em> for the Planning Phase bar (or timeline).</p>
<p><em><strong>Initially</strong></em> the start date "outside the box" matches the start date "inside the box"</p>
<p><em><strong>Initially</strong></em> the finish date "outside the box" matches the finish date "inside" the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here comes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When one of the tasks in the Planning phase (the timeline with the custom dates) extends it's duration&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>the Planning phase dates showing "<em><strong>inside the bar</strong></em>" change correctly, HOWEVER</li><li>the previously set custom dates that appear "<strong>outside</strong>" the timeline bar remain the same&nbsp;</li><li>we now have conflicting dates for the Planning phase timeline (or bar) showing on the screen</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned the "fix" I am using, but again, if a Scheduler does not know about this, there could be a lot of explaining to do if this is not caught before an executive briefing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps, thanks for your review.</p>

    <title>Hovering over an appointment shows the wrong date format - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> powernout  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hovering over an appointment shows the wrong date format</h2>
                    <p>Since I installed Office 365 I noticed that hovering over an appointment in Outlook Calendar shows the US date, i.e. 11/7/15, meaning 7th November 2015.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I set up my computer to show the more logical date display of 7/11/15.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I change this manually in Outlook somewhere? Or is this a bug which should be reported?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot is with the date 26th January 2016, but I'm sure we all get that :-)

<p>You're wrong. Hovering over an appointment does produce a US date format when the Windows 10 is set to another format, it is happening to my installation. &nbsp;Would you have anything useful to add?</p>

<p>Hi Harsha.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Your response is incorrect.&nbsp; I get US formatted dates date as well (precisely as described in the original issue), but all my system settings (dates / language etc) are set to Australian.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like most of the world we use DD-MMM-YYYY and that format is set to the default in the system settings.&nbsp; It is displayed correctly in the OS itself plus other applications.&nbsp; Even within Outlook itself, but in hover view it defaults to the US format (Exactly
 as explained by the original poster).&nbsp; Bloody annoying.&nbsp; Can you please look into this further.</p>

<h2>            phone randomly switches off or reboots..</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have an Omnia 7 with Mango. I recently updated with a small update....I think this was a samsung update. On Sunday my phone had 60% charge but decided to switch off and wouldn't switch on, thankfully I had my charger but the battery was completely flat! Once
 I could switch the phone on I realised it had deleted any recent contacts and some messages!<br />
<br />
Again this morning my phone had 40% charge but this time it rebooted, my texts and contacts are fine but it had now deleted 70% of my music and videos!<br />
<br />
The only thing which i think could have triggered this issue is the samsung update however on sunday before the incident I had just download the following apps,<br />
<br />
Groupon<br />
super mario ringtones<br />
talking tiger <br />
<br />
I doubt any of the apps have caused the issue but it did occur after i had installed these apps.<br />
<br />
any one else had this problem or know of any solutions to prevent it?<br />

            <p>Hi Fyka,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your forum contribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things you could try to solve the issue are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Set your phone back to the pre-update version and check if the issue still occurs.</p>
<p>2. If not, repeat the update again and check if issue still occurs.</p>
<p>3. If not, re-install each app individually to see if one of those causes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If none of that works, it looks like phone issue and you could try a hard reset to see if that solves the issue. Before doing so however, please make sure your contacts, pictures and music are all backed up to either Windows Live or your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a hard reset does not solve the issue either, you would have to contact your mobile operator and send in your device for repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marc A.</p>

            What if you want to receive a 'silent' notification?
<div><br />
<div>In other words I want the notification window to show that I received an e-mail, I want the phone to vibrate, but I don't want a notification sound to be played.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The app seems to only allow you to edit overall sound settings (which affects all notifications, not just Outlook app), message notifications, and vibrate. &nbsp;It does not let you edit sound settings for only the app.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know this can be done, because my corporate e-mail does it and the Gmail app does it.</div>

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and I understand that you also have the same issue about turning off the notification alert of the&nbsp;Outlook.com app. Since you mentioned that the settings from the app are also applied to the general settings of your phone,
 I advise that you provide a feedback about the app for further improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you think that the app needs some tweaking to make it more efficient, then we highly advise that you make a comment in our

            Not sure if you were able to figure it out yet or not, I just had the same problem and googled it, and saw your question. You have to select the email notifications/how do you want your device to notify you when a new email arrives. Why you have to select
 it again after selecting notifications I have no clue. I just stumbled upon it when I noticed my screen was dirty. Hope it helps.&nbsp;

This is unfortunately, incorrect. When you go to General&gt;Notifications&gt;Email notifications&gt; there are two choices:
<div>Message notification and vibrate. I have unticked both and am still getting the default phone email notice that there is a new mail. It does not disengage the sound. It is a true nuisance especially since I loathe the Samsung S3 whistle notification sound
 file.</div>

            The Audio Notification option is not a check box. You have to tap on Audio Notifications to actually bring up the notification sound list. It is from this list that you can select Silent.<br />

            THANK YOU!!! &nbsp; &nbsp;I too did not know that you could click the "audio", since it appears the other 2 choices are all there is. &nbsp; How simple! &nbsp; :) &nbsp;
