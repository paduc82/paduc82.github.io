    <title>365 Subscription Renewal Loop&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave metcalfe  say:</h3>
<h2>            365 Subscription Renewal Loop&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I am stuck in a loop, it says my subscription has expired and tells me to renew, I click on the renew and it offers me 365 again, so I chose to pay, then it tells me I have an account already but needs to be renewed!
<br />
<br />
This is just going round in circles!<br />
<br />
Furthermore Microsoft Office will now not accept the the 365 token 78.00 prepayment I bought in PC World UK either.
<br />
<br />
In the mean time I can not use any of the soft ware. <br />
<br />
I am prepared to pay by card as already bought or on line if possible but neither seem to work at present.
<br />
<br />
Has any one got an answer to this?<br />

            <p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you are not able to work with the Offce 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would need more information to help you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Did you Office 365 annual subscription or you have opted for monthly subscription?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.What is the exact error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove and re-install the Office and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer this article to remove the Office suite:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</font></a></p>
<p><span>Once Office is removed, go this link
</span><a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.office.com/myaccount
</span></a><span><font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to reinstall Office on the same PC.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 365 will be assigned to a particular account, if you login using other live account to My Account page then you won’t be able to view the information for Office 365 purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Log-off from all the accounts, login to the My Accounts page by using the email address used to purchase Office 365 and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results to help you further.</p>

<h2>            Spell Check and Style Sheets - not updating properly in &#41;365 Word</h2>
                    <p>Hello - have read many of the posts, and yet still having an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>REVIEW ( just looking, no changes made)</p>
<p>I open a document and in Review/Language/Set Proofing Language my default language is English, and I have the "Do not check spelling or grammar" unchecked.a</p>
<p>I hit CTRL-A and check language again ("set proofing language") where "Do not check spelling or grammar" now has solid block in it, meaning some parts are checked, some are not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I find a line that has a misspelled word ("neogtiated"), check style called "List Style", press ctrl-alt-S to pull up style sheet options, go ot modify, format, language - select English is selected already, and "Do not check spelling or grammar" in UNCHECKED..
</p>
<p>Spell check is not working, it does not catch the mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ATTEMPT TO CORRECT:</p>
<p>In style sheet List Style, I select English and press OK (it is already set as default language)</p>
<p>CTRL- A - Review/Language/Set Proofing language - uncheck "Do not check spelling or grammar"&nbsp; - takes 2 clicks - pres OK</p>
<p>Run Spell Check - misspelled word "neogiated" in the LIST STYLE is not corrected and is listed as spelled correctly</p>
<p>Highlight the line word is on, go to Language/Set Proofing Language - <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong>and "do not check spelling and grammar" is checked!!!!! WHY????</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I now uncheck (again) "Do not check spelling or grammar" in the style sheet format language option, the misspelled word is underlined and found by spell checker ...woo hoo! Why must I do CTRL-A, uncheck "do not spell or grammar check" then go back to
 the style and modify the language back to English again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can re-create the document from scratch, or copy/paste without format - but how can I set a macro in normal.dot or global macro that always checks spelling in each document I open, and in every style sheet within the document? I saw someone posted a macro,
 but never gave instructions on where to install it or how, and the Mastering Spell Checker document has not been updated in a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>The issue with the document was that by "direct formatting" a number of paragraphs in the document, including that paragraph containing the word "neogtiated", had the setting for "Do not check spelling or grammar" checked.&nbsp; If, with those paragraphs selected,
 the "direct formatting" is removed by pressing CTRL+Space, the "Do not check spelling or grammar" attribute is removed and the word&nbsp;<span> "neogtiated" is then marked as a spelling error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The procedure detailed under the ATTEMPT TO CORRECT heading in the originally post, of using CTRL+a and then accessing the Language dialog and clicking as necessary to clear the "Do not check spelling or grammar" box,&nbsp; has no effect on, and will not
 remove the "direct formatting".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Find and Replace facility is probably the best way of dealing with the issue across the whole document.&nbsp; In that dialog, click on More and with the selection in the Find what control click on Format&gt;Language to bring up the Language dialog and
 click on the "Do not check spelling or grammar" box as required until it is checked.&nbsp; Then put the selection in the Replace with control and click on Format&gt;Language again and clear the "Do not check spelling or grammar" box so that the Find and Replace dialog
 appears as:</p>

<br />
Hello. The "AT+CPIN" is a modem command, which asks for a PIN to&nbsp;access the 3G network. It sounds like some configuration has changed for the provider that Datawind has contracted (Vodaphone?). I am afraid that they are the only ones that can help you. From
 their <a href="http://www.datawind.com/ubisurfer/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">website</a>, they still appeared to be in business. &nbsp;If they will not answer your emails or calls, you probably have some recourse with your local better business bureau or the like
 to get some of your money back, if you have the time and inclination to do so.

            <p>Hello mrstripe:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding your copy and paste question.&nbsp; From some testing I have done it looks like copying and pasting from these applications is something that cannot be done.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best work around I could come up with is to access your account through the mobile version of the site.&nbsp; I was able to go into the uploaded picture and then copy the full URL for that displayed picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other thing I could suggest regarding doing this from the phone would be to review the marketplace to see if there are any applications that might help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If none of the above options work for you, you may need to post pictures from these sites via a PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

    <title>Calendar entries not appearing in mobile app - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Calendar entries not appearing in mobile app</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am using Outlook on my laptop and phone and my email is on outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Samsung S5&nbsp; and my laptop is a Windows Surface 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my software is at the current release levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All functions worked perfectly until around the time I did a recent upgrade of Microsoft Office on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem symptoms are:</p>
<p>1. I can create calendar entries on my mobile phone and they are created in calendar and appear when viewed through my laptop but after being created I can no longer see them on my phone.</p>
<p>2. I can create calendar entries on my laptop and they are created in calendar and appear when viewed through my laptop but&nbsp; I cannot see them on my phone.</p>
<p>3. Although the entries do not appear on my mobile phone, if there is a notification attached to the entry then I do receive the notification on my phone when the event is due.</p>
<p>4. If I look at what calendars are to appear in my mobile phone, two read only ones are listed plus "Paul's calendar" which is my default calendar and the one with all the relevant entries.</p>
<p>5. Paul's Calendar is not ticked for viewing so I select it and the problem is sometimes momentarily resolved. However, shortly thereafter Paul's Calendar is unselected by the App and the problem is back. Note that even when Paul's Calendar is selected the
 App is inconsistent with regards to which, if any, appointments it displays.</p>
<p>6. For clarity, this is not an issue with regards to entering events into calendar, all that appears to work fine via both the phone and the laptop. Also there is no issue viewing the events from the laptop. The issue is only with regards to viewing events
 in the Mobile App. Additionally, there are no issues with email - they all work from both platforms and everything is successfully synchronised - including sent files, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Note: I have already tried deleting all data and the App from the Mobile phone and reinstalling the App. The problem persists.</p>

            <p>Have exactly the same problem - calendar entries do not show up on my&nbsp; mobile device (Lumina 550 in this case) but are visible on the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;All runs on Windows 10 Outlook. &nbsp;I can enter an appointment on the mobile and it shows on the PC but not on the mobile.
 When entering the appointment on the mobile I am not able to&nbsp;check the bullet that&nbsp;selects&nbsp;my synchronized calendar. This seems to be the reason&nbsp;why the appointments are not visible.&nbsp;All this happened after I updated the phone three days ago.
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Answer to your questions above:</p>
<p>1. I access my account not directly but entered it during the original phone setup. Its a *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account that is my main Microsoft account. This is the account I use for email, calendar, contacts and tasks and it works well, apart from&nbsp;the Calendar
 on the phone.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;The apps I am using are the ones that came with the phone and are Outlook Mail&nbsp; &amp; Calendar.</p>
<p>3. Did not make any changes, the problem occurred during the last update, which I uploaded a few days ago It is now Version 1511, OS build: 10.0.10586.164, Firmware 01078.00017.15461.48010. Again it's a Lumina 550, brand new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your suggestion above I tried to remove my account but can't find any way of doing so. There is seemingly no option available do remove the main account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>Amrita,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your specific questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you access your account on your phone? Microsoft Outlook App Version 2.0.57 (121)</li><li>Is it through native app or Outlook.com app? Outlook.com</li><li>Did you make any changes prior to the issue? Only upgrading Microsoft Office on my laptop. No changes on my phone other than deinstalling and re-installing the App to try and fix the problem. I have just done that again as per your instructions and it has
 NOT helped.</li></ol>
<p>For clarity I want to emphasise that the entries are in calendar they are just not displayed on the phone. I can sometimes fix the problem by going into calendars on my phone&nbsp;and selecting "Paul's Calendar" (my default calendar) but the system unchecks the
 "Paul's Calendar" box randomly itself so I have to go back in and recheck the box again to try and see my calendar entries which then&nbsp;may appear or may appear in part. At the moment they are appearing up until March 23 but an hour ago they were appearing for
 April as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Whoops, the tick box just unchecked itself again and there is nothing there! This is a very frustrating problem.</p>

            <p>Yes, if I go through my browser all calendar entries are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand what you mean by suggesting reconfiguring the account. I have already told you I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it twice. You configure the App when you reinstall it so what do you mean when you say reconfigure it? Even the instructions
 you are pointing me to are for install8ng the App which I have already done twice.</p>

    <title>Two sets of favourites in maps. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paterant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two sets of favourites in maps.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 930. In the maps app I can see two sets of Favourites which are almost the same, but not quite. After I click on the star with four parallel lines at the bottom of the app I see one set&nbsp;under "Favourites" and then under "Collections" there
 is a second set inside an icon exactly the same as the one I clicked at the start which is also identified as "Favourites". Does anyone know how I can combine these two sets of Favourites into one and then get rid of the duplicates?</p>

    <title>The Office Document Cache for Word, Excel Save Options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> labbinz  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Office Document Cache for Word, Excel Save Options</h2>
                    
<p>Hello - I've already posted a similar question, but still need to know more about the "SharePoint" Server drafts location default in Word, Excel, etc.. We've recently upgraded our users to Office 2013 and thus we have the "Office 365" Business Premium subscription
 although we don't intend to use the "cloud" side of things, our users of our small business will only be using the local Office suite 2013 products for now. We don't yet have DirSync going, but I know enough that due to the install tied to the "online" part
 of Office 365, our default settings in Word, Excel are the following-</p>
<p>Somehow after the install, the following get set to areas on our server:</p>
<p>Default local file location: \\server\user$\lorib\My Documents\</p>
<p>* The Office Document Cache - Server drafts location: \\server\user$\My Documents\SharePoint Drafts\</p>
<p>So, I do know I can change the "Default local file location" to our shared drive (i.e. G:\)</p>
<p>But, what I'm struggling with now and want more answers is the other setting for the Office Document Cache - Server drafts location which is : \\server\user$\My Documents\SharePoint Drafts\ ; wondering since we don't intend to have our users use the online
 Word &amp; Excel, what are the implications if I leave this path or does it make sense that I change it to something else? Whether I change to the user's local drive or somewhere on our network?</p>
<p>Can anyone give me more info/answers or is there some documentation out there on what these settings exactly are, can I change them. I don't want the group policy documentation on how to edit these. I simply want more info explaining these locations so I
 can make better decision on whether I should change them or what's best for our situation where we are not going to have our users utilizing the "cloud/online" versions for Word, Excel at this time?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Lori</p>

<h2>            Nokia 6230i - Sevice Message Inbox &#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I have a Nokia 6230i. I receive WAP push messages as part of a service I subscribe to. When the phone receives a WAP push message I get "1 service message received" and when I open it I get sent to the "service message inbox" which lists the WAP push
 messages I have received. However when I'm done downloading the WAP link that’s been sent in the message, I can not get back to the service message inbox ? It’s not part of the usual inbox or the Messages menu. Is there a way of opening the service message
 inbox via the user interface ? Thanks. Jon. London, UK.

            could have sworn the service inbox is the same place as the regular inbox. used to be this way on my old 6230.<br />
<br />
are you able to save the link as a bookmark at all?

            Its not in the same place. In fact, as far as I can see, its not accessable at all.<br />
<br />
The WAP pages are not the issue. I can download/save/bookmark/etc the WAP links fine. But I want to return to the Service Inbox to see the original messages.<br />
<br />
For example, I am meant to receive a certain amount of messages per event. At the end of the week, I want to be able to look at the inbox and confirm I received X messages that week as part of my subscriptions. I cannot. So I never know if I'm being fleeced
 without keeping a manual log, or waiting until the next event.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            From the manual:<br />
<br />
To access the Service inbox in the standby mode, when you have received a service message, select Show. If you select Exit, the message is moved to the Service inbox.<br />
<br />
<b>To access the Service inbox later, select Menu &gt; Web &gt; Service inbox. <b><br />
<br />
To access the Service inbox while browsing, select Options &gt; Other options &gt; Service inbox. Scroll to the message you want, and to activate the browser and download the marked content, select Retrieve.<br />
<br />
To display detailed information on the service notification, or to delete the message, select Options &gt; Details or Delete.</b></b>

                    ive a nokia 5210. When my phone is off and i get calls i never know because when i switch it on it doesnt tell me ive missed calls. I know on my other phone which is and updated model it does list, so why doesnt the 5210.<br />

Ive tried looking at call divert but when i try to activate divert when unanswered it wont let me<br />

            You've had a phone that lists missed calls from when the phone was switched off?<br />
<br />
What phone, what network?<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure there's no way of making your phone show you missed calls unless the calls were missed when the handset was on.<br />
<br />
About the diverting calls - where are you trying to divert to? If you're on Pay &amp; Go some networks only allow you to divert to voicemail...<br />
<br />
We need more info lol

            sorry for being so confusing.<br />
<br />
I used to have a nokia 7210. If people called whilst switched of when i switched on it would automatically display on the opening menu 4 calls missed. Then you would look at who they were from. This was with O2.<br />
<br />
I thought the reason my current handset doesnt do this may have something o do with the call divert set up. So i tried to activate divert when out of reach but i click activate and it tells me request not completed.<br />
<br />
I only want to find out how many calls ive missed when people dont leave a message. Is this possible?

            That's not a phone feature (when it is off, any phone, it has no way of detecting and registering any missed calls).<br />
<br />
It is as if you unplugged the power cord of a VCR; it has no way of recording any programs when it has no power. Same with a phone that's been powerd off.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was an O2 service (<a href="http://i.e." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">i.e.</a>, the operator's network remembers and saves missed calls and then notifies the phone when the network sees it is turned back on)?

            I think it is an o2 feature - some of my friends have it set so when I call them, I get a message saying something like:<br />
<br />
"The person you are calling is unavailable, we will send them a text letting them know you called"<br />
<br />
You need to speak to o2 about that if you want it back - but I think it charges the callers every time, so they might not like you for it lol

<p>Is there a 64 bit version of 2016 available and if so how do I install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

<h2>            Improper asking for a parental permission</h2>
                    Everytime a try to log in my desktop skype, it asks me for a parental permission. When I then log into account.microsoft.com (as proposed), it shows that my date of birth is 1.1.2018. I then change it, but after saving the data, the birth date is still
 1.1.2018, so on my next start of desktop skype application, it asks me again for a parental permission and everything repeats again and again. How can I escape from this enchanted circle?

    <title>Automate MS Access report to print to Adobe PDF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baysideguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automate MS Access report to print to Adobe PDF</h2>
                    
<p>I'm sure it's been asked before but I want to automate the output of an MSA 2003 report to Adobe PDF without user interaction.&nbsp; I'm currently forcing the user to take&nbsp;charge of the Save As dialogue box but they want it fully automated.&nbsp;The code I'm using
 at the moment is very simple and short:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dim strDefaultPrinter as string<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strDefaultPrinter = Application.Printer.DeviceName<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Application.Printer = Application.Printers("Adobe PDF")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport "rptPDFReport"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Application.Printer = Application.Printers(strDefaultPrinter)</p>
<p>However this is not enough for them, they want it fully automated without user interaction.</p>
<p>Can anyone help either with their example or pointing me in the direction of a previous blog?</p>

            You need to obtain the ROM and flash tool from your carrier or LG directly. Then it is just a matter of docking the device and running the tool.
<div><br />
<div>Why do you need this though? if you just want to restore the phone to the way it was out of the box, do a hard reset. You can do this in Start|Settings|System. There is an icon in there somewhere to clear the memory.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>AVERAGE IF BETWEEN TWO DATES - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rayinman  say:</h3>
<h2>            AVERAGE IF BETWEEN TWO DATES</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue averaging numbers in one column for a specific month based on dates in another column:</p>
<p>
</p><p>example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>O4:O80 = Numbers to average</p>
<p>J4:J80&nbsp; =&nbsp; Dates within year 2018</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need to average numbers for&nbsp; the month of April</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I am trying:&nbsp; =AVERAGEIFS(O4:O80,DATEVALUE,"&lt;=",4/30/2018,"&lt;=",4/1/2018,(J4:J80))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in the right direction would be greatly appreciated, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!!</p>

<p>Very close! The correct syntax is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=AVERAGEIFS(O4:O80, J4:J80, "&lt;=4/30/2018", J4:J80, "&gt;=4/1/2018")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people prefer the following to avoid regional differences in the form of the date:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=AVERAGEIFS(O4:O80, J4:J80, "&lt;="&amp;DATE(2018,4,30), J4:J80, "&gt;="&amp;DATE(2018,4,1))</p>
<p>
</p><p>More generally, if you intend to calculate the average for each month, put some the date of the 1st of each month into A1 (e.g) -- for example, 1/1/2018 -- which you might format to show just month and year. Then write the following formula into B1 (e.g):</p>
<p>
</p><p>=AVERAGEIFS($O$4:$O$80, $J$4:$J$80, "&lt;="&amp;EOMONTH(A1,0), $J$4:$J$80, "&gt;="&amp;A1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the formula into B2:B12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT] If there might be no data in column O for a particular month, it would be prudent to wrap IFERROR around each of the above formulas. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IFERROR(AVERAGEIFS(O4:O80, J4:J80, "&lt;=4/30/2018", J4:J80, "&gt;=4/1/2018"), 0)</p>

    <title>Unable to authorise domain in O365 - PowerBI Free Conflict - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaron tasker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to authorise domain in O365 - PowerBI Free Conflict</h2>
                    <p>I would like to share an issue that we came across this week, as it may affect others who are attempting to complete the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Symptom</strong></p>
<p>When trying to verify a domain against an Office 365 tenant, the verification fails in both the modern and classic console, even though the TXT record is present and correct. In the modern console, a new TXT record (ms=xxxxxx) is generated each time you
 attempt to verify the domain. In the classic console, the verification fails with an error and asks you to restart the process, then generating a new TXT record (ms=xxxxxx).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>When someone in your organisation signs up for Microsoft PowerBI Free, they are asked to authorise their account via an e-mail activation. When this is completed, an O365 tenant is created with that user account, so sharing can occur across members of the
 same domain. While not authorised, this tenant now has members with a UPN of <em>
@yourdomain.com</em>. As the domain is partially authorised against this new tenant (of which you are probably un-aware), and there are users with active UPN's using it to access services, it prevents you from authorising the domain against your desired tenant.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Sign-up for a free Microsoft PowerBI account using the desired domain name</li><li>Using the tile interface, click on the 'Admin' panel and follow the instructions to authorise your account as an administrator for the tenant. This will involve adding a DNS TXT record to your external DNS registrar.</li><li>Notify all staff of the impending logon change, and update all existing accounts to use the
<strong>@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com </strong>domain suffix for sign-on. (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Update-email-addresses-after-you-add-a-domain-933564e9-20ee-4634-b58d-86851aa582ec?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IE&amp;ad=IE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Article</a>)</li><li>Ensure you are using the <strong>Classic Portal</strong> and go to domain management, delete the
<strong>@yourdomain.com </strong>domain from the tenant.</li><li>Log-off the Microsoft PowerBI tenant</li><li>Log-on to your desired tenant, and complete the process of adding <strong>@yourdomain.com.
</strong>This should now complete without errors.</li></ol>

<h2>            How to cancel Skype auto-recharge on my credit card from another person&#39;s account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had created a new Skype account for my wife over a year ago and set up auto-recharge against my own credit card. We're now going through divorce and I recently noticed the auto-recharge is still active. However, she's not willing to share her Skype password
 to let me remove my credit card. Is there any way support team can remove my credit card auto-recharge from her account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>It would not be possible for us to remove the payment instrument from the reported Skype account as this would need the account owner's verification to view the details of the subscription. If there would be any chances that you can get your partner to provide
 you access to the account, our live chat support would be able to remove the payment instrument connected to your subscription.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, it would be highly recommended that you report this to your financial institution for them to block any recurring charges made on your payment instrument. Just to give a head's up that there is a possibility the Skype account using the
 payment instrument be restricted on using their paid features once you reported it to your bank.

I order to collaborate, they have all 4 accounts in their Outlook clients (running PC WIN7).</p>
<p>The problem is that reminders from calendars and tasks are broadcast to each employee.<br />
I'm looking for a solution, where we keep the email accounts linked and transparent, but isolate calendar and task reminders to only the user calendar/task?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Dirk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It’s not feasible to do that. I suggest you submit feedback to our related team via
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows</a>. Many features have been upgraded or designed by customer’s valuable advice.&nbsp;
</p>

</span>As I know, we can <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-or-remove-reminders-6d3c3e29-59d3-4b6d-a15d-933f166add64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
set or remove reminders</a> in the Outlook client. But it’s a little complicated if you have too many calendar items.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>There is a workaround. If you don’t want to view other Office 365 accounts calendar, I suggest you set up them via IMAP or POP3. After that, the OWA calendar items will not be synced to the Outlook client and the emails will not be effected. You can
 access the OWA to view or create calendar items for these accounts. </del></p>

<p>We don’t suggest customer use the 3<sup>rd</sup> party calendars. </p>
<p>Regarding “Can't access filing structure of the IMAP account”, I wonder if you manually subscribe the subfolders. If not, please give it a shot and check the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click your account or Inbox folder &gt; IMAP Folders… &gt; Query &gt; subscribe the folder that you want it to show up in Outlook.
