<h2>            Equation symbols appear as different, incorrect symbols &#40;PPT 2010&#41;</h2>
                    I am a student who uses PowerPoint to go over lecture slides. Any PPT files that I have (either that I created or have downloaded from a professor) appeared to be normal a couple of days ago, and when I went to open a PPT file, any equations that were
 made in Equation Editor are completely off now.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As an example, here is what one slide did look like: &nbsp; &nbsp; http://imgur.com/xxQi1S7</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>as opposed to what it looks like now: &nbsp; &nbsp; http://imgur.com/wXlZmgK</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have done the following troubleshooting: using the "Repair" option that Microsoft Office has through the Control Panel -&gt; Programs option, downloading any PPT files that I thought could be "corrupted", and completely uninstalling and re-installing Microsoft
 Office with the Office DVD I have. None of this has worked. Does anyone have an idea of what is going on?</div>

            I have figured out the issue! Somehow, some of the fonts had been uninstalled from my computer, or at least were not being recognized. To fix this, I followed this link here:&nbsp;http://www.withsteps.com/404/how-i-restored-my-windows-7-default-fonts.html
<div><br />
<div>Essentially you just download all of the default fonts again, extract them all from the folder, and install the fonts. If it asks whether or not you would like to replace the fonts that already exist, I would just allow it to replace them all. I am no
 longer having any issues.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Adding phone to Family Safety - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a_jed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding phone to Family Safety</h2>
                    <p>My child has a Surface and at one time I was sent usage reports. After buying a windows phone v8 I stopped getting those reports. I can look it up but it's no longer emailed.&nbsp;I still get them for my other child.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After 'binging' 'how to add his phone to family safety' I follow the instructions and here is the result:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><em>We couldn't add </em></strong><strong><em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em></strong><strong><em> to your family, because this account is already part of another family. Before you can add this account to your family, a
 parent from the other family will have to go to </em></strong><a href="https://familysafety.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Microsoft Family Safety</em></strong></a><strong><em> and remove the account.</em></strong>
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Really? Why can't I have everything under one system or is there another avenue where I can click a few checkboxes and get things emailed again with his phone, laptop&nbsp;AND surface usage??</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

    <title>Why does Windows 10 still default to an admin account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danwdoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 10 still default to an admin account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It is baffling in light of the security advantages of running as a non-admin account that Windows does not automatically create the default account as a non-admin. Here is yet another article highlighting how effective a security measure this would be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/limited-user-accounts-windows-10?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+laptopmag+%28LAPTOP+Mag+Main+Feed%29</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I have to manually create a second account, make it an admin, and demote my current account to a standard user.&nbsp;A fairly complex task that is well beyond the average user. The admin account also shows on the login screen by default, adding an
 unnecessary point of confusion for the average home user. This should be handled during setup automatically. I understand if not done well, this process could add some confusion to the installation process and later logins, but if handled well it would be
 a huge win for the security of the average home user. A few extra well documented steps during setup could make all the difference in the world. It's high time for this change to happen.</p>

            <p>The main reason Microsoft updates the previous admin account from an older windows system to<br />
similar admin user is people would get locked out of making changes to their system if they<br />
are a standard user. Windows uses User Account Control Settings to limit administrative changes.</p>

I believe you missed my main point, which is that&nbsp;this is way to complex for the average non-tech user so most home users are still running as an admin and therefore far more vulnerable then they ought to be.

            If I am not mistaken, even a fresh new install still makes your account an admin by default, leaving it up to you to add an admin account and demote your current one. This whole process should be automatic and simple. Setup could create an admin level
 account, let the user set the password, then hide this account from everything but&nbsp;control panel&nbsp;users and all&nbsp;UAC prompts.

The admin account should not appear on the normal login screen by default, but should be mostly hidden as it is only needed for UAC prompts and very special operations that non-tech users never do anyway.

            <p>I have used Windows back to 3.1 but I skipped some versions like 98, ME, Vista but I fall for this every time and end up with my preferred user name being the Admin account. A bit of documentation and instruction at the beginning would be good. Just say

<p>
</p><p>Agreed. Something along these lines would not add significant confusion to the&nbsp;setup process or even daily usage (assuming the admin account is mostly hidden from daily use)&nbsp;but would&nbsp;make a huge leap in general security when all users of windows are running
 non-admin accounts. Yes, the&nbsp;mechanics needs to be carefully thought out, but I have no doubt that it would more than pay off in preventing compromised machines, which definitely results in severe end user misery.</p>

<h2>            what do i do if i accidentely open up spam.</h2>
                    I blocked the emails, but noticed in the deleted menu where they went that they said they had been opened. I tried manually clicking them as unread again so it didn't send a message back to the sender (which I read it does on another forum) But I clicked
 just to the left of the click to read/unread button and it opened up. Do i get a virus. Obviously outlook blocked the contents but there was a link that I didn't click. I just pressed back and deleted the email.

 opening these documents on the settings of my firewall or just via the internet settings. I'm almost pretty sure that everything was normal. I didn't really know what to check or check off when looking at it mainly because I've never had this issue before.
 This wasn't a problem for me before, so I'm not too sure why now all of the sudden it has occurred. My father who works in the networking department (for the gov.) says that it behaves this way because of our internet connection (which isn't bad..).</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I have tried the online and quick repair for Office 365. I even re-installed it. I've yet to have this problem solved, so all I can do now is ask the more knowledgeable and experienced people. (not saying my dad isn't smart... he is,
 but he just doesn't want to pay attention to me right now)</p>
<p>I did also try accessing and opening the same document from the same source on my desktop computer (Windows 7 OS, but I have 365 on there as well) and I was able to successfully open &amp; view it there. What do I do next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please and Thank You for your assistance! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional info (don't know if you need it):</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Installed memory: 8.0 GB (7.88 GB usable)</p>
<p>
</p><p>64-bit OS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks!</p>

<p>You can create folders and copy/move shortcuts in "%appdata%/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu" and "%programdata%/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu", but it seems that the changes are not reflected in the start menu until you log out &amp; back in, restart or switch
 to 'start screen' and then back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can only use one folder level - if you create a folder and then a sub, the sub folder won't show (but any shortcuts in it show in the parent, as I recall).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new folders (but not subs) will also show in the start screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not found a way to stop 'modern' apps from hijacking the 'all programs' list, apart from uninstalling, and even then some won't uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all rather hopelessly broken.&nbsp; Either MS should stop any customising, or simply allow it as with Windows up to 7.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend performing a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean</a> <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
boot</a> to check if any third party software is causing an issue, as clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you need any other assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Did you also see the error message&nbsp;<span>"We couldn't&nbsp;update the system reserved partition"? If so, you might need to clear some more space on your System/EFI partition or rebuild it. There is an article here that describes ways to do this.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/2c7bf4e9-cb08-4fe4-96db-e5d493663644/anniversary-update-failed-0xc1900201?forum=win10itprosetup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/2c7bf4e9-cb08-4fe4-96db-e5d493663644/anniversary-update-failed-0xc1900201?forum=win10itprosetup</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would find it simpler to delete the partition and replace it and then rebuild by using bootsect and bcdboot commands. You could boot from Windows 10 install media to do this from a Command Prompt. SHIFT-F10 gets a Command Prompt from the first setup
 screen after it finishes loading.</span></p>

            <p>I had already performed a clean boot (but I did it again to no avail).</p>
<p>No, I've never received the message&nbsp;<span><em>"We couldn't&nbsp;update the system reserved partition".</em></span></p>
<p><span>Other updates install fine, e.g. Defender definitions, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>Each time I hit RETRY after the error 0xc1900201, Windows 10 Insider Preview 16170 starts to initialize, a popup appears with the message,

<p><span>I'm not trying to install anything on a USB drive, so why that message?&nbsp; I'm only trying to install 16170 on a properly running PC build 15063.138.</span></p>

            <p>Your first recovery partition and EFI both are unusually large, but that shouldn't matter much. The final recovery partition is possibly a PBR (Push Button Reset) to restore Factory settings/reinstall Windows. It might have an older OS, such as Windows 8.1
 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen Windows get confused and think a disk partition is removable media, such as a USB stick and that I was trying to install Windows To Go, so what you are seeing is not unheard of. It sounds like there may have been confusion on which partition
 you were trying to install to. Often drive letters change, if you boot from install media, so choosing to install to "C:" might not really be what you are wanting to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way to upgrade, or to do an in-place "refresh" of your existing install via your USB is to run setup.exe from within your running Windows 10, rather than booting with the USB stick. It is also possible that the USB stick has been setup incorrectly and
 is more like an actual Windows install (running on the stick instead of hard disk) than proper Windows install media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do want to wipe your computer completely and clean-install Windows, then you can boot from USB, delete all partitions and install. You would get a 450MB Recovery partition, a 100MB System/EFI partition and a 16MB MSR followed by the rest of the hard
 disk as drive C:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also delete that last partition and replace it with a full install of the Insider Preview (since it is 60GB there is lots of room) and stick with running the public build 15063 on your main partition.</p>

<h2>            Excel to filter stock chart pattern, candlesticks</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I browse the web to look for stock charting pattern tool, which&nbsp;is used under EXCEL environment.</p>
<p>I found this ...</p>
<p><a href="http://ta-lib.org/function.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ta-lib.org/function.html</a></p>
<p>But its candlesticks is not always working. Secondly, it cannot show the chart pattern like FLAG, TRIANGLE, rounding bottom ...</p>
<p>Do you know where can I find those tools (to be used in Excel environment) please? There are a lot but they are not meant to be used in Excel.</p>
<p>Paid add-ins are OK. I don't need Free but I just want to find where can I buy.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Elton</p>

    <title>Power Pivot Underlying Results - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> va-mickj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Pivot Underlying Results</h2>
                    <p>Attached is a file of employee data in Power Pivot Excel 2013.&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=B655BA6B509B1EE2!1299&amp;authkey=!AE8wUCfpaTv5C3A&amp;ithint=file%2cxlsx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="One Drive">File on One Drive</a>.&nbsp;It uses the slicers to count the number
 of people who meet all the criteria. There are some limitations*, but it accurately counts based on the "slice selections" &amp; the result is shown in the pivot table.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Since the related tables are many to many relationships, the calculated field of the pivot table is a DAX function using CALCULATE(). The value is correct, but when you double click a cell, way too many primary employee table rows are returned.&nbsp;Namely it does
 NOT apply the slicers from the related tables at all.&nbsp; It only uses those within the Employee table (those in Red.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially I am looking to return a column of data that is either just the 'Emp Nbr', which is the single key throughout this file.&nbsp; Or if possible the complete information from the Employee table?&nbsp; I've done the first part with a similar pivot on the Staff
 tab.&nbsp; Is there an easy way to get the whole employee table for the filtered employees.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, is there a way to double click a cell in the pivot table to actually return the data from the primary employee table? Such that, we can quickly repeat the calculated field calculation and change it to actually return the Employee table, filtered
 with the slicers?&nbsp; Or can this be done in VBA?&nbsp; Can someone share the VBA code that "Figures it out" &amp; does it in "automanually"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas &amp; help are much appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.<span>

            <p>Thanks, Ashish.&nbsp; Yes, that is correct. I&nbsp;want&nbsp;a 4&nbsp;row table (1 header &amp; 3 rows of data) that looks&nbsp;exactly like the &nbsp;9 row data table that does come up.&nbsp;But obviously filtered with the slicers that are connected to the Pivot table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I was hoping that the Power Pivot underlying data, already stored within the file would be enough.&nbsp; The users who click on cell G12, may not actually have direct access to the original data.&nbsp; Plus the original data may be an Access database or a
 different type of data source altogether.&nbsp; Is the data model available as a object to manipulate?&nbsp; If you just want to see the data, you should be able to see all the underlying data in the Power Pivot window, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, if there is a better way to structure my Pivot Table formula in the first place, to get Excel to do all the work, then all the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that help clear up the question &amp; solution parameters?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you make multiple selections in any one slicer and then double click on any cell within a Pivot Table, then you will get an error.&nbsp; So my contention is that even if we can get 4 rows (with the first row as the header row) to show up when we double click
 on number 3 in the Pivot Table, the same double click action will produce an error message when you make multiple selections in a slicer.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>To clarify, I understand that double-clicking the pivot table once just a few slicer items are chosen, does result in an error.&nbsp; So I guess you've answered the first of my original questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to double click a cell in the pivot table to actually return the data from the primary employee table?
<strong>Answer is&nbsp;'NO' ---&nbsp;double clicking a "sliced" power pivot will create an error</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But can this be done in VBA?&nbsp; Can someone share the VBA code that "Figures it out" &amp; does it in "automanually"?&nbsp;Can the same DAX formula
</p>
</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">If I could somehow execute this DAX&nbsp;directly in VBA&nbsp;"=CALCULATE(Employee,Cert,Degree,Role)" this would be the exact table result I am looking for.&nbsp; Is that possible?</p>

 to document the Power Pivot "slicers" in the&nbsp;process. &nbsp;It includes a couple new tabs that are complicated but should help visualize what's going on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>'EmpResult' includes a separate pivot table with all the same slicers as on 'StaffCount', but it returns just a list of employee names.
</span></li><li><span>'Extract' then includes links to 'EmpResult' tab, for the names.&nbsp; From this it uses CUBE functions (for use with PowerPivot tables) to get the data for the result file.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hard part -- a 'member expression' -- which
 I don't entirely understand but will have to work on the full capabilities of that.&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>'Filters' then shows the items selected on 'StaffCount'. Or if the slicer is cleared, displays All instead.</span></li></ul>
<p>From here,&nbsp;in VBA I just intercept the double click &amp;&nbsp;ensure that the table is&nbsp;fully populated with the right formulas &amp; create a new file with the results and the settings of the slicers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Lost files when syncing new computer</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got a new computer and synced my OneDrive business account. &nbsp;I went to access a folder I needed (which has some of my most valuable work in it) and all of the files are missing. &nbsp;The entire folder structure is still there but every file within
 the folder structure is missing. &nbsp;Is there any way I can get my files back? &nbsp;It's 30 gb worth of information that I critically need.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing information with us in the private message.</p>
<p>To narrow down this issue, Iâ€™d like to confirm following information:<br />
1.Did the OneDrive for Business only sync folders without files to local computer?<br />
2.Did the old computer encounter the same issue?<br />
3.Can you find the files in OneDrive for Business websites?</p>

    <title>IE10 and IE11 send HTTPS request instead of HTTP when browser URL is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed dewd  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE10 and IE11 send HTTPS request instead of HTTP when browser URL is clearly HTTP, and fails to display page. Occurs after web site no longer supports HTTPS.</h2>
                    <p>Is there some sort of newer security mechanism in IE that prevents a site from using HTTP if it was once before browsed to using HTTPS?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario is I have a&nbsp;production website working at <a href="http://name.domain.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://name.domain.com</a> and built a development web site using HTTPS with redirect from HTTP.&nbsp; I put the name in my local host file to point name.domain.com to the development site.&nbsp; I determined my development site works fine with HTTP redirect to HTTPS
 when browsing to <a href="http://name.domain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://name.domain.com</a>.&nbsp; I then removed the local host entry for name.domain.com.&nbsp; Now the production site (which is HTTP only) will not open.&nbsp; A packet capture shows&nbsp;my client is sending an HTTPS request
 when the browser is clearly set to use HTTP.&nbsp; I've tried to "Reset" IE settings to default.&nbsp; I can't find any information about where this "HTTPS lockdown" for a list of URLs can be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate the time!</p>

            <p>Thank you Scott, but none of that worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However&nbsp;I did find a fix,&nbsp;but I'm&nbsp;not sure I wanted this to be my fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tools &gt; Internet Option &gt; Delete Browsing History&nbsp;&gt; and uncheck "Preserve Favorite website data".&nbsp; At this point there is no way to save this option except to click "Delete", so it seems like a strange place to put this on/off switch type radio button.&nbsp;
 Deleting temp files, cookies, or history did not help, but turning off the "Preserve Favorite website data" prevented&nbsp;IE from forcing HTTPS on sites like I mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to me that the "Preserve Favorite website data" option remembers sites that redirected to HTTPS if the user typed in HTTP.&nbsp; I surmise&nbsp;it's an attempt to speed up your experience by recognizing such sites visited before and doing the change to
 HTTPS in the URL for you in the browser so the server doesn't need to redirect you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might be good for users, bad for the developer.&nbsp; I'm leaving this option off.&nbsp; Feel sorry for the site out there that stop using HTTPS.&nbsp; Their site just won't work for so many people anymore.</p>

<h2>            I no longer receive emails sent to myself &#91;send&#47;recevie to same email acct&#93; using Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found several similar posts but they are locked.&nbsp; The moderator "Kent_P" has apparently helped many others with this, but the solution is not public.&nbsp; It is "I made a changes to your account. see if this works."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, I don't receive emails sent from a gmail account to the same gmail account when using Outlook 2010.&nbsp; The other recipients receive the email without issue and the email shows up in the "sent" folder, but is not delivered to my inbox.&nbsp; I have no
 "rules" enabled and the problem just started approximately 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; I haven't changed anything in this set-up for approx. 3 years.&nbsp; I thought the common problem was when I cc or bcc myself, however I disproved with more testing.</p>
<p>

<p>You may also verify if you receive â€˜Testâ€™ email which is sent when you perform â€˜Test account settingsâ€™ for the account within Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post back with the details of the issue so that we can assist you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for getting back to me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Outlook:&nbsp; When I send myself an email using using Outlook [gmail to gmail], I am able to immediately login to my gmail web account and find that email in the sent folder.&nbsp; The problem is that it doesn't get received by gmail as a new&nbsp;email and thus
 appear in the inbox.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not using Outlook: I can login in to web gmail and repeatedly send emails that immediately get delivered to the inbox as well as show up in the sent folder, upon refreshing the screen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gmail set up in Outlook as a&nbsp;POP account with the settings&nbsp;taken directly from the gmail setup guide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to use the test email function in Outlook account settings page and it is delivered every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;initially thought the problem was isolated to when I cc or bcc myself, but I was able to disprove that, by non-receipt of an email where I was in the "to" line.&nbsp; I would&nbsp;estimate it is a 75% failure rate.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more example:&nbsp; I send an email to myself&nbsp; from Outlook [gmail to gmail], I see the email I just sent on my iPhone in my gmail sent file, but no copy ever made it to the inbox.&nbsp; I click on the email appearing in the sent folder [on the phone] and select
 "resend", and it immediately sends and is received properly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is that I have checked numerous times, and the recipients of these email are always receiving the email.&nbsp; The problem seems to be isolated to when I send&nbsp;from/to the same account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

 have been clear in my first post, but this problem is roughly 2 weeks old.&nbsp; Myself and 2 others have been using a system&nbsp;for 5 years in which we use consecutive file numbers for our business.&nbsp; Standard procedure is to send an email to the three people stating
 what the next file number is.&nbsp; We have been doing the same thing for&nbsp;5 years and I have just recently&nbsp;encountered the problem.&nbsp; I have checked every setting available&nbsp;in Gmail and&nbsp;Outlook&nbsp;AND reviewed every thread I could find that outlines the same problem.&nbsp;I
 use Gcal&nbsp;in lieu of Outlook calendar, so I have not experienced the same issue as Doris.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The odd thing is that the email shows up in the sent folder and not the inbox.&nbsp; I know I'm restating the issue, but wanted to make sure I was being clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As always...any help is VERY much appreciated.&nbsp; My current work around is to drag/drop the email from the sent folder to the inbox in Outlook....EVERY time I send an email.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive Office 365 sync excel files I open not work</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a problem with co-editing Excel files. We use Office 2016, downloaded from Office 365, we use Office 365 Business Premium. By following this instruction - https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-Office-2016-to-sync-Office-files-that-I-open-8a409b0c-ebe1-4bfa-a08e-998389a9d823?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US
 we can co-edit Word and PowerPoint files without problems. But with Excel files this is not working well. Every time someone opens one of Excel files, another user can't co-edit that same file, it says that file is locked by &lt;someone&gt;. And if another user
 is trying to edit that file, it is saved as copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we need to do, so we can get to co-edit Excel files? Thanks!</p>

<p><br />
Best Buy ommitted to tell you that you can only set up an "Out Of Office" message in outlook if you are connected to Exchange Server.</p>
<p>Otherwise you have two options:</p>
<p>1. Set up a rule to reply to incoming emails using a template. the downside of this is that your computer must be on 24/7 with Outlook running while you are ansent, and then Outlook will quite probably go into aloop replying to spam, and your email mailbox
 at your Mail provider will fill up VERY rapidly.</p>
<p>2 - the preferred way - log on to your Mail Provider's Webmail page and see if they provide an "On Vacation" message function. Many do so these days..</p>

                    <p>I was able to connect to my printer fine before this update. The printer properties show following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Brother MFC-9320CW Printer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brother Color Leg Type1 Class Driver</strong><br />
Port: WSD-&lt;GUID numbers&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer status looks ok. But the pages do not print. I could not print test page from printer properties either.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Multiple other windows machines (with same windows update) are connected to this printer and were printing fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above update is creating problems. I also rebooted the printer, just to be sure. Even that is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even got firmware update tool from brother's web site and checked if there are any issues. It said the printer is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My MAC can print fine!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything should I be trying on my windows machines?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible reason why you could not print using your printer could be due to an outdated driver. We suggest that you download and install the latest driver from the manufacturer and see if it helps. After ensuring that the correct driver is installed, check
 if the device is recognized in the Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do update us on how it goes.</p>

                    <p>I am running IP 32 bit Home on a a Pentium D 2.8 dual core Dell OptiPlex SFF with 4Gb ram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc /scannow before going to Storage to delete my Windows.old file etc. The result found corrupted files and fixed them, There seemed to be an awful lot of Primitive installers committed for repair. Has anybody else found this?</p>

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />For the Skype application that is installed on your device, it will match the Time and Date settings you have on your device, including the current Timezone on your system.
<br />
<br />If you were to change your Android Time settings, it would not change the Timestamps of previous messages, but only the new messages. I hope this helps.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It's most likely not possible to enlarge the size of the key board as it would simply not fit the screen. Use the horizontal keyboard instead by twisting the phone horizontally whilst texting. This key board is broader than the vertical key board.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 900 wont hard reset</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to hard reset my Nokia Lumia 900 because after not using it for like&nbsp; years I have forgotten what the pin to unlock it was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try to factory reset it by holding down the volume+power+camera keys it doesn't hard reset but instead shows a picture indicating that I need to plug it into my pc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I plug it into my pc nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please how can I hard reset this phone and be able to use it again?</p>

<p>Hello! Stephanie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about you having these issues, i found a detailed youtube video of how you hard reset your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WiZ4MoiKdNk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WiZ4MoiKdNk</a></p>
<p>If this doesnâ€™t work please let me know and i will look into other methods you could try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

<p>Nope tried that too.... i actually found that same video too in my attempt of figuring it out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do this is simply restarts the phone taking me back to the home screen where I need a code to get in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried all the methods from this website www.hardreset99.com/nokia-hard-reset/nokia-lumia-900-hard-reset-how-to-factory-reset/</p>
<p>
</p><p>..... and they all just take me back to the locked home screen except for the 3rd method, and then I get whats pictured.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ae976a5-25d6-4885-9f98-3094e8eec87d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ae976a5-25d6-4885-9f98-3094e8eec87d?upload=true" height="194" width="130" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then if I plug it in like it wants it does nothing at all and about 5 minutes later resets and goes back to locked home screen again.

<p>Oh okay, sorry to hear your still having problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You donâ€™t just simply attach the phone to a computer, you need the software on the computer. But its the software we now need to figure out what you need to factory reset your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you donâ€™t need to factory reset, maybe an update could fix this issue.</p>

<p>It may still ask you for the pin but its worth a try.</p>

                    <p>I'm sending this twice in the hopes of getting one helpful answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem, let me make it clear, is that when I'm in other countries it doesn't work</p>
<p>You get into the private browsing but no 'sign in' sign appears and when I try</p>
<p>putting into the address area above hotmail or my address nothing happens.</p>
<p>I DON'T get the opportunity to get into my other address, it is sooo aggravating,</p>
<p>believe me!Microsoft has kept me this year out of my own account for 5 weeks in South Africa, came back</p>
<p>to mails I should have answered weeks before and 150 of them! Now in Austria, you name it.</p>
<p>Please WHAT CAN I DO when I'm not at my own computer. Also they don't have Internet Explorer</p>
<p>everywhere, another problem you/Microsoft may not have thought of.&nbsp; PLEASE HELP. thanks, Downy</p>

            <p>When travelling I am locked out from my hotmail account. I was given the instructions</p>
<p>to press Ctrl+Shift+P and then I could open a 'Private Browsing' page and sign in</p>
<p>to my alternate account. When I did this from my own computer in the Private Browsing</p>
<p>up came "sign in" but when I do this abroad IT DOESN'T APPEAR. There is no clear</p>
<p>place to sign in. It only shows it on my own computer. </p>
<p>This is driving me crazy as I come home to many many unread mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help or Windows people make suggestions so I can sign in abroad.</p>
<p>ALSO only being able to do this using Internet Explorer is annoying as many</p>
<p>computers don't have it, only Mozilla or Safari.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(77, 77, 77, 1)">We have recently implemented a security update called Familiar location protection to keep our customersâ€™ accounts secure. The message "You haven't signed in from this location recently." will occur if you are signing in from
 a location more than 300 miles from your normal location. The Microsoft account service will prompt you for an additional challenge to complete the log in. Codes can be the date of birth, or receiving a code sent to your SMS number or alternate email if configured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this you will need to&nbsp;configure&nbsp;your computer as a trusted device&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given the new security measures, Account Settings requires an extra security, through the use of a security code. &nbsp;Also known as 2 step&nbsp;authentication</p>

<p>I'm beginning to think you are right. I have a 'trusted computer, well two actually</p>
<p>but don't travel with them and yes, no smart phone.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I would just like Microsofts own solution, get into private browsing, open my other</p>
<p>account, find the code, go back and put it in the original area and go into my</p>
<p>account would work, other then on paper i.e. when they write what to do or</p>
<p>when I'm actually in my own computer, works fine ther (ha). Thanks</p>
