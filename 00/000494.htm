<h2>            Operation failed for Nokia 8800 Sapphire Arte</h2>
                    Could anyone tell me how to fix the problem for Nokia 8800 Sapphire Arte as whenever I turn on the phone, it states Operation Failed! I tried to reset to the original stage, then it was ok, but when I started syncronize with PC Suite or Microsoft Outlook,
 it came back with the same message. I also tried to reinstall the firmware, but it didn't work neither. Could anyone please help? Many thanks

            Your best bet at this point is to take the phone to your nearest Nokia Care Point. The 8800sa is a Series 40 phone on which there isn't much you can do. In fact there's nothing you can do other than revert to factory default settings. If you want to reset
 the phone then it has to be done by an NCP.

<h2>            Build 10532 - Stuck at &#39;Getting Search Ready&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just installed the new 10532 build in an effort to try Cortana now that she's been released to Canadian clients (through the insider program).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there's no option for search as Win 10 search functions are stuck (for hours and hours) on 'Getting Search Ready'.&nbsp; I've tried rebuilding my index file, (which worked fine) but still no joy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>

            Ctrl,Alt, Delete at the same time takes you to Task Manager, when it opens click on Services in the upper list, when it opens click on Description and it gives you an alphabetical list starting with "A" click again the list starts with "X" look down about
 half way on the screen and you will find Windows Update, Read the Status,&nbsp; right click and it brings up a menu, click on Start or Restart.&nbsp; Go to the top and get out.&nbsp; If you started in Update it should take you back there.

            <p>Thanks for your reply,&nbsp; I'm sure it will be helpful to some reading this thread in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as my problem is concerned - I've managed to get Cortana working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though I had my language and date settings correctly set to Canada, I found instructions indicating I still had to download the Canadian language and speech pack.&nbsp; I did (by right clicking the time and date in the lower right hand corner, selecting Region
 and Language, and downloading the Language and speech pack) - and she's now up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the indexing is concerned, I realize it is indeed still indexing files after 6 1/2 hours.&nbsp; I assume it has something to do with my email, that has emails dating back 3 years.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response!</p>

<h2>            Notification icons in task bar keep disappearing</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 with Office 2016. &nbsp;The same issue was happening when I was running Office 2013.</p>
<p>This is a work laptop, no one else seems to be having the same issue. &nbsp;We originally thought it might be a weird Group Policy issue, but I think we have ruled that out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I have set my "customise notification icons" area (next to the clock) to always show the outlook and new email envelope icon. &nbsp;It is set both within Outlook and also the Windows customise notification icons settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet, every time I reset my computer, or sign out, or put it into sleep mode - the settings revert to "off" within the "Customise notification icons" area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried a fresh install of both Windows (originally it was an upgrade form Win8 to 10, then a fresh install of Win10) and also Office (both 2013 and 2016 versions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also reset/cleared my icon cache multiple times, yet it continues to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas? &nbsp;It drives me nuts and neither our IT team or myself or Google seem to have the answer</p>

ziadmostafa.</a>&nbsp;How did you transfer the contacts from your old phone? Did you use Transfer my Data app on your Lumia? There is also a possibility that these contacts are linked to another account and you can only edit it within the account. Try going to the
 call history and check the contact information of that caller who appeared his/her name but it's not listed in your contacts. What is written under his/her name? Looking forward for your reply to further assist you.

            Yes I transferred the Contacts by using transfer my data app from an old lumia phone but there something weird after i had transferred the contacts and i didn't find them i made some new contacts profile with another names to the same phone number but
 when they call me the names which i had transferred appears to me not the new one and when I go to history and try to open their profile this message appears to me

ziadmostafa.</a> May I asked, what is the model of the other phone? Is it also a Lumia phone. If it's a Lumia phone and you used the same Microsoft account on your new phone, the contacts should sync. But if you're not using the same Microsoft account, you
 can add that it on the People app to get the contacts.

            Sorry for the delay I want to be honest with you when I bought my new Lumia 950 XL I wanted to take the phone number quickly from my father's Lumia phone I thought that I could edit on them as I want but the problem was that the Outlook accounts were different
 which caused that cursed problem now I tried almost everything I added my dad's account to my phone to make contact pages on people app after it finished the problem appeared again the old numbers still appear to me and I couldn't also edit on them ,then I
 deleted dad's account from my phone and also the old phone numbers still appears and what is making me angry that the other chat apps could find these contact data and numbers and adding them to me I really get tired and I don't now the solution

<p>Hi Lisa Danier,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I totally understand your request about the category and actually, it's not feasible to create a rule&nbsp;that automatically adds color category to calendar events based on the organizer in Outlook for Mac.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Super virus is blocking administrator right Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi, community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this virus is a strong one, it is blocking task manager and register editing, asking to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to login, preventing from install certain programs, every dew days a installed program or .exe file is corrupted, unable to uninstall any program
 at all and no anti-virus is detecting anything new.</p>
<p>the erorr messages always are related to administrator (the administrator disabled this feature, you don't have enough privileges, try run this with administrator righs, access denied,, etc...) and don't prompt me for giving administrator access, it simply
 denies.</p>
<p>this is the third time this happens ( two in windows 7 and one in XP ) and i tried to revert all settings and unistalling all programs to the point of prior to this issue, but not worked.</p>
<p>the only way i could fix that before was doing a clean reinstall.</p>

<h3> nicklewis_633  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2010 won&#39;t sign on to Windows Live</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to share some of my notebooks from OneNote 2010 to SkyDrive, as I've recently acquired a Windows Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choosing File&gt;Share&gt;Save As, I select my Notebook (I've upgraded it to 2010 format) and Select Share On Web. I choose Web Location&gt; Windows Live. A "Contacting Server" dialog box appears, and after a while disappears. Below Web Location in OneNote, it now
 says: "Windows Live: To continue, please read and sign the Windows Live terms of use", with a hyperlink to "Terms of Use". Following that hyperlink takes me to a Windows Live sign in screen, which, on signing in, takes me to my SkyDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can read the Terms linked at the bottom of the screen, but there's no way to sign them, and anyway surely I did this when I signed up to SkyDrive? There's a Try Again button below the text, but using that justtakes me round the same loop. OneNote does
 not appear to be connected to SkyDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same thing happens if I choose File&gt;Open&gt;Open from the Web. It's as though I'm part way through signing up for a new Windows Live account...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do to get OneNote signed in to my Windows Live account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Nick</p>

<h2>            Cannot send email to Alias account</h2>
                    <p>Orignal title: Outlook.com alias doesn't work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Microsoft account with a Hotmail email address.&nbsp; I created an outlook.com alias email address and chose the option to create a new folder for the alias address, but when I try to send an email to my alias as a test, I get a message back that the
 email is undeliverable.&nbsp; When I check "My Account Settings" it shows I have the email alias, but when I click on the Options icon, then "More Mail Settings", then "Your Email Accounts", it indicates I have no aliases.&nbsp; What is wrong?</p>

            <p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply, but the problem seems to have corrected itself.&nbsp; The day after I posted my question I received an email informing me that my new alias was ready.&nbsp; I have tested it and it works now, so it just took a little longer than I expected
 for it to be set up.&nbsp; Sorry to have taken up your time.</p>

<h2>            Office 2013 Doesn&#39;t Work At All</h2>
                    I updated to Office 2013 yesterday on my PC running Windows 7. &nbsp;I had Office 2010 before with no issues. &nbsp;Office 2013 doesn't work at all. &nbsp;Outlook crashes every time I try and open it. &nbsp;The other programs will open if I just open them, but if I try and
 open a document in them, they too crash. &nbsp;I have already done Windows update both before and after the install. &nbsp;I have uninstalled and reinstalled Office but it still crashes constantly. &nbsp;I am upset because I just bought this and haven't been able to use
 it at all and the only phone support option seems to be buying premium support? &nbsp;Why should I give Microsoft more money when the product I just bought isn't working?

            I'm expected to go through these add-ins one at a time for each program (seeing as ALL of my programs crash)? &nbsp;That's an extremely arduous and time consuming thing to expect a consumer who just bought your product to go through. &nbsp;I expect a polished product
 like Office to work out of the box. &nbsp;I didn't sign up to be a beta tester.

 for an entire day and night,&nbsp;first trying to run the repair function with the status not going past 2 of 4. Then I tried to just uninstall and that ran for about 6 hours? Now I'm trying to run the Repair function again and have run out of ideas and now have
 a crappy load on my computer and&nbsp; a very expensive shiny new frisbee, or coaster. Which is what brought me to this MS search for help&nbsp;thread. Please help!!</p>

<p>Hi Nayana,</p>
<p>I have a fresh install of windows 7 SP1</p>
<p>I have downloaded and installed office 2013 and I am having trouble. The only way I can run outlook is if it is run in safemode this is also the case for the other apps, even with all add ons turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not very happy with this, is there a live support you can put me on to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this issue previously when I formatted my system for&nbsp; previous job, clean install and office 2013 would not work. program not responding on all apps and outlook only running in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please check my profile and reply via email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <blockquote>I updated to Office 2013 yesterday on my PC running Windows 7. &nbsp;I had Office 2010 before with no issues. &nbsp;Office 2013 doesn't work at all. &nbsp;Outlook crashes every time I try and open it. &nbsp;The other programs will open if I just
 open them, but if I try and open a document in them, they too crash. &nbsp;I have already done Windows update both before and after the install. &nbsp;I have uninstalled and reinstalled Office but it still crashes constantly. &nbsp;I am upset because I just bought this and
 haven't been able to use it at all and the only phone support option seems to be buying premium support? &nbsp;Why should I give Microsoft more money when the product I just bought isn't working?
</blockquote>
<p>Its been my experience that Office 2013 and Windows 7 are not enough. What you need is the Compatibility Pack for the 2007 Office system. It has worked well for me and others. My PC has 285 MB of it, (12.0.6612.1000), if you can download it wait for the
 updates before trying out the Office. Its a free Microsoft download. Remember, some Bluetooth versions crash Word. I still had to scrub mine of Bluetooth. I have 32bit &amp; 7pro. Bye.

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span>Is the issue confined only to Internet Explorer toolbar or other toolbar in the computer as well?</div>
<div><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span>Have you made any software or hardware changes to your computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To work on the issue, refer these methods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the article <strong>how to optimize Internet Explorer</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/ro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/ro</span></a><span>
</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>Reset Internet Explorer disclaimer:</strong> </span><br />
Please note that running Reset Internet Explorer Settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed extensions, toolbars and other add-ons to IE Defaults. This includes all Security, Privacy and Zone settings. Also this will clear
 browsing history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>NOTE</strong>: The link applies to Internet Explorer 9 as well.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>As a work around you may try these steps.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>Step 1:</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Try changing the theme to the Windows 7 theme to see if that has any effect. You can do this by:</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>a) Close all windows of Internet Explorer</span></div>
<div><span>b) Right click the desktop </span></div>
<div><span>c) Click <strong>Personalize </strong></span></div>
<div><span>d) Click Windows 7, under the Aero Themes group</span></div>
<div><span>e) Wait for theme to be applied</span></div>
<div><span>f) Open Internet Explorer.</span></div>
<div><span>Check if the issue persists.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>NOTE:</strong> Performing step 2 will change the font size of toolbars for the entire computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Follow these steps to change the size of the font of the menu bar.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>a. Right-click on the desktop and click on “<strong>Personalize</strong>”.<br />
b. Near the bottom of the dialog box, click on the icon for “<strong>Windows Color</strong>”.<br />
c. In the resulting dialog box, click the link for “<strong>Advanced appearance settings</strong>”.<br />
d. In the next dialog box, titled “<strong>Windows Color </strong>and <strong>Appearance</strong>” find the menu for “<strong>Item</strong>”.<br />
e. Under "<strong>Item</strong>" just pull down to choose “<strong>Menu</strong>”.<br />
f. Across from “<strong>Menu</strong>” you can change the size of the menu area, but not the font or font size.<br />
g. Under “<strong>Font</strong>”, you can change the size of the font. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information is helpful.</div>

    <title>&#39;Temporarily Allow Pop-Ups&#39; Option - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#39;Temporarily Allow Pop-Ups&#39; Option</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While browsing a website and clicking a&nbsp;link, the info bar stated that a pop-up was blocked and I clicked it to temporarily allow pop-ups. I assumed that pop-ups would only be displayed while that website was open and that pop-ups would be blocked again
 when navigating to another website or&nbsp;when closing the&nbsp;browser, hence the term 'temporarily.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when the browser was closed and that website was reopened, the pop-ups were still displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the option 'temporarily display pop-ups' mean that pop-ups&nbsp;are only&nbsp;displayed on that website&nbsp;for that particular&nbsp;'session,'&nbsp;that pop-ups are 'still' displayed on that website even&nbsp;when navigating&nbsp;to another website and back to the original&nbsp;website,
 that&nbsp;pop-ups are only blocked again on the website when the browser is closed, or&nbsp;that pop-ups are&nbsp;only blocked again once the browser is closed 'and' the browsing history has been deleted?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The blocking level is set to medium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when the pop-up setting is set to blocked,&nbsp;will the&nbsp;info bar&nbsp;be displayed when a photo/link is clicked but the photo/link will not be displayed or will another page open when the photo/link is clicked?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
                </div>

<p>Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default", then Trusted Sites icon, 'Sites' button... remove the website in question from your trusted sites list.... popups are allowed by default in the Trusted sites list...</p>
<p>'Trusted' acutally means less security is applied to those sites... web sites work just as well if they are not placed in the Trusted Sites list... you probably don't need to place the shopping site in your trusted sites list, so long as they are using the

<p>Tools&gt;Popup blocker settings.... remove any sites you have placed in the white-list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have the google toolbar or the yahoo toolbar installed (or any other addon that has a popup blocker, turn it off or disable the toolbar (you don't need two!)</p>

    <title>Background and Lockscreen Issues on Windows 10 Phone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Background and Lockscreen Issues on Windows 10 Phone</h2>
                    <div>My problem:</div>
<br />
I have recently had an update on my Lumia 640 from windows 8.1 to Windows 10, now I can't change the background or lockscreen to a picture of my choice. I have tried changing by going to settings&gt; personalisation but when I select my picture it never changes,
 just keeps the blue tiles on start and a rainbow colored sample image on the lockscreen. I tried changing my background by viewing the picture and clicking the 3 dots at the bottom and selecting set as background (all it says is we Try a different photo we
 can't set this one as your background) I have tried this to change my start screen and when you first click the tick it looks like it might of worked, but then when you go to the lock screen it hasn't changed, the picture I want to use is a JPG image so I
 can't figure out why it wont work because before my phone updated it worked fine. Has anyone else had this issue or does anyone have any solution to this.

<p>Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions!<br />
<br />
Hi dutchman99,<br />
<br />
It is not possible to add languages on your Nokia device. The set of available languages is fixed and dependent on your original sales region. However, that's a good feedback. Thanks! :)</p>

    <title>Outlook 2007 embedded hot links no longer work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 embedded hot links no longer work</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
Outlook 2007 had no issue(s) until recently...&nbsp;then w/o any changes initiated by me, embedded hot links in received messages refused to work.&nbsp; popup prompts: "This operation has been canceled due to restricions in effect
 on this computer. Please contact your system administrator."&nbsp; I am the "system administrator."&nbsp; I can find no tab or setting to enable (or disable) embedded hot links.&nbsp; This is not a Norton issue....but very frustrating.&nbsp; I suspect some auto/update from Microsoft....???&nbsp;
<u>How can I ensure that embedded hotlinks are active and will connect from Outlook 2007 to IE 9 (I am using Win 7 Professional)...</u>

    <title>Installing ISO files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jsommers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing ISO files</h2>
                    I have purchased an open license with an open product key for Office Professional Plus 2010 and downloaded the files. They are ISO files. All of the computers that the program will be installed on have a CD/DVD drive so I do not need the virtual disk.
 Now that I have the ISO files downloaded, how do I install the programs? The directions I've received are not clear. I have downloaded IsoBuster to extract the files, but I get a "Could not open or create file: Windows doesn't allow to open or create this
 file. It is possible that the selected file is write protected, in use by another program, contains unsupported characters in the name, or the folder doesn't exist. Windows error: 3. File:AutoRun.inf, BCMHooks.dll BCMSetupHelp.chm, dotnetfx35.exe, etc. There
 is no where to install a product key. How do I install the program?

<h2>            Moving from VBA to C&#35; for developing add-ins to Microsoft Office</h2>
                    <p>I have heard that it is possible to write apps for Word in C# as a replacement for VBA.&nbsp; I have just spent over an hour going through a bewildering maze of what seems to be conflicting information on the Web.&nbsp; I see Visual Studio 2010 and 2013, I see Visual
 Studio Tools for Office, I see Office Interop, I see MSDN, I see .NET 4.5.&nbsp; But I cannot find a simple roadmap of what to do if I want to move on from VBA. One of the key benefits for me would be to use the more mature Visual Studio as the IDE in place of
 the built-in VBA editor which is ... flaky ... to say the least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be eternally grateful if someone can tell me if it is possible, what I need, what would I gain/lose and how much it would cost.&nbsp; I am a retired software developer currently working on a non-profit project with no possibility of any remuneration whatsoever,
 so I cannot even think of spending thousands of dollars.&nbsp; Free downloads would be ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 2010 currently but may upgrade to 2013 if needed.</p>

            <p>Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "official" Microsoft way to write Office add-ins in C# is to use Visual Studio and Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) together. The sticky part is that Visual Studio Express, which is a free download, doesn't work with VSTO, and the versions of Visual
 Studio that do work with it are quite expensive. So forget that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bearing in mind that I haven't used either of these, there are two free-download development tools that I've seen recommended:
<a href="http://netoffice.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NetOffice</a> and <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharpDevelop</a>. NetOffice is a replacement for the VSTO code libraries, and according to
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8415595/how-to-develop-a-microsoft-office-addin-without-visual-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this thread</a> it will work with either SharpDevelop or Visual Studio Express. I hope you don't find SharpDevelop as flaky as the VBA editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be some features in .Net 4.5 that you'd eventually want to use, but for most purposes .Net 3.5 or later should be sufficient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office Primary Interop Assemblies (PIA) come with Office, but might not have been installed depending on what installation options you chose. If they're there, you'll see an entry in the Windows Control Panel &gt; Programs &amp; Features list. If necessary,
 you can install them later; see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kh3965hw(v=vs.110).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to: Install Office Primary Interop Assemblies</a>. Per another MS page, "<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">By default, PIA’s are embedded in your solution when you build it so you don’t have to distribute PIAs to users as a prerequisite to using your add-in or
 customization."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get into the coding, you'll find that a lot of what you want to do is fairly similar to coding in VBA. The objects and their methods and properties mostly have the same names. The biggest difference is that C# doesn't let you just omit optional
 parameters; if you want to accept the default value of an optional parameter, you need to pass
<em>ref missing</em> in that position. Here's an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163853.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
interesting article</a> on the topic.</p>

    <title>Using my 123 Reg Domain in O365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pipermitchell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using my 123 Reg Domain in O365</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've purchased my domain through 123 Reg. I've purchased Office 365 and the first most important task is for me to be able to create an email address.</p>
<p>I cant get past the "add a TXT Record" step in O365 to add my hlasxxx.co.uk domain. I'm adding it to 123 Reg in "manage DNS Settings" as your guide suggests, but O365 is saying it cant find the added record (24 hours now). Can some one help with this (over
 and above the 123 Reg guide provided in O365 which doesn't seem to entirely match the 123 Reg site) or just give me a "short cut" to getting a working email address please?</p>
<p>Thanks, Simon</p>

<p>hi thanks for the enclosed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have indeed carried out the steps you suggested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i add a txt record for verification in 123 reg (as best i can)&nbsp; - see 123reg dns below:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d704eafe-70d0-4644-9698-307253aa6b4f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd704eafe-70d0-4644-9698-307253aa6b4f" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after 2 hours + i still get the following error screen:</p>

<p>i think this is relevant - our website was built on wix.com and the hlasxxx.co.uk is using wix name servers (<a href="http://www.hlastudio.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.hlasxxx.co.uk</a> is "pointed" at the wix website)</p>

<p>all i want is the quickest route to a live website (<a href="http://www.hlastudio.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.hlasxxx.co.uk</a>) and email addresses @hlasxxx.co.uk.... can you suggest the best way to do it (with o365)?</p>

<p>Hi Piper,</p>
<p>Based on my research, since it is using wix nameservers, you can add the TXT record via wix,com website like you did in 123-reg.

<p>Meanwhile, I find that the TXT record in the screenshot is missing <strong>TTL</strong> value (3600). Please add that when editing TXT record in wix.com site.</p>

<p>Hi &nbsp;- Thanks so far!</p>
<p>So I was able to add the TXT to the wix.com DNS settings.</p>
<p>I was then able to verify the domain in the O365 set-up, and log back in as 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I'm able to send emails as 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** but I cant receive them (I've tried more than one account). This the error received by the sending email address:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reporting-MTA: dns;BAY004-OMC1S27.hotmail.com Received-From-MTA: dns;BAY402-EAS92 Arrival-Date: Wed, 10 Feb 2016 00:45:49 -0800</p>

<p>rfc822;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Action: failed</p>
<p>Status: 5.5.0 Diagnostic-Code: smtp;550 This domain is not hosted here</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what do it do!?</p>
<p>thanks again</p>

<p>Hi Piper,</p>
<p>Sorry for our delay.</p>
<p>Based on our check, Exchange related DNS records are not added properly. As you are using WIX nameservers (DNS provider), so all DNS records produced by Office 365 should be added to WIX. Please refer to :
<a href="https://www.wix.com/support/html5/domains/managing-your-domain-records/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.wix.com/support/html5/domains/managing-your-domain-records/</a>&nbsp;to add all the DNS records produced by Office 365(you can get these DNS records on your
<strong>screenshot, steps 3:set up domain</strong>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, 123-reg now is regarded as DNS register, if you have add DNS records produced by Office 365, please delete them.</p>
<p>We will keep assisting you based on your updates.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Sky</p>

<h2>            How do I recover and old &#40;inactive&#41; hotmail account and ALL of my emails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It has been a while since I have logged into this account but it is still in constant use as my Facebook account is registered to it. I have sent numerous emails to this account from others as it's my back up account. I desperately need access to this account
 and ALL emails I left on it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will appreciate any feedback!</p>
