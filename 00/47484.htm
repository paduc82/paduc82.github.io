<h2>            HP Officejet 7400 Printer cannot be contacted over the network</h2>
                    <p>Printer has always communicated with the laptop, but after a power failure two days ago there is no more connection. &nbsp;Printer powers up and copies but when a print is ordered there is nothing but an error message. &nbsp;Laptop can find the printer and install
 it. &nbsp;Have installed new printer drivers, updated Windows, powered off and unplugged laptop, printer and router. &nbsp;Have uninstalled and reinstalled printer several times. Have run every diagnostic I can find and the same message comes back: that the printer
 cannot be contacted over the network. &nbsp;Have tried resorting to using printer offline and inline; no difference. &nbsp;Even performed a system restore to before the storm, with no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any up to date guidance? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Not working. Error &#40;0x409&#41; 0x80080005</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Problem with connecting to Xbox. I cant open the App. It says: "You cant be logged in right&nbsp; now. Try again later" (Translated) with the error codes (0x409) 0x80080005 . If i go the Settings, Gaming (The one with the Xbox logo), and at the bottom
 there is Xbox-Network, it checks the connection. Everything seams fine, (ping is a bit high), but at the bottom under Nat-Type it just searches and searches and never finishes. I also can't play any Microsoft game. Forza Horizon 4 loads for ever end gives
 me the same error code at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows is up to date (1803 ; 17134.590)</p>
<p>My Antivirus is close to fully disabled (Bitdefender)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me because i have this problem for 3 weeks now, never found a working solution, and i miss playing Forza.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank for your Help!</p>

<h2>            Can you change the keyboard layout on Surface, say to a Dvorak keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    I'm interested in buying Surface RT for school, but I use a different keyboard than everybody else, which happens to be a Dvorak keyboard. I was wondering if I can change the settings on the Surface RT to fur fill my need. Also can I use it (Dvorak keyboard
 layout) with a touch cover?<br />

            for most things, windows rt is exactly the same as windows 8. you can change to any keyboard layout you want. you'll have to use your imagination when using the touch cover, but i'm guessing you are used to the layout and shouldn't have much trouble.

            I noticed this as well the other day, although it appeared to be PDF attachments wouldn't come through. When I would log online, I could see and access the attachments just fine but windows 10 mail gave no indication that there were any attachments to
 the messages. What really threw me for a loop was a day or two later I received an email with a microsoft word attachment just fine.&nbsp; Windows troubleshooting tool didn't detect any issues.&nbsp; I'll try sending more tests tomorrow from work to try and see if there
 are any patterns to help isolate the issue.<br />

<h2>            Files show up in two locations and I can&#39;t delete one without deleting the other</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to clean up a slow-running laptop that is running Windows 7. I transferred a bunch of picture files from my Picture folder to an external hard drive and then deleted the pictures from my hard drive. All seemed to be going great. Then I noticed
 a bunch of files in my Picture folder that shouldn't be there. One was a large folder I have on my desktop. I deleted it from the Picture folder since it doesn't belong there, but it also deleted from my desktop. I restored the file from the recycling bin,
 and it restored to both locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, several files from other areas (like downloads and desktop) are also showing up in my Pictures folder. I thought they were just copies, but they must be the same files just somehow in two places at once, since each copy deletes when I delete
 one. How can I unlink them and get rid of the excess files?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to find the answer with a Google search, and I've learned that it's not the best idea to save documents and files on the desktop. I won't be doing that anymore. But how do I unlink all these files so I can delete one and not the other?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for any suggestions!</p>
<p>Jen</p>

            <p>Take a look closely at what you're using.&nbsp; The Picture <em>library</em> is entirely different from the Picture
<em>folder</em>.&nbsp; The library is just a shortcut way of seeing several places at once (nothing can ever be "stored inside" a library).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exercise:&nbsp; Right-click your picture library and choose "properties".&nbsp; Here you'll see all the places that will show up inside the Picture library view.&nbsp; Likely, you have some places being shown in that library that aren't meant to be.&nbsp; No problem, you can
 remove them from the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just remember that the library is just showing you an easy combined view of all those locations.&nbsp; The files are still stored in the original places and if you delete them from the library view, you're deleting the original.</p>

<h2>            User Profile Lost How to re-establish&#63;</h2>
                    System did an update &amp; since then when starting up it gives an error stating that you have been logged in using a temporary profile. I've tried
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile <br />
but that won't let me copy over the appdata &amp; it dosen't seem to actually transfer the files either even though the copying window pops up &amp; shows the progress. When I log out &amp; log in as the new user, the copied data isn't there.<br />
<br />
I've also tried renaming the user key.bak entry as another kb article showed, and tried to do a restore, but the only available restore point is from the point where the problem started.<br />
<br />
The user folder is still there &amp; all the files are there, it seems it **should** be a simple step to just tell windows where to look for the profile data, but no such luck so far.<br />
<br />
The reg key does point to the correct folder.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
These methods should help for Windows 7 or Vista.<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.</p>

Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to ADMIN.<br />
This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same password<br />
(or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />

<h2>            Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I hook my Xbox 360 for the first time to my TV which has all the necessary connections. After I hook up the composite cable and turn on the console I tried to use the free Kinect disk&nbsp;the display on the TV showed a message relating that I must update my
 Kinect stings. And then on the bottom of the screen with the message window shows Yes or No for updating &gt; but my&nbsp;TV controller&nbsp;could not move to the&nbsp;"Yes" position or the" No" position&nbsp;. So I could not update, then I disconnect my Kinect sensor from the 360
 Xbox and installed a Movie in to my Xbox to see if it would play, the screen came up for the Xbox 360 but that was it? I can't do any thing with it, even my commuter monitor does not work with the Xbox, I wonder if this is just a piece of junk, and I just
 purchased it.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear you're having issues with your 360. When you say you're having problems calibrating the Kinect, what are you using to select Yes/No? Do you have a wired Xbox 360 controller or a wireless one? If you have a wireless one, is it fully charged
 and synced with the Xbox 360 properly?</p>

            I was having similar problems to you. &nbsp;My issue occurred when a PC that was the creator of the homegroup was upgraded to windows 8.1 (and switched to a "connected" Microsoft user account). &nbsp;My guess is that somehow during upgrading the OS, the computer
 retained its old id (pre-connected user account id?) leaving an orphaned member of the homegroup that was being broadcast by the homegroupprovider service (so deleting the local data, such as the idstore, would not help, because the homegroup provider running
 on that same machine was broadcasting that data to the homgroup listener running on that same machine)
<div><br />
<div>I can't promise it will work for you, but I narrowed down the problem to the HomegroupProvider service running on my own computer claiming that it was a member of its own homegroup. &nbsp;In order to change this, I needed to delete a key from the registry with
 system permissions. &nbsp;Others experiencing this or related issue can try the following:
<div><br />
<div>FIRST: A caveat: Before doing any of this, I had left the homegroup from all other computers on the network. &nbsp;This is because other computers in the homegroup are broadcasting homegroup membership to any listeners on the network, so it is unclear if deleting
 a member on only one computer will quickly be reverted.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) Check in the registry for some member keys in the location: HKLM/SYSTEM/ControlSet001/Services/HomeGroupProvider/LocalUserMembership</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there are no member keys there, this might not be your issue. &nbsp;If there are, you can proceed to step 2. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) Export the LocalUserMembership key to a file on your desktop (just in case). You'd like to delete whatever keys are under "LocalUserMembership" -- but of course when you try, you will see that you do not have access to do so. &nbsp;In order to get access,
 you need to run regedit as a system account. &nbsp;See step 3.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>3) Download pstools (google it) and put them in a folder (I put them in C:\program files (x86)\pstools\ ) and add that folder to your path (edit the system environment variable path... google that too if you don't know how.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4) Open a command prompt as admin and type: "<strong>psexec -i -d -s c:\windows\regedit.exe". &nbsp;</strong><span>This
 will run regedit with system account access, giving you the permission to delete that offensive member key</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>5) Go back to&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>HKLM/SYSTEM/ControlSet001/Services/HomeGroupProvider/LocalUserMembership</div>
<div>and delete all keys (folders) under it (you should have exported this to a .reg file on your desktop in step 2. In the event of an issue or if this fix doesn't work and you want to reverse it, you would have to reimport the .reg file with a system account).</div>

            HI dlan1000,<br />
<br />
Anyone with leaving the HomeGroup issue should try to leave the Group using the usual methods<br />
first.<br />
<br />
Logging in as ADMIN and using a Command Prompt (ADMIN) to run&nbsp;regedit will allow you to<br />
edit that key without using PSTools.<br />
<br />
WinKEY + X - Command Prompt&nbsp;(ADMIN)&nbsp;- regedit.exe<br />
<br />
=====================================================<br />
<br />
It is a good idea to remove the HomeGroup before doing any major OS upgrades.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            <p>Like the op, I was unable to remove my Win 10 machine from a homegroup. I would always see "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">windows couldn't remove your computer&nbsp;from the homegroup". However Dlan1000's suggestion of killing the keys
 using pstools and regedit worked perfectly for me (after a reboot). Sorry, Rob Brown, but just running regedit as admin did NOT allow me to delete the keys, the pstools trick was necessary.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My homegroup had been broken for over a year, I didn't think I'd ever actually fix it. Thank you dlan1000!!!</span></p>

<h2>            vx-800 webcam picture is tinted green&#59; has no property settings</h2>
                    I recently replaced my older vx-1000 with the vx-800, hoping to have a better webcam. Unfortunately, upon purchasing, i've run into many problems.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. The picture is tinted green, and I cannot find any video settings or properties to change this.
<div>2. The picture is laggy and the voice sounds terrible, which is worse than my old camera.</div>
<div>3. I cannot find a program for this camera to use from Logitech or microsoft.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am very dissapointed, but I guess, all in all, I just want to know how to change the picture settings or know if there is a compatible Logitech program for this camera.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You could&nbsp;need a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox stores)
<br />
or your System maker's Support to help with hardware issues.</p>
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy
<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already
<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come

<h2>            Hyper-V Replication setup with pure PowerShell</h2>

<p>I have 2 x Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 (HV1 and HV2) in Workgroup (WG), not in domain.&nbsp; HV1 has a VM (VM1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to setup VM replication of VM1 in HV1 to HV2 with pure PowerShell commands by creating self-signed Certs.?&nbsp; How to do it?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>All the information I found on web so far are showing how to use GUI under AD.&nbsp; I don't have GUI and AD as I have Hyper-V Servers in Workgroup only.&nbsp; I know I need self-signed Certs. for HTTPS HyperV replication.&nbsp; The previous "MakeCert" steps is now deprecated
 too.&nbsp; So I don't know the proper way to create, export and import the Certs. for Hyper-V replication now.</div>
<div>

            The second monitor is using the screen resolution of your laptop. This may be because your laptop's video card can't support the monitor's native resolution (the monitor is quite large for instance). You would check that by Googling for something like
 "[name of your video card] supported resolutions". Or you look in your Control Panel&gt;Display options for multiple monitor preferences. You might also have a Control Panel applet just for your video card which offers preferences for multiple monitors. If your
 video card does support the monitor's resolution but nothing else avails, look at third-party multiple monitor management software.<a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UltraMon</a> is excellent but costs.<a href="http://www.displayfusion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DisplayFusion</a>
 has a free version as well as Pro.

            Thanks for the life raft. I'm starting to unpanic. Actually my laptop screen burned out &amp;&nbsp;plugging in an aux mon was cheaper than total replacement so I'm not really running multiple monitors. Does that alter your suggestion&nbsp;for looking into online software?
 Also what am I giving up by going with the tempting freebee. On my budget, barebones software is fine but not if a few $ more will keep the lid on my tranquilizer bottle.

            Even though you are only looking at one monitor, Windows is using the resolution for the laptop's screen size. Look in your Display settings and see if you can change the aux monitor's resolution. If you can't, you still need to make sure your video card
 can push out the pixels required for the aux monitor. You forgot to say how large it is. And it can't hurt to install the free DisplayFusion app to see if that allows you to set the aux monitor's resolution to something larger. I'm guessing that your laptop
 has a resolution of something like 1024 x 768 or 1280 x 800 or the like and the monitor is maybe 1600 x 1200, etc.

<h2>            I can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t add PayPal without credit card info.</h2>
                    
<p>So for about 3 hours Im trying to add my PayPal account to my xbox live paymant options.Without any succes.</p>
<p>It looks like this is some known issue because there is ton of search reasults on google but there is no answer to this.</p>
<p>All I get is error code 8382025C or info that I must add credit card info when Im doing it on xbox.com instead of console.</p>
<p>I am aware of sticky FAQ somewhere on this site but there is no answer to my problem there.</p>
<p>I'm from Poland,I have same adres on paypal and on xbox account (only email is different),I have some money on my paypal account.</p>

<p>Did you find a solution? I'm experiencing the same problem. </p>
<p>My Xbox and Paypal Acount have the same billing and email address. I have a verified bank account linked to my Paypal account.
</p>
<p>But on the Xbox it gives me the same error as the topic starter. On the PC it asks me for my credit card info. Which makes the whole Paypal payment service quite useless, in my opinion. If I wanted to link my CC info, I could do that in my Xbox billing info.
</p>
<p>The weird part is that my Paypal account was linked to my Xbox account, but every time I wanted to purchase something it just redirected me back to the pricing info, after I confirmed I wanted to pay with Paypal. I tried deleting and add my Paypal info again,
 and now I'm stuck with the same problem as the topic starter. </p>

<p>In Brazilian forum they have the same problem.</p>
<p>But to fix your payapl data +xbox.com and your &nbsp;credit card information data &nbsp;they have the same, if only one data is diferent the system refuses.
</p>
<p>Yeh i know that´s a pain, but that´s (in theory) is for your safety (because for issues of that i use MS points).</p>
<p>Maybe just Maybe the error is caused by diferent e-mail (or in rares cases how they lauche your name is the culpit, for sample: if your name is Fernando José Curasao and Paypal lauches your information just like that and your credit card launches your name
 like Fernando Curasao the credit card will refuses, because the name don´t match,,,).</p>
<p>I hope i help you and forgive my bad english it´s self learnerd.</p>

<h2>            Strange noise from Xbox One</h2>
                    I have noticed lately a strange "bloop" randomly coming from my Xbox One when it's turned off. It seemed to stop when I unplugged it and plugged it back in but then it starts again when I turn it off after play. Anyone else have this problem or know what
 causes it?

            Try posting a video because its supposed to make noises booying up. So unless you can post a video it will be hard to help.

<p>3 small questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do you keep your console?</p>
<p>Is it properly ventilated?</p>
<p>Do you use 'power saving' (i.e. the xbox 'turns on' briefly before fully shutting down)?</p>

            The consol is in my bedroom and is well ventilated. I don't use the power saving settings.

            I will try to capture the sound but it's so random. Thanks for the suggestion.
