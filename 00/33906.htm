====================================<br />
I guess you have a media reader? Insert your card and<br />
try going to Start / Computer and see if the memory card <br />
shows as a Removable Disk...<br />
<br />
If it does...left click it to view the contents and you can <br />
delete from there.

==========================<br />
What happens when you highlight a file<br />
and press your delete key? Do you receive <br />
an error?<br />
<br />
Maybe the read only&nbsp;slider on the memory <br />
card was moved by accident.

Can you delete the photos one at a time from within the camera?

<p>I just started having the same problem with the built-in SD memory card reader on my Dell pc, using Vista. All has worked well for two years, and now suddenly although I can still read memory cards in this reader, I cannot delete them - using Windows explorer.&nbsp;
 Delete does not appear in the right-click menu, and in the File menu 'delete' is grayed out.&nbsp; If I just press the Delete key while the file is highlighted, there is no error message, and absolutely nothing happens.&nbsp; The card slider is in the Unlocked mode.&nbsp;
 This happens for any of my SD cards I try in the reader.&nbsp; I finally tried the card in my laptop card reader and I can both read and delete there.&nbsp; Then I plugged a USB card reader into the Dell pc, and I can both read and delete files on the card there.&nbsp; I
 have no idea what changed.</p>

An internal media reader is USB connected also. It sounds <br />
like you may have a hardware issue with the internal media <br />
reader.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Slow After Computer Shut Down Unexpectedly</h2>
                    I had a power outage recently and since then the computer seems slow. I had reset my PC just a day ago and there's no chance of any other issue. What should I do? Wipe the whole drive and install Windows again from scratch?

            Did you restart several times to see if it improves?
<br />
<br />Also try resetting your BIOS:

<br />OR
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Even though you did a Reset Windows does not always find the latest available drivers and there are likely other issues affecting performance. So I would do a Performance check for the entire system.
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a  process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there
<br />Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major device drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Right Click Start Button - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -  REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We actually recommend a USB based drive, as it‚Äôs very easy to use by simply plugging into an open USB port on your computer. Once the drive is plugged in, it acts almost like an external hard drive, so all you‚Äôd need to do is open the disk up and drag the
 files/folders you want to copy onto your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - Type Cover - Cursor Disappears</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue with my Type Cover that makes the cursor disappear and not come back until I detach the keyboard and connect it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens when I have the cover flipped behind the screen so it is a base for the kickstand. When it is in this mode, the keyboard and touch pad turn off so you don't have accidental button presses. Normally, once you flip the keyboard back around, all
 the keys and the touch pad start working again. However, I have found that if it is flipped around for too long (&gt;30 min), the touch pad does not start working again when you flip the keyboard back around. This is resolved when you disconnect and reconnect
 the keyboard. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess it is a firmware issue that can hopefully be resolved.</p>

            <p>Hi Cuttingwater,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your contribution to the Surface Community. I see you're using the Surface Pro 3 and the Type Cover, and the cursor disappears when the Cover is flipped behind the screen. You seem to be having another issue where the Cover completely stops
 working after being flipped around for too long. That must be very inconvenient, and I'll try the best I can to help resolve the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, make sure you have all Windows updates (the most recent one is from 7/8/14).

<h2>            Second monitor isn&#39;t detected</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For about&nbsp; half a year, I've been using Samsung TV as the second monitor, connected to PC via DVI-HDMI cable. However, about a week ago (I suppose that it has happened after Windows updating) Windows stopped detecting the second monitor. Intel HD Graphics
 panel in the Multiple Display tab offers only 'Single Display' option. </p>
<p>My processor is Intel Core i5 4460 with Intel HD Graphics 4600 subsystem.</p>
<p>Can anybody help?</p>

            <p>I am having a similar problem. The last update to windows was 7/15/16 and the software reports that it is up to date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened to me was yesterday (7/23 -- a long time since the update) the external monitor was working fine, then it froze, then it had a distorted image of what was on my laptop screen and the it went dark. The device manager lists a "Generic PnP Monitor"
 but does not recognize it when I try to configure for multiple displays. No sound is emitted when I plug or unplug the device (it used to). I have gone to the monitor manufacturer's website (ViewSonic) to look for the driver for my model (VA2455sm) and while
 it is on the dropdown list, it gives an error that there is no such thing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try the windows update troubleshooter and it indicated that had made an adjustment. We'll see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am about to try the approach of turning it on and off a couple of times to see it that works.
</p>
<p>===========</p>
<p>It worked! I don't know why, but my monitor came up when my system rebooted. Hope this helps someone else even if I don't know exactly what worked (restarting or the troubleshoot adjustment).</p>

<h2>            Unable to move application to Flash drive&#47; SD card, move option is disabled</h2>
                    <p>Hellow to all. I have Windows 10 on a device with just 16 Gb on drive C: most of which is taken by the OS itself and preinstalled files, leaving me a meagre 3 Gb. I would like to move some applications from C: to my flash (D:) or, better still, to my SD
 card (E:), and also, to install all new applications on E: . In Settings &gt; Storage, the necessary buttons ("Move" against many installed applications, and the choice of drive for new applications), although present, are dimmed. At the same time, the choice
 of drive for new pictures, music and video is working.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi Andrei,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern about moving the files to flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform&nbsp;that movement of few&nbsp;applications to flash drive/ SD card is not possible as&nbsp;those programs would be in-built in operating system.</p>
<p>If you move those applications to flash drive and eject the drive out, accessibility&nbsp;to those programs would be lost and hence the option is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to move the programs/ applications to any other partition on the same and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. Feel free to contact us for any further issue on Windows Operating System. We will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Deepika,</p>
<p>Thank you but your comment does not quite answer my question which is, in fact, in two parts.</p>
<p>1. Moving apps.</p>
<p>I have no intention to touch essential programs that are part of the OS. However, there are quite a few pre-installed ‚Äúextras‚Äù, such as MS Solitaire Collection, the ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù clip, etc., etc. I don't mind keeping
 them but I'd rather have them on the SD card, rather than taking up valuable space on the (C:) drive which on my device, as I said before, is quite small (16 Gb, of which 11+ are taken up by Windows 10 itself, plus all those extras, leaving me less than 3
 Gb for all my pains). In Settings &gt; System &gt; Apps and features, clicking these apps opens two buttons, ‚ÄúMove‚Äù and ‚ÄúUninstall‚Äù. The first is inactive (dimmed), the second active. So, the system does not mind my getting rid of the app altogether but wouldn't
 allow me to move it out of the way. This is what I find strange. After all, if the ‚ÄúMove‚Äù button is there, there must be a reason for it. Is there a way of activating it?</p>
<p>2. New apps.</p>
<p>For the same memory saving considerations, I prefer to install all new apps on the SD card, rather than on the (C:) drive (option available, e.g., on the humblest Android smartphone). In my present case, Settings
 &gt; System &gt; Storage reads: ‚ÄúSave locations. Change where your apps, documents, music, pictures and videos are stored by default‚Äù. Fine, but again, the relevant buttons are active for all those things except for the applications. And again, I wonder why should
 the system force me to install such non-essential and bulky things as, e.g., games, on my meagre (C:) drive? It is true that the setup programs of many apps show the installation path and give you the option of changing it. There are other apps, however, that
 go straight for the (C:) drive, no questions asked. I'd rather define it once and for all.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention. </p>

            &nbsp; It sounds like you could have a virus or other malware. Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into Safe Mode.&nbsp; Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in Safe Mode.&nbsp; To
 get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode.&nbsp; Then run a full system scan.<br />

&nbsp;Forum moderator Keith has some suggestions along this line at <br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3</a><br />

&nbsp;If that fixes it, fine. If not, use System Restore to go back to a date prior to the beginning of the problem.&nbsp; To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore.&nbsp; Click the box that says Show more restore points.
<br />
- <br />
&nbsp;You can check for corrupted system files.&nbsp; Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type CMD in the search box, right-click CMD.EXE and click Run as administrator. Then from the command prompt type sfc /scannow.<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log.&nbsp; To do that click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer.&nbsp; Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.<br />
&nbsp; `<br />
&nbsp;When you get your system back in good working order, I urge you to back your system up to an external hard drive and make regular periodic updates to it.<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.<br />

<div>It looks the same in safe mode.</div>
<div>The memory diagnostics behaves the same way as all the other programs. (opens in the same program, and doesn't work).</div>

I mean that when you right click on a program, and ''open in'' and then choose standard program. I tried what you suggested. didn't work.

<h2>            How could I split the audio from an HDMI cable so that I have working audio when gaming&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Basically I have a new acer monitor that has tow HDMI inputs and one D-SUB. The problem&nbsp;being the&nbsp;monitor does not have any speakers built in. There for when I use the HDMI cable to use the&nbsp;monitor for gaming off my XBOX 360 I get no audio. My question being,
 how could I sue this acer&nbsp;monitor but still get audio for my game?</p>

<p>Some retail stores sell a sort of "splitter" item that allows you to plug in the red white and yellow cables so you may be able to hook up the red and white cables to a receiver and play them through speakers.</p>

<p>While you could buy the Mad Catz cable, if you have a 360 S you don't have to. You can use a digital audio adapter via the optical out, like this

<p>I know the xbox 360 slim has a S/PDIF port that &nbsp;you can use an optical audio cord for. Here is one from amazon. I haven't bought one yet but I'm thinking about it. &nbsp;It should work if your sound system has a port for it. Check out the xbox to see what the
 port looks like, it's located at the bottom of the port panel on the back. Hope this was helpful.

            <span>What happens is that the end "margin" of the QuickLaunch toolbar has gotten so far over to the right that it is now down below. Unlock the Taskbar and then "grab" the dotted line on the bottom bar and drag it up to immediately
 to the right of the QuickLaunch icons. Now you've successfully made the QuickLaunch toolbar shorter and can "grab" the top bar of the Taskbar and "push" it down to the regular one-tier height. If you have multiple toolbars on the Taskbar this can happen, too.<br />

                    <p>Original title: Windows 10 update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp; I upgraded from Windows 8.1 Home Ed to the free Windows 10 Home Ed back in August 2015 and</p>
<p>have been receiving automatic updates ever since.&nbsp; I am now at Windows 10 build 10240.
</p>
<p>Apparently other users have received an update to build 10586 back in November.&nbsp; I have</p>
<p>seen no notice of this update. When I open Windows update it tells me my device is up to date.</p>
<p>Is there a problem or should I just be more patient.</p>
<p>

    <title>Laptop Shuts Down When Closing Lid - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Laptop Shuts Down When Closing Lid</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Windows 10 Update my laptop has been behaving strangely when closing the lid. I completed the update and have clean installed Windows 10 from a DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I shut the lid and then re-open. My laptop goes straight to the Asus start up screen, then to the blue loading screen and then to the sign in. Prior to the update It would always go straight to the log in page upon opening back up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had an issue with the computer turning off when leaving the laptop untouched with the screen open. Normally it would have been in standby until I moved the curser, now the screen goes off and I can hear the computer fans starting up then winding down
 every 10 seconds or so accompanied by a beep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought this was an issue with the install so I carried out the clean install again last night and I'm still getting the issue with the computer shutting down after the screen closes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a big issues as I'm often moving around with my laptop and basically loose everything I've been working on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Anyone else had this? All the settings are still on default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,&nbsp;</p>
<p>David.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It's been nearly a year and no one from Microsoft has been able to answer this question? The problem persists on my laptop after the most recent round of updates. Computer shuts down and takes an annoying length of time to restart, when it's supposed to
 just "wake up". All settings are still set to "sleep" but apparently this new update ignores them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not impressed.</p>

    <title>windows 7 unexpected shutdown... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elvis7  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 unexpected shutdown...</h2>
                    ill start off by saying my laptop is a dell studio xps 16 , core i7 820, 8gb ddr3 ram, ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5700 Series. i do not want to send my laptop back to dell for repair because it is my 4th replacement and they decided that all the upgrades they
 gave me for my troubles will be taken away if the laptop is ever replaced again..(that doesnt make sense to me and i will contact the dell legal department as my last resort)..<br />
<br />
now then, the problem with my laptop is that is works great other than it shuts down and restarts when ever im not there, my pc would restart more than twice a day and the reliability history would just say that there was an unexpected shutdown...i reinstalled
 windows 7 ult 64bit and it seems to be doing it again, except this time its done it 3 days in a row 1:38am-1:40pm-1:45am ... im looking through everything but can seem to find anything helpful. and dell is useless! i dont want dell to replace my laptop with
 one that is a 6/10 when the one i have is a 10/10 ...&nbsp; im thinking about installing some log software to tell me what processes and services etc were running before the shutdown. i currentl turned off all services(expect Ms ones) and startup stuff and will
 see how that goes. the restarts seem to happen when the system is idle. there is no blue&nbsp;screen or anything like that,&nbsp;just a restart...&nbsp;any help would be greatly appreciated..<br />

<p>On the surface at least the two you posted seem to be unrelated.</p>
<p><strong>A few&nbsp;things to try:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Run the SFC&nbsp; /SCANNOW&nbsp; command.</strong> This will check and repair if necessary any critical Windows system files.</p>
<p>Windows 7 - SFC SCANNOW Command - System File Checker<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html</a></p>
<p>How to analyze the log file entries that the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker (SFC.exe) program generates in Windows Vista:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a></p>
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;Run Memtest86+,</strong> this runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or<br />
confirm if your one or more of your memory sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours, if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a></p>
<p><strong>3) Prime 95:<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/</a><br />
It's a stand alone .exe file contained in a .zip archive.<br />
Just choose to run the "stress test" option for 3 hours or more.<br />
If your PC can pass this test both your memory and CPU<br />
are fine (close the case cover to maintain proper ventilation)</p>

<div>Since there's nothing obvious&nbsp;in the logs, I'm wondering whether it's simply a case of overheating.</div>
<div>Try installing a temperature monitor that records the temp periodically </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since it seems to happen around the same time each day, it may be a good idea to see what is in the Scheduled Tasks lists for around that time, as well - perhaps a Virus scan?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't suppose that you have power supply problems? Anything else resetting at about that time?</div>

            <p>Hi Johnson, </p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For better understanding of the issue please answer the following question:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you made any software or hardware changes on your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>What is the make &amp; model of your computer?</li><li>Which security software is installed on your computer?</li></ol>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Disable antivirus and Firewall and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and\or troubleshoot
 any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</p>

<h2>            Family screen time sending &#34;Can &#60;child&#62; have more screen time&#63;&#34; requests to wrong email address</h2>
                    <p>I have a Family set up with screen time limits for a child. Last night, they wanted more Minecraft time, so they clicked the "Request more time" button in Windows 10. I didn't receive an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got into work this morning and found that the email had been sent to my work email address, not my home email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I had both email addresses registered with my Microsoft account. However, I have since removed my work email address from my Microsoft account. I can't even find a reference to it anywhere on the Microsoft account page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is it that the screen time requests are going to an email address that is no longer part of my account?</li><li>How can I adjust what email address the screen time requests are going to?</li></ul>

<p>The correct answers to my questions, which I got from customer support, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a part of my account. It's the "billing" email address for some reason.</li><li>You can adjust the "billing" email address by visiting your profile ( https://account.microsoft.com/profile ) --&gt; Your Info --&gt; Contact Info --&gt; Address --&gt; Address book. This might be a working quick link: ( https://account.microsoft.com/billing/addresses#
 ).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the billing section you can change your billing email, which also controls family screen time emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know why I cannot mark this as the actual answer.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate&#58; &#34;you must activate today. activate windows now&#34;</h2>
                    Was already installed in December when I bought my brand new pc.&nbsp; I never received this program. Now all of a sudden I get messages like "you must activate today. activate windows now"&nbsp; and "change product key" and "windows 7 Build 7600 this copy of windows
 is not genuine"&nbsp; and the shop from where I bought my pc has disappeared.&nbsp; I can not afford to buy another Windows 7 Ultimate program of N$ 3,680 (that was the price).&nbsp; Now my question is: can I buy a new XP and just install it on my pc?&nbsp; Surely that will cost
 a lot cheaper?&nbsp; What will be the cheapest solution for my problem, please?&nbsp;

            You can install any version of Windows on any PC. Just make sure you can locate the drivers for the various devices such as display adapter, network adapter, sound card.

    <title>All apps are missing from Windows 10 Start menu - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            All apps are missing from Windows 10 Start menu</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Missing Win 10 Maps Tile</p>
<p>On starting up recently, I have lost all my Windows Store app tiles ie Maps, Edge, MSN News etc&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly Sport tile remained. The only one.</p>
<p>The Apps are still installed as if I click on an .html file it opens in Edge.&nbsp; Or if I try to reinstall Maps from Store (Tile also gone) then I get the message that the app is already installed, and an open button is offered.&nbsp; Clicking on this, opens Maps.&nbsp;
 So I think the apps are still in the machine, but the tiles are no longer visible, and they do not list in the program list to the left of the tiles screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run Reimage PC Repair Online, but this failed to bring the apps back into the program list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to get the apps back on the program list, or how to find them in my system files (to make shortcuts manually)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, Apps, settings, files‚Äîthey can all be found on the Start menu. Just select the
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fkbdevstorage1.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f15438_en_2" />button on the taskbar. However, we understand that you have problem in finding them in Start menu. Try like this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Click Start,</p>
<p>* Type name of the app (I.e. Maps) you need to PIN to Start menu,</p>
<p>* When it appears in the search results, right-click on the app and select Pin to Start,</p>
<p>* Do the same for all apps that you need to Pin to Start menu. Now check if they appears in the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it went.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Unfortunately when I click on Start and type in Maps the app does not come up in the list.&nbsp; What does come up is a Best Match, Settings and Web sections offering ways to select default apps, web searches etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have discovered is that by signing in to my <strong>administrative account</strong>, all the tiles are visible and functional as expected.&nbsp; It seems that my
<em>standard user account </em>has been corrupted somehow, and it is probably quicker to make a new standard account and delete the corrupt one.</p>
<p>

    <title>Transfer Cable Not Recognizing Old HDD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jawshooah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer Cable Not Recognizing Old HDD</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>So I just recently got a new Xbox 360 Hard Drive Transfer Cable, and I'm having some trouble. Specifically, the cable doesn't seem to recognize my old HDD when I plug it in. The instructions say that a message is supposed to pop up when everything is connected,
 but I have yet to see such a message. My console is completely up-to-date, and all of my hardware is official first-party Microsoft stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it helps, I recorded a video showing step-by-step how I attempted to use the cable.&nbsp;http://youtu.be/DmDbuNQIQR8</p>
<p>Can anybody offer some advice? I doubt the cable is faulty since it's literally brand new, and my 360 is barely a month old.</p>

<p>[quote user="Jawshooah"]Can anybody offer some advice?[/quote]Yeah, don't follow the instructions.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Unplug the drive from the cable and the cable from the console.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>- Power on the console. Let it finish booting, then log into your profile.</p>
<p>- Attach the USB end of the cable to a rear USB port on the console</p>
<p>- Wait 15 seconds</p>
<p>- Attach the HDD to the cable</p>
<p>- Wait 30 seconds</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>You should then get the pop-up.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Corona model consoles (the latest one out) do not appear to have enough power to drive the cable from the front USB ports. I've also noticed that even the rear USB ports don't power the current cable if the drive's plugged into the cable before the cable
 is attached to a rear USB port.</p>

<p>Hey IceStorm,</p>
<p>Thanks, but that doesn't seem to work either. It's been plugged in via your suggestion for about 5 minutes now, and still nothing. Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Just a suggestion, but on my xbox, the usb ports are very touchy and I had adjust (wiggle) the cable to get it to recognize my drive. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Sorry Bobo, that didn't seem to do anything.</p>
<p>I just tried it with my friend's newer model HDD, and the transfer dialog popped up almost instantly. Either there's something wrong with my old HDD, or the cable has trouble recognizing the older model.</p>
<p>Any mods want to weigh in on this? Here's the video again in case it was lost in the block of text in the opening post.</p>

<p>Try an older model console or the original transfer cable that only works with original HDDs if you can. The original cable appears to pull less power than the new cable.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Other than that... do you have a powered USB hub? You might be able to get it working by putting the powered hub between the 360 and the cable.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Also, make sure the drive's spinning up. You should be able to feel the vibration of the drive spinning up. That should at least rule out if the drive seized or not.</p>

<p>I don't have an older model console available to test, and I actually tried the original cable before exchanging it for this one :\</p>
<p>I don't have a powered hub, but I suppose I could go out and buy one...though I hesitate to buy more hardware when this should work on its own.</p>
<p>The disk in the old HDD doesn't spin when I plug it in. Why would the old drive pull that much more power than the new one?</p>
<p>Also, completely unrelated, but how do you add line breaks in this editor? I added &lt;br /&gt; to the HTML source but it just replaced it with &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;, which doesn't seem to allow consecutive newlines.</p>

<p>I add two &lt;br&gt;'s from the HTML section to add paragraph breaks. Paragraphs work correctly in IE, but I'm using Firefox at the moment.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>If you have something like an iPod charger handy, you could plug the cable into that, then the drive into the cable. The drive should spin up.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Any friends with older model consoles? The older Trinity 360 S or the original model 360? Unfortunately I will not be back at my collection of consoles to try a 120GB drive on the new transfer cable on a Corona until tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p>I tried plugging it into an iPod charger, but nothing happened. I did the same with a newer model, and it spun up, so I'm guessing there's a problem with the old hard drive. Any way to get Microsoft to check it out without wiping the data?</p>

<p>So is there anything I can do about this? The old HDD won't draw power when I plug it into my computer either. I have a TON of stuff on the thing, the 120GB was almost completely filled with game installs, saves, and DLC. Is it all unrecoverable?</p>

            You can most likely fix your problem by using System Restore. Here is how it works:<br />
1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu.<br />
3. Enter the Administrator's password when prompted. It is often blank.<br />
4. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
5. Set Windows back to a point before you changed the password.<br />
<br />
Now is a good time to create, test and document a second admin account . . .<br />
<br />

<p>Does that mean you DO remember the OLD admin password ? The one before you changed it ?</p>
<p>If yes, do you also have a Windows 7 Installation DVD or a Repair disk&nbsp;?<br />
If yes again, you can logon to your computer by using this Microsoft Support tutorial :<br />
