<h2>            Windows Phone 640 8.1 update 2.  No memory due to OTHER uncategorised files</h2>
                    <p><strong>Phone has no memory left.</strong></p>
<p>More than 3Gb categorised on phone as "<strong>OTHER</strong>" that I cannot access or delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that this is a common problem, but most of the threads I have read are quite old and suggest that Software Version 8&nbsp;update 3 was meant to resolve problem.&nbsp; I am running 8.1 update 2, which must be newer,&nbsp;but problem still exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a huge SD card with loads of available space.</p>
<p>From the outset I ensured that everything defaulted to the SD card (Photos, videos, apps etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>3rd party File Explorer Apps in the hope they would give me access to the hidden files but to no avail.</li><li>connecting to PC and using native file explorer but to no avail.</li><li>3rd party Cleaner Apps that I believe work on the basis of filling the remaining available space with temporary data to force phone to purge the OTHER memory, but again to no avail.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Only solution left that I can find is to do a backup and hard reset, but I am reluctant to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>in case I brick the phone&nbsp; -&nbsp; which some have experienced;</li><li>in case I lose information and settings;</li><li>as I believe rebuilding the phone to how I had it will be laborious and will never actually be the same.</li><li>as I believe the restore can actually restore all&nbsp;the OTHER junk as well, making the exercise pointless.&nbsp;</li><li>as it doesn't actually cure problem.&nbsp; It just buys me some time before I have to do it again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MY QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a way to drill into the OTHER files and delete them?</li><li>Is there an explanation as to why the OTHER memory is filling up so&nbsp;that I&nbsp;can endeavour to do things differently in future and avoid the problem?</li><li>Should I even be having this problem with software 8.1 update 2?</li><li>Can anyone reassure me that the hard reset will work, and possibly direct me to a site that explains what I have to do in detail, from backing up to rebuilding?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>I am subscribed to office 365. My Windows 10 (all updates to date installed) is generally not running well and I would like to run the Microsoft Diagnostic tool and a "fixer" to identify and if possible fix issues. How can I do that without contacting supprt

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>We can run the Microsoft Diagnostic Tool ourselves without contacting support telephonically (<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/yongrhee/2014/02/01/tool-mpsreport-replacement-msdt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">See: Tool: MPSReport replacement, MSDT</a>). Based on your description,
 you may consider using the Windows Performance Diagnostic. You can find it and other Microsoft Diagnostics Tools from this page:<a href="https://home.diagnostics.support.microsoft.com/SelfHelp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Support Diagnostics</a>.</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to create a backup for HUP version of Office 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Within the next week, I shall be upgrading to an SSD for my laptop and doing a clean install of Windows 8.1 on the system. I would like to backup Microsoft Office 2013 to a USB drive, but I cannot do it with the normal means due obtaining the license through
 the HUP. Would anyone be able to help me backup Office without using my other installation? It doesn't seem like Office is tied to my personal Microsoft account, is there any way I can do that? It would make backing up a lot easier.</p>

<br />
You can re-install the Office on same computer. However if there is any hardware change, Office suite needs to be re-activated as the installation&nbsp;will be considered&nbsp;as a new computer.<br />
<br />
As mentioned in the following FAQ article, if you're connected to the Internet and installing Office without a DVD, activation will just happen silently in the background after the install is complete.
<br />
<br />
But if you aren't connected to the Internet during install, you'll see the Activation Wizard. It will give you options to either activate online or by telephone - choose the telephone option if you're still not connected.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

<h2>            How to get rid of a contact called &#39;Me&#39; and replacec it with my real name</h2>
                    My business Phone Lumia 735 i super. I love it. but It has one BIG disadvantage, the first contact is called "Me" and You cant rename it to Your real name nor delete it. The contact is useless and very confusing. Because when I see a list of my business
 e-mail (exchange server) it is laways "Me" (in real it is "Ja" in polish) instead of Name Surname or Surname, Name. Everybody in the company has a Real Name only I dont have my own, my name is just "Me". Most stupid way of presentation e-mail conversation
 I ever saw.&nbsp; It is replaced by the mobile mail application beacuse&nbsp; the "Me" ("Ja") does not exist anywhere else only on top of the contact list in my Lumia. And I think it came from here or is hardcoded in the mail application. How to ged rit of this anoing
 "Me". E-mail from outlook.com dont have this issue, there is always my real name not the stupid "Me". The same with my corporate e-mail in outlok and web outlook. Is this an error or it is by design by the most stupid way

<h2>            Unable to copy my worksheet</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I'm trying to copy one of the sheets in my workbook and I'm getting the message: "The formula or sheet you want to move or copy contains the name TABLE_11_3 which already exists in the destination worksheet. Do you want to use this version of the name?"<br />
<br />
If I click Yes the message pops up again, this time with the name TABLE_12_3. Each time I click Yes the message returns with a slightly different name. If I click No the name Conflict window opens, prompting me to change the name. Then the first message comes
 back with a different name. While this is going on I am unable to do anything else in Excel, not even close the program. I have to go into Task Manager and force close Excel.<br />
<br />
I have copied dozens of worksheets before and never had this happen. What could be causing this?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I don't know about POSTEDTXNS_1, I know Table_1 is generated when you create a Table. The fact is that there are things that generate a name automatically, like Print_Area, external connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for =#REF!#REF! , I am sure they can be deleted because you already have deleted the reference worksheet. If you are really using any of those reference, you should be able to see #REF in your current worksheets. You can press control+F and search&nbsp; #REF
 within the workbook to see any broken reference.</p>

<div>Outlook for mac was behaving really odd where I couldn't view any of my notes or calendar etc. To try and fix it, I used the Microsoft database utility to rebuild the database but after I did this, all my emails that were stored in folders have been deleted
 and the same goes for all my notes. It seems that it's completed wiped everything out except all my account information. I really need all the information that was lost.&nbsp;</div>

Do you know if there's a way around this problem?</p></blockquote><p>So, are you saying that you've yet to use Outlook for Mac at all?</p><p>If you have been using Outlook but just recently updated with service pack 2 then the "earlier version" would be what you were using prior to the update.</p><p>Since you haven't been using Time Machine you'll more than likely need to drag the Microsoft Office 2011 folder to the trash and re-install Office for Mac up to the version you were using prior to applying SP2. Launch Outlook with the Option key held down. This will launch the Database Utility application. Repair your identity and then see if it will open.</p><p>If that works then you can install SP2.</p><p>Sorry for the long work around but this update has had some issues around it.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Incoming Email from Customers Denied - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt&#38;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incoming Email from Customers Denied</h2>
                    <p>For the past several months, my organization has been experiencing a strange issue with incoming mail to Exchange Online/Office 365. A small percentage of people, typically customers and vendors, are unable to send email to any of our email addresses. They
 get mail delivery failed notifications with the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This message was created automatically by mail delivery software.<br />
<br />
A message that you have sent could not be delivered to one or more recipients. &nbsp;This is a permanent error. &nbsp;The following address failed:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &lt;redacted email address&gt;: 530 Validating Sender: 5.7.57 SMTP; Client was not authenticated to send anonymous mail during MAIL FROM
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The information I've been able to find on this error suggests that it's due to a problem on the senders end. That doesn't make sense when combined with the fact that these senders typically have nothing in common with each other, trying to send mail from
 a great variety of domains with different email services. I've gone so far as to whitelist a number of domains that users have reported getting this error from, which changed nothing. Message traces show no record of the affected emails existing on our end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for further troubleshooting or potential fixes would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've asked folks around the company to inform me of any further cases of this issue, and to ask anyone who contacts them about this to forward full NDR reports on to me. So far no results. Now it seems likely that this was a temporary issue that has since
 vanished. Please feel free to close this thread if appropriate, and I can resubmit with the full NDR should this problem reemerge.</p>

<p>Unfortunately N85 does not get free navigation, although the cost of an annual license has been considerably reduced in price.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, l<font>ike others users recently with E75 ("</font><font>Failed Install Ovi Maps 3.4(278) for E75") or 5530XM ("</font><font>Ovi Suite does not install Maps 3.04(278) on my Nokia 5530 XM"), I have the same problem.</font></p>
<p><font>I use currently Ovi Maps 3.01.09 with Drive and traffic navigation licences.<br />
</font></p>
<p><font>Nokia Ovi Suite (3.0.0.290) indicate an Ovi Maps update on </font>
<strong>"Ovi Maps 3.4(278)" with free navigation" </strong><span><span>(strangely not 3.04(278)!, an another mistake probably)</span></span><strong>,
</strong>but was not able to install it and gave me the error <strong>"An error occurred"</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope Nokia will solve this install problem quickly to give us Free navigation too.</p>

<p><strong><span>Here is the problem: I have Word 2007, Windows 7, and a new, widescreen monitor, which is where the problem starts. Like the others in the thread just mentioned, I cannot have a single page at 100%, rather than two pages
 at 100% or one page at 75% or 120%.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I can have it if i work around it every time I open a document, for instance by narrowing the Word window, but what I want is the same as I had with the old non-widescreen monitor: to open a document and find a single
 page, at 100%, and in the centre of the screen.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>In the thread of Aug 22nd, there is a link to an idiot's guide to macros, by Graham Mayor, which apparently will solve the problem. Unfortunately, I am not advanced enough to qualify as an idiot, and what I need is a complete
 moron's guide to creating a macro which will solve the problem so that all Word documents will open to a single page at 100% every time.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Is there such a guide? One that even I can follow? If not, is there any way of fixing things so that the document always opens with the Word window narrowed the way it was when the document was closed, so that again it
 opens to a single 100%, centred page?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>These are little problems in the greater scheme of things, but surprisingly annoying.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I'd appreciate any help, so thanks in advance.</span></strong></p>

<p>Start Word.</p>
<p>Press Alt+F11 to activate the Visual Basic Editor.</p>
<p>On the left hand side, you'll see an explorer-like treeview with two main items: Normal and something like Project (Document1).</p>
<p>Click on Normal.</p>
<p>Select Insert | Module (or press Alt+I, then M).</p>
<p>Copy the following macro from this post into the module window that appears:</p>
<p>Sub AutoOpen()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveWindow.ActivePane.View.Zoom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .PageColumns = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Percentage = 100<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>(this is based on Graham Mayor's code from the thread that you referred to)</p>
<p>Press Alt+F4 to close the Visual Basic Editor.</p>
<p>Now open a multi-page document to test whether the macro works.</p>
<p>When you quit Word, you may be asked whether you want to save changes to the Normal template. If so, answer Yes, so that the macro will be available in the future too.</p>

<p>Hello HansV. Thank you for the insructions. I was able to create the macro. After activating the visual basic editor, by the way, I was already in 'normal', so i was able to click immediately on 'insert'. The fix works perfectly with existing documents,
 so thanks for that.</p>
<p>With new documents, it does not seem to work. when i create a Word document i now get a single page at 10%. When i zoom it to 100% it stays a single page, but is at the side of the Word window.To get around this, I click on 'view', then on 'web layout',
 then back to 'print layout'. The page is then in the middle. the good news is that when i close the document, Word seems to remember the changes, because when i open it again, it opens on to a single page, at 100%, positioned in middle of window, not at the
 side. Still, it would be&nbsp;better&nbsp;if&nbsp;the&nbsp;workaround was unnecessary.</p>
<p>is there some way of fixing this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Laurencewithau</p>

<p>The macro provided runs every time you open an existing document (hence "AutoOpen"). You could create one for AutoNew, but that would only apply to documents based on the normal template.</p>
<p>However, you can easily run the macro at any time - press Alt+F8 to bring up a list of macros in your templates and documents and double click the AutoOpen one to run it "on demand".</p>

<p>
</p><p>well, you can't. The xlsm file is physically a different file, with a different file name. You can see that even in Windows Explorer, not just in SharePoint. &nbsp;The file extension is part of the unique file name and only unique file names are included in the
 version history in SharePoint.</p>

    <title>loosing contacts from my phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liviu p  say:</h3>
<h2>            loosing contacts from my phone</h2>
                    <p>I have lost all my contacts after the last update on my phone - win10 - lumia 650. They were deleted from the sync outlook too. I am left only with 10 contacts, the latest ones. I did the back-up (believing that it will store the data, silly me) but with
 no use. So little space storage for this kind of data but it looks like its gone. I have all the pictures though, and a new colour for the explorer bar, very important stuff for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did see that this was a problem in the past too for nokia/microsoft. Looks like it's coming back. Does anyone know how to get my contacts back? I have tried chat support but they seem not to understand the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe microsoft can make a downloadable data for the contacts too - like they do pictures - they are important nowdays (if you live in 2016). Or, should I start to write them down on paper. All this type of accounts, storage, syncing tiles (lots of them)
 for nothing. People have a lot of people in their adress book, and if you have a business it is like gold.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to disable USB 3.0 from the BIOS and then follow the steps below and see if it helps:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. On Boot, when you see the manufacturer's logo press
<strong>F8</strong> or <strong>Del</strong> key to enter <strong>BIOS.</strong></span></p>
<p>2. Navigate to <strong>Advanced settings</strong>, locate <strong>USB configuration
</strong>and disable<strong> USB 3 support.</strong></p>
<p>3. Save and exit. Your system will restart now, if keyboard and mouse aren‚Äôt working try plugging them in into different USB ports.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Go to the&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Expand<strong> Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.<br />
6. <strong>Right-click</strong> on every device under&nbsp;<strong>Universal Serial Bus controller‚Äôs</strong> node, and click
<strong>Uninstall.</strong><br />
7. Restart&nbsp;the system&nbsp;and allow the computer to reinstall the USB controllers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">8. Once all the USB Controllers are installed, connect the external hard drive again.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late response on this post.&nbsp; Hopefully you have been able to get your keyboard and mouse working.&nbsp; If you are still having problems with your ports, this might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are running into the issue where your USB Ports are not working and you have an ASUS system, try uninstalling the ‚ÄúAi Charge+‚Äù Utility. You can do this using either the ASUS AI Suite or Programs

            <p>Another empty inbox here. The symptoms are really weird. This is on a university branded older live.com account. Logging in on outlook.com I see a completely empty inbox, and trying to 'recover email' doesn't do anything. There is no 'welcome message' either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly, on my Windows Phone the account still shows old emails&nbsp;, and if I send new email to the account, it appears in the inbox on my phone just fine BUT: logging in via the web interface or via the Windows Mail app I don't see any mail at all. I'm 100%
 sure I'm logging into the same mail account in these three cases, yet only on the phone do I see the emails. What gives?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: more symptoms. If I send from the previously university branded account, the email arrives, but it shows as having been sent by
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;outlook_38a1234d55e7b7c7 at outlook.com on behalf of (my name).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the digits after outlook here, but that's the form of the address. Did some kind of account renaming go wrong here? I don't use the account a lot, but as mentioned, it still works on my phone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            PST Import Logs</h2>
                    <p><span>Good day Community,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have successfully imported emails and items for PST files into Exchange Online via the Data Import service found at protection.office.com. Based on the Import Results, there were a few items
 that were skipped due to corruption.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is there a way to have a log of the items skipped, specifying if there are either:</span></p>
<p><span>‚¶Å</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Emails with subject
 and date time information<br />
</span><span>‚¶Å</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Contacts
<br />
</span><span>‚¶Å</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Calendar items?</span></p>
<p><span>This could aid in the migration of missing items.</span></p>

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, the Import service will have the notification saying the "problem (ie, some skipped items) during the process. Otherwise, there is no the related log regarding the Import service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I understand it should be useful to have such a feature. I'd like to suggest you share your idea with our related team via&nbsp;<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273493-office-365-admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273493-office-365-admin</a>.
 Many products' services and features have been designed based on customers' valuable comments. Thanks</p>

<p><br />
I'm assuming that you are looking at available space on your device and have a concern that you may not have enough.&nbsp; If you connect your device and view how it is used then the "unknown" is that area called "other"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So "other" is basically a storage of data from a variety of sources (photos, music and video as well as reserved space for applications).&nbsp; Each application that writes (and stores data) has their own specific area to use so WP allocates space according to
 needs of the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Phone allocate storage dynamically, so if the phone is relatively empty, it will reserve a&nbsp;lot of space&nbsp; (as an example, IE and&nbsp;Maps would take space.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As&nbsp;you add more to your device it will release some of the reserved&nbsp;space back to the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty much if space is not being used, it will automatically take space and reserve it for use for what is there.&nbsp; If a new app is installed and it needs more space, the phone will allocate&nbsp;the space needed.</p>

<p><strong>Picture Hub</strong></p>
<p>- Photos and Videos you recorded with your camera.</p>
<p>- Online folders sync temporarily for you to see the photos on facebook/skydrive but will need to resync again when you go back to them after a few hours or days (I can't confirm this, but it most likely uses temporary storage from reserved storage)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Apps &amp; Games</strong></p>
<p>- Some apps are only 1mb while some games can be 200mb or bigger depending on how graphic intensive they are.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People Hub (stores contact info)</p>
<p>Maps / Nokia Maps (allows you to download offline maps)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Possible Solution:<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>-MANUAL DELETION-</strong></p>
<p>The best way to clean the storage of your phone is to save all the pictures and videos on you phone to your computer by using the Windows Phone App to sync pictures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then delete "pictures and videos" from&nbsp;Pictures&nbsp;Hub&nbsp;or uninstall "Games &amp; Apps" you don't need.</p>
<p>This is a somewhat tedius job but grants the highest success of you not deleting something you want.</p>
<p>Apps you can always re-install them, games also. </p>
<p>If your phone allows for external memory like Lumia 810 then you can increase storage on demand or swap memory cards.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-HARD RESET-</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone above also mentioned a hard reset. You can do that also... but you will delete everything and should only be used if you want to restore the phone to factory settings (aka brand new default set up)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helped and good luck! :)</p>

            I do not believe that is possible.&nbsp; You would need to have a subscription to Office 365 to be able to activate it on an iPad.

<h2>            Pictures in OneNote - Need zooming</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I already use OneNote to organize almost everything. Recently I'm in the need to take pictures of the feel papers I have in the office and take it with me in Android.</div>
<div>So I don't have to carry those documents, I just take pictures of it, and if the client asks something that is on that, I just access it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is that only taking pictures doesn't help. They need to be organized, named etc. That is what OneNote do best.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But Im facing a problem. The pictures inserted in OneNote cannot be zoomed. Its static, so I can't read anything. If I tap in the picture it gives me the option to access it in the gallery, but this option do not work. It says there is no picture. If I
 could access the picture from OneNote to the gallery would be great as the gallery gives me the option of zooming.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It this a known bug? Or a problem with my phone?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I manually access the gallery I can see the pictures there, but I need OneNote to take me there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
                </div>

            I dont see an option in OneNote to open gallery. As far as I have seen it seems to be the same problem on my Android as well.

<p>Does anything (dialog box, error message, stop watch, ...)&nbsp; show up on the desktop when<br />
you connect? Does anything show up on the Axim? Any noises? Any sign of something<br />
happening?</p>
<p>Can you start up Windows Mobild Device Center when the Axim is not connected?</p>
<p>I just tested with my Axim X50 (WM 2003SE) and Windows 7. My first attempts failed; WMDC<br />
did not even start up. I then started WMDC while my Axim was not connected, and still<br />
failed. Finally, I connected and disconnected WMDC, and <u>then</u> the Axim connected.</p>
<p>So, WMDC on Windows 7 can connect to an Axim x50. But maybe not so easily.</p>
