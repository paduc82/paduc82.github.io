                    This is not fair. We are using longtime but we didn't get any extra facility for 630. When windows 10 is available on this time it is not for 630. Why?? Have you any answer?? We want to that Windows 10 in the 630... please..

<p>I absolutely understand your dilemma and feel your pain but the real truth is that many older devices just cannot handle the new operating system effectively and will most likely cause more issues than provide a great experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It brings to mind an issue I had years ago with one of my pocket pcs that got an upgrade. As soon as I upgraded what was once a great pocket pc became effectively a brick. It was the most disappointing experience I ever had on a pocket pc but it was also
 a good experience in that I will never upgrade a primary device unless there is an easy&nbsp;way to revert back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although your device was launched in April 2014, in terms of age it is "old" for a mobile device. You and I don't think so but newer devices have more memory and better processors. It is not the answer you want but it just the way it is.</p>

    <title>Microsoft&#58; Why do we see unfinished features&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft&#58;  Why do we see unfinished features&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It may seem like an obvious question, but...&nbsp; I have been around software engineering for&nbsp;a LONG time, and there's a deeper meaning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases we see entries in the Modern UI for things like backup that are just stubs.&nbsp; There are completely non-functional dialogs. &nbsp; There&nbsp;are entries like zPC Settings.&nbsp; Even the Windows Update interface is only about 1/4 baked.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Professional software engineering does not expose features in the midst of development that do not yet come even close to working.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nor should they be exposed in this state!&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead you should be waiting until "feature complete" before making it available to the public.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's impossible for users to know the context of&nbsp;partially complete software in order to provide meaningful feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users - even seasoned software engineers not privy to inside info at Microsoft - can only perceive half-finished software as "<em><strong>Microsoft must think this is finished enough to show it off - so I need to complain that it doesn't work or that it
 just sucks</strong></em>".&nbsp; And frankly it DOES suck to walk into a menu and find out&nbsp;the functionality is&nbsp;just not there or is just broken - especially in light of the fact that you're already actively deleting the "legacy" features&nbsp;the new work is supposed
 to replace.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It's not hard to make sure the top level menu items just don't show if the feature is simply non-functional.</strong>&nbsp; Who benefits, exactly, by a Backup entry in the Settings App that does nothing at all?&nbsp; YOU know where it's going to go in.&nbsp; That's
 enough for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even your support engineers respond to questions about unfinished features as though they should be expected to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If I may be so bold, there are only a few reasons why we should be&nbsp;seeing your work unfinished in such a manner.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>...Your <strong>Marketing people are forcing for you to expose work in progress</strong>, so as to engage the public.&nbsp; This is a good idea at a high level, but it actually takes work and especially
<em>funding</em> to do properly.&nbsp; There is no way to just pop out internal builds to Joe User and hope for the best.&nbsp; User's don't know the context!&nbsp; You need an organization to&nbsp;approve and test what goes out,&nbsp;implying someone&nbsp;in charge of what the public sees.&nbsp;
 That needs to be someone's FULL TIME job, not just an afterthought.&nbsp; And that someone needs to have experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...Your software development management (and systems?) have gotten so <strong>
out of control </strong>that you can't actually predict what's going to be in a particular set of software until after it's built.&nbsp; This would be&nbsp;a nice&nbsp;way of saying "abandon all hope", because something as complex as Windows simply cannot be managed in a
 seat-of-the-pants fashion.&nbsp; You folks still DO care about things like quality procedures, ISO 9000, etc., right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>...You have <strong>de-funded or under-funded your software configuration management
</strong>organization to the point where they can't support&nbsp;the need to make clean builds available to the public, so you're trying to "wing it" by just sending out what your engineering folks do directly.&nbsp; Trust me, this isn't a good thing to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...<strong>You think these features actually ARE finished </strong>and think&nbsp;that somehow getting people to use&nbsp;software that doesn't really work is going to lead to good things.&nbsp; If this is the case, you're so disconnected from reality that you can never
 possibly succeed in creating an operating system people will want, and is frankly the scariest option of all of those here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have near 40 years experience in professional software engineering.&nbsp; What you're doing is not how it should be done.&nbsp;
<strong>You need to think about this.</strong></p>

            <p>I agree 100% going back to private beta testing.&nbsp; The Windows XP x64 forum(?) was more interesting with knowledgeable people participating that really knew what they were talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Windows 10 "exchange" is totally ludicrous with all the cry babies thinking Microsoft is at fault if a 3rd party application or utility doesn't work it's Microsoft causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least with people like Charlie Russel there were people in the forum that understood the software development process and didn't blame Microsoft for 3rd party incompatibility!&nbsp; I wish I could remember some more of the participants, but can't at the moment.</p>

            <p>It seems as if you didn't really read Noel's post - he didn't mention third party anything, yet that's the focus of your critique.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know the exact release date, but if it's less than 6 months from now, Microsoft has a lot of work to do in not much time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The stated reason for this unprecedented open beta "insider" program was for end users to give early feedback to
<strong>shape </strong>Windows 10, e.g. which features they wanted didn't want, liked, didn't like. &nbsp;Some will defend Windows 8 and 8.1 bu it is widely considered the worst windows release, in terms of UI and consumer acceptance. &nbsp;Even in closed beta, I'm sure
 there were some who considered Windows 8 a mistake, but I'm not sure if their voices were ignored, or they were afraid of not being on the metro bandwagon. &nbsp;I understand the pervasive cheerleader mentality when you are affiliated with an organization and psychologically
 have to drink the koolaid. &nbsp;Either Microsoft was surprised at the Windows 8 backlash, or they expected it. &nbsp;Either way, I don't think it was a good move. &nbsp;I still can't fathom why they didn't simply leave a start menu in desktop mode and 90% of the criticism
 would have not happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is not to say that there aren't useless whining posts in the forum - sure there are, but Microsoft could have mitigated that by providing more up-front information. &nbsp;I checked the links Andre posted and I could see that Chicago builds had "under construction"
 on many features. &nbsp;With Windows 10 we're left guessing which features are largely complete and ready for feedback on usability, and which ones are under construction so aren't even ready for feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ask someone to taste food I'm preparing, it's in the final phase of seasoning. &nbsp;Does it need more salt? &nbsp;I don't give them raw chicken and ask them to taste it, then when they say the chicken is undercooked I say "well it's not finished". &nbsp;You don't
 put out a public beta for tasting until the functionality is complete enough to be tasted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also don't just wholesale say "taste the meal I'm preparing" because different dishes are at different stages of preparation. &nbsp;There's a stage at which feedback on something is early enough to be actionable, but late enough to be valid. &nbsp;For many insiders,
 we don't know if our feedback is actionable or valid, since we don't know which features are either "locked" and we're wasting our time complaining about something that's not going to change, and which features are ready enough for critique but still being
 shaped and our feedback could inform the next build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Insider hub gives us some "tasks" to test with the OS, but really, is that all they want feedback on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Noel's points are valid. &nbsp;Grey out features that are incomplete - that will give the user a hint that it's not ready, but will be completed in a future build. &nbsp;Give some indication of which areas of windows are complete enough for us to pay attention
 to, otherwise we pay attention to everything, including the things that are already known to be in an "under construction" state.</p>

            It would appear that MS is taking the "open source" sorta route these days; they believe the future of their software profits will be in selling "connection subscriptions" for PC to Internet such as Live or TV access...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
By MS taking this route they are basically beginning to let the community hack it up for them to save costs, because lets face it you can only outsource to nimbwits for so long before you realize you don't actually have the best talent working for you lol so
 what do you do turn it over to the community and let them have at it let them find the flaws, bugs, etc rather than spend it in house as a testing expense...
<br />
Just my 2 cents on it...

            <p>Andre, I don't know if you'll be able to answer this, but I'll ask anyway.&nbsp; Regarding the Start menu, why would Microsoft give us something that most of us said we liked in prior TP builds, and then pull the rug out from us by sending a new, unfinished Start
 Menu in build 9926?&nbsp; That, in itself, has me questioning the whole purpose of the Insider Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it because there wasn't enough feedback praising the Start menu of previous builds?&nbsp; Or is it because that version was never intended to be the final version.&nbsp; If the latter is true, then why even bother creating it in the first place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all fairness, I do want to point out that there are some things that do work better in Build 9926, but they are all related to "Store" apps.&nbsp; For example, the Weather Channel app now remembers its window size and position, and scaling is much better.&nbsp;
 Trickshot Bowling by Goldenhammer Software would not play at all in previous builds, but finally works in 9926.&nbsp; Pinball FX2 previously would not work if the flippers were set to be operated by the Shift keys.&nbsp; Now the Shift keys work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only Microsoft had given us a build demonstrating the fixes to previous builds' issues&nbsp;without throwing in a revamped but unfinished Start menu, and a new Windows Update that&nbsp;they admit&nbsp;does not work as intended, the tone in the forums might be less pessimistic.</p>

            <p>This is a beta... that's why. Consider yourself someone who is working for MS to test their products before release or someone who might be developing with them. Don't think of yourself as a consumer at this stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wanna run win 10 at this stage, then be ready for anything. Use a computer you don't mind junking.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No, it's NOT beta.&nbsp; It's a "consumer preview".&nbsp; It's later than pre-design and&nbsp;it's not&nbsp;beta quality.&nbsp; That's precisely the point.&nbsp; Some above get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beta programs provide a level of access&nbsp;and understanding that exceeds what Microsoft is doing, even considering the "insider hub".&nbsp; Feedback programs actually have to take into account actual feedback to be viable.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's pretty clear&nbsp;there's not a majority
 of "rah rah we want more Metro/Modern" sentiment in the world, yet what are we seeing?&nbsp; Reimplementation (and not very good at that) of things that already worked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are not getting the kind of detailed <em>context </em>information beta testers get, because apparently Microsoft doesn't REALLY want to allow users to be in on the development.&nbsp; Nor do we have access to the Microsoft movers and shakers to discuss things
 with as a selected set of beta testers would have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not just testing Windows 10, I do beta testing for others as well.&nbsp; And I've
<em>led</em> beta tests of complicated products.&nbsp; As a career software engineer myself I'm more than ready, technically,&nbsp;for what Microsoft&nbsp;is doing&nbsp;here.&nbsp; This is not about technical things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Microsoft's&nbsp;doing&nbsp;is not <em>professional</em> at all - not befitting a serious operating system company, and
<strong>certainly not what's needed to bring Windows back onto the straight and narrow to where it can be a cornerstone of serious computing</strong>.&nbsp; What's left&nbsp;if these people botch Windows into oblivion?&nbsp; Unix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the future of computing as we know it depends on what Microsoft does it's too important to just say, "aw, I'll just wait and see what they come up with".&nbsp; Their track record is not good&nbsp;in that realm lately.&nbsp; It's almost past time to do better.&nbsp;
 Almost.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Many ask about getting a choice of this or that - and not what Microsoft try to force down our throats. Many believe Microsoft don't listen to them, that fact seem to be more and more clear due to the growing number of negative posts here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all work differently on computers, due to personal likes and due to what we work with. If the way Microsoft want to us to work doesn't suite us users they should listen to us. The keyword is CHOICE(S).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all it is the user that make part of Microsoft's future. If Microsoft doesn't listen to us users more people will be sacked from Microsoft in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do also agree with Noel Carboni about how unfinished features add to negative feedback from people testing Windows 10. They shouldn't be there at all until they at least work as good as possible.

</p><p>I agree with everything you said at the start of this thread, but this is not a CP in the way that win8 was released. I see this as Alpha, internal use only, but a decision was made to open this up, bad idea and not well thought out, and supported,&nbsp;as you

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on our forum.</p>
<p>Based on my test, there is only one option “Open in browser” when you open a pdf file on OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to edit the pdf file directly on OneDrive, you need to try the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Open the app “Adobe Acrobat”.</p>
<p>2. On the Home screen in Acrobat or Acrobat Reader, select Add Account in the left-hand pane.</p>
<p>3. Select OneDrive&gt;type the account to sign into.</p>
<p>4. The left-hand pane will add your OneDrive&gt;you can click it&gt;then directly edit the pdf file on there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Why don&#39;t appointments on Calendar show up in My Day&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using Outlook:Mac 2011. &nbsp;I have my weekly calendar filled with all my recurring events throughout the day, and I have a few tasks that I've created, but when I open the My Day window, it will show the tasks at the bottom, but the entire daily planner
 is blank. &nbsp;None of the appointments on my calendar are showing on My Day. &nbsp;How do I change that?

<p>In Word, you can show the recently used files under the File menu. If this is not on, then use Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>In Windows Explorer, use the Search feature, change the Look in: to My Computer, thenclick on Date, change the option to files last Accessed. If you modify the dates to a range that suits your requirements, you will list all files accessed on your PC.</p>

<p>My location: China mainland</p>
<p>I <strong>can</strong> receive mails but <strong>cannot</strong> send mails in Thunderbird Mail. It is not likely because of my settings, for I can send mails using VPN, but failed using my local network:<br />

<p>
</p><p>This forum is specifically meant to help with Outlook.com issues (as when people log on to Outlook.com through their internet browser to access their email).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you are using Thunderbird Mail, I recommend you looking into their forums if they have any, as they may be of better help in your particular case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2016 - Sorting emails by category in Ascending order with newest at the top - can this be done&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just upgraded to Office for Mac 2016. With Outlook 2011 I had my inbox sorted by category, in ascending order with the newest at the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With 2016 I can only sort by categories in ascending order. No where can I find where I can then apply the filter of newest at the top when sorted by category. Can this be done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I have found is if I sort by descending category, but then my inbox and categories are "upside down".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue has now been fixed and will be available in the 1908 monthly release channel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The advice in the meantime is to remain on your current working release.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once 1908 reaches Insiders Slow in early August then you can</span>&nbsp;plan to move forward again.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recognise that this issue with the TreeView control has impacted your ability to get work done and will work to ensure these breaks do not happen going forward.</span></p>

<h2>            Deleted Paragraph &#40;Grammerly&#41;</h2>
                    I accidently deleted a highlighted paragraph. I was using the add-in Grammarly, which does not allow Word to operate the 'undo' mode to restore text. I tried the Ctrl Z keys and that does not work either. Help me, where did the paragraph of text disappear
 to so that I can get it. Is it in the recycle trash?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Have you tried the support forums at the Grammarly website? MS does not support third party software products used with IE (so called Addons).....<br />
<br />
I would think that they would know their product better than us... at a guess, your paragraph has not been written to disk and is lost.... you could try updating to IE11 by running windows update, and using its improved spellchecking and word processing features...
 (uninstall those redundant addons also).... the vast majority of user browser problems are caused by Addons.... many of those features that old addons provided, are now built-in to the web browser... there is little need for addons, that have little utility
 with modern web browsers.<br />
<br />
Regards.</li></ol>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>It's probably gone, perhaps in a crash recovery.&nbsp; You can use Reliability Monitor to see if there was one when your "accident" occurred.&nbsp; Something similar happened to me recently.&nbsp; Unfortunately when IE "recovers" the web page anything that you were working
 on goes just as if you hadn't done anything there yet.&nbsp; We need to be more aware of the need to take responsibility for doing our own checkpointing.&nbsp; E.g.&nbsp;since I have been using a battery powered machine and been less concerned about the possibility of a
 power failure I have become less careful of thinking "what if something happened now which would make me have to start over?"&nbsp; A problem is that there are still things that can happen that way so if I reach a point where I am driving myself crazy asking that
 question I still do a Ctrl-a Ctrl-c and Paste into an open Wordpad window to ease that anxiety.</p>

<h2>            Help&#33; i Can&#39;t Sign In to my outlook email</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I has been trying to sign in to my live.com email many time but it shows me this:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 1)">
snt150.mail.live.com normally uses encryption to protect your information. When Chrome tried to connect to snt150.mail.live.com this time, the website sent back unusual and incorrect credentials. Either an attacker is trying to pretend to be snt150.mail.live.com,
 or a Wi-Fi sign-in screen has interrupted the connection. Your information is still secure because Chrome stopped the connection before any data was exchanged.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(105, 105, 105, 1)">
You cannot visit snt150.mail.live.com right now because the website&nbsp;uses HSTS. Network errors and attacks are usually temporary, so this page will probably work later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have clear all my history and try to sign in both from Firefox and Google chrome but not successful.</p>
<p>I'm using windows 8 at the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            The new outlook.com calendar broke my appointments</h2>
                    After the update, the new outlook.com calendar messed up my appointments.<br />
Most (but not all) of my appointments are now suddenly off by one day! <br />
<br />
I distinctly remember setting an appointment few weeks ago which takes place from 1. Sep. 2013 till 12. Sep. 2013. Now this appointment is displayed as taking place from 31. Aug. till 11. Sep.
<br />
<br />
Another appointment which originally was to take place on the 4. Nov. is now moved by outlook to the 3. Nov. There are more examples too...<br />
<br />
WTF???<br />
<br />
Why is outlook breaking my appointments???<br />
<br />
I can not trust outlook with something as simple as setting a date!!!<br />

            Hi Ronaldo,<br />
<br />
nope, the Time zone is <u><b>not</b></u> the culprit. The time zone is (and always was) set correctly on all my devices, including Hotmail and Outlook.com.
<br />
<br />
I was using Hotmail for two years now — I would have noticed a wrong time zone long, long time ago. Likewise, my Android device is (and always was) set to the correct time zone — otherwise I wouldn't have been able to meet any of my appointments in the past
 two years.<br />
<br />
All my events were created on the website (Hotmail.com / Outlook.com). I do not use my Android device for creating appointments — I use it only for displaying them.<br />
<br />
All events were correct on the Hotmail site — it was the transition to outlook.com that broke the majority of them.<br />
<br />
Clearly the outlook.com calendar is broken in some subtle way!<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.: (Besides, a wrong time zone would have given me only one or two hours difference — not a whole day!)<br />
<br />
