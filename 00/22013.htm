</p><p><strong>Should I upgrade my existing version of Windows to Windows 10?</strong></p>
<span><span>
<span><span>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do choose to upgrade your existing version of Windows to Windows 10, please be warned, it will make your recovery partition in operable, requiring that you have separate recovery media for reinstallation if necessary.</p>

We’re working on bringing upgrade to low capacity devices
</p><p>The reason Windows 8.1 devices using WIMBOOT are not yet able to upgrade to Windows 10 is because many of the WIMBOOT devices have very limited system storage. That presents a challenge when we need to have the Windows 8.1 OS, the downloaded install image,
 and the Windows 10 OS available during the upgrade process. We do this because we need to be able to restore the machine back to Windows 8.1 if anything unexpected happens during the upgrade, such as power loss. In sum, WIMBOOT devices present a capacity challenge
 to the upgrade process and we are evaluating a couple of options for a safe and reliable upgrade path for those devices.</p>

                    Hi<br />
i'm currently having issues with my nokia n82.<br />
when i put in the charger, it doesn't seem to charge my phone.<br />
It says "charging", but it doesn't really charge. The battery bar just stays the same.<br />
<br />
and my warranty just expired...<br />
<br />
has anyone else experienced the same problem???<br />
<br />
is there a way to fix it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks!

<h2>            Is this the reward for being &#34;Early Adopter&#34;&#63; My &#36;250 Band 2, now &#36;179&#33;</h2>
                    So four months ago, I see Microsoft Band 2 is a good product, and enthusiastically buy it. 60 days later they cut the price by $50, and now by $75. Sometimes when a company does that, they don't want the customer feel as if they were ripped off or even
 deceived, and will give a <strong>smal</strong><strong>l</strong> compensatory gift or token of appreciation to the early adopter.&nbsp;

            <p>When the first rebate appeared, I had my Band for 2 weeks. I called to get the price difference refunded, which they gladly did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several months, I understand that this is possible and there's nothing we can do about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I agree with you, Microsoft should consider a new way to do things with their early adopters. For example, substantial rebates when you pre-order. This way, we wouldn't feel like idiots for supporting their product launches and then notice these important
 rebates.</p>

            <p>Yes almost all products lower their prices over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my point was the rapidity of the price change. Microsoft reacted to sales lower than projected, then recapitulated and decided they were pricing themselves out of the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the <strong>Nike+Fuel</strong>&nbsp;(below) maintained its asking price for eight months, compared to Microsoft Band's six weeks. The similarly priced &nbsp;<strong>Fitbit Surge</strong>&nbsp;(bottom) was able to maintain its price point for a
<em>year and a half!</em>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There is no facility in Word to Automatically Save a document.&nbsp; It is something that you must do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the event of a system crash, there is a chance that the auto-recover feature may have saved a copy of your document, particularly if you had previously saved it.</p>

                    <p>I am trying to copy a pivot table result into another worksheet and unlink it from the source.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried this with no success:</p>
<ol>
<li>Display the Office Clipboard. In Excel 2007 and 2010, click the dialog box launcher icon in the bottom right corner of the Home - Clipboard group.
</li><li>With the unlinked pivot selected, click the item on the Office Clipboard that corresponds to the pivot table copy operation. It will be the last item, unless you copied something else.</li></ol>
<p>When I do item 2, I see nothing changing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What am I missing?&nbsp; </p>

<p><em>Edited to add the following:</em></p>
<p>I even programmatically checked the Interior.Colorindex of the cells that are shaded and it's showing no shading.&nbsp; I'm thinking that there is a CF somehow on the pivot table fields that I can't see.&nbsp;

                    <p>From time to time I have noticed that outlook inserts an additional row into my email signature. this row is related to a URL that I have in my signature. I do not see it when I send the message but I see it in my original message in a reply that&nbsp;I receive.
 it does not happen every time, in fact it's very occasional. The email signature I've created looks like this:</p>

                    I used to be able to play this game on IE9 all the time. &nbsp;Now it is very slow and sluggish. &nbsp;It has been going on for about a month now. &nbsp;I have cleaned my history etc. &nbsp;I find I am having to use Google Chrome. &nbsp;I would prefer to use IE9.

</p><p>This issue about images which were saved as ".thumb" may be software related. Let's sort this out, let's perform a

<h2>            Granting LimitedDetails to a Group Calendar</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!&nbsp; I have seen quite a few posts that seem to touch on this topic, but have not found a clear answer.&nbsp; We have created a group calendar, and by default all users have AvalabilityOnly access.&nbsp; We would like this to instead be LimitedDetails so our
 users can view the details of appointments on the calendar.&nbsp; This worked about a year ago, and suddenly stopped working.&nbsp; I've tried using Set-MailboxFolderPermission, but it does not seem to work on Group mailboxes.&nbsp; I've also reviewed the settings available
 via the Office 365 administrative portal as well as the Exchange Admin portal and have not seen anything that would allow me to change these settings.&nbsp; In addition, I've added myself as an owner of the group, but this does not seem to make a difference.&nbsp; Here
 is some data from our system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Output of Get-MailboxFolderPermission:</p>

<p>Hi Bobby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your time is appreciated. And sorry for my misunderstanding. By default, group members can view or edit the group calendar. For your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Schedule-a-meeting-on-a-group-calendar-in-Outlook-0cf1ad68-1034-4306-b367-d75e9818376a#Outlook=Outlook_2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Schedule-a-meeting-on-a-group-calendar-in-Outlook-0cf1ad68-1034-4306-b367-d75e9818376a#Outlook=Outlook_2016</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And it is impossible to change it. As a workaround for your request, it is suggested to create a shared mailbox. Then you can try to create security groups and assign the shared mailbox permission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are welcome to submit feature request in Office 365 UserVoice:</p>
<p><a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office365.uservoice.com/</a></p>

</p><p>Thank you for your understanding.&nbsp;</p>

            That is the whole point of a Pivot table. It groups "values" by the row and column so you can count them or sum them etc. If there is no calculation to be performed on a value then why are you using a Pivot table ?
<div>If your Pivot Table is valid then there must be more than 1 value to display on the row / column intersection so how would it know which value to display ?</div>

I have a list of entries (kind of a small datebase) about training events.</p>
<p>To simplify, the fields are Event name, topic, start date, end date. trainer, location and budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to make a pivot table where&nbsp;rows are events/topics, columns - months (grouping of a start date), and the interception gives the location or the trainer.</p>
<p>The pivot works well with budgets, but when I want a name or location on interception of row and column, I cannot get it.</p>
<p>Is there a way around?</p>
<p>Report from Access?</p>

<p>Danida - How did this get removed? This is core functionality of a global communication program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know, the globe? That big round thing that goes around the sun once every 365ish days and rotates on its axis every "roughly" 24 hours?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you ever noticed that there's a big ball of hot light in the sky for part of the day? And for another part of the day, the sky is dark and has little dots on it? You may be surprised to know that people in other parts of this globe thing might be looking
 at the sky and it doesn't have little dots, but it's actually got a big ball of hot light when you are looking at little dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's amazing how that happens. However, most people understand how this works and it's not a big surprise to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when you make a program to communicate between people on different parts of this globe thing, the first thing you need to consider is "who", the SECOND thing you need to consider is "WHEN".</p>
<p>
</p><p>People who live or work overseas often need to stay connected to people around the world. People in business often need to stay connected to people around the world. I fit both of those categories and I *CONSTANTLY* get calls and messages at all hours of
 the night on my Skype. I leave my skype on 24/7 in case of emergencies. But what I have been getting on a regular basis since this function was removed from Skype is calls that are definitely not emergencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How exactly does the Microsoft/Skype dev team not understand this? What possible justification could they have to remove this core functionality? Have they converted to Flat Earth? Do they simply feel that everyone should live on the US clock? Or do they
 get some sort of perverse joy out of knowing that they are causing people to get woken up in the middle of the night on a regular basis because *most* users simply don't think about where the other person is?</p>

<p>Problem is that Microsoft has probably outsourced maintenance outside of the USA.</p>
<p>My experience when that happens is that the people who take over do the absolute minimum necessary, so it's easier for them to remove a function, as essential as it might be, than to fix it properly - that takes too much time and reduces their income.</p>

            Please explain how having the time displayed is an invasion of privacy? That seems to not be a valid issue. Have you ever sent an email? It is time stamped. Can we have the feature back please?

            Danida. Skype is an opt-in service with TOS that must be agreed to. There is no concern with privacy.<br />
<br />
In fact, there are THREE tiers of opt-in. There is opt-in for end users as well as an opt-in for people who agree to become friends and there is an opt-out with the privacy options.<br />
<br />
This is an unacceptable excuse.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On the other hand, in the *many* years that I have used Skype before this feature was removed, I was called in the "middle of the night" (which I define as between the hours of 11:30pm and 6:30am) on two occasions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since this feature has been removed, I have been called in the middle of the night on no less than 30 occasions. All but one of those was a result of a time zone misreading. Yeah, just a few months. And I even made this mistake myself twice because I did a
 quick guess on the time zone and thought it was around 10pm, but it was actually just after 12pm... (I was 1 hour off with my head math+ DST)<br />
<br />
That's because I am a "global" sort of person, with family and friends on the other side of the globe, as well as clients and colleagues around the globe. Because I must be available for emergencies, my line is open 24/7. But now my actual time zone is not
 visible to others. So they just call without thinking.

<p>Another thing you could try, and once again, I cannot guarantee it will work, is to change the country associated with your Live account. Personally I think your IP address is causing the server to block certain apps. Could try using a proxy I suppose.&nbsp;</p>
