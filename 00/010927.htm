            <p>I'm using a different Internet connection from back then, but this one shouldn't be all that much better.&nbsp; And it also seems to have problems since the telephone wire it's connected through has joints in it (it's not a single, whole piece of wire), and the
 modem might also have problems.&nbsp; Even though the main wire is fiber optic, it's still not as fast as it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had McAfee on this PC before, but I've already removed it.&nbsp; And this is the first time I'm seeing this problem, so could it really be because of remnants of McAfee still being in my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is the same as the one from when I asked about the newer upgrades of Windows 8.1, yes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows Defender doesn't have any problems as far as real-time protection is concerned, though.&nbsp; It's all fine in that area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what could the reason be for definition updates failing?&nbsp; Connection problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got Error Code 0x80004004 on definition updates, even though they still seem to install when the dialog box is still open and I haven't closed it yet.</p>

            <p><em>Don't worry, it's Windows 8.1 64bit</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. About 3 or 4 years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. The computer came preinstalled with Windows 8, but I ran through some problems after upgrading to 8.1 the first time and I had to go back to Windows 8, but then it became Windows 8 Single Language so now I'm using Windows 8.1 Single Language. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. The Single Language one was installed a few days or weeks after 8.1 upgrade came out, although I'm not all that sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Yes, I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1e. It's connected wirelessly.&nbsp; It's a wireless modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1f. No, it's not a metered connection.&nbsp; Normal connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It's Definition version 1.199.2337.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. It should only have McAfee remnants, if even those.&nbsp; And I don't think there's a third-party Fire-Wall since I'm only using Defender's one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If I recall correctly, yes, I think I may have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Yes, this PC came with McAfee installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6a. All three are listed there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6b. Again, all three are listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6c. If you're talking about the recommended setting for Windows Update, then yes, that's what I've got it set to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. It's IE Update version 11.0.20 and KB3058515.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b. I've got both Chrome and Firefox installed.&nbsp; Is that a bad thing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Yes, I have that version of Flash for IE installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Sort of, but I rarely use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got Error Code 0x80004004 on Windows Defender now; I can only seem to download Definition updates for Defender when the dialog box talking about the error is still open, but as soon as I close the window the update fails.&nbsp; What's with that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Real-time protection on Defender seems to be working perfectly, though.&nbsp; And the Firewall is, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Stephen: I already did a scan using Malwarebytes Antimalware before.&nbsp; And I tried downloading that large file of Definitions, but it kept taking me to my browser with a "502 Bad Gateway" error message.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now, I saw that Defender is up to date, but when I tried clicking on Update just to be sure, I get that error message pop up again.&nbsp; The same thing is happening.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I also can't install optional updates with Windows Update all of a sudden. &nbsp;Error Code 80244021</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Windows Update Troubleshooter, the "service registration is missing or corrupt".&nbsp; I don't know what that's about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the file mpas-feX64 but I can't open it.&nbsp; Is there a way to troubleshoot this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
I tried to do an Elevated activation of Defender while running it with Admin privileges, but it didn't work, and I get an error message saying "Class not registered" - Error Code 0x80040514.</p>

            <p>I did run the Removal Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember the exact date.&nbsp; Should be somewhere around the midway point of those 3 or 4 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really remember that well if I ever did run it after reverting back to Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I've used a registry cleaner on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also need help with Windows Defender error code 80040154, by the way; I tried doing an Elevated activation while running Defender with Admin privileges, but then it gave me that error code, with the message "Class not registered".&nbsp; If I need to register
 it, then how do I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I have still problems with Windows Update, how do I fix them?&nbsp; I've already used the Windows Update troubleshooter a few times, and have also tried using Fix It.&nbsp; I also unchecked the option for receiving recommended updates the same way I receive
 important updates, with the option for "never checking for updates" selected, after which I manually installed some updates, and I was also able to download and install a Windows Defender definition update via Windows Update.&nbsp; I've got the option for automatically
 checking for and downloading updates selected now, by the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did remove a McAfee program from my PC today, using CCleaner I believe.&nbsp; I also used some other programs to try to clean stuff, so maybe it was one of those that did it.&nbsp; But I did definitely remove a McAfee remnant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows Update window still says "Never" beside "Updates were installed: ".&nbsp; Is this also due to some serious error?</p>

    <title>How can an Manager edit draft e-mails that Assistant creates within - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can an Manager edit draft e-mails that Assistant creates within Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    I want the ability for a <b>Manager</b> to be able to open a draft e-mail that an
<b>Assistant</b> has created, then review, make changes, and save, before being sent by the
<b>Assistant</b>.<br />
<br />
Is there native ability to do this in Outlook?<br />
<br />
Note: I'm not sure Delegate or folder permission access would work here, because the manager is not sending on the Assistant's behalf, he/she is only review/editing, and the "sender"
<i>must</i> remain the Assistant, not the manager.<br />
<br />

                    The hyperlinks in the email in Outlook 2007 do not work.&nbsp; You get an error message "This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer.&nbsp; Please contact your system administrator."&nbsp; I am a personal user with administrator permissions.&nbsp;
 I have configured the Junk Mail options in Outlook 2007 to allow hyperlinks.&nbsp; I have used the MMC to try an update the group policy for users on this computer to allow the snap-in for web links.&nbsp; This is beyond my knowledge and experience and I do not want
 to go too far at the risk of doing some serious harm to my system.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />
<br />Take a look of the below link to contact Support so they can guide you: 
<br />
<br />By chat: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/</a>

<br />
<br />However, I would suggest to check if you complete this steps in Gmail before configure your outlook profile for Gmail account:
<br />Log in to Gmail.
<br />Click the gear in the top right.
<br />Click Settings.
<br />Click the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab.
<br />In the IMAP Access section, select Enable IMAP.
<br />Click Save Changes.
<br />Go to www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps. Select the option to Turn on access for less secure apps.
<br />
<br />
<br /> Finally check the Outlook configuration:
<br />
<br />Set up IMAP
<br />Step 1: Check that IMAP is turned on
<br />On your computer, open Gmail.
<br />In the top right, click Settings Settings.
<br />Click Settings.
<br />Click the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab.
<br />In the "IMAP access" section, select Enable IMAP.
<br />Click Save Changes.
<br />Step 2: Change SMTP &amp; other settings in your email client
<br />Use the table below to update your client with the correct information. For help updating your settings, search your email client's Help Center for instructions on setting up IMAP.
<br />
<br />Incoming Mail (IMAP) Server	
<br />imap.gmail.com
<br />
<br />Requires SSL: Yes
<br />

<br />
<br />Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server

<h2>            Outlook autocorrect smiley emoticon broken</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I type :-) in outlook, instead of getting the smiley autocorrect I get a plan asci box. Looks like something corrupted.</p>
<p>I've gone into Autocorrect and see the box in there. I can't seem to find a way to fix it. I've also reset my fonts in Control Panel in case it was that. Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Subform Error</h2>
                    <p>I have a main form and 5 subforms in an Access 2016 database; all are pointing to the same table.&nbsp; When I enter a record, it saves the information on the main form just fine, but when I try to enter anything in a subform, it gives me the error message that
 says (see pic attached).<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f3a820d-52f7-4881-b298-cd61cce70f88?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f3a820d-52f7-4881-b298-cd61cce70f88?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only one table and it has an autonumber primary key.&nbsp; There are no relationships, since there is only one table.&nbsp; I've checked every field and all of them have the index set to "no".&nbsp; If I close the form at this point in time (with the warning that
 it will not save the record), and then re-open it and start entering data in the subforms, it works fine.&nbsp; ????&nbsp; Thanks everyone for your brilliant solutions to this mystery.<br />

<p>Just curious - why would have have 5 subforms sourced from the SAME table?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you set the Master/Child link fields on those subforms? If so, then you may need to remove those links and manage the data fills yourself.

<p>It's complicated (I'm doing this as a volunteer for a nonprofit so I only have so much say-so in how it is done).&nbsp; AND, I have to stay within my knowledge-base, which is pretty limited.&nbsp; Basically, there are 180 fields that need to be displayed in a very
 simple layout, so 5 tabs was the answer.&nbsp; I know having 180 fields in one table is not the "right" way to do this but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the&nbsp;<span>Master/Child link fields set on those subforms but if I take them out, the data doesn't link up correctly.&nbsp; I've never used subforms like this before so I don't know too much about them, but how would
 I "manage the data fills" myself?&nbsp; Thanks very much for your time.</span></p>

<p>180 Fields in a single table? I'd suggest you normalize your database structure before you do anything else. I've seen tables with 30 and 40 fields, and those were pushing the limits. 180 fields is most definitely a severe case of "spreadsheet-itis". :)</p>
<p>

            For inserting data into a single table you need not have any subforms at all.&nbsp; You can simply bind a form to the table and place logical groups of controls bound to the columns in the table on separate pages of a tab control.&nbsp; Data which you need to be
 permanently visible can be shown in bound controls above and/or below the tab control.<br />
<br />
However, as Scott has pointed out, and as has been made clear to you in your other current thread, a single table is a bad design.&nbsp; It will inevitably mean that there is major redundancy in the database.&nbsp; This not only makes data entry much more difficult and
 time-consuming for users, but more importantly, it introduces a high risk of update anomalies which prejudice the integrity of the data.&nbsp; The database will consequently be unreliable as an effective business tool, and cannot be regarded as fit for purpose.<br />
<br />
I would very strongly recommend that you draw this to the attention of the organisation in question.&nbsp; The user-friendly interface which they desire can be achieved in the context of a correctly normalised database comprising multiple related tables, each of
 which models a valid real world entity type, and whose columns represent valid attributes of the entity type.&nbsp; This underlying model should be of no concern to the users, and not exposed to them in the operation of the database.<br />
<br />
You might like to take a look at DatabaseBasics.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
As its name suggests, this file provides an introduction to some of the basic principles and methodologies of relational database design.&nbsp; You might also care to look at Normalization.zip in the same OneDrive folder.&nbsp; This is as simple as possible (but no more
 so) introduction to the process of formal normalization, an undertanding of which to at least Third Normal Form is essential to anyone designing a relational database.<br />

            The reason I went to subforms was a silly one, but one that was important to this group.&nbsp; I've researched around and can't find a way to put a background color on the tabs on a form - and the white was very difficult for them to see.&nbsp; Someone suggested
 subforms, so there I went.&nbsp; Thank you so much for your response and the terrific link to your files.&nbsp; I have downloaded the sample database and will work through it to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>You can always put a Box control onto your form, and set the Background color of that box as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the first thing to do is get your structure in order. Once you do that, you'll find most other things are much easier to achieve.</p>

            If you set the BackStyle property of the tab control to Transparent, the background colour of the form's detail section, or even a form's background picture if you use one, will show through the tab control.&nbsp; If you want the tab control to be a different
 colour to that of the detail section in which it is placed, then underlay it with a box as Scott suggests.<br />
<br />
But these sort of cosmetic details are the least of your problems.&nbsp; You really should be addressing the major problem with the fundamental structure of the database.<br />

<h2>            Java SDK Bug</h2>
                    This occurs in the Java SDK version 11.5.4<br />
<br />
When calling the following method (with all the correct parameters):<br />
<br />
setAdExtensionsAssociations<br />
<br />
I get the following error:<br />
<br />
Error in deserializing body of request message for operation 'AddAdExtensions'. OperationFormatter encountered an invalid Message body. Expected to find node type 'Element' with name 'AddAdExtensionsRequest' and namespace 'https://bingads.microsoft.com/CampaignManagement/v11'.
 Found node type 'Element' with name 'ns2:SetAdExtensionsAssociationsRequest' and namespace 'https://bingads.microsoft.com/CampaignManagement/v11'<br />
<br />
It appears that the method is internally invoking "AddAdExtension" operation instead of the "SetAdExtensionsAssociations" operation, which the method is trying to perform.&nbsp;

<h2>            30 GB Bandwidth Over In 20 Days&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Since a few months now, our internet bandwidth plan for 30GB on-peak + 30GB on off-peak has been finishing around the 20th of each month. We have four devices, including a Win10 Insider Preview laptop, a Linux laptop with Ubuntu, a Windows Vista laptop
 and Nexus 9 Tablet running Android. We do not know the cause of the problem or which device is eating the internet. Auto Updates are off, Metered Connection is on (for applicable devices) etc. Please help me find the cause as Internet gets eaten really fast
 and its costing a lot, like <strong>5GB gets over in two days</strong>! We NEVER watch any videos either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a><br />
(Also holds good for Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>

            60 GB in 20 days is nothing. 5 GB in 2 days is nothing. Anyway make sure the tablet has auto updates off. Perhaps update it when you are elsewhere with it that has wi-fi. Also disable background data on it.

<h2>            This OutlookSession not automatically active</h2>
                    I am using Microsoft Outlook 2010. To have an automatic BCC for all outgoing e-mail, I use a visual basic code in the module "ThisOutlookSession", which works fine. However, everytime Outlook is started, this module is somehow not activated: No BCC is
 added to outgoing e-mails, until I one times go to the Developer Tab and push on the "Visual Basic" button, i.e. open the Visual Basic Editor. Afterwards I can close it again, and from then on everything will work until the next restart. What can I do to make
 it automatically work from the beginning?

<h2>            Duplicate hotmail account&#63; weird.</h2>
                    <p>I had the weirdest thing happen today.<br />
I created a hotmail account for my neighborhood's local crime watch group, and it set up perfectly.&nbsp; I considered setting up a facebook page as well, but when I did it said that the name of my email
<strong><em>account already belonged to another person</em></strong>, and that person
<strong><em>already had set up a facebook account with that email</em></strong> address<br />
&nbsp;I am inside the inbox now of the email address I set up, and it is definitely clean, and there is not email from anyone else, and it says I created the account yesterday which I did.<br />
<br />
How is it possible that someone using an email account I just set up, could have a facebook account with my new email address?</p>
Baffled,<br />

            <p>There are multiple ways this could have happened.&nbsp; One is that they could have been the owner of that address at one time but allowed it to lapse or deleted it without changing their Facebook information.&nbsp; Later on, you requested the account and since it
 wasn't taken, you got it.&nbsp; If that person ever forgets the Facebook password and tries to use the address to recover, you'll get the messages from Facebook and you'll be able to take over their Facebook account if you're so inclined.&nbsp; In my opinion, this is
 exactly why mail providers should never allow addresses to be reused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way is that they made a mistake when creating the Facebook account and accidentally used an address they don't own.&nbsp; Perhaps they thought their address is

<strong>abc.def@outlook.com</strong>. They entered the first value when they should have used the second.&nbsp; Then along you come and get an account that looks like the first.&nbsp; Since that account wasn't in use, there was
 no problem on the Outlook.com side.</p>

<h2>            Single Tenant, Multi domains, Multi Forest, Single ADFS</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have two AD&nbsp;forest A.lan and B.lan&nbsp;and Exchange 2010 (hybrid) resources forest C.lan. In AD&nbsp;forest A.lan we have (ADFS/Proxy, Azure AD Connect). Their is a non-transitive trust between&nbsp;AD&nbsp;forest A.lan and B.lan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Exchange information from AD&nbsp;forest C.lan are synchronized with MIM to Forest A.lan&nbsp;then all users are synchronized to Office 365 with UPN departement1.com or departement2.com federated with ADFS in AD forest A.lan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All users in forest A.lan with Oulook 2013 or 2016 (with modern authentication enable) authenticate to Office 365.
</p>
<p>ADFS authentication is working fine for those users.</p>
<p>Users in AD&nbsp;forest A.lan or B.lan are using the same&nbsp;departement1.com or departement2.com domains as EmailAddress.</p>
<p>But in Forest B.lan&nbsp;we cannot authenticate user with Outlook 2013 or 2016 or even with Office.com with the federated domains departement1.com or departement2.com even if we change UPN in AD forest B.lan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the user is redirected to ADFS with we have signin error : Requested realm object 'http://b.lan/adfs7services/trust/' does not exist or that the NHukyUyd/EaeH9+uWDKcgQ== (ImmutableID ?) need to be added to the directory {GUID}.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Do we need to have two ADFS farms and different federated domains for each ?</p>
<p>2 - Do we need to synchronize user from their respective AD forest&nbsp;A.lan and B.lan with Azure AD Connect to Office 365 as multi forest ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 - Does ADFS Farm from AD forest A.lan could authenticate users from AD forest B.lan for Office 365 with the federated domains departement1.com or departement2.com or we really need two ADFS farms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for helping.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi Livio Jeangoudoux,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><em>Question 1 - Do we need to have two ADFS farms and different federated domains for each?</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some admins will use one ADFS farms. However, based on my knowledge, you can also use two ADFS farms. It is depending on your requirements.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><em>Question 2 - Do we need to synchronize user from their respective AD forest A.lan and B.lan with Azure AD Connect to Office 365 as multi forest?
</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you use one ADFS farms, the answer is yes. You need to sync them to Office 365 as multiple forests.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><em>Question 3 - Does ADFS Farm from AD forest A.lan could authenticate users from AD forest B.lan for Office 365 with the federated domains departement1.com or departement2.com or we really need two ADFS
 farms.</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>No, you can only have one ADFS farm.
<span>However, forest&nbsp;trusts exist between the forests this will work. Meantime, each forest much have unique UPN login suffixes for this scenario.</span> If no trusts exist between the forests than multiple ADFS farms are required.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>

If you search for "Arabic", you will find the explanations.

            In order to select multiple objects each one needs to have some form of Text Wrapping applied. IOW, if an object is formatted as In Line with Text it cannot be included in a multiple selection. That further implies that In Line objects cannot be Grouped
 with other objects or with one another.<br />
<br />
See <b>Word Help</b> on the subject: <i>Move, rotate, or group objects</i>, particularly the
<b>Note</b> @ the end of the <i>Group objects</i> topic.<br />

    <title>New LG and Samsung phones - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New LG and Samsung phones</h2>
                    Hello, I had Samsung Windows mobile 6.1 phones and recently upgrade to two new phones. I want to save some money on my monthly cell phone bills, so I did not get PDA/Smartphones. Which AT&amp;T charges $30 per phone per month.<br />
<br />
Long story short, does the my phone service work on non Windows mobile phones. We purchased the LG Xenon (GR500) and the Samsung Impression&nbsp;(SGH-A877.) These phones are almost as good as smart phones, fast Internet and email but don't have Windows Mobile. The
 unlimited data plan is only $10.00 per month per phone and it's faster then my older Samsung BlackJack II.<br />
<br />
Thank you Paul

            Is there a # I can call ? I've been at this for about 4 hrs and I am being sent in the same circles for the whole time. All I want to do is install my Office program on my new hard drive. This seems like a simple request for the #1 software company in

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook app on iPad</h2>
                    <p>I use the Microsoft Outlook app on my iPad and iPhone. &nbsp;My e-mail account is a Microsoft Exchange account which connects to my office server. &nbsp;When I reply to or forward e-mails on my Apple devices, the prior e-mail chain repeats itself one or more times
 in my reply or forwarded e-mail. &nbsp;I do not have the problem on my HP laptop. &nbsp;Only when using the Outlook app on my iPad and iPhone. &nbsp;I have tried manually deleting the additional text before I press send, but the problem persists. &nbsp;I also tried contacting
 Microsoft support, but they were not very helpful. &nbsp;Any ideas or suggestions would be most welcome. &nbsp;Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi WILLIAM T. FREYVOGEL,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand based on your description, emails you sent from Outlook for iOS get duplicated when you reply or forward to others, right? In this situation, I suggest you first re-install the Outlook app on your iPad and check if the
 issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please make sure that your email address is not listed in the To/CC/Bcc field when you reply or forward the email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, to better help you, we recommend you to contact our dedicated Outlook for iOS in-app support team to get targeted help:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-in-app-help-for-outlook-for-ios-and-android-218a22d1-9fa5-4889-b689-de1c63493243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-in-app-help-for-outlook-for-ios-and-android-218a22d1-9fa5-4889-b689-de1c63493243</a></p>

            I did all of the things which you suggested, but nothing worked. &nbsp;After I deleted and reloaded the Outlook app, it did not recognize my old login credentials. &nbsp;I am locked out of my Outlook account. &nbsp;Now, I can’t get access to any of my Outlook e-mails.
 &nbsp;Any suggestions?

<p>Hi WILLIAM T. FREYVOGEL,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this situation, I suggest you check if you can successfully sign into Outlook Web app with the same account. If so, you can follow the steps below to remove the saved Outlook password on iPhone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to iPhone Settings &gt; Passwords &amp; Accounts &gt; Website &amp; App passwords &gt; remove the Passwords related to Outlook</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook Script Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jlo1965  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Script Error</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I started getting the following error when I run Outlook:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eecc1c71-2b11-45b6-b62d-8d08f2b9af93" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until yesterday, I had maintained a different volume on my hard drive for all of my data files (including my .pst files).&nbsp; As I have been utilizing more of Win 8.1's features, I no longer saw the need to have a different volume and moved all of my data
 back to the c: drive.&nbsp; When I opened Outlook, I received a message that it could not locate my Outlook file and asked me to choose another.&nbsp; I selected the file at the new location, it then opened up but now I am receiving the above error.&nbsp; Any help would
 be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

    <title>error message when opening and when closing excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juant333  say:</h3>
<h2>            error message when opening and when closing excel</h2>
                    
<p>I am getting the error message:</p>
<p>compile error in hidden module: DistMon</p>
<p>every time I open excel and every time I close excel.</p>
<p>The only thing I did recently was install Adobe Acrobat Professional 9.</p>
<p>How can I get rid of the annoying message?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The cause of this error is Adobe's&nbsp;<strong>PDFMaker.xla</strong>, which loads at startup from the
<strong>XLSTART</strong> folder. This is an add-on that add the Adobe toolbar in Excel upon startup.</p>
<p>The easiest solution is to close all instances of Excel and&nbsp;delete <strong>PDFMaker.xla</strong> from your computer. Typically, PDFMaker.xla is stored in your profile directory:</p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\PDFMaker.xla</p>
<p>In other scenarios, <strong>PDFMaker.xla</strong>&nbsp;could be&nbsp;stored in your Program Files directory. Be suree to search your C: drive for any and all instances of the file.</p>
<p>After you deleted the file <strong>PDFMaker.xla</strong>, the error "<strong>Compile Error in Hidden Module: Distmon</strong>" when starting Excel shouldn’t appear.</p>
