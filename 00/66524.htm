    <title>Windows 10 Flickering screen, windows acting aggressive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjoerdschelvis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Flickering screen, windows acting aggressive</h2>
                    <p>Oke this is starting to get really, really annoying. And all the windows 10 "smart" features are not helping at all...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an IT guy and know a lot about computers. I was called by a friend who needed help with his PC. He got a flickering screen which made the computer unusable. First thoughts after seeing the pc: Virus. It had a **** load of malware and adware installed
 due to an inexperienced user. The thing was infected with so much crap so i deleted the entire hard drive and reinstalled Windows 10. No windows.old or any of that stuff. Complete wipe and clean windows using windows install files. After that it worked fine.
 Then came the latest major update, from I think 2-3 months ago, which wasn't installed yet on this pc. After that forced update the pc was unusable again due to flickering screen. It only had a couple things installed needed for work, such as ms office, mcaffee,
 chrome and acrobat reader. It couldn't be an app. I consulted the internet again thinking this might not have been a virus at all and maybe something driver related. It seems other people were confronted by this problem in the past. It said if taskmanager
 flickered with the rest it was a display driver problem, and if taskmanager didn't flicker it was an incompatable app causing the problem. Task manager didn't flicker with the rest so that would mean an incompatable app. But there was nothing installed causing
 this. So I tried the display driver. Turning the display driver off made windows revert to the windows basic display driver. When this was done the flickering stopped and the problem was gone. But you can't work on that driver. So i went and tried to install
 the correct display driver for the videocard inside the pc, which is a ati amd radeon r7 240. Windows refuses to accept the driver and just decides to delete the driver and replace it with another driver using a slightly different name but still called "amd
 r7" and "amd radeon r7 240". 2 drivers. Making the pc flicker once again making it unusable</p>
<p>
</p><p>So first I solved it reinstalling windows</p>
<p>A week later, in the afternoon, after the update I solved it again installing other drivers</p>
<p>That evening I had to solve it again reinstalling the good drivers once again and turning off windows automatic update to prevent windows to interrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now 2 days later the pc started flickering again. **** **** man this is so annoying I want to trow the PC in a fire. What to do?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've spent hours and hours and hours trying every single fix to no avail. I've already even done the 'reset pc' TWICE and nothing. Flickering won't stop and microsoft has done absolutely nothing to solve this issue affecting so many people ever since that
 awful anniversary update. And it's been a couple of months already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've decided to go back to Mac as a christmas gift to myself and give this damn expensive surface pro 4 to the trashcan. I can't deal with the lack of resolution from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

            Going to apple is the biggest mistake one can make. Macs are retarded machines. Good luck with paying 3 times the worth of your machine, locked software with no way of changing anything and a slow computer in 2 years.

            <p>I know a solution that works but goes beyond problem solving in windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the videocard. It will require different drivers and work. You got a service pro 4 which probably makes changing the video card impossible. therefor return it to microsoft and demand a new one. A new one in the box has the latest software and probably
 does not have the problem, if it does they would have stopped production and retail of the surface pro 4 entirely</p>

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; MsMpEng.exe &#40;Windows Defender&#41; continuously consuming high CPU for days</h2>
                    <p>Since friday (Oct 13, 2017), my Windows 10 computer was spending a lot of CPU with MsMpEng.exe (Windows Defender), without stop. Using Process Explorer, I could see that there were two threads, each of them consuming 100% of one of the 4 cores in the Intel
 Core i5-5200U, so I had two cores always busy. One of the threads had "Start Address" = "!RtlUserThreadStart" and the other, "0x0" (I know these information are not of much use, although I wanted to put here everything I have, because I had already searched
 a lot and didn't find anything similar).<br />
<br />
What I had already done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reboot machine (as soon as it finished starting up, MsMpEng.exe started consuming CPU again);</li><li>Checking that MsMpEng.exe itself was in Windows Defender's exclusions</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When writing this answer, I opened Windows Defender's exclusions again, so I could list here all exclusions already set. Then I've realized I had exclusions for older versions of Visual Studio Community and SQL Server Express, but not for current ones (Visual
 Studio 2017 and SQL Server 2016). So I've added those .exe to the exclusions and, after rebooting, I&nbsp;finally have my machine back again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've written this so if someone else has the same problem and doesn't find the answer, please try the same solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I already had exclusions for older versions of Visual Studio and SQL Server Express, but I've upgraded and forgot to exclude newer versions.</p>

</p><p>1. Connected hard disc on different ports</p>
<p>2. In device manager tried automatically upgrade driver</p>
<p>3. Again in device manager removed&nbsp;disks scan again for hardware changes restart system</p>
<p>4. Run troubleshooting, in trouble shooting it detect the issue and show notification that some installation has been done and after restart it will be fine but nothing happens after restart.</p>
<p>5. Under Disk Managment I dont see my external hard discs<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are glad to provide the assistance required to help resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Have you installed all pending updates for your PC?</p>
<p>2. What do you men when you state "on Win2012 (on same laptop) I can access my discs"?</p>
<p>3. In the above line are you referring to the old OS that you have installed, i.e, Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>4. Can you provide the exact error that you receive when you ran the troubleshooter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have specified that you are unable to view the hard&nbsp;drive, even when connected to different USB port. I suggest that you install the latest updates for your Universal Serial Bus Controller (USB) and check.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks Venessa,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are replies to your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;Have you installed all pending updates for your PC?</span><br />
</p>
<p>I just checked a few updates are pending, I tried updating but was not successful due to an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. What do you men when you state "on Win2012 (on same laptop) I can access my discs"?</span></p>
<p>I made my laptop dual boot last month for doing some labs and on along with updated Windos 10, I installed Win2012 server in other partition which I removed now. I was able to access external hard desks there.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. In the above line are you referring to the old OS that you have installed, i.e, Windows 8.1?</span></p>
<p>I bought laptop with Win 8.1, upgraded it to Windows 10. After a few months I installed Win2012 in another partition. So laptop became dual boot. I was able to use external hard disk on Win 8.1 and Win2012 but not on Window10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Can you provide the exact error that you receive when you ran the troubleshooter?</span>Not an error, after running it says restart is required but after restart nothing
 happens and also external disk remains hidden as it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help.</p>

    <title>HDMI to HDMI connection from pc to monitor blurry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tychad  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI to HDMI connection from pc to monitor blurry</h2>
                    The HDMI to HDMI connection between my asus computer and my monitor creates a blurry display on my monitor. The resolution on the monitor and in windows is set to its native 1920 x 1080. Due to the extremely small font after installing the monitor, I had
 to go to the "make text appear larger" setting and increase that to make the text comfortably visible. However, the text is still blurry as well as the icons requiring me to always zoom text. It can also be noted that I had to go to my graphics properties
 and manually adjusted the aspect ratio because the desktop was "zoomed in" on my monitor with the default 1920 x1080 screen resolution in windows<br />
<br />
My ASUS U50A Series laptop's specs are:<br />
<br />
64 bit windows 7<br />
intel core 2 duo t6600 at 2.20 GHz<br />
4GB RAM<br />
integrated intel graphics card<br />
1 HDMI out and 1 VGA plug<br />
<br />
Monitor is a sceptre X240BC-FHD at 1080p<br />
<br />
I have yet to try a vga to vga connection because the cord is at home 2 and a half hours away and I have no other cables or adapters either. HDMI is the preferred choice because of both video and audio being sent to the monitor where my speakers are pluggged
 in.<br />
<br />
The blurriness is the issue that I would appreciate being resolved.<br />

<h2>            Skype for Business - what&#39;s the logic behind the 4 tiles &#47; 4 people showing up in the main window</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We usually host Skype for Business with more than 4 attendees - let's say with 6 to 8 people. We're also used to Google Hangouts, which we have been using over the course of the last couple of years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't understand the logic behind the 4 people / tiles: which users show up there and why? The ideal behavior looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>whoever is talking should be showing up in one of the four tiles. How can we make this happen?</li><li>how can we "remove" someone from the 4 tiles, and make a different person showing up?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I know that we can "pin" / lock users to be presenters (aka make the 4 tiles disappear, and enforce one particular user to be in the main window).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do we have to tweak the presenter settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, what are the "default" presenter settings if people schedule meetings via Outlook OWA by clicking on the "add skype for business meeting" button?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Roman&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Be sure to check for updates to the router firmware since that can have a definite effect<br />
on Windows 8.1 connections even though other OS&nbsp;systems connections are fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check the system maker's support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in<br />
their forums about any known issues. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and<br />
the major on-board and separate device drivers. Especially update the network drivers,<br />
WiFi/Wireless and NIC/Wired.<br />

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7 and Windows 8.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Did you check for updated BIOS, chipset, and other drivers - especially the&nbsp;WiFi driver?<br />
If there are no newer WiFI drivers re-install the same ones.<br />
<br />
Do you have any 3rd party antivirus/security programs installed (or ever installed) or any<br />
3rd party network assist programs?<br />
<br />
Have you ever changed the DNS or tried to change or alter the IPv4 or IPv6 settings?<br />
<br />
Run SFC /scannow and checkdisk to try to rule out any corruption.<br />
<br />
WinKey + X (or Right Click in lower left hand corner) - Command Prompt (Admin)<br />

<h2>            Sound and image dropping out</h2>
                    <p>Hi friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>During my research I have found many other with the same or similar issue. I am hoping someone has found a true solution without being forced to downgrade image quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know full well I took a chance when purchasing these cables. A new type of cable the unknown, supposedly superior but even if there was no visible improvement i should not be having this issue.
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my issue. I purchased some very expensive FIBBR Ultra Pro fibre optical HDMI cables to use for the new 4K set up. I'm using X-Box One X with a Yamaha RX-V 2085 AV Reciever and Sony KD X9000F TV. During play I will get random drop out of
 image and sound (I will loose sound and image at the same time) I can see the information displayed on Reciever disappear as if the whole signal is lost. I can play for a couple of hours without a problem to it dropping out every second second. I have tried
 every setting on all systems with no success. Tried turning systems on in different orders to confirm hand shake has been successfull. Tried unplugging and swapping cables to different positions. Tried plugging directly in TV only to have same issue. I tried
 3 pairs of copper HDMI cables with all settings at highest quality and it run perfect with all copper cables. With that said I am confident that the FIBBR cables are not damage in any way. Another test I tried was running copper cable from X-Box One X to reciever
 and FIBBR cable from reciever to TV, for 2 days I didn't have a single drop out but the issue returned on the third day. Running FIBBR from X-Box One X to reciever and copper to TV was no good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know why or have a true solution please let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and help.</p>

<p>Hi there Forever Knight, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out. I recommend to try the following article: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/troubleshooting-4k-and-hdr-on-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshooting 4K and HDR on Xbox One X and Xbox One S.</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Xbox One X console system includes one HDMI cable. You can use this cable to connect the console to an HDMI-compatible TV or HDTV. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the HDMI cable to the HDMI OUT port on your console (the leftmost HDMI port on the back of your console).
</li><li>Connect the other end of the cable to the HDMI input on your TV. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Video output for the Xbox One X console is HDMI only. If you’re also connecting your console to a sound system, see
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/connect-sound-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>If the included HDMI cable isn’t long enough, we recommend finding a n “HDMI Premium Certified Cable” of the appropriate length. If you need a cable that’s 50 feet or longer, you may want an “Active High-Speed HDMI Cable”.
</li><li>As a best practice, make sure all the cables on the back of your console are gathered away from and are not touching the console<strong>.</strong> If you must run the cables to the side, avoid running cables by the back-left side of the console by placing
 the console vertically on the stand. This helps avoid wireless interference that can affect the console’s ability to reliably connect to Wi-Fi or decrease your wireless controller’s range.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. </p>

<p>I purchased a Surface 2 over the weekend. HBO Go and Max Go run fine. Showtime anytime requires a "Widevine" plug-in which apparently won't run on Windows RT. Widevine is a Google property. Surface even gives you a nice message asking you to look for Apps
 in the Microsoft Store--which&nbsp;is a joke even compared to the Xbox&nbsp;360 App&nbsp;Store.&nbsp;One can download HBO Go, Max Go, and yes even Showtime Apps there on the 360, but&nbsp;not in the Windows RT store. &nbsp;Microsoft's App store for the&nbsp;Surface is SEVERLY lacking. Microsoft
 has gotten far to proprietary in&nbsp;forcing its Video Store and Music Store on device owners. I can listen to Pandora Radio, as well as watch HBO, Showtime and Cinemax on my&nbsp;Android phone for free.&nbsp;No Apps for Windows Surface RT&nbsp;but there are for Xbox 360..huh?
 I will likely take the Surface 2 back and opt for a convertible laptop. More utility.</p>

    <title>Devices and printers not opening windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azeem mohammed ashraf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Devices and printers not opening windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me regarding, devices and printers not opening. It crashes when trying to open from control panel. Sometimes it opens and it seems all the printer are shown as inactive. when trying to right click any printer, it crashes again. Already tried
 the solution of checking bluetooth services and many other, but still the problem remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also another issue I face with excel 2016, it crashes on clicking FILE tab. Also some of the excel file crashes at opening time itself. Tried re-installing office 365, yet the problem still remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anyone thinks this issue is co-related?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions please suggest as I am in trouble of this since many days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Azeem</p>

<p>Hi Azeem,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>A peripheral like a printer requires manual driver installation before it can be recognized by the computer completely. This is required since each printer has its own features based on their manufacturers.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>To
 make sure that we can provide the appropriate resolution to your concern with your printer, we'd like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build of Windows 10 are you using? To know about it, hit
Winver</span> and then press <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>. You could also press
Winver </span>into the <span style="font-weight: bold">Run</span> dialog and press
</span><span>or available drivers </span><span>for the printer?</span><br />
</li><li>Does the other Office application crash as well or it just happens to Excel files?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, we suggest that you follow the steps in this <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17420/windows-printer-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to troubleshoot printer problems. You may also see this

</span><span>to run a quick repair for Office 2016 and see if it would do the trick.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to the requested information and the results of the recommended troubleshooting steps.</p>

<p>We appreciate the information that you've provided, Azeem. If you recently updated your device, that could be another reason as to why you encounter this issue. It is also the reason why we are asking if have you already checked the manufacturer's website
 if they released any updates or new drivers that you need to install on your device. About the Office applications, did you already tried to run the quick repair that we've suggested on the previous response?</p>

<p>Thank you for the added information, Azeem. This could be related to the corrupted system files which is why the System File Checker or SFC process didn't push through. With this, we suggest that you install the latest update of Windows 10 to your computer
 which is the Windows 10 Version 1709 Fall Creators Update. You may check this <strong>

<h2>            Messaging not working on xbox website.</h2>
                    
<p>Over the last 3 days I have not been able to access messages on the xbox website. I constantly get the error message "Uh oh ... that should not have happened. It appears you have found a glitch in the system. Please try again later". The same thing happens
 no matter what device I use to access the website. Direct contact with the support team on two separate occasions &nbsp;has been completely unsuccessful as well. Not good enough Microsoft.</p>
