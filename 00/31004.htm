    <title>Can I upgrade from Vista Ultimate to Windows 7 Professional&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I upgrade from Vista Ultimate to Windows 7 Professional&#63;</h2>
                    I'm currently running Vista Ultimate.&nbsp; If I want to upgrade to Windows 7 is the only upgrade I qualify for the Ultimate version of W7 or can I get an upgrade to the Professional version of W7?<br />
I'm mainly asking because an upgrade to W7 Ultimate doesn't seem to be included in the half-price pre-order sale announced today.&nbsp; I don't mind paying $20 more for Ultimate over Professional, but I don't want to pay $120 more.

            If you have Vista Ultimate 32-bit installed, you can use an upgrade&nbsp;edition of Windows 7 Professional 32-bit&nbsp;to perform a "custom installation" which is actually a "clean install" of Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; You would begin the installation by booting
 to your current Windows Vista Ultimate desktop, insert the Windows 7 Upgrade DVD in the DVD drive and select "custom installation" when the setup menu appears.

    <title>Multiple Blue Screens while playing video files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> totokavey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Blue Screens while playing video files</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my issue is that upon upgrading to Windows 10 I began to notice blue screen errors while playing media through various media players, the most common while using Potplayer, but VLC and windows standard as well. The issue is that resizing the window, opening
 more than one instance or advancing or backtracking too rapidly within the program playing a media file causes the system to crash and proceed to various blue screen with errors on them, at least four different ones all "caused" by the same action. I have
 suffered kernel_security_check_failure, system_service_exception, memory_management and reference_by_pointer, listed by the most common to least common. I at one time did have dump files for the errors, but I was careless on a format and don't anymore. I've
 checked with the forums on VLC and Potplayer but that has not been all too helpful, despite following the suggestion provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I proceeded to upgrade drivers and try for fixes, but that did not stop the errors. Due to a few of the error messages, such as the memory management bsod, I then tested my hardware, using MemTest86+ for the RAM (two separate instances of 40+ hours, 20 trials
 each), SMART hard drive checkers like the one on the OS and CrystalDiskInfo and the graphics card tester FurMark; all of which did not elucidate my issue and passed my hardware as functioning normally. After that I suspected a virus and probed with various
 third party software (Bitdefender, Kasperkey and my all-time favorite Malwarebytes), of which I couldn't find anything that would be the cause of my bsods. Finally in desperation, I went full nuclear and formatted the hard drive and reinstalled Windows 8 only
 to find that the issue was now occurring in 8 as well - any time I opened a video and played it and either resized the window, jumped around the time or had more than one playing, the system would crash and bsod me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone has an answer out there for me, thanks in advance for reading and any help. System specifics to follow.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth Music Receiver &#34;Disconnected&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth Music Receiver &#34;Disconnected&#34;</h2>
                    <p>********* original title ********* Bluetooth Audio Device "Disconnected" </p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Belkin bluetooth music receiver that has worked perfectly for a long while, until about a month ago.&nbsp; Suddenly, I couldn't play music from my computer through the receiver, even though it was connected (and it still works perfectly through my phone).&nbsp;
 Instead, music would only play through my computer's speakers.&nbsp; At first I thought it was the bluetooth connection, but that seems to be working fine, and the problem is that the audio manager thinks that the "headphones" are disconnected.&nbsp; When I use the
 Windows "Find and fix audio playback problems" tool, it tells me the device is simply unplugged, and to plug it in for them to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tinkered around a lot, and the basic reinstalling drivers and forgetting the device don't work.&nbsp; An interesting find is that, in playback devices, although it says the device is "disconnected", the little blue light on the actual receiver lights up
 when I press the "connect" button.&nbsp; Nothing else happens, but it does seem to be reaching the receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e57ee584-cb3a-462d-8393-c73a2dcd0999" /></p>
<p>I've jumped around so much trying to find a solution and I haven't been able to for days.&nbsp; Any help would be much appreciated!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Did you get any error code or error message while installing the Bluetooth device?</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate the efforts that you have taken to fix this issue by yourself. This might have happened because of Audio Drivers corruption.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the below methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Right click on the <strong>Speaker Icon</strong> present on the bottom right corner of
<strong>System Tray</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the option<strong> Playback Devices. </strong>
</span></li><li><span>Now click on <strong>Playback</strong> tab. </span>
</li><li><span>Right click on the <strong>device</strong> and make sure the
<strong>Show Disabled Devices</strong> is checked.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>If the issue persists, try method 2.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: &nbsp;Set Bluetooth device as default after enabling Disabled device.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to update the audio drivers and then check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To update your Audio driver in device manager:&nbsp;
</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Type in <strong>Search box</strong> Control Panel then click
<strong>Control Panel</strong></li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>System and Maintenance</strong></li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath Device Manager, click View <strong>hardware and devices</strong></li></ol>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your
<strong>password</strong> or click <strong>Continue.</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand <strong>Sound</strong>, <strong>video</strong> and <strong>
game controllers</strong></li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click your <strong>Audio controller</strong>, and click
<strong>Properties</strong></li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the <strong>Driver</strong> tab</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the <strong>Update Driver</strong> button.</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software.</strong></li></ol>
<p><span>Windows will now search for an update for your Audio drivers locally and on the internet, then walk you through the process of installing the driver.
</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer to the below link for more information:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>No I don't get any error code or message, it seems to think it's installed correctly, which does make it seem more like a audio driver issue rather than a bluetooth one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as you can see in the picture above, the option to set the device as default is grayed out, presumably because it thinks it's disconnected, so I can't try that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into device manager and "Sound, video and game controllers", and none of the options stuck out to me as an "Audio controller" because none had "controller" in the name, but I did try updating the drivers of all the devices in that category and they
 were all supposedly up to date already.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an external microphone connected to my laptop but I cannot hear the recording as long as the microphone is plugged it.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have the microphone plugged in and listen to the audio over the laptop speakers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S: All drivers are up to date and the laptop has only one slot to connect a 3.5mm jack.</p>

            Check you playback devices.
<br />To do that on your taskbar right click the icon that looks like a speaker and select playback devices.
<br />Remove the microphone by right clicking it and selecting Disable.
<br />See if that works.

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this did not working unfortunately because of this:</p>
<p>The output settings already say that the sound is coming out of my speakers. Even the sound bar in the settings is hopping around when I play music. However, as long as the microphone is plugged in, I don't hear anything. :/</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>here are the screenshots.</p>
<p>Lautsprecher means loudspeaker in German. I had to switch the language.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And Mikrofon means microphone :-)</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Interestingly, when I connect my bluetooth headphones everything works fine: I can speak into the microphone and simultaneously hear over my headphones.</p>

            Yup that is what you want.
<br />Did that microphone have drivers you can get from the hardware vendor?

            Hi SirLevir,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am a Microsoft Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with possible resolution to the issue you are reporting.
<br />
<br />Sounds like the drivers are missing or got corrupt.  Have you reloaded you drivers for that touchscreen?
<br />
<br />You can download drivers on the Samsung website.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.samsung.com/us/support/downloads/</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            Before installing these, I want to recommend creating a restore point... just in case.
<br />
<br />Create a restore point
<br />Right-click the Start button, then select Control Panel &gt; System and Maintenance &gt; System.
<br />In the left pane, select System protection.
<br />Select the System Protection tab, and then select Create.
<br />In the System Protection dialog box, type a description, and then select Create.

<h2>            My PC is using too much RAM but not to much &#34;disk&#34; and is very slow</h2>
                    <p>Don't know if this is the correct place to post this, but anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, since i updated to Windows 10 my pc has become slower. I saw in the performance that my pc is using too much Memory but almost nothing of "Disk" (idk if that's the correct way to call it). The thing is that when i was in Win 8.1, my pc was more faster
 and instead of too much memory usage, there was more "disk" usage (almost nothing of memory usage, it didn't go far of 20%, while the Disk one was fine with 40% - 100%). Now the thing is reversed and it's causing me problems while working with 3d programs
 or playing games, it's just impossible, i can't even play internet flash games because they're too slow, and sometimes when i watch videos these stucks for 1 or 2 seconds everytime instead of runing smoothly (and i know it stucks because the audio is going
 smoothly and i can still listen to the video while this stuck).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now my memory usage is usually on 65% - 100% while writing this (but when i'm working with 3d programs or . When i stop using the computer the memory goes up to 80-90-100%, getting the screen stuck for like 3 or 5 seconds, something that didn't happen
 in Win 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how i make my pc use more "Disk memory" instead of Memory usage?</p>
<p>Is that really the problem of my pc?</p>
<p>Is it normal that my pc uses more memory instead of "Disk"? (if it is, i hate it and i want it like it was in Win 8.1)</p>
<p>I have 4GB RAM</p>
<p>Processor: AMD A6-4400M APU with radeon HD graphics 2.70GHz</p>
<p>it's 64 bits.</p>
<p>(And before anyone else ask, yes i have all my drivers updated and installed, i made a full scan of my pc and no virus were found, i use Avira)</p>

            Hi Akuma,
<br />
<br />Before we get into what is causing this, just a couple of things:
<br />
<br />_______________________________________________________
<br />
<br />The way a computer works is:
<br />
<br />When you open a program or file, it is copied from the hard drive into RAM
<br />
<br />The processor calls and returns data to and from RAM
<br />
<br />The reason this is the best way is that RAM is much faster than a hard drive
<br />
<br />So optimally, you want your PC using RAM rather than your Disk - if you run out of RAM, then the Page File on your hard drive is used as virtual Memory and this is when your PC will slow down
<br />
<br />_______________________________________________________
<br />
<br />So you have 4GB of RAM - when running Windows 10, that is something you should look as upgrading, Windows itself will use half of that. And you are using 3D applications - that is hugely RAM intensive, another reason to upgrade your RAM
<br />
<br />_______________________________________________________
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager
<br />
<br />Click on the memory column header so the arrow faces down
<br />
<br />Leave that window open
<br />
<br />Then when your PC becomes slow and RAM is 80% - 100%, what are the top 5 processes listed in the processes column
<br />
<br />Please let me know that and we will see if we can get your system running better!       
        </p>

            RAM is way faster than disk. You want your PC to be utilizing RAM instead of performing I/O to the disk. Windows is a virtual memory operating system. It will use as much physical memory as it can (which is a good thing) and use disk for memory only if it runs out of RAM. If more address space is needed, WIndows will move some things to the hard drive to make more space available in RAM.

            Ok done, now what? don't see any good changes, i still can't play flash game smoothly, or watch videos smoothly, even play tibia (a very lightweight game), smoothly. Also, sometimes, when the pc is lag the cursors lags too.<br />
Another thing that scares me is that a few days ago i was having 160 GB in my "C" disk, now i have 153, is it that a "memory leak" or a virus?(which i don't think it's because i scanned the pc)

<p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the computer came pre-installed with Windows 8 operating system, you may contact the system manufacturer for resetting it to factory settings and also for Windows 8 setup.</p>

<p>As the computer came pre-installed with Windows operating system, contacting the system manufacturer would be the right option as suggested earlier. Refer to the link for Asus support:</p>

<p>Just as I was worrying about. The game looks like garbage. The guns don't shoot well. Your guy moves like he had lead boots on. And also rifles won't knock down walls like that in real life. Sure maybe put some bullet holes in the wall, but not knock down
 walls themselves. &nbsp;Try as they might, but it looks like this slow, unreal game is going to take backseat again. We will sill enjoy playing it, bit it doesn't look like were going to get call of duty numbers..</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of flaming going on in other forums about this clip. People, as smart as they are, are comparing this directly to what we have seen on the PC. I for the most part thought the clip looked great. Sure it's missing some lighting effects
 and wotnot but for a console, I'm pretty happy. Can't wait to see some MP footage...</p>

<p>Looks good. But like life, it will only get you so far. The reason why BF is not as popular as COD is gameplay. If only they could make a BF game that played like COD, but with all the extras BF brings to a FPS. One day hopefully. It's kind of like how GTA
 cant have the same car physics Midnight club has. They are even made by the same people if you want to wrap your head around that. Not flaming, just going by what history is telling me.

<p>Looks pretty nice. The PC version has better lighting, and some textures were more distinct. Also, I watched the PC version of that clip again, and I noticed that there was very little motion blur on the console version. But it still looks pretty good on
 the console. And besides, both are still in pre-alpha, so there's plenty of time to clean things up on both versions.</p>

<h2>            STOP Moving things&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Why is it that Microsoft programmers seem to think that moving things around in menus is an improvement?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, default programs has been moved in version 1703, and it took me 15 minutes to find how to change a default program (and I consider myself fairly proficient at Windows 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ordinary users will spend untold hours or just give up&nbsp; - leave things where they are after we learn how to operate them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not only a Windows problem, they do it in Office, too.&nbsp; Always rearranging menus moving operations to different sub-menus so we users have to spend valuable time figuring out how to operate the program versus getting actual work done.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> <br />
<div>I would suggest you to disable the antivirus program for temporary purpose and perform the steps provided below:
<div><br />
Refer: </div>
<div><br />
<strong>Disable Antivirus</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software?SignedIn=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software?SignedIn=1</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong>Here are the steps below which would erase the current update history. By doing so, there wonâ€™t be any another updates that can run.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Open the command prompt in an elevated mode [ Run as administrator ]. To open it, press Windows Button + R; type in cmd and click on OK.</div>
<div>2. Try executing these commands in the command prompt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\services.msc </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. You'll get the services window. Stop the following services by right clicking on the service and clicking on stop.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>i. Background Intelligent Transfer Service.</strong></div>
<div><strong>ii. Cryptographic Service.</strong></div>
<div><strong>iii. Windows Update Service. </strong></div>

<p>If it worked with the old motherboard, I would call Seiko tech support at 1-800-757-1011 and give them the model information of the new motherboard - there may be a known issue.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your support,&nbsp; my monitor is in it's native resolution my graphic card has the latest drivers etc..</p>
<p>(i'm a web/graphic designer for more than 10 years now, and I am familiar with all pc-tweaks possible..)</p>
<p>I finetuned the brightness/gamma settings slightly&nbsp; and after that i went trough al the reg edits found at</p>
<p>this link:</p>
<p>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7desktop/thread/f180e803-3317-4433-8fd2-63aadaecc2d2?prof=required</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>windows 7 is now almost completely stripped off cleartype...</p>
<p>the white/brightness display is now better, probably me new grapics card an ATI 6850 1 GB ram has "more color display punch" than my older ati rage 128</p>
<p>card..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still hope MS comes with an official update/functionality te strip the cleartype function out of windows 7.</p>

Your screen resolution is not correct for your monitor. You have a wide-screen monitor, but your resolution is&nbsp;a type for&nbsp;the old 4:3 monitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's probably because you have not installed the correct Windows 7 driver for your video card.</p>

<p>Can you check if any updates are for these controllers if not then disconnect the controller (Take the batteries out) then hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds then unplug the console from receiving power + HDMI and wait up to 5 minutes then
 plug it back in again.</p>
<p>Another thing yo can do is press the button on TOP of the controller with the 3 Arrows and on the console. (It is on the left side of the console it has the same 3 Arrow marking in silver / chrome color) press both buttons simultaneously and the controller
 hopefully will work after this. </p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2 Charger Exploded - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosehip1248  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 Charger Exploded</h2>
                    <p>Today I was using my Surface Pro 2 charger when I started to hear a noise and saw my charger sparking. I know the power cable has been recalled, but this was the charging cord which has sparks coming out of it. (I placed an order about a week ago to get
 the replacement power cable, still not been dispatched). Luckily, I quickly reacted and managed to pull it out before it burst into flames but smoke was present. Having retrieved the charger from when I threw it across the room, both ends of the cable which
 go in / come out of the brick are broken and burnt out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface is no longer covered by warranty, but this appears to be some leak / shortage in the battery. Would Microsoft still replace it or will I have to fork out another Â£45 for a new one? Also, has anyone else experienced their battery to be a deflect?

            <p>Hi Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be possible that you are facing issue due to incompatible/missing/corrupted/outdated display driver. Try the steps as below and check the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>At first, you may place the computer in clean boot state to avoid any third party software conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow
 the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
<em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>You may want to visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest display driver for the same computer model as you have.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Also, you can <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/update-from-windows-8-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">update Windows 8 to Windows 8.1</a></strong> and check if the game can play well since the
 Operating System will be updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<h2>            Gamertag problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello there, i was told by an agent by the name of Walter to contact the enforcement team because of my problem. I was told to download my account again, so i typed in my microsoft account info, and did the download. The account that was &nbsp;downloading was
 called SweetCalf658072, even though my gamertag was <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>. Please help me with this problem, and thank you for your help.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Christian</p>

<p>Your previous gamertag violated the code of conduct &amp; you have been issued a forced name change.</p>
<p>You will not get the old gamertag back &amp; if you want to change the tag you have now you will have to pay,you will not get it changed for free.</p>
<p>To find out what part of the CoC it violated either read the email sent to the address linked to your account or post here

<p>It's pretty obvious why it was changed.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 system restore and network adapter issues. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 system restore and network adapter issues.</h2>
                    <p>I have bewn running into issues with my ASUS AC53 Nano wireless adapter lately, and in a feeble attempt to repair the slow internet, uninstalled and deleted the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On reboot, the adapter would no longer work. I opened device manager and it listed it as an unknown device with no drivers. After unsuccessfully trying to repair this with legacy hardware, I booted up system restore and attempted to restore to an update
 from earlier in the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I was met with this error-</p>
<p>System restore failed while restoring the directory from the restore point</p>
<p>Source: AppxStaging</p>
<p>Destination: %ProgramFiles%\WindowsApps</p>
<p>An unspecified error occured during System Restore. (0x80070091)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clue how to fix either of these errors?</p>

            Plug the adapter in, plug in by ethernet cable to get online.

Right click Start button to open Device Manager, find the wireless device under Network Adapters or Unknown Device, or other.   Open it and click on Driver tab, select Update Driver, then Automatically pull the driver in from Windows Update since you deleted it off your PC.  The is a common wireless adapter that will find its driver if connected to the internet.
