<h2>            N95 Freeze and crashes</h2>
                    Hi can anyone give me advice please on the following?<br />
<br />
My N95 is at present at a registered nokia repair centre because it freezes and crashes on a regular basis, this problem i know from the forum is helped by taking the battery out for a short while. Sadly as this does not truly cure the problem i had to send
 it for repair, because the problem did not happen while the technician was looking at it he has said there is nothing he can do :(<br />
<br />
He also said this was the first N95 they had seen for repair so all could do was re flash the software, as the phone was on the latest FW i cannot see that this would have helped.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had the crash and freezing problem repaired, and where you given a reason for the possible cause?

            As from my expirience - N95 crashes&amp;reboot itself much less with the latest formware (11.*) in comparision with the original (10.*).<br />
But the main problem with my phone is working with stereo bluetooth headphones, with Nokia BH-501 phone crashes on regular basis, in fact I was unable to use them. With Motorolla HT820 it was lightly better, but only Nokia BH-500 works normally and phone more
 or less stable.<br />
<br />
Maybe you have problems not with phone itself, but with compatibility with external devices, like bluetooth hedphones?

            Phone crashes and freezes for no reason and quite random, such as not used for a while, sending texts or just looking at files. This problem started when i had the original FW and continued with the new FW.

My N95 has also frozen on several occasions. Previously, I was able to get the phone going again by removing the battery for a short while then replacing and switching on. On the last freeze, I tried the same technique, however the phone would not power up
 at all. I have not changed any firm ware, but the phone was returned to a Nokia repair centre, who have in turn returned it to Nokia. This was 10 days ago and I am still with out the phone, nor non the wiser about the state of the fault.

            I have had exactly the same problem, my phone is 7 days old. I make sure I close every application before opening a new one but still it freezes. I also have been removing the battery and only if I let it sit without the battery for at least 3 hours then
 I can start it up again but it only lasts for about 15 minutes. As of yesterday even taking out the battery is not helping and I cannot do anything with it except turn it on and then it freezes before it even starts up properly. It worked perfectly with no
 problem for 6 days then started this freezing problem. Lets hope the next one is better - if I can get a replacement! :(

            Appears to me there are A LOT of bugs in the N95 firmware. The only way is to ensure your firmware is up to date as korngear said, and to frequently check for updates.

            Hi Everybody :<br />
<br />
This is another problem with N95<br />
Sometimes i want to view a message or send a message and ooooops it's freezing<br />
Sometimes starting Maps will cause freezing<br />
Although the FirmWare is the latest V12xxxxxx<br />
If the problem with software it's easy<br />
But i'm worried about the hardwae , maybe this small phone with all this load of applicatins and functions needs a quadro core processor ;)

            Well:<br />
<br />
I am another N95 user reporting random freezes and crashes.<br />
<br />
Since I have this wander gadget for about seven or eight days, I can tell I must<br />
remove the battery about five times.<br />
<br />
At this moment. I slide the screen to the media keys. Select the Radio. And the screen keep black for five minutes. Then the phone restart itself.<br />
<br />
I use MacBook Pro.... Well, when rarely crash, simply I keep the power button pressed for ten seconds and it shutoff instantly.<br />
<br />
This phone must have a kind of keystroke for fast shutdown. Any know if there are some like that?<br />
<br />
Sincerely yours

<h2>            Can I set Excel so I have a formula like &#61;SUM&#40;&#41; automatically populate the cell when I type &#61; in the formula bar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type "<strong>=</strong>" in a cell, I was wondering if I can set Excel to automatically populate the cell the formula bar with =SUM(? Then I can highlight the cells I want to sum, press the "enter" key and Excel will add the right parenthesis to
 finish the formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can type =SU in the formula bar and =SUM will appear in the dropdown list or I can put the cursor a cell and press Alt + = to have =SUM( appear in the cell but since I use the SUM function a lot just typing in = and having =SUM( populate the cell
 would be very convenient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            You can do this like below
<br />
<br />Open Excel &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Proofing &gt; Autocorrect Options &gt; Put = in Replace: box and put whatever you want say =SUM(A1) in With: box&gt; Add &gt; OK
<br />
<br />Now whenever you press = and press Enter or Tab, it will populate =SUM(A1)

            Can this be done?
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br />The method would involve vba programming that is beyond me and which would degrade the performance of Excel as well as become annoying.To do it, I would have to have a program looking at every keystroke and evaluating it before acting on it.
<br />
<br />Here, I would advise settling for what you have with the shortcuts available.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, I confess that my ignorance is vast. Someone else may have a way to do this which is not so cumbersome and problematic.

            Sorry to throw cold water on you enthusiasm for finding a better way. I just have to tell it like I see it. I hope the perspective, at least, is helpful.
<br />
<br />It would be possible to put the SUM function on the QAT, but I don't see that as any improvement over what is available.

            It just occurred to me that Office does have something evaluating every keystroke. That is AutoCorrect. I tried adding an AutoCorrect entry to produce =SUM( and named it _s. By typing _s and a space in the cell it produces =SUM(.
<br />
<br />File - Options - Proofing - AutoCorrect Options (button)
<br />
<br />That may help some without interfering with other work.

            I thought I was very clever finding AutoCorrect. 
<br />I see that Vijay Verma got it without dropping a step. Props!
<br />I use AutoCorrect in Word all the time and should have thought of using it here.
<br />
<br />AutoCorrect requires at least two characters and a space or the Enter key as a trigger. So it is not much savings. You should have the trigger be something that you do not type routinely because triggering is automatic.
<br />
<br />Also, AutoCorrect entries apply across all Office programs, so you want it to be something that will not be accidentally triggered in Word, PowerPoint, or Outlook as well as Excel.
<br />
<br />I hope you have been helped.

<p>Hello all, thanks for your responses. I saw a user while working in their Excel spreadsheet type "=" in the cell and then highlighted cells they wanted to sum. After highlighting the cells and pressing enter, the cell where "=" was typed would then show
 the sum of the highlighted cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you look at the formula of this cell it shows for example =C3+D4 and not =SUM(C3+D4). The user didn't know why it worked and received the spreadsheet from someone else who I can't get a hold of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can you setup Excel to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            There is a better way, have a look at the Formula tab at AutoSum:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-autosum-to-sum-numbers-543941e7-e783-44ef-8317-7d1bb85fe706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-au...</a>
<br />
<br />AutoSum has also a key shortcut (hover the mouse over AutoSum to display), but it depends on the layout of your keyboard if it works.
<br />
<br />But you can also add AutoSum to your QAT:

<h2>            Outlook rules - working intermittently</h2>
                    <p>I have a rule - that forwards emails from a specific sender and subject line to a folder. I've been noticing for a couple weeks not that the rule sometimes does works but other times doesn't. Just this morning I had (3) emails that fall under this rule -
 the 1st and 3rd email did NOT get the rule applied while the 2nd one did have the rule applied. The emails were received at 11:39am (didn't work) 11:43am (did work) and 11:43am (didn't work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm absolutely baffled by this. The emails came from an gmail account on an iphone to a Windows 10 system running Outlook 2016&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas on this???</p>

            Rules tend to be sporadic with imap accounts, even mores oif they messages are marked read on another device.

</p><p>For all the settings in the Stream web part in SharePoint Online, when you add the Stream web part, you can see a pencil icon.</p>
<p>All the settings which are available in SharePoint Online are all in the right pane after you click the pencil icon.</p>

<h2>            Missing Adobe Reader and QuickOffice  &#40;Nokia 700&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently had to do a "full factory reset" on my Nokia 700 but since then I seem to have lost both the</p>
<p>Adobe Reader and QuickOffice. Both were working before the reset and I did a full Nokia Suite backup</p>
<p>and restore after the reset.</p>
<p>In an attempt to restore the two missing functions I've re-installed the software and searched the store,</p>
<p>all to no avail.</p>
<p>Any suggestions about how to get them back?</p>

<h2>            Office 365 PowerPoint does not allow editing data in a table</h2>
                    I have a PowerPoint that has several graphs and tables embedded into the presentation.&nbsp; When I right click on the table and try to edit the data, Excel used to open and allow me to edit.&nbsp; However, after the last updates for Office 365, this function does
 not happen and I am unable to edit the data through PowerPoint.&nbsp; Happens on all the PowerPoint presentations I use on my computer.&nbsp; If the PowerPoint is opened on a different computer, the editing function occurs without issue.&nbsp; Thoughts?

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest you create a chart in Word &gt; check if edit data / edit data in Excel works, if yes, you can either make the pop-up Excel sheet open or close the sheet, then go to PowerPoint &gt; clicking
 edit data or edit data in Excel to see if it works. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we'd like to know whether the problem happens after you update to Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, if yes, please share the OS version with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And please provide the reproduce video of the problem. You can send it via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Have to re-enter password for everytime I send an email.</h2>
                    I have Office 365 on Windows 10. Everytime I hit send on a message, I have to re-enter my password. 3 times a Microsoft agent has logged on to my computer from the Phillipines and "fixed" this problem by making me get a new password from Yahoo, then adding
 that to Outlook. This has fixed it for one day, one time and one week. Each time I ask them what caused this problem and they don't know. MS agents have spent about 10 hours now logged into to my new HP Envy computer with Windows 10 and can't fix what has
 to be the most simple problem in the world. Is there a non-MS person that can help me?

            <p><span>I have learned you cannot always trust everything a technical person tells you. They will pretend they know even when they don't have answers. Actually you needing to type in your password every time
 you go to send a message might be a good thing if you worked in an office. Because someone could send a message from your computer and it appears to have come from you. That's the purpose of that.</span></p>
<p><span>But if you are working from home and no one have access to your computer, it's annoying.<br />
</span><span>I may be wrong but what do you have to lose by trying?<br />
<br />
Go to [<strong>File</strong>] top (left corner).<br />
Click on [<strong>Account Settings</strong>]. Now click on the word [Change]. <br />
A dialog pop-up box appears. At the bottom of those input columns - do not change anything, simply check the checkbox that says [<strong>Remember Password</strong>].</span></p>
<p><span>If that was unchecked, then that's why you had to enter a password every time to “Send.”<br />
</span><span>….(again, that protects you others from using you computer).<br />
<br />
If it is already checked, then I don't know what the source of the problem is.<br />
Hopefully I hope this helped.</span></p>

<p>After moving our Apple Macs from a company that was providing us Office 2016 Macintosh to our own purchased Office 365 subscriptions we go the message:</p>

<p>Account Notice: We've run into a problem with your Office 365 Subscription, and we need your help to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;with a "do not show again" box and a two choices "Manage my settings" and "Remind Me later"</p>

None of the options are helpful.&nbsp; So we used the followed this article to remove Office 365 form the MAC completely:

We, however, did not do the last step that deletes the outlook data files.&nbsp; And after installing Office 365 2016 MAC from our own portal, we are still receiving these messages!!&nbsp; Pelase help as this is really annoying our users!</p>

2.Navigate to &lt;YourUserName&gt;Library &gt; Group Containers.<br />
3.Find the folders below and move them to<strong> Trash</strong>.<br />
<strong>UBF8T346G9.ms</strong><br />
<strong>UBF8T346G9.Office</strong><br />
<strong>UBF8T346G9.OfficeOsfWebHost</strong><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After removing these three folders, the Office applications need to be reactivated.<br />
4.Open one of the Office applications to activate it via your work/school account.<br />
5.Check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />

    <title>Dual&#47;Triple boot feature has a bug. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> inkman_4u  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual&#47;Triple boot feature has a bug.</h2>
                    <p>Ive been dual booting for years. This is the first time ever doing a triple boot setup. IT WORKS, but listen.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way for the prompt to choose witch OS you want to boot into to show up, you must EACH TIME, from within Win Tech Pre. go to the "advanced system settings/startup &amp; recovery/settings" and change something. I had it set to 2 sec. when I first installed
 Windows. The very first time I actually restart to boot into another OS is when I first realized WTF!?! I thought hmm, maybe I just didnt see it, and it went by quickly. So I let it boot back up into Win 10 and check the settings again. It was still at 2.
 I scratch my head. Thinking maybe it needed more time (ive used 1 sec in past fine on other machines) I changed it to 6 sec. When I restarted I was able to get the OS boot selection to show up. However, I booted into my Win XP 64 (older windows os in menu)
 and did whatever and restarted. I wanted to boot into my Win 7 next and guess what. WTF!?! I thought I was going crazy. It booted straight into WIn 10 without the OS boot selection screen. I had to go into the advanced system settings again, this time to 5.
 I know that does not matter what the time is, but just changing it at all EACH AND EVERY TIME seems to be the only way for that screen to show up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never seen that in my life and doubt it was to do with my triple boot setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specs are dell inspiron 1545 old vista laptop.... 2.17ghz 64 bit 4gb ram 750GB SATA HD. 3 seperate partitions... XP64/7/WIN Preview.... the way it should be. All still do boot up just great.... only when I go through the hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win Build 9860</p>

            30 seconds is the normal default time for boot so try that and see if it works. Today's fast computers need at least 20 seconds to load everything or the selection screen will go by in an eye blink or not show at all. Windows 10 is the default OS. So if
 you don't select the OS fast enough or don't allow enough time, it will always boot to win 10. Windows XP is not supported any more, so that might cause problems. No more security updates for xp which makes it vulnerable.

            <p>Sounds like you are dealing with the boot manager bug that Build 9860 has. What happens is the Boot Manager does not display at start-up. If you follow this link, there are a few things you can try:</p>

            <p>Its obvious you have No experience with dual booting, yes 30 is the default but who wants to sit there and wait for it to count down when fast startup times matter to most. Ive been doing it since windows 3.0 and win nt 4. Early 90s. Always was able to set
 it to show the boot manager for 1 sec. When it showed you quick hit the up or down arrow and you can select what you want. You had to be ready and looking for it. This is not the case here as it just is not showing up regardless of the time setting.&nbsp; also
 'today's fast computers' need 'at least 20 sec...'. umm no they don't. And did you read my computer specs even? "an old vista laptop....." as I stated is not a 'today's fast computer'</p>
<p>
</p><p>And second, XP 32 bit has been dead, yes. But 64 bit Version with sp2 will still be supported and gives updates till 4.8.15. Also that has nothing to do with anything. I can't simply get rid of it anyway without completely starting over with a format of
 my hard drive and reinstalling every other windows all over. Read up on your dual booting. The oldest&nbsp; os must always be first.
</p>

</p><p>None of what you said is relevant.</p>

 my mobile.Then I have done a soft reset,but no solution whatsoever.Then I used an another charger(not the original one) and it was charging properly.But after 2-3 times it was showing the same message.Then I have done a hard reset.Again I started &nbsp;charging

<p>Thanks for your reply.I already told that I did a factory reset,but no solution.What I understand that it may be the problem with the battery or charging point,cause I have done all the software related procedures to solve the issue.</p>

                    &nbsp;I've had the Omnia for about a week now and I really like it.&nbsp; But there's a problem.&nbsp; I put the "phonebook" into my "shortcuts" menu, then went on file manager and rooted around my files, I "think" I might have deleted the phonebook shortcut from "shortcuts".&nbsp;
 Then I see, on the "shortcuts" page, a blank spot where my "phonebook" was.&nbsp; But I can still access the phonebook from the main menu and from the start menu.&nbsp; But it doesnt offer me the option of adding "phonebook" to my shortcuts menu.&nbsp;
<br />
Can anyone help?&nbsp; I use "phonebook" often so its a pain to pick it from the main menu.&nbsp; Also, from the start menu is difficult too, since the selections are too small for me to reliably press.<br />

Any help is always appreciated, thanks!

<br />
I am not exactly clear where you would like to see your phone shortcut, but I can advise as follows:<br />
<br />
The phone shortcut is a file named as " Phone.lnk" and would be visible at a few locations, such as Start Menu, Programs, etc...<br />
<br />
Use File Explorer in your phone to locate a copy of this file and then copy and then hop over to where you want to locate it, and press "paste" - that should do it...<br />
<br />
Cheers...<br />

Is the "phonebook" an Omnia specific program?&nbsp; OR are you referencing Contacts (from Outlook Mobile)?

            I think "phonebook" might be specific to the OMNIA.&nbsp; I think the shortcut is not "phone.lnk", its "phonebook.lnk".&nbsp; I am looking all over through the directories and subdirectories for something called "shortcuts" but there is none.&nbsp; I wonder what directory
 all the shortcut menu "shortcuts" are kept in.<br />
By the way, its the "phonebbok" command I want.&nbsp; Its the thing that brings up all your phone contacts which are searchable by entering the letters of their names.

            So if you take&nbsp;phonebook.lnk, copy and then paste a shortcut in the Start/Windows/Start Menu/Programs folder, did that work for you?

                    I use my Zune to listen to audiobooks and am frustrated by the fact that I can never seem to find where I left off.&nbsp; Surely there is a bookmark option which will allow you to turn it off and pick up where you left off when you turn it back on..

            As Julie suggested, this is a feature supported on audiobooks only (not audiobooks sync'd as music for instance,) and to enable this you need to use the zune enabled overdrive or audible clients to sync books. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/promotions/audiobooks/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zune.net/en-us/promotions/audiobooks/default.htm</a>

<p>I'm not sure what the problem could be.&nbsp; Books that are downloaded via Overdrive or Audible and transferred to a Zune, should bookmark just fine.&nbsp; In fact, I recently downloaded a book from the library (via Overdrive) and it is bookmarking exactly as expected.</p>
<p>Are all 8 of your books not bookmarking or is the issue isolated to just 1 book?</p>

                    <p>When I go to the Office 365 Support Center in the new admin portal, it seems as though it is not working as it should be. &nbsp;Most of the screen is white aside from one column on the left side that says "Need help? &nbsp;Search for help on something new while your
 request is in progress".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below that is a "View solutions" area that provides some automated search results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then below that is "Email in progress" but it is showing a ticket from months ago with no ability to edit that request or add a new request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, below that is a Privacy link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that's all that is in my support center, rendering it unusable since I can't interact with the support department in any way.</p>

            Hi Joel,<br />
<br />
This is the new support experience when you try to submit support tickets in Office 365 admin center. After you choose “Let us call you” option in the “Need help?” widget. A support engineer will call them back within 10 min. However, we can only open one support
 ticket once in a time. As you have already opened one support ticket, please contact the support engineer to close the previous ticket so you can open a new one.<br />
<br />
In the meanwhile, we can help you in the forum. If you encounter any Office 365 related issues, welcome to share the details about the situation, we’ll provide assistance based on your exact scenario.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Spike

            Hi Joel,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply. We have sent feedback to the related team and they will look into this. If there is any update, they will let you know .<br />
<br />
To open a new support ticket, you can switch to another Office 365 global admin account in your organization. Because we only open one ticket per Global admin at a given time.<br />
<br />
Or you can share the details here about the issue you encountered in Office 365 and we’ll provide assistance based on your exact scenario.<br />
<br />
In addition, if you prefer email support, you can add a note in the problem description that you prefer email communication or tell the support engineer your preference when you get a call from us.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

    <title>Word 2003 Keeps Crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davey mames  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2003 Keeps Crashing</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 Pro. I've been using Word 2003 for years without issues. Lately Word crashes for no apparent reason while a Word file is open. I've done everything here and the problem was fixed for a few days but today it crashed again: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-msoffice_custom/word-2003-keeps-crashing/c0c6b902-a592-4b9a-9f19-64e188746681</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried repairing Word but that made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the steps asked me to delete all the temp files. I closed all instances of Word and deleted everything but some files wouldn't delete as they were being used by programs other than Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I install Windows for the first time, I install everything I need then I make a backup image of the C Drive with Macrium Reflect. I have restored a backup to when I didn't have this problem so I know the installation is problem free but even that backup
 now has the Word crashing issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that today several minutes before Word crashes there was a popup saying that Word couldn't spell check the document - I think it was because it said there was too many spelling mistakes. I never asked it to do a spell check (as word checks your
 spelling on the fly and underlines any mistakes) - the popup just appeared. Could that be causing the crash? The word file is 515 pages long. The file is a stuff to do file that I keep open all the time.</p>

            As I said, I already tried that first link you posted as it was on the page I mentioned.. Tried repairing Word as well but that didn't fix the problem.

<p>Can you navigate to <em>Menu &gt; Messaging &gt; Options &gt; SIM messages</em> to check if it is just the SIM memory that has filled up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, try insert the SIM into another phone to check - and try another SIM card in your own phone - to make sure that both the phone and the SIM card is healthy.<br />
'Memory full' alerts can also indicate the phone or the SIM card has become defective.</p>
