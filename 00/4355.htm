<h2>            OneNote and Outlook Task Design Advice</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to find a way to use OneNote to manage my projects and tasks. Specifically how to focus on my next relevant task.</p>
<p><strong>Considering:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>One Notebook </li><li>Tabs/Sections for each project </li><li>Pages relevent for each project (brainstorming, tasks, etc) </li></ol>
<p>This seems okay unles you have better idea.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<p>On my tasks sheet (for each project)&nbsp;in OneNote I'm considering a list all my tasks in order. e.g.,:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call Staff Member </li><li>Discover training needs </li><li>List training topics </li><li>Create&nbsp;a lesson plan </li><li>Select a date and time </li><li>Send Outlook Invite </li><li>Train </li><li>Send evaluation </li></ol>
<p>My initial thoughts would be to sync the current or next task in a project to Outlook.</p>
<p>I know how to&nbsp;sync OneNote tasks to Outlook. My issue is when they get to Outlook I don't know what project they're for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the above example <strong>Create a Lesson plan</strong>&nbsp; (this could for be many projects)</p>
<p>Is there a way&nbsp;to assign&nbsp;an Outlook&nbsp;category or project name in OneNote&nbsp;that would&nbsp;sync with the task in Outlook? I could then group and sort them?</p>
<p>Am I going about this the wrong way? Can you think of a better way?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I work in much the same way, following a GTD setup. I keep my GTD "projects" (lists of concrete tasks) in OneNote. Each of these lists has a "@NextAction" task (OneNote tag)&nbsp;and when the time comes to actually put the task on the calendar, make it part of
 the hard timescape, it becomes an Outlook task.</p>
<p>To make the Outlook task subject speak for itself, I do more or less what Ben does: be overly-explicit in naming it: I usually start the task subject with a keyword referring to the project to which it belongs. Something like "Programming course: Create
 a lesson plan".</p>

<p>You could create a Tags Summary and print that, yes.&nbsp; So that would form a sort of categorized To-Do list.</p>

    <title>unpredictable scrolling in Outlook 2010 Word 2010 and Internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lacenter  say:</h3>
<h2>            unpredictable scrolling in Outlook 2010 Word 2010 and Internet Explorer 9</h2>
                    <p>REPORT OF SOFTWARE PROBLEMS: between Outlook 2010, Word 2010 and Internet Explorer 9 and Touchpad</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Please fix whatever bug&nbsp;is causing sudden, unpredictable runaway scrolling in Outlook 2010, Word 2010 and Internet Explorer 9. When it occurs, a small&nbsp;scrolling icon appears under the mouse cursor. A user can click on the small scrolling icon to stop
 the sudden scrolling, but by that time, the user has lost his or her place in a document. And the scrolling doesn't stop for long. It can restart at any time, including as soon as the mouse cursor moves. The user ends up wasting a lot of time during&nbsp;computer
 use trying to stop the runaway scrolling and get back to where he/she was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem is that the scrolling is coming from a part of the software targeted to smartphones, and you are trying to save development dollars by combining the mouse operations for smartphones and laptops with touchpads, please separate out the scrolling
 features. If the scrolling problem is a bug, please fix it. If the problem is between Microsoft software and the Touchpad software or interfaces, work with the Touchpad provider to fix the problematic interaction and provide a bug fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way the software handles scrolling now is frustrating to say the least.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Also, sometimes when I try to insert the cursor into a specific location in the text of a Word 2010 document or Outlook 2010 email or message created on Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;to a provider, the cursor does not insert into that location. It inserts into a
 different location lines away. And sometimes the screen jumps when the cursor is inserted.This problem&nbsp;occurs often.&nbsp;[The problem occurred while I was writing this problem report to you on Internet Explorer 9 (v. 9.0.8112.16241).]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;don't know if the two problems, runaway scrolling and incorrect cursor insertion, are related, but they may be as they are both touchpad mouse problems running under Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I end up having to look at my screen every time I insert my mouse cursor to ensure that it is in the right place. It is very distracting to have the screen jump when I try to insert the cursor into the document. But when the screen jumps, I find that&nbsp;the
 cursor is not where it should be. If&nbsp;the cursor&nbsp;isn't where it should be, I have to click in the correct location&nbsp;second time&nbsp;to make it go to that location.This is no small problem. You can imagine how many times one must&nbsp;insert the mouse cursor when writing
 and editing a document or email to ensure correctness. Every time I click to insert the curor into a document location, I have to look to see if it inserted correctly. And I have to click again if it did not (a frequent occurrence). If the screen jumped several
 lines, I have to try to find the original locaion I was trying to insert the cursor into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Another problem also just occurred. I was unable to select a range of text with my Touchpad mouse. The only way I could select it was to pull my cursor over the text and press SHIFT+click, instead of just pulling my cursor over the range of desired text
 and releasing the mouse button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; The runaway scrolling and the cursor insertion problems and inability to select a range of text without using SHIFT+click occurred while I was writing this problem report.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer&nbsp;particulars are</p>
<p>Toshiba Sattelite P755-S5320</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium with Service Pack 1</p>
<p>6 GB RAM</p>
<p>64-bit Operating System</p>
<p>with a Synaptics Touchpad V7.4 on PS/2 Port</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scrolling and mouse&nbsp; insertion problems were&nbsp;not caused by any non-Microsoft programs I've added. The problems were&nbsp;there from the beginning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <div>Hi,<br />
There has been not a scenario where a bug has been found in the scrolling option in Windows 7.<br />
You can try the methods mentioned below to check if that helps in getting the issue fixed.<br />
Method 1: Reinstall the touch pad driver.<br />
Follow the steps mentioned below to find steps to uninstall a driver from a Windows 7 computer.<br />
a.&nbsp;Go to the Device Manager and select your mouse. Uninstall it and then restart your computer. During&nbsp;&nbsp; restart, your mouse driver will automatically be reinstalled.<br />
b.&nbsp; Click on Start and type ‚ÄòDevice Manager‚Äô.<br />
c.&nbsp; Click Device Manager.<br />
d.&nbsp; Click + sign next to Mouse.<br />
e.&nbsp; Right-click on mouse entry and choose "uninstall".<br />
f.&nbsp; Restart your computer.</div>
<div>After installing download the driver automatically or from the manufacturer website and install it.</div>
<div>Method 2: Perform a security scan on your computer.<br />
If no security software is installed check the link mentioned below and download and install Microsoft Security Essentials:<br />
(note: Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.)<br />

There is an update to the Samsung mail app.&nbsp; It fixes the Sent folder&nbsp;duplicating messages.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Or remove the account from the phone app.<br />
Download and install the outlook.com app.<br />
Add the account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Or you can setup the account to use 'Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync'.<br />

FIXED ON SAMSUNG GALAXY S2? <br />
&nbsp;<br />
I had the same problem with hundreds of duplicated emails in my outlook sent mail folder. I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 and I use the native email app (which I prefer after trying many alternatives). I cleared the problem using the native email app on my phone.&nbsp;
 I deleted the outlook account [open app; settings; bin in top right corner; delete] then added it back selecting 'Manual Setup'.&nbsp; When the app then asks 'What type of account?' I selected 'Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync'.
<br />
<br />
The settings needed are as follows... <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Domain\user name: \[Your outlook email address]<br />
Password: [Your outlook password]<br />
Exchange Server: s.outlook.com<br />
Use Secure connection (SSL) [Tick yes]<br />
Use client certificate: [Leave blank]<br />
<br />
All your emails will be back in place on the phone within a few minutes once you have worked through a few more settings which are all ok at their default values.
<br />
<br />
I can now send emails from my Samsung with only one instance appearing in my outlook sent folder :)<br />
<br />
If I get any further problems I will report back.<br />
<br />
I got the Exchange ActiveSync settings from the following <br />

</p><p>now. what i did do of course was already change my primary email address to a gmail acct. &nbsp;and today i got emails. i then forwarded them back to my outlook and thankfully it shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so maybe i need to contact my mobile app maker? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you use a smartphone? Do you have a "email" app? (built in app) thats what i used to register as spam. &nbsp;after submitting this i will try and contact the app developer. maybe what i did didnt actually flag it as spam<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2bb31c6-95c4-4895-a5b7-e53e83a67f78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2bb31c6-95c4-4895-a5b7-e53e83a67f78" /></a></p>

<h2>            How can I change my Skype name&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How can I change my Skype name please? I don't like my Skype name anymore, but I want to keep all my contacts and history and the pennies in my account so I don't want to set up a new account instead.
</p>
<p>(BTW I don't think much of the limited choice of options/topics that Skype is providing for me to ask this question but I can't do anything about it so I just hope someone can help me.) Thanks very much folks</p>

<h2>            One Note Notebook corrupted on OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hi, a user in our Office 365 tenant uploaded their OneNote notebook onto their Onedrive as they needed to have their laptop reimaged.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since having their laptop rebuilt and logging back into OneDrive the OneNote Notebook now displays the follwing message on 4 out of 5 of the notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"we're sorry something went wrong and we couldn't load this content. Refreshing the browser may fix the problem"
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked version history but it does not show any previous versions of the file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way of retrieving these OneNote files? The laptop has been reimaged, so accessing the appdata folder is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the notebooks no longer exist in the local driver, and you cannot open them in OneNote Online. You may not be able to get the notebooks back.

 done this four times.&nbsp; I am wondering if I need to download a new copy of Excel.

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. As I understand Excel stops responding when editing the spreadsheet. Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have couple of questions for you:</p>
<p>Which edition of Excel is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>Does this issue occur with specific file or all the files when you try to edit?</p>
<p>If the issue is across specific file, then what is the format and size of the file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to open the Excel file in Excel safe mode and check if you can edit the file.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> Windows key + R</span><span>.</span>
</li><li><span>Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Excel /safe</span></p>
<p>Note: There is space between
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide more information on the issue so that we can assist you further..</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

                    Hello, as I said in subject, this build is unstable for me in core functions.<br />
<br />
Update went so fast from build 15025.<br />
Action center is freezing.<br />
&nbsp;Control panel sometimes wont open and bakcs me to desktop.<br />
&nbsp;Windows explorer and computer closing, back to desktop.<br />
When I try to switch tasks with alt+tab, sometimes apeering emtpy desktop, or normal desktop but I am not able to switch tasks.<br />
Or, I am able to do it in random times.<br />
<br />
When My computer went to sleep, and I turned it on, sign in screen crashed and I rebooted twice.<br />
Start menu opening longer than expected, and without search edit field<br />
When I open settings, pressing tab will close and back to desktop.<br />
Insider hub also wont work, and I am not able to submit feedback about noted issues.<br />
What you suggest?<br />
Can I repair something, or to try again, by reimaging to 525 then upgrading again?<br />
I have healthy system image.

<p>Hard to say at this time.&nbsp; I have a 15031 that is the best yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 14986, I hit the brick wall with a failure at 100% and a rollback.&nbsp; After days of doing everything in the book, and not being the only one, I wiped the hard drive and used Media Creation Tool with USB and BIOS to get back public build.&nbsp; I waited until
 the next new Insiders and used Fast Lane to get back to Insiders in a few hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen the last 2 builds actually fixing a couple of annoying issues I had with Firefox, etc.&nbsp; I had a recent issue where the PC could not come back from Hibernate.&nbsp; On 15025, I removed Fast Boot and this seemed to help.&nbsp; 15031 now has no issue with
 coming back from Hibernate but Fast Boot is now OFF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update - Just now I hibernated my 15031 and it failed to come back.&nbsp; I checked Fast Boot and it had defaulted back to Fast Boot.&nbsp; I turned Fast Boot OFF and it came right back from Hibernate.</p>

            As I can see, I am only one with so negative impact.<br />
Reimaged to 525 than upgraded again to 531, situation is the same.<br />
I will later build 15531 clean instalation for myself and will see &nbsp;how it will behave.<br />
If nothing, will simply reimage to my healthy 525.

            Reading your previous posting it seems that you have had issues before with upgrading, and people have asked about your system, to help you with better answers some info such as make/model or if custom built &nbsp;Motherboard, CPU any 3rd party programs installed,

            I've just done the 15031 on my Surface&nbsp;Pro 4... and rolled straight back to 15025... The&nbsp;Action Centre is very slow to respond for me and the Tiles generally don't do anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't switch Tablet mode on or off for example.&nbsp; Down selected to the Slow
 ring for now, MS You guys really have to get this a lot&nbsp;better... This is one of the worst phases of Insider experience I have had since I&nbsp;joined the program...

<p>Your best course of action is to contact the JAWS manufacturer</p>
<p>and let them know the issue.</p>
<p>They have to make JAWS work with Win 10, not the other way around.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded an Image of build 14393.0 to build 15031, and it works fairly well, with a few small issues...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT... I upgraded an image of Win 7 Pro to Build 15031, and I am having a lot of the same problems you report...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I have taskbar Icons that will not appear even though the program is running... When I try to select which icons appear, I've found that on the settings window the Icons are&nbsp;mislabeled with their function...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Network" Icon is described as "Windows Explorer" for instance...</p>
<p>
</p><p>About any attempt to use a taskbar Icon causes it to hang...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My normally 20 second boot time is now 2 minutes, plus another 2+ minutes for some functions to start...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The funny thing is that the exact same Win 7 Pro Image, and the exact same machine that&nbsp;was upgraded to build 14393 without a problem... Then Build 14393 upgraded to 15031 without a problem..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I should consider myself fortunate that the Win 7 Pro upgraded at all...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All previous 15*** builds have failed at the exact same spot...&nbsp; 29% on the Install Windows 10 window... before the 1st restart</p>

<p>OK, this is getting irritating. I rolled it back to 15025 and it immediately started installing 15031.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If we want to go for Current Branch for Business for our Office 365 ProPlus either online or via a local share we will use the targetversion attribute right?</p>
<p>So if &nbsp;we pin-pint a current version build nr, what will happend to the security updates? Current Branch for Business should still receive security updates every patch tuesday right? but how does that &nbsp;work if one use targetversion? I cant see how this works?</p>
<p>We want to utilize Current Branch for Business and still receive security updates every month...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Kerwin and thanks for your reply, howerver I dont get this... :)</p>
<p>If we use internal GPO to point our clients to a local share, then It shouldnt matter what we have specified within office 365 portal?</p>
<p>our intention is to have testusers run current branch for business for 4 months (lets say version x that we have pin-pointed into targetversion), when 4 months have passed we want to let this x version out to the rest of the users and have the next current
 branch for business release to the testusers.</p>
<p>Is this not possible?</p>
<p>What would be our preferable approach if we want to utilize two groups (testgroup and publicgroup) where the testgroup &nbsp;will verify the package a few months before the public users get the release?</p>
<p>Or can one only have one current branch for business group?</p>
<p>How does other companies approach this?</p>

<p>Hi Ziid,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that Current Branch for Business is the default update branch for Office 365 ProPlus. But you can configure an Office 365 ProPlus installation to use Current Branch or First Release for Current Branch for Business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your requirements, you may deploy <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt455210.aspx#BKMK_FRCBB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt455210.aspx#BKMK_CBB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Current Branch for Business for Office 365 ProPlus</span></a> to the public group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything is unclear, please let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi again, just for clarification...</p>
<p>1) We have no use for TargetVersion if we will go for Current Branch for Business, no security updates will be applied then?</p>
<p>2) If we choose to download content via "online distributipon point" or a local distribution point we can still utilize the current branch for business and first release for current branch for business?</p>
<p>3) first release is receiving tweaks and security updates but no new features?</p>
<p>4) If we manage to get a RSS downloader to download all the released versions to a local share the Office itself will determine (based upon the installation setting or GPO) which branch it is configured to access and only download these files from the local
 share? Is there any what of knowing jut by looking at the share or the build numbers which version is current branch for business and the first release for current branch?</p>
<p><strong>Or... is it &nbsp;so that it' just the current branch for business and first release for current branch for business that is published within the portal so users will not download the latest and greatest cutting edge but instead the accepted version for
 which the user belongs? if we make a group for first release it will download that version, and the rest will download the current branch for business?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Ziid,</p>
<p>1) The Target Version is optional. If you use Current Branch for Business, the Security updates will be applied monthly. For the details about TargetVersion, please refer to<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219426.aspx#BKMK_UpdatesElement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219426.aspx#BKMK_UpdatesElement</a>
<br />
2) Yes.<br />
3) Yes. The new features will be added to the new First Release for Current Branch for Business. After a Current Branch for Business is released, a new First Release for Current Branch for Business is made available to start testing the next Current Branch
 for Business.<br />
4) Yes, it will if you have configured the update branch. To configure the update branch for an Office 365 ProPlus installation, you can use the latest version of the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office Deployment Tool
</a>or use the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Group Policy Administrative Templates files (ADMX/ADML)</a> for Office 2016. Yes, you may refer to the article to check the versions:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/mt465751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/mt465751</a> &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Yes. If you enable First release for some users and they download the Office 365 ProPlus from Office 365 portal, they would use the First Release for Current Branch for Business. Other users would use Current Branch for Business. To enable First Release, please
 refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-release-options-3B3ADFA4-1777-4FF0-B606-FB8732101F47?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    Ok,&nbsp; Do not know if anyone else is having this issue, but every time I start Spartan it does not respond and like the issue I had with ie 11 , windows installer starts and both Spartan and ie&nbsp; just flickers off and on like someone turning a light switch
 off and on very, very fast and then my whole system stops responding.... I'm currently posting this in IE which seems to work great now...

            I have a similar problem.&nbsp; The first time that I opened Spartan it went to msn.&nbsp; But, Spartan would not display any other site from favorites or&nbsp;sites that I manually entered.&nbsp; So, I closed Spartan and reopened it, and now it will not display any sites
 at all including msn.&nbsp; All of the menu options are there including favorites but&nbsp;nothing happens when I attempt to change the settings.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            After attempting to use Spartan some more, I found out what my apparent problem really is.&nbsp; I had mentioned before that I couldn't&nbsp;access&nbsp;any website.&nbsp; The real problem is that Spartan it taking 30 seconds or&nbsp;longer before&nbsp;a website actually appear on
 the screen.&nbsp; So, I assumed I could not access a website when it was really a slow loading issue.&nbsp; Due to the slow response of Spartan, I have gone back to using IE.

            Did you enable International roaming before you left UK ?<br />
Call your UK service provider and ask them to enable International roaming.<br />

            If you mean using a local sim card(Africa) &amp; your phone is locked by UK provider? A locked phone can only be unlock by the the provider who locked it, you can't even use it in UK with a sim from other provider there.<br />

You need to contact the network operator that the handset belongs to, as they are the only people who can officially unlock your handset

            Nokia 6233 and 6234 are very famous for the phrase :<br />
<br />
phone restricted ,inter restriction code .<br />
<br />
this showed up oftenly with me after serving the web ,I didn't have a clue about this code ,and searching up and down for it was of no avail ,and the only way to get phone enabled again was by restarting .<br />
<br />
Thank God this phrase disappeared permanently after updating the firmware .

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not feasible to share files on Skype for Business on Android phone. I totally understand it will be convenient to have this function. Given the situation, we recommend you vote on the feedback below to improve Skype for Business on Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/suggestions/17714023-skype-for-business-clients-on-mobile-device-could" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/suggestions/17714023-skype-for-business-clients-on-mobile-device-could</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you can try sharing files on Outlook for Android or <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-documents-by-using-a-mobile-device-dad9b2ca-d8c0-4685-8d9e-06c008939c73" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">using SharePoint</a></strong>.</p>

If I send messages via PC Suite it used to save them in the sent items folder (on phone &amp; PC) but now no longer does this. Is there a way I can get the software to save a copy?<br />

            Similar problem here - any ideas? Some messages from PC Suite get into the Sent Items folder on my 6230i - some do not. All are 'sent successfully' according to PC Suite. Some are received and some are not. All rather confusing!

            If I'm following OK, sometimes messages are handled as you describe - other times, they do not show up in either the phone's Sent Items folder or in the same folder viewed via PC Suite. It's the 'hit or miss' effect that I don't understand!

            I am having the same issues as the original poster:<br />
<br />
Messages sent from the PC using Nokia PC Suite do not appear the Sent Items of the phone. Messages sent from the handset do appear in Sent Items.<br />
<br />
Additionally, if I set "Delivery Reports" to "Yes" on the handset (Messaging | Message Settings | Text Messages) I do not get them for messages sent through PC Suite. Messages from the handset do provide Delivery Reports. Messages from either PC Suite or the
 handset are received by the recipient, I just have no record of what was sent or when.<br />
<br />
Details of equipment:<br />
<br />
Nokia 6280 V06.10<br />
Nokia 6233 V05.43<br />
<br />
Nokia PC Suite 6.84.10.3 on Windows XP SP2<br />
<br />
Nokia USB cable CA-53<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice.

            your have made the right conclusions, unfortunately the limitation of not having PC sent SMSs saved to phone is a feature of phone/PC Suite.

            From you menu bar choose Format &gt; Style. &nbsp;Your default style is probably Normal so select it and click Modify. &nbsp;Set the paragraph spacing as you would like it and before exiting make sure you mark the box to Add to Template. If you don't mark that box,
 your change will only apply to the current document.

<h2>            GeoFlow feedback&#58; filtering needed</h2>
                    <p>I'm enjoying using GeoFlow and my clients are finding it has a lot of wow-factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One annoying oversight in the product is that you can't (as far as I can see) filter. Let's say I have a PowerPivot model loaded with 10,000 Coke rows and 10,000 Pepsi rows in the same table. I can't just plot Coke and not plot Pepsi. It would be very nice
 to be able to filter like you can in Power View, PivotTables, and every other client tool on the planet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there's a better place to provide feedback, let me know.</p>

            <p>If you open one of your&nbsp;GeoFlow workbooks, and click the smiley in the top right of the GeoFlow window (not the Excel smiley) it will bring up an email directly to the GeoFlow feedback email address at Microsoft. That's the best way to get your suggestion
 directly to the GeoFlow team!</p>

            If it is a template, you should not be opening it. If you have saved it in your Templates folder, it will appear in Word's New dialog. When you double-click on it there, you will get a new, unnamed document based on it. The first time you save, you will
 be doing a Save As but of a new document rather than the template itself.

<br />
The way to use this is with File &gt; New or by double-clicking on the icon. This gives you a fresh Word document based on your template.
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Templates in Microsoft Word</a><br />
<br />
What you are describing sounds like the behavior of a document (not template) with the option checked to update the document styles from the template and being attached to normal.dotm.<br />
<br />
Did you make this a template (.dotx) file by using SaveAs from within Word or did you rename it from within Windows to have the .dotx extension. The latter will not create a true Word template.<br />

            Thanks for the comments - both are helpful.
<div><br />
<div>I did save it via Save As within Word and amended the file type via the drop-down box to Word Template, but it doesn't show in my File --&gt; New --&gt; Available Templates within Word so I imagine I will have to re-do this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Only issue is I use this from a shared drive which others also access via a remote access connection - so would they all have to save it as a template within Word on their machines as well? Not sure how that would work when I need to update the template...</div>

    <title>Nokia 2626 screen legibility outside - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mobile99---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 2626 screen legibility outside</h2>
                    I find that the screen is illegible (making the phone unusable for sending texts or making calls) when using the phone outside especially in sunlight because the combination of screen brightness and contrast are insufficient. I have got Settings&gt;Display&gt;Display
 Contrast set to maximum. Does anyone else have this problem and does anyone have a solution, please? I did not have this problem with my 6310.

            The screen on the Nokia 2626 is a CSTN which is not suitable for daylight viewing.<br />
<br />
The CSTN uses red, green and blue filters to display color. However, CSTN displays typically suffer from lower image quality and slower response time than TFT displays.<br />
<br />

<p><br />
I find some of the mathematical functions in Excel developed in a somewhat inconsistent manner.&nbsp; But, I'm sure that, even if Microsoft wanted to, it's too late to change any of the functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may want to use the longer but more reliable and consistent approach.&nbsp; To round the number&nbsp;x to a multiple of the number m, use ROUND(x/m,0)*m</p>

<p>
</p><p>Greetings. This is Alan Wu from Office 365 forum support. Glad to assist you for your case here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, I suggest you try printing it in Outlook Web App (OWA) since you are using the Office 365. For printing in OWA, you can refer to<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/printing-messages-5c8a3b81-c6d2-4bd0-8dc2-a8ae8718eaba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/printing-messages-5c8a3b81-c6d2-4bd0-8dc2-a8ae8718eaba</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it works in OWA, my understanding is that the issue is more likely to be related to the Outlook side. Firstly, we should ensure the Outlook OutIprnt file is OK. You can refer to the following steps to rebuild OutIprnt file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click Start, point to Search, and then click for Files or Folders.<br />
2. In Search for files or folders named, type<br />
3. Outlprnt, and then click Search Now.<br />
4. Right-click the Outlprnt file, and then click Rename.<br />
5. Type a new name for the Outlprnt file, (such as Outlprnt.old), and then close Find.<br />
6. Restart Outlook, and then make any change to the print styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another hand, please make sure the settings, for example, the printing style like paper size (A4) "Memo Style"/Paper tab/ set as A4" are correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will further assist you if it is necessary. Looking forward to your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help. Unfortunately, the step you sent me didn't work. My users are able to print to&nbsp;<span>Outlook Web App (OWA) but, it is a pain for them to be switching between outlook and logging&nbsp;into webmail.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If there's any other solution you think could be helpful please share for testing.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Prince,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your update.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'd like to confirm whether you have re-started the Outlook client or re-started the Windows after you performed the 6 steps. Moreover, please let me know whether the issue persists with all the emails
 or just specific one. I have known that this issue may occur while the user is printing a large size email (for example, the email contains many images).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you mentioned that the issue occurs after you upgraded the users to Office 365, do you mean it works fine while the users use other mailboxes (ie, hotmail, outlook.com) in the Outlook client or
 anything else? And, for the affected users, are they have something in common, ie they are using the same Outlook client version (16.0.****.****)?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, we still focuse on the Outlook client side since the users are able to print in OWA. Please make sure all the affected users' clients are newly updated. In addition, you can try using the Office
 365 Offcat to scan the Outlook client via&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2812744/office-configuration-analyzer-tool-offcat-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2812744/office-configuration-analyzer-tool-offcat-information</a>.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Problems in Lumia 535 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems in Lumia 535</h2>
                    <p>I am regretting buying this phone from day one. I have so many issue that I forgot count of them. Few of them are :-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Phone's touch is very bad, below par. And it is worse while charging, I don't know if there is a problem just in my set or its with all Lumia 535 device but while charging my device is almost unusable. It does't response to some tap and then suddenly
 will give 4 - 5 response to 1 tap.. It makes it impossible to use while charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Phone music player stops by itself while travelling. Works fine in home but don't know what happens while travelling. May be it has something against movement or something, I don't know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Multitasking is not good. App doesn't work in background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Windows app store has very few applications compared to apple's app store and android's play store. Its frustrating that even very popular apps are not available for windows and those&nbsp;available, gets new features and updates very late as compared to their
 android version. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and many more...</p>

<div><br />
</div>

            By default macros are stored in the normal template, normal.dotm. It appears that yesterday you somehow managed to replace the old normal.dotm with a new blank one. If you have no backup and the old file is not in the recycle bin, then the contents of
 the old file with the macros is lost.<br />
