<h2>            Error message when trying to forward email</h2>
                    <p>I cannot forward emails from my Hotmail account.</p>
<p>When I try to forward them I receive an error message:</p>
<p>"Couldn’t send the following message right now. Please try again later."</p>
<p>However, it doesn't matter when I try, or how often I try, it won't forward emails.</p>
<p>I have no issue sending new emails, and no issue receiving them.</p>
<p>Additionally, it makes no difference if there is an attachment or not.</p>

            Hello DebraBourdeau, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having difficulty forwarding your Hotmail e-mails. I know how important this is to you, and rest assured, I will try my best to help you to resolve this together expeditiously.
<br />
<br />
Could you please provide us additional information about the issue? <br />
<br />
1. Is your Hotmail account verified with phone number? <br />
2. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far? <br />
<br />
If your Hotmail account is not verified with a <strong>phone number</strong>, please do so here:
<a href="https://account.live.com/reputationcheck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
This is to lift the restrictions on your account, since there are many users who abuse Outlook platform to spam and scam other online users.
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile may I suggest you to delete your <strong>Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies</strong> and clear
<strong>browser caches</strong> then restart the browser? It could be a <strong>browser-related issue</strong>.

<p>Thank you for trying. I did everything you recommended but am still unable to forward emails from my Hotmail account when I'm using Firefox. When I use Chrome it works just fine.</p>
<p>I do have my Microsoft account protected with my phone number; I cleared the cache/cookies; I'm current on Java dn Silverlight; basically I followed your guidance exactly.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>I've have the Hotmail account since 1996 and the same laptop for over a year. This problem came out of the blue a month ago, maybe two. I cannot figure out what the heck I changed or did to cause this.</p>
<p>All help is appreciated, so thank you very much.</p>
<p>Deb</p>

            Hello DebraBourdeau, <br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply. The information you have provided above is very helpful towards resolving this issue.
<br />
<br />
Please be informed that the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox seems to be incompatible with Outlook.com
<br />
<br />
You may like to use <strong>Firefox ESR</strong> (Extended Support Release) instead.
<br />
<br />
See: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizat...</a> <br />
<br />
Otherwise, I strongly recommend <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> or <strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong>. They are most optimised for Outlook.com
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps! <br />
<br />
Regards, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

<p>
</p><p>I have a Nokia E 71 that I am regularly using to browse internet for the last 5 years. Now, for the last some months, I am experiencing difficulty in using mail sites like mail.yahoo.com or gmail. Other website can be accessed normally but when i try to
 open this two sites, it do not connect to the server and yields an error message displaying that the connection can not be made. &nbsp;Initially the problem occurred while using built in browser but i used to access mail using opera mini. But now, even opera mini
 failed to load.</p>

<li>Are you using Opera Mini 7.1 for Java or for Symbian/S60? Please, open the built-in Internet browser, go to
<a href="http://m.opera.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">m.opera.com</a>&nbsp;and select the variant for Symbian/S60.</li><li>Are you accessing Gmail via its mobile webpage? In Opera Mini, please, go for&nbsp;<a href="http://m.gmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">m.gmail.com</a>.</li></ol>
<p>If the answer is Yes to both, and you still experience issues: Do you get any error message? We need that word for word. I tried the above on my Nokia E66. The Nokia E66 has the same software as a Nokia E71. Works. However, I did not try to log-in because
 I do not have a Gmail account. If we know your issue in more detail, I try to replicate it thoroughly.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.<br />
1.&nbsp;Are you able to delete the Favorites in the Internet Explorer?<br />
2.&nbsp;Did you try deleting the Favorites restarting the Microsoft Edge?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you some steps which you can try resolving this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Check if you can <strong>delete the favorites in Safe Mode.<br />
</strong>1.&nbsp;Click start and search Settings app -&gt; Update and security -&gt; Recovery.
<br />
2.&nbsp;In the corresponding right pane of Recovery screen shown below, click on Restart now under advanced startup.<br />
3.&nbsp;After restarting your system, select the Troubleshoot option.<br />
4.&nbsp;Select advanced options under Troubleshoot screen.<br />
5.&nbsp;Click on Startup Settings.<br />
6.&nbsp;Click Restart and follow the onscreen steps to go to Safe Mode with networking.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue resolves then perform a clean boot<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Perform a <strong>clean boot</strong><br />
to disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> A <strong>clean bo</strong>ot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a
 program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to even <strong>check opening the website in Internet Explorer through Microsoft Edge.<br />
</strong>1.&nbsp;Open a website in Microsoft Edge.<br />
2.&nbsp;Right top corner you can see “. . . “ click on this.<br />
3.&nbsp;Select open with Internet Explorer.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us informed if the issue is resolved. We are glad to help you further.</p>

            I have exactly the same issue with Microsoft edge - the buttons on the favourites bar cannot be resized to icons and when they spill off the edge you cannot delete them.<br />
It looks like edge has less functionality that explorer so I may just revert back unless Microsoft can upgrade this new browser.

<p>I do not think there is anything wrong with my PC it is just the Edge Favourite Bar is not as flexible as the Explorer Favourites Bar.</p>
<p>if you have any say with MS please ask them to revert to the Explorer Favourites Bar on Edge it would make things so much easier.</p>
<p>As much as I do not want to go backwards if nothing can be done then I will have to revert back&nbsp;to Explorer

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for fast respond, app is helpful for diagnostic, but it seems it´s all ok and updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT: I discovered a way to solve this problem so maybe it will help others too, because on this forum is so many same topics with NO solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems problems appear with verification code for MIcrosoft account:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-when you start new (or empty) phone you must create account, then it send you verification code on your second e-mail</p>
<p>- I didn´t get this code for a very long time, I also refresh my 2 e-mail- nothing, so I skip it- and that´s why my phone couldn´t connect with store apps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go on Settings- Sync- Turn on passwords. </p>
<p>Turning on passwords need Microsoft code again, so the code was send on my e-mail
</p>
<p>and apps- store were connected and I can start to use them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now sadly another problem that facebook messenger doesn´t work anymore- it says that is my version out of date with 29 march.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>What email program are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to "Attach" the resume file to an email.&nbsp; That is usually done using an icon that looks like a paperclip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also have the option of just saving the resume file to your OneDrive. Then you can retrieve it when you are at the other location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, it is probably a good idea to save or print the resume file to PDF format. That way you can be sure that there won't be any format changes on the other computer. Then email or upload to onedrive your PDF resume file.</p>

<h2>            Missing Microsoft Word 15.0 Object Library</h2>
                    <p>I have a large Excel 2010 spreadsheet with Macros that is also updated by a user with Office 365. After receiving the file back from this user, I receive an error related to a Missing&nbsp;Microsoft Word 15.0 Object Library. How can I fix this error? I am certainly
 not making any references to Word content or functions. I have tried checking off the box for the 'Missing&nbsp;Microsoft Word 15.0 Object Library" in References, but it says the operation is not permitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

            <p>You don't have Word 15, so you cannot apply its object library. Change your references to use Late Binding to Word and then neither of you will have a problem. This essentially means unchecking the reference to Word, and changing the DIM statements to use
 Object instead of a any reference to Word or its commands, and any code that uses wd<em>Name</em> must use the numeric equivalent of the command.<br />
</p>
<p>If you have any difficulty doing this, post your code.</p>

<p>My wife has had the Asha 303 for some time and she has not yet encountered the issues you complained about, although she doesn't use BT a lot, so not able to hide it while receiving would not be an issue for her. Which firmware version you have? Complaining
 about bugs is kind of pointless without that information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One more thing: camera night modes are hardly very useful with the kind of camera the 303 has. The default automatic settings will work in low light as well as can be expected from the low end camera module. In other words night capability is hardware limited.
 It's not 808 Pureview, you know.</p>

<p>shaktyxx: This is a known issue and we are investigating/trying to reproduce the error. There should be hopefully a workaround solution eventually available, but unfortunately at the moment the only way to have those applications fixed is to take the phone
 it to a Nokia Care service point for refurbishing/reflashing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also which SW version are you using in the phone at the moment (type *#0000# in the homescreen to see this)? Latest available SW update should be . Updating or reinstalling the SW will not fix those broken application however, it requires a complete refurbish
 of the phone (basically restoring the device back to "factory" state), which can't be currently done with Nokia Suite, only at a Care service point.

<p>Also which SW version are you using in the phone at the moment (type *#0000# in the homescreen to see this)? Latest available SW update should be . Updating or reinstalling the SW will not fix those broken application however, it requires a complete refurbish
 of the phone (basically restoring the device back to "factory" state), which can't be currently done with Nokia Suite, only at a Care service point.</p>

<p>A question: since we haven't encountered those issues yet and we have already updated to 14.76, is it likely that those issues could surface in my wife's phone and if yes, is there anything we could do to prevent that from happening?</p>

<p>in that case you don't have probably anything to worry about. The issue is that occasionally when Nokia has rolled out a new update for the browser/other application (which are not currently delivered with the actual device SW update, but as a separate download),
 the application update process has failed, and caused the application to break. This would not seem to affect all consumers, only parts of them, but we are of course taking the issue seriously and looking to find the root cause and solution for it.</p>

<p>Sir , I did visit nokia care center and they told me that I have to wait 15 days to fix it ! And basically it's not my fault ! I didn't do any thing wrong to be lamed and going to care center with new phone doesn't make sense !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My SW is 14.76 . And reinstalling software or hard rest is useless already. nokia should make reflashing device is possible on nokia suite . We can't&nbsp;visit&nbsp;nokia care every month. This is a bad joke.</p>

            I bought my 303 last May but I dont suffer these problems. These are the problems that I encounter:<br />
1. You can only use video streaming when you are connected in WiFi<br />
2. The phone automatically locks even you are still using it<br />
3. When you are connecting in the WiFi there is a message "Network cannot be used to connect to the Internet" but when I used another phone I was able to connect without this message.<br />
4. The phone switches off automatically<br />
5. When you pause the video player it doesnt stop it is still playing. For you to stop the video you need to go to the media library. The stop icon is replace with the play icon that is what I am saying, the video is still playing.<br />
<br />
My wish<br />
1. Maps version should be updated.<br />
2. Swipe to unlock, the C3-01 and X3 touch and type recieved these functions through software update<br />
3. Notification Bar like the Asha Touch Series<br />
4. The same browser with the Asha Touch series.<br />
I hope this would happen.<br />

<p>We haven't encountered those other issues you mentioned, but your suggestions are excellent. Especially the maps apps should be updated. I downloaded maps thru Nokia Suite but they were not compatible with the Maps app! No error message or warning. Nokia
 Suite just installed them on the Memory card, but the Maps app said that they are not compatible and refused to start. I had to delete he whole Cities folder to make it work again, but it has no maps. The phone had no preinstalled maps, by the way. Probably
 you could download compatible maps directly from the phone, but since the phone doesn't have a GPS we haven't bothered yet.&nbsp; Not a show stopper for us, but of course it's still a bug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried updating the browser separately (although it seems to be a little dangerous). My wife's phone came with the 1.5 but could be updated to 2.20. I am not sure which version the Asha Touch phones have other than they now seem to call it "Nokia
 Xpress Browser" (don't you love the name changes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I doubt the notification bar will come to Touch &amp; Type phones, but swipe to unlock would be nice.</p>

    <title>Timezone issue with o365 groups shared calendars - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter bowers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Timezone issue with o365 groups shared calendars</h2>
                    <p>When using an o365 Group shared calendar I create an event in a timezone which is not my current local timezone. When I save/send it correctly displays the adjusted time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I go over to view email and come back to the calendar and the timezone difference has been RE-applied, thus doubling the difference between the timezones. I started at noon and since my local timezone is 7 hours ahead it displayed as 7pm. When I come
 back it displays as 2am the following day - 7 MORE hours ahead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is so bizarre I went ahead and recorded a video demonstrating the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://youtu.be/HFSaADmPlIs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I'm using Desktop Outlook 2016.</p>

 know sometimes it takes a while for settings to propogate through the system, so I don't know how definitive that test was...</p>

<p>We haven’t received reports regarding the issue except for the thread. It could be a tenant related issue. That’s why we’d like to escalate the case to our related team to help you with the issue. However, without your tenant information and a reachable
 Office 365 admin, we’re not able to escalate the case. It’s not feasible for end users to handle the issue. Please involve an admin here to troubleshoot the issue. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Public verses Private Office 365 Groups&#58; Can I restrict or allow external users&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>

<p>For my current client, I have setup a couple of &nbsp;private groups for both set of managers: Senior &amp; General Managers. &nbsp;Now I come to the Staff group. Having build a number of intranets on SharePoint; &nbsp;I typically give &nbsp;access given to most content to the
 "Everyone" group. &nbsp;Hence, &nbsp;I am thinking this Staff group might map to a public Office 365 group. &nbsp;There are advantages with less centralised management of membership however, &nbsp; In the new cloud paradigm this does make me a bit nervous. &nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Can I regulate &nbsp;or get notified if &nbsp;external / licenses users can join this - I am talking about a few number of valid &nbsp;users who part of the sister organisation that don't require a mailbox, profile etcf? &nbsp;Whereas I wouldn't want external users joining
 as a rule</p>
<p>2) Can I assume that this public group is not going be 'discovered' by all those hackers out there with too much time on their hands ;-(</p>

<p>Hi Westerdaled,</p>
<p>Here are the answers.<br />
1. If you want to get notified if external users can join a group in a site collection in SharePoint Online, firstly you need to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-external-sharing-for-your-SharePoint-Online-environment-c8a462eb-0723-4b0b-8d0a-70feafe4be85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enable external sharing</a> and set a notification via <strong>Site Settings&gt;People and groups&gt;Select the group&gt;Settings&gt;Group Settings&gt;Allow requests to join/leave this group</strong>. Then you can share the site collection with them and when they submit a
 request of joining the group via the URL of the group, you will be emailed to determine if they can join the group if you are a group owner. If they haven’t mailbox set up on their computers, they can know if they can join via Outlook Web App.<br />
2. As I said above, only when a site collection administrator shares a site collection with the external users, they will access the group to submit their requests of joining the group via the URL of the group. So generally, the group will not be discovered
 by hackers.</p>
<p>If something is misunderstood, please post back and we will provide further help.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Cliff</p>

<p>1) I think external sharing is enabled by default when a SharePoint Office 365 tenant is created. &nbsp;Currently Office 365 Group: Site collections are hidden from Admins . &nbsp;Hence I can't go into Site -&gt; People and groups to make any changes.</p>
<p>Also the Set-UnifiedGroup &nbsp;commandlet is equally limited .</p>
<p>I think the behavior you describe &nbsp;is applicable to all other site collections. &nbsp; I guess my issue is both applicable to public and private groups - say one one of the group owners invite an external user.</p>

<p>hi daniel,</p>
<p>to clarify the issue, how do you create the group? could you give us with some screenshots related to your steps?<br />
to upload a screenshot, click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> and then click
<strong>edit/insert media</strong>.</p>
<p>from your description, it seems that you create a public group in<strong> outlook web app</strong>. when creating, if you click
<strong>public-anyone can see what’s inside</strong>, external users can enter the group via the url of the group to edit the group files. there is no settings for your notification about who edited the files, but you can see who edited the files when you enter
 the group as it is public. if the external users send messages in the group and you click
<strong>subscribe from email for this group</strong>, you will receive an email of notification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7a229ba3-1502-48dd-ba76-06bb93ebae8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7a229ba3-1502-48dd-ba76-06bb93ebae8d" /></a></p>
<p>if you click <strong>private-only approved members can see what’s inside</strong> when creating, the external users can enter the group via the url of the group, but they will see nothing because it is only visible for the members in the group.</p>
<p>please let us know your updates at your convenience.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<p>As you have suggested I created two <strong>Private Groups</strong> and one <strong>
Public Group</strong>&nbsp;via <strong>Outlook Web App</strong>.&nbsp; The screen dump is very similar to yours&nbsp;btw,&nbsp;&nbsp;All groups are set to&nbsp;receive emails from any user but no users are currently set to:
<b>Subscribe from email for this group</b> .&nbsp;&nbsp; I want the users to get used to the UI before flooding their individual&nbsp;inboxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the <b>Private Group </b>&nbsp;I think&nbsp; I have the balance right esp when considering these&nbsp;are to be populated with&nbsp;managers. I do know&nbsp;of one
<strong>External User</strong> ( No inbox needed) will join this group</p>
<p>Conversely, the <strong>Public Group</strong> really worries me, as I don't want anybody simply joining this, only all the internal users in the tenant and an invited External user ( the same person as above) .&nbsp;&nbsp; To clarify this organisation is made up of
 A and B departments and I want keep the user membership mostly restricted to Department B.The&nbsp;<b>Public Group</b> sounds a bit like given a standard SharePoint Extranet anonymous access and this something I avoid !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless somebody convinces me otherwise.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am going to delete the &nbsp;<b>Public Group&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;and recreate it as
<b>Private Group&nbsp;. </b>Thereafter, add&nbsp;all users from both of the other Private Groups, plus the rest of the staff to it.&nbsp; I can advise on whether each user should subscribe as well.&nbsp; This has been a useful discussion, thanks.</p>

    <title>A simple settings question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frustrated as usual  say:</h3>
<h2>            A simple settings question</h2>
                    
<p>My internet explorer would always go to any address without my adding the .com at the end. For example, if I want to go to a new website (one I have never visited before) and I type in NewSite in the address bar, it would take me to NewSite.com.&nbsp; Now it
 would take me google search results for the term NewSite. I don't know why the change happened (how I screwed it up).&nbsp;I don't think I changed&nbsp;any toolbar or search&nbsp;settings. I know it's got to be a simple fix, but I just can't figure it out!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

            Hi Don,<br />
Thanks for the help. I should have given you more info.&nbsp;<br />
Unfortunatly, that did not do it. But, using the info from that option I found the information on another site. It turns out that it is a function&nbsp;of&nbsp;the google toolbar - you can set it to search and direct to a site based of the words in the address bar, so
 if you put in microsoft, it takes you to microsoft.com&nbsp; Also, if you put in something else with similar wording, it will take you there.... like if you put in "home page for abc" it will take you to abchomepage.com. I also found out it only works on IE 6 &amp;
 7. I have IE 8. Oh well.

<h2>            SharePoint&#58;  Change The Look --&#62; Try ty it out.   Hangs, never loads</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying the change the look for my SharePoint site to another out of the box theme in site settings--&gt; change the look.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had done this many times in the past with no issue, but a couple of weeks ago, it stopped working for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;After making my selection,
 and selecting "try it out", &nbsp;it switches to the "Working on it....This shouldn't take long" screen and hangs there indefinitely.&nbsp;&nbsp;To&nbsp;rule out&nbsp;a broken theme, I have tried several and&nbsp;none of them load.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have left it there all day, and it still never loads.&nbsp;
 I have changed nothing with the code itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not have the experience to make code changes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't even use SP Designer to make changes, I do everything within the site itself, so I find it doubtful that I broke the coding somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Has anyone else
 had this problem or have and idea how to resolve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello Atli,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for you reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, the external users can be added as guests to your team. Please see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-guests-to-a-team-fccb4fa6-f864-4508-bdde-256e7384a14f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to get the detailed information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However, you need to confirm if the Guest Access feature has been turned on in your organization. For your reference:

<p>When copying a slide from PowerPoint 2013 that has slide numbers, the slide number will change when it is pasted into another application.&nbsp; Does not appear to affect slide 1, but subsequent slides do not show the correct slide number.</p>

<p>Hi Admin IT,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing the experience with us, we could understand the frustration when encountering the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, we suggest you restore the deleted files from recycle bin. You can refer to this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restore-deleted-files-or-folders-in-onedrive-949ada80-0026-4db3-a953-c99083e6a84f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Restore deleted files or folders in OneDrive</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we suggest you go to Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center and use Audit log search to check the activities in OneDrive for business. You may find any user or administrator's activities regarding
 the files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some articles for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/search-the-audit-log" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Search the audit log for user and admin activity in Office 365</a></p>

Hi Admin IT,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, automate settings like
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/overview-of-retention-policies-5e377752-700d-4870-9b6d-12bfc12d2423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Retention policy</a>, <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/overview-of-labels-af398293-c69d-465e-a249-d74561552d30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
label policy</a> may delete files automatically based on the settings and show up as “system account” in the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-office-365-audit-log-search-on-or-off-e893b19a-660c-41f2-9074-d3631c95a014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Audit log</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may check whether there’s any Retention policy or Label policy there.
</p>
<p>1.To check Retention Policy, you can go to Security &amp; Compliance Center &gt; Data Governance &gt; Retention &gt; Select each Policy there and check whether any of them is active and applies to the situation.</p>
<p>2.To check Label Policy, you can go to Security &amp; Compliance Center &gt; Classifications &gt; Label Policies &gt; Select each Policy there and check whether any of them is active and applies to the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If above doesn't help, could you let us know the following information for troubleshooting?</p>
<p>1.Are you using OneDrive sync client and sync OneDrive files to your computer?
</p>
<p>2.Witch device are you using? Windows or Mac?</p>
<p>What changes have you done before the issue happens? Update Windows?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's start working on this by checking if there's a pending phone software update. To check it, just go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update and security</strong> &gt; <strong>Phone update</strong> &gt;
<strong>Check for updates</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating the phone software, we suggest that you perform a soft reset. To soft reset the phone, just press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.
<br />
<br />
Let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Error while archiving folder &#34;Deleted Items&#34; in store &#34;Business Contact Manager&#34;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
On one of my computers I am getting this error when Auto Archive runs in Outlook 2007 (SP2) on Windows XP SP3:<br />
<br />
Error while archiving folder "Deleted Items" in store "Business Contact Manager".&nbsp; Could not complete the operation because the service provider does not support it.<br />
<br />
I connect to a BCM database on the local Windows 2003 server.&nbsp; This computer is a part of a domain.&nbsp; I have gone into properties of the Deleted Items folder under BCM and set it to "Do not archive items in this folder".&nbsp; However, the error persists each time
 Auto Archive is run.<br />
<br />
Is there a fix for this?

                    Can remove once with /cleanreminder but they return and all new events/tasks show two reminders. Does this have to do with multiple .pst files?

<h2>            Multiple lines in graph, but data starting &#38; stopping at different points, how to stop line plummeting to zero.</h2>
                    <p>
Hi</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I’m setting<span>&nbsp; </span>up some multiple line graphs with data by the week ie week 1 through to week 52.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I am picking up relevant data from other tabs within the same workbook as the graphs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This data is feed through to a tab called AUTOData <span>&nbsp;</span>and then I am selecting the data from this tab to create the graphs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, on occasion one of the lines within the graph may not have data entered until week 3 (all the others have data from week 1) and sometimes one line within a graph may cease to have data at week 44 rather than 52.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
How can I get the graph simply to show no data on these occasions rather than having the line plummeting down to zero.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I have tried just selecting the data range.</p>
<p>
I have tried using the formula: (IFB5&gt;0,B5,NA())</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
But this does not work.<span>&nbsp; </span>Can anyone help please.</p>

            Do you want the line to break where there is no data, or do you want the two ends of the line to join?
<div><br />
<div>I think your solution should work if you want them to join instead of the line going to zero.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>=If(B5=0,NA(),B5)</div>
<div>Where B5 contains the number to plot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The result when B5 is zero will show #N/A, but you can use conditional formatting to hide it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>To break the line where there is no data you'll need to delete the value from the cell.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            office suites.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have recently downloaded Nokia Ovi Suite for use with my Nokia 5230. I have managed to sync all my messages and contact without a hitch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is though, is it possible to password protect the suite so that I have to sign into it when I run it on the PC rather than it just opening and all my personal information is available ?</p>

<p>Hi. Please use your Windows account for protecting your Nokia Ovi Suite content. This way all your private stuff is protected by Windows account username / password combination.</p>
<p>- Make sure, that Windows requires username / password to start Windows session</p>
<p>- If there's multiple users in your PC, create own username / password for each user</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            SharePoint Site mailbox not appearing in Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>I have an issue with several users on Office 365 where the sharepoint site inboxes do not show up in their Outlook.</p>
<p>This happens for some users and not others. All users are members of the SharePoint site.</p>
<p>It also happens to me on my desktop but not on my laptop. I have researched the issue and can't seem to find any answers.</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Oliver,</p>
<p>This problem may related to the Office version. If the Office is downloaded and installed from a plan such as Business Premium, it will not support site mailbox.<br />
If it’s downloaded from a higher plan which including Office Pro Plus, then the site mailbox can be displayed in the Outlook client. For the details, please check:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Prepare-for-using-site-mailboxes-in-Office-365-6381daa5-3d98-4629-972d-d19e1dc48c1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Prepare for using site mailboxes in Office 365</a>.</p>
<p>For this situation, please check whether the problematic Outlook are downloaded together with Office from the plan which doesn’t support using site mailbox in Outlook.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry Huang</p>
