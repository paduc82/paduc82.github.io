    <title>Surface Pro 3 cannot install WIndows Update from Win 8.1 to Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 cannot install WIndows Update from Win 8.1 to Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I bought my Surface Pro 3 just before Christmas last year. &nbsp;In August I noticed problems with video playback in iTunes- &nbsp;playback would hang every 20 seconds. &nbsp;Eventually I got around to resetting the unit in an attempt to improve the performance. &nbsp;During
 the windows update process I would have a 131 step install - and I would get a fatal installation error after step ~90. &nbsp;I have refreshed my unit 4 times (complete wipe and attempted a fresh install) with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get back to Win 8.1, but that's not where I want to stay. &nbsp;I am also afraid to do win update for fear of the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't just take this back to my local Microsoft store since I will be working in S. Korea for the next 3.5 months until Dec 20.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Subnukeman,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Initially, I suggest you to run Windows Update troubleshooter to fix the problem.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It makes sure that your computer is connected to the Internet, and checks to see whether your network adapter and Windows Update services are running correctly.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Type troubleshooting in the search bar.</span></li><li>
<span>Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Under<strong> System&nbsp;and Security, </strong>click<strong> Fix problems with Windows Updates.</strong></span></li><li>
<span>Follow the on screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After running the troubleshooter, let us install the available Windows updates and check if the issue persist.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Hope it helps.</span></span></p>

            <p>I had tried to install the Windows updates before running the troubleshooter (But I had done this step before to no avail). &nbsp;Right now I am getting the following message after attempting to install a 145 step Windows and Firmware update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Fatal error C0000102 applying update operation 3361 of 24431(rdpcor...)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I will have to restart my machine and hope I can enter into the recovery mode. &nbsp;I am not happy. &nbsp;Up until July 30th this machine worked fine, and now it is essentially bricked. &nbsp;I just shut it down, and now I can't restart it - I'm going to bed, hopefully
 in the morning it will at least start-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am connected to the internet - that's how I get these updates that won't install properly</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider myself to by computer literate - I have built for myself about 12 computers in the last 15 years, and am familiar with the traditional CD boot/recovery method.</p>

            <p>I have tried various types of automated repairs - the only thing that sort-of works is completely refreshing the drive and reinstalling 8.1. &nbsp;At least I get to the windows desktop and I can run the basics - but everything is still not alright, itunes won't
 install etc.. &nbsp;(no, don't even get me started on the failure that is Xbox video - ever tried it offline during a 12hr transpacific flight?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to upgrade to windows 10 I get the installation error. &nbsp;Problem is that once in 8.1 there is a massive 145 item update plus firmware, and then I get an install error as described above. &nbsp;I think I have tried every permutation in the recovery sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need your help - I am relatively clever with these things, so don't be afraid to get me into the command prompts.</p>

            Having exactly the same issue on an ASUS tablet. &nbsp;The tablet works fine when I return it to factory settings, but chokes when it tries to apply a Windows Update. &nbsp;Tried the Troubleshooter, tried the automatic repairs. &nbsp;Nothing works, except wiping the
 system and going back to the factory settings. Then it happens again the next time the system tries to install a Windows Update.

<h2>            Can&#39;t edit my photos in Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10 Pro (on my Dell M4400 laptop computer) when I click on the Windows (Start?) button at the extreme lower left of my screen and then click on "Photos" and then click on a photo, it opens up the photo.&nbsp; But then when I try to edit it (by clicking
 on the "Edit" (pencil shaped icon) toward the top right of the screen I get the error message "Can't Edit.&nbsp; We're having trouble opening this file for editing."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get this error message for all the photos I've opened, whether they are on the computer's desktop or on my OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:&nbsp; As of 8/27/2015 this problem is still unresolved...</p>

            <p>I had this exact same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following corrected it for me and will hopefully help someone in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My setup is that I have recently upgraded from Win 7 Pro to Win 10 Pro.</p>
<p>I am using a microsoft account to log in. This the first time I have used this feature.</p>
<p>All my media is on a secondary hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially using the photo app enabled me to see photos but not edit. I got the "Can't Edit.&nbsp; We're having trouble opening this file for editing." Trying the above steps did not fix it for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began to realise it may be a UAC control issue since when placing new media in this location it showed the security sign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right clicking on my media folder (infact I clicked on the hard disk since it is all devoted to media) and changing the security of the 'Authenticated Users' to Full Control, making sure everything was ticked, fixed it for me. A dialog box was shown with
 all the files security settings rapidly changing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this point onwards the photo app could edit (because presumably now it had permission too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Doug</p>

<p>Hey, <br />
<br />
So I just called Xbox Live Customer Support, and I wish to file a complaint - not about the agent (they were just grand) - but regarding the outcome of my query.
<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if M$ offer an email address to which one can&nbsp;escalate complaints about the Xbox Live "service" to?
<br />
<br />
Cheers. <br />

<p>I agree with Temhotabot on this. But you can also try to call Xbox Customer Support again and ask them if you can have an email to file a complaint. If this is regarding billing/payments and all that kind of stuff you will need to contact them also. Hope
 this helps! Have a great day!</p>

<p>I cant bare to speak to them on the phone again, I'd not be able to hold my tongue. I wanted to use email for a back and forth dialogue, as "feedback" generally is a one way communication.</p>
<p>My issue mainly is that I moved from the UK to France 5 years ago, and have not been able to subscribe to Gold since (without use of Gamecards) and was told all those years ago that "under no circumstances would I be able to change my XBL accounts regional
 setting", even when I offered to send them my tenancy agreement, working contract and all sorts.</p>
<p>Now, 5 years on, I've moved to Ireland, and now I cannot even purchase any games using M$ points since "its not available from my current location". To my knowledge, the IE and UK store are identical apart from the currency offered :P</p>
<p>My only option they say is to either start all over again (no chance) or send my HDD off to a friend in the UK and have them download the content I want (lol! I don't call that an option). I asked if I could proxy in and they said it would be against the
 Terms. Whilst they would never ever find out, I'm a stickler for sticking to the rules.</p>
<p>I work for a large international gaming company in the account support department, a very similar outfit to this (Blizzard Entertainment) and we've always allowed regional changes with a submission of proof of address and residency in the new region, and
 we're smallfry compared to M$, so I cannot work out why such a system is not in place. In this day in age it's a joke - I barely know anyone of my old school class who live in the UK still - it's not "rare" that people leave their homeland these days.</p>
<p>I'll try the feedback option, but failing any progression on this, I'll simply lose my remaining 11 months Gold membership and leave 4,500 M$ points on my account to rot :(</p>
<p>Sucks so hard. Get with the times M$. Hear my voice :(</p>

<p>Unfortunately it renders me unable to enjoy the XBL products and services, and has wasted 100s of euros. I wish I understood the methods for the madness, because right now it makes no sense at all. 5 Years this has been an issue, and I'm still no closer
 to resolution and judging by the lack of change over the years, I'll continue to be unable to make use of the XBL services. I really don't want to use my PS3.</p>
<p>I do appreciate that you guys dont want people to change region on a whim - to avoid cheating store restrictions (I know countries like Finland have a bare store, compared to other European regions), but there is no reason why with enough documentation that
 this isn't possible to change for people with legitimate reasons.</p>
<p>Miss Portia, do you know if there is a complaints email/escalation process I can follow in order to have a dialogue with someone of higher stature (no offence intended).</p>

<p>There is no "email us" option on that page nor submit feedback.</p>
<p>I am extremely upset but more disappointed that xbox would cancel the family gold option of 4 users for $99 per year. I contact customer support through chat to try to understand my options. The conversation started out great but I became increasingly frustrated
 because of my lack of options and the changes to the website. The controls and interface a year ago was much easier to navigate than it is now. The conversation lasted almost 40 minutes and i felt like I had accomplished nothing. I can NOT justify spending
 4x$60 per year for my family to use xbox live. That's insane.</p>
<p>I do not intend to continue my subscription due to the 140% increase in cost and poor customer service a I experienced when I contacted customer service to try to understand the change and why my credit card was being charged without my approval. I was also
 told I could not cancel my wife's automatic charges because i didn't know her password even though it was MY CREDIT CARD! I found it easier to cancel the credit card rather than try to figure out the lost password/email and follow the new poorly designed website.
</p>
<p>Instead of spending the money on XBOX live, i bought a playstation. I like it and I plan to sell all XBOX equipment and moving entirely to Playstation. This is very sad because a year ago I loved the website and family plan management/billing setup and purchase
 3 game systems. I really hope Microsoft changes their views on how they treat their customers by increasing costs by 140%. Controlling accounts should be much easier to figure out on the website and their should be some sort of bulk purchase discount.</p>
<p>This is very sad!</p>

<p>If by hundreds of dollars of live and msp(or whatever they're called now) cards is what you mean, then you need to get new ones from your country. If you sent me codes from over there I wouldn't be able to redeem them, at least it's happened to me before.
 You can't just expect it to be region free, they have rules for a reason. Like how BF4 is banned in China because of the new dlc, because they found it to be an endangerment to national security (LOL).</p>

<h2>            Printer Drivers HP5660, Should I Install This&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows Update is holding an install for my command to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"We need to start a separate installation to complete this update. Select Install to start it. If you don't see the install window, minimize this window, or check the taskbar."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&nbsp;‚Ä¢ Hewlett-Packard - Enterprise WSD Multi-Function Printer, Multi-Function Printer, Other hardware - Null Print - HP ENVY 5660 series.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Details say: <em>7/‚Äé4/‚Äé2015, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise WSD Multi-Function Printer, Multi-Function Printer, Other hardware software update released in August, 2014.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This printer, purchased and installed today. Downloaded from HP, all drivers and installation software and did not use the supplied installation disk/CD. Printer works apparently in all respects. Considering the date on the Windows Update, 7/4/2015 in the
 details, do I need this install? I would hate to screw anything up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thought was, since the printer is a certified Windows 10 device, says so and sold as such, and since HP provided the drivers today in a download to install the new device, I wondered that installing an "old" update from Microsoft was, perhaps, a mistake.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I or should I, delete an install that asks for my permission or command? Wouldn't HP, in December 2015, have sent the most current drivers for this brand new printer which seems to work just fine?&nbsp;This printer is doing everything as expected. I'm afraid
 an "update" from 7/4/2015 seems unnecessary? As always, thanks for your time and assistance.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. My question is very specific. I have always enjoyed Windows Updates as I know Microsoft is committed to making WIN10 a consistently leading edge tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take a moment and review the specifics of my inquiry. The portions that appear in italic are cut and pasted from the notice as it appears in Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are saying the MS dated, 7/4/2015, will not harm operation of the HP5660 please provide some perspective. Is it possible the MS package they have delivered for update is an essential update even as the download from HP took place only yesterday to
 install this new device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I may not understand is, Windows 10 has specific aids for the HP 5660 and this is the purpose of this update and it will safely and reliably maintain best performance in communication with the device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your reply! I am certain Windows Updates are one of the most exciting part of the new OS as they allow current, and future, improvements. If you might comment on the specifics of this question that would revive the worry over screwing up
 a new device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update also lets the user go to MS Support for more information, but there the note makes apology as details are either unavailable or not yet ready for use. That is where I'm sure the reassurance on the&nbsp;necessity of a specific downloads will appear
 in the future. Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Hello again:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead with the HP5660 update provided by Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a problem I guess, but now the system thinks there are two identical printers on the network. Should, or can I correct this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>WIN10 has been pretty impressive. One sidebar on this question, I also noted that my two Lexmark printers can no longer be supported. One four year old, one six year old, both worked fine, but they are now at Staples in their recycle program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having a new printer is also fine, considering these aren't terribly expensive. It was kind of surprising how Lexmark and/or Microsoft didn't want to play well together. Obviously, I have no idea about why two functioning printers are no longer supported,
 but at least they got to the correct solution, proper recycling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, if the duplicate printer issue isn't important or worth the reply, the update was applied and now I have to tell the HP software which of the identical devices to use and, of course, there is only one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this is interesting? Thanks again, I sure this time of year comes with a million requests for information. Merry Christmas Microsoft!</p>

            <p>Microsoft has asked for follow-up on this issue. As answered above, there were some remaining questions, but, obviously, the printer seems to function in all respects. As answered above, it cannot be considered "an answer" as it does not address anything
 of the question's content. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As a point of feedback, Microsoft asked for comment, I would only note the generic answer provided is a nice piece of marketing but doesn't answer the specifics. The Microsoft community, by contrast, is the real brain trust available here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, thanks for being there Microsoft. And thanks to the community for their great support when surprises bring confusion or concern.</p>

                    Hi.&nbsp; I dont know why my hour glass cursor "hangs" when I click on it to select&nbsp; on it.&nbsp; It stays that way even when the task has been completed.&nbsp; Could anyone tell me what i can do to rectify it.&nbsp; My system seems to be working rather slowly.

<h3> laur008  say:</h3>
<h2>            DisplayLink Core Software</h2>
                    <p><span>My PC installed an update over night that is now preventing DisplayLink Core Software from being compatible/used
 on my PC. I've tried updating the driver for displaylink to the most up-to-date version which didn't solve the problem. Next, I tried fully uninstalling then re-installing the software and nothing has worked.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I use three monitors every day at work and this is extremely frustrating and inconvenient that one day everything
 works then the next day (without any fault of mine) it doesn't. This is also a brand new PC that I just got 4 days ago.</span></p>

            <p>Similar to the original post, I awoke this morning to find my system had updated to Windows 10 Anniversary Edition. Along with that an error message indicating that DisplayLink Manager had been disabled - and please forgive me but I don't recall the rest
 of the error message. A visit to DisplayLink's website suggests the following: </p>
<p>
"Diamond vstream WPCTVPRO
This Diamond device is a wireless USB device. The wireless part of this product is not provided by DisplayLink and is not part of the DisplayLink drivers. It appears that the DisplayLink device is not appearing on the USB bus correctly due to the wireless link.
 This problem is outside DisplayLink technology and suggest contacting Diamond if this product is not working after updating to Windows 10 Anniversary update."
</p><p>
</p><p>I am far from an expert in these matters but can tell something is still wrong after the limited troubleshooting I am capable of. The glaring issue that seems to be the problem is that the system has some sort of confusion around the USB device. It keeps
 alternating between "SCAH" and "DisplayLink USB Graphics Device" when I view the list of "other devices." I also keep getting a pop-up asking me what about auto-play settings for F: and to select what happens with removeable drives.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to fix this? </p>

            Bruce, this sounds more like a problem with Outlook Express or his PC than a Windows Live issue.&nbsp; The error is being generated not by the Windows Live server but by OE.

    <title>Unable to shut down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redhonker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to shut down</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7 64-bit, no bit locker</p>
<p>Choose shutdown -&gt; all applications will close -&gt; logging off -&gt; shutting down.</p>
<p>I can see disk light busy and then stops with a clicking sound.&nbsp; Disk then turns quiet.&nbsp; Windows 7 stays at this shutting down stage with the circle keep going.&nbsp; At 5-min mark, my power saving setting kicks and monitor turns blank.&nbsp; Moving mouse will bring
 it back.&nbsp; If I give it more time, e.g. 10 min, it will no longer respond to mouse.&nbsp; However, pressing power button will bring screen back to the same stage.&nbsp; If I press and hold on the power button, it will shutdown.</p>
<p>During reboot, it's all normal.&nbsp; If I do the above press-hold shutdown when it's still responding to mouse, it will complains about improper shutdown upon restart.</p>
<p>I don't have bit locker and I have all update installed except the language packs.&nbsp; Nothing abnormal in event viewer.</p>
<p>How do I troubleshoot?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

 bit.ly url.</p>
<p>This behavior is the "norm" for technocrate - lifting others posts and dropping them in other threads where the dropped response may or may not be relevant to the discussion at hand, and not crediting the source. &nbsp; This has problems because it adds noise
 to the thread and often confuses the original poster. &nbsp;It also fails to credit the original composer of the advice, and since technocrate does not post original material, technocrate is unable to respond when the original poster has further questions or requires
 clarification.</p>

<p>Redhonker,</p>
<p>You're probably on the right track with the issue being caused by a driver. The best thing to do is contact the system/hardware manufacturer and get the latest drivers for your hardware. In most cases, the chipset driver and upgrading the BIOS resolve most
 power related issues.</p>
<p>Try that and let me know if it helps!</p>

<h2>            Help with &#64;gmail.com attached to an Xbox Live account</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently purchased a Xbox 360, second hand. My son wanted to get a live account to play with friends. He registered this account using a gmail.com account. Now that I, as parent, want to get into his Live account to manage it, I can't (because its not
 a Microsoft account).</p>
<p>His Xbox profile will not allow me to change his Live connected gmail.com account to his @outlook.com account. There is an error message.</p>

<p>You did not say which version of MS Office you're thinking of.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is highly likely that the problem is limited to your machine. Instead of asking forum members to test this for you, I recommend that you start by doing some tests on machines that were not configured by you.</p>

<h2>            Psychonauts Download</h2>
                    

<div>
<p>Hi, I'm trying to download the Xbox Original: "Full Game - Psychonauts" from the Games on Demand section of the Xbox Live Marketplace, but when I click into it there is no option to "purchase" the game unlike other games, only the option to rate the game.
 What is the problem here and is there any way around it?</p>

    <title>XP pro SP3 repair installation asking for asms file and cannot proceed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blackshines  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP pro SP3 repair installation asking for asms file and cannot proceed</h2>
                    
<p>I upgraded from xp pro sp2 to sp3 and after that computer was very slow.&nbsp; So I repaired SP3 and during that process it started asking for 'asms' file.&nbsp; Even though the sp3 cd(which i burnt from a ISO image) had the asms folder it does seem to sense the cd.&nbsp;
 I am really stuck now because, even if I reboot my pc without the cd it goes to windows setup asks for 'asms' file.&nbsp; Even in safe mode it says windows setup cannot proceed in safe mode it reboots.</p>
<p>Kindly help me on what can I do now so that either i can get thru with the 'asms' file or is there a way I can revert back to sp2 and do any possible recovery so that I can go into windows and backup my files.</p>
<p>Greatly appreciate your help and solutions.</p>
<p>THANKS.</p>

                    <p>While transferring photos from my phone to my computer, my photos/videos were quickly sent to the Recycle Bin in error. I've been able to Restore the folders that appear in the RB (most were named January 2016, etc.) and can display all of those. &nbsp;However,
 there are at least half of the folders of photos that did not show up in the RB. When I change how I arrange the restored folders,

<p>Hi and thank you for your response. &nbsp;So as to not take your time helping me with misguided information, I should have started my conversation with... AFTER, not while transferring photos from my phone as I believe they transferred successfully and then while
 organizing them into the monthly folders....... then the problems began. My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S6 however. Any ideas on actually fixing the issue of not being able to view the photos that are appearing as icons and unable to view? Again, thank you for
 your time!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bluetooth lets users connect all kinds of wireless devices with a Windows 10 PC. Pairing issues may arise due to incompatible or incorrect device drivers, as well as improper configuration settings on your computer and Bluetooth setup. For us to properly
 point out what's causing it, supply more information by answering these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages when attempting to pair your phone?</li><li>Have you checked if you can successfully pair another device on your Windows 10 computer?</li><li>How and when did the issue start?</li><li>Have you also checked for the latest drivers on your computer's manufacturer's website?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial step, we suggest running the <strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter</strong>. This built-in tool will allow you to diagnose and resolve concerns involving your hardware and devices. The steps are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type Troubleshooting using Windows Search.</li><li>Click Troubleshooting.</li><li>Click on View All under the Control Panel Home.</li><li>Choose Hardware and Devices.</li><li>Run the troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know these details so we can work on resolving your query.</p>

            Thanks for your response.&nbsp;&nbsp; After going through the normal troubleshooting protocols, I contacted Kyocera support asking about the Bluetooth pairing issue.&nbsp; Eventually, the answer that I received was that the phone does not have the capability to pair
 with my Win 10 laptop.&nbsp; Then I was asked to try the 'mass storage' option to produce a .vcf file of my Outlook Contacts and copy the file to the phone.&nbsp; This I accomplished but to no avail.&nbsp; The issue has been referred to Kyocera's 'engineering group'.&nbsp; So
 far, no response.&nbsp;&nbsp; I continue to pursue the matter because the documentation for the phone includes instructions for both Bluetooth and file transfer as a means for moving my contacts from Outlook to the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob

                    <p>Do I need to reinstall windows? Because I tried every method of repair there was, always ends in error. I notice most people have boot\bcd showing on the blue screen. I only have \bcd which means something deleted the entire boot file so I can't repair whats
 not there.</p>

<p>Hello. I had the same kind of issue myself. I have an HP 6520 All in One. My solution may work for you.</p>
<p>1. I&nbsp;Removed Printer from Settings&gt;Devices first. Restart.</p>
<p>2. Uninstalled the Windows 10 HP Remote App. Then Uninstalled all HP software. Shutdown PC.</p>
<p>3. With my PC off, I turned on my HP and made sure it connected to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>4. Powered up my PC and installed the printer in Settings&gt;Devices first.</p>
<p>5. Installed the HP App again and configured. This time I used the App to Download and install full HP Software. Hint: Swipe or click to expose Menu options in the App! Click box for HP Full Software.</p>
<p>6. Once HP All in One software suite was installed, configured&nbsp;and printed Test Page, Restarted my PC and Uninstalled the Windows HP Remote App. Just use your HP software from the Icons on your Desktop.
</p>
<p>-OR- </p>
<p>Print from any App i.e. Adobe Acrobat, Word, etc. </p>
<p>Hope this Helps you. The HP Remote App reporting Not Connected and having to mess with the App drove me nuts. My steps above are trial by fire overnight frustrated until I got it right. Cheers!!</p>

            I found a quick way to fix this problem. I just downloaded HP Printers/Drivers/and did a run, install, and config for my printer.&nbsp; I did not have to remove any old device data, settings, etc..&nbsp; New drive info just updated my old drive data, the&nbsp;config
 ran and everything is working perfectly.&nbsp; So quick and easy just following the HP Online Support Help.

<p>Hi suzannekQP! Glad to here it! Did this resolve the Printer reporting "Not Connected" in Printers and Devices? Just curious. My 6520 works just fine but what puzzles me is that it still shows "Not Connected" even though it is fully functional. Weird!? I
 will try your solution. Please let me know, though. Thank you. Cheers!!</p>

Easiest way!!! In the Windows seach bar type in "printer" click on "Devices and Printers". Find your printer and make sure it is set to "Set as Default Printer". Right click on your printer and click on "See what's printing" click on Printer tab make sure "Use
 Printer Offline" is unchecked. Try doing a printer test from Note Pad or other program. You may have to unplug the printer first.&nbsp;
