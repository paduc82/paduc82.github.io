    <title>Facebook Gameroom - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sp13l3ndl31cht  say:</h3>
<h2>            Facebook Gameroom</h2>
                    <p>For the last 2 days I have been unable to play some of my favourite games on FB Gameroom. I keep getting the message that flash player has not been detected (but I have the latest version). I can play them on FB itself.</p>
<p>So I uninstalled FB Gameroom and when I tried to re-install it, I could not. I keep getting the message 'unable to verify publisher'. Microsoft Defender Firewall won't let me install it, even if I click 'run anyway'.</p>
<p>Has anyone else got this problem and what do I do about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help</p>

            Hey Sp13l3ndl31cht,
<br />
<br />I hope I can help you here. Have you tried installing the latest PPAPI version of Flash? I understand you've said you have the latest version of Flash, but Facebook Gameroom seems to be based on Chromium, here's a link: <a href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/</a>
<br />
<br />Select under Step 1: Windows 10/Windows 8, then Step 2: FP 31 for Opera and Chromium - PPAPI.
<br />
<br />Do whatever you will with the optional offers (I don't recommend installing the McAfee stuff), and click Download.
<br />
<br />Go ahead and install it. Here's the thread which could provide more suggestions: <a href="https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2242447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2242447</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! Feel free to let me know if this has done it or if you need any further assistance, in which case I'd be more than happy to help with. Good luck.

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having the same issue. I have installed the adobe flash player in chrome and fox and it is up to date now. The problem is when I tried to reinstall my facebook gameroom app I get this message." We are unable to verify the validity of the download folder"
 Microsoft defender says "publisher could not be identified" even though I click on "run anyway" it will not let it. This happened right after an update. I have has facebook gameroom since it was out. I have not had this issue until a couple of days ago. All
 this tech stuff makes me crazy cuz I don't understand it but it appears that it is the update of windows defender that has caused this problem. I have spent several hours looking for posts similar to mine. I would really like my app back. Can you help me?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Tammy</p>

<p>Hello, Yes I have done this and have the correct version. There was a version for chrome and another for FB I downloaded both. Won't work in either chrome or firefox. All since the windows defender update. Still cannot reinstall facebook gameroom.

            Hey again,
<br />
<br />Apparently a number of people have this issue as well... change your date before 10/25 (10/24 preferably) and try to install it again.

<br />
<br />Run as an administrator before you do so if you haven't already.
<br />
<br />I understand this is not a be all, end all solution, so let me know how solid this method is or not, good luck. I'm a reply away.

<p>Hello Again,</p>
<p>OMGoodness. Thank youThank you !!! It worked !Manually chaged to 10/24, went to FB and it downloaded and installed right away. Then chaged the date back. I have been working at this for 3 days. Was so frusrtated. Offering the link was so helpful as weel
 as I am PC "challenged". I just hope when I need to uninstall it again ( cuz it messes up often) it will reinstall ..but if not I will follow your instructions to fix it again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>a NAT (Network Address Translation) type can affect a lot, a moderate NAT or a strict NAT can and may prevent you from getting on-line or even accessing Xbox Live . &nbsp;This can also cause a lot of lag in your connection!</p>

<p>Kind of funny you post a thread about how your "loyalty" deserves a beta key, but refuse to get MOH. If you don't get MOH you don't get the beta. That simple.</p>

            Hi Margarett, 
<br />
<br />Try this for me, click on the task menu down on the bottom right, and look for "all settings" 
<br />
<br />See if that'll launch. If that launches, close it. Now try to open settings from the start menu. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Which fix it did you try?<br />
2. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may run the power troubleshooter and check:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-power-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-power-problems</a><br />
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may also update the display drivers from the manufacturer website and check.<br />

<div><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>If the issue persists then you may also perform a clean boot and check.<br />

            The reason for the screen not turning off, despite being told so by the power plan, seems to be related the "presentation" applet in the notification area:
<div>&nbsp;
<div>When the applet is shown, i can connect the projector and see the screen reflected on the projector which what i expect BUT the laptop won't turn off the screen even when the projector is disconnected.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If i press on this applet that i am no more in "presentation" mode then, when i connect the projector, no mean to see the screen reflected on the projector, regardless how i press &lt;FN&gt;&lt;F4&gt; until i RESTART the laptop. BUT, the laptop does turn of the screen
 as set up in the power plan.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In short, and as i already stated here, connecting a projector to a Vista is a real nightmare complicated by other&nbsp;pathological&nbsp;symptoms, well, at least for&nbsp;feeble&nbsp;minded like me</div>

            <p>Glad you have isolated the issue that is causing the problem with your computer not turning off.
<br />
<br />
You might look at the options in powercfg to see if you can get it to help shut down.<br />
Go to a command prompt. Right click and select Run as administrator. <br />
Type in: powercfg /?</p>
<p>This will return a list of available commands. <br />
<br />
Type in: powercfg -devicequery wake_from _any <br />
This should return a list of devices that will wake your computer from sleep.</p>

            Thanks got your reply,
<div><br />
<div>Please note that the computer did not wake up from sleeping or hibernation. The issue is with the screen which won't turn off or would turn off and steady on again, whenever the "presentation mode" is set, even when no external projector other display
 is connected.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I need to set the "presentation mode" whenever i connect the projector to see a movie and if, after seeing the movie i turn off the "presentation mode" (as to avoid the screen from staying on forever) then, no way to reuse the projector without restarting
 the computer :(</div>

<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-desktop/turning-off-presentation-mode/07b2bf18-e176-480a-94ec-9443e9739bd4?page=1&amp;tm=1339623516362">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-desktop/turning-off-presentation-mode/07b2bf18-e176-480a-94ec-9443e9739bd4?page=1&amp;tm=1339623516362</a></p>
<p>From the thread post by fhlee:<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Mobility Center (Control Panel &gt; Windows Mobility Center)<br />
2. At the Presentation Settings box, click the (PROJECTOR ICON) at the Presentation Settings box.<br />
3. The Presentation Settings dialog box will apprear.<br />
4. Click on Connected Display (you will then see a list of all the available monitors)<br />
5. UNCHECK the box that says I ALWAYS GIVE A PRESENTATION WHEN I USE THIS DISPLAY CONFIGURATION.<br />
6. OK everything back.<br />
</p>
<p>Another user, Spoonjab, changed their power scheme to not conserve the battery as much and that resolved their issue.
<br />
<br />
Review their findings and see if it helps. <br />

Let us know the results. <br />

            Thank you Marilyn.
<div><br />
<div>Can you please first indicate a sure procedure to reflect my monitor on an hdmi attached projector? For instance, when i plug an earphone or the aux stereo to the corresponding socket on the laptop, i *always* have the sound&nbsp;redirected&nbsp;there without going
 through n&nbsp;menus&nbsp;and m dialogues; is there at least *one* deterministic way to have the laptop's screen mirrored on my ACER projector?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I guess that from there (if such a procedure exists) I could try to figure out how to 1) use my projector for the grandchildren and 2) avoid&nbsp;having&nbsp;my lap's screen&nbsp;always&nbsp;on</div>
<div><br />
<div>For&nbsp;example, right now, while typing here are some results&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) If i connect the projector via hdmi cable and power it =&gt; nothing happens (ACER says "no signal")</div>
<div>2) If ii go to Start &gt; Control pammel &gt; Mobile PC &gt; Windows mobility center &gt; Connect a display, i get "display&nbsp;connected" then "choose&nbsp;appearance" &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Duplicate &gt; OK =&gt;&nbsp;nothing&nbsp;happens (no signal)</div>
<div>3) if at this point i press "turn on&nbsp;presentation" nothing happens</div>
<div>4) if i press fn f4, an icon by the notification area showing two screens appears and&nbsp;disarming&nbsp;but still no signal.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'll stop here: In short, when the screen is reflected on the projector, it's more a&nbsp;hazard&nbsp;than something&nbsp;deterministic;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

            OK, i know why the projector receives no image:&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If from power on, at any time the laptop's screen goes off (due to power plan) the projector will not work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To have the projector mirror the screen via hdmi connector, you must prevent the lap's screen from ever going off i.e. use a power plan which never turns off the display</div>
<div><br />
<div>This behavior is deterministic&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Store is not available in your country or region</h2>
                    Day one with a nice new Surface 3 and first task is to connect to the Store. &nbsp;However error message &nbsp;"Store is not available in your country or region" &nbsp;What? &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;I am in the heart of Europe, in Guernsey. We are not a failed state or a bunch of terrorists.
 &nbsp;Has Microsoft really formed the view that we cannot be trusted with their Apps? &nbsp;My first thought is to pack the Surface away and send it back to John Lewis for a refund. &nbsp;But I thought I might try here first to see if this is simply a bug. &nbsp;Anyone know?

            <p>Same English Pound currency as the UK, right? Worth a try to pick a place in the UK and see what happens. You can try support
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/customer-service-phone-numbers/en-us?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/customer-service-phone-numbers/en-us?wa=wsignin1.0</a> , but if THEY tell you it is unsupported, you are stuck. Also, if you ever need service from Microsoft, you might have to initiate from a supported location in the
 UK, etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't honestly know why your locale isn't supported. </p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not doubt that the UK is supported, but even if my card works, the UK has 20% sales tax which I am unwilling to pay. &nbsp;Guernsey is a crown dependency, like Gibralter, and we have no sales tax. &nbsp;I can see that as a small country, Microsoft may have decided
 to simply exclude it from the App store. &nbsp;But there seems no point in my using it if I cannot access the apps. &nbsp; I will try the support link you suggested. &nbsp;Thanks</p>

            Guernsey is a supported store region - as a developer I can make my apps available to that region.<br />
your issue stems from elsewhere.

            Thank you. &nbsp;Microsoft support agree, but have been unable to make my store work so far, set to Guernsey. It does work for UK, but of course I do not live there and do not have a UK bank account. &nbsp;So, I am waiting to hear back from Microsoft whether they
 can work out what the problem is. &nbsp;Thanks for your advice.

            Three weeks after a sympathetic hearing from UK support and a promise to investigate and get right back (might take a day or two), I have of course been left to swing in the wind. No response and no solution. &nbsp;Without the ability to download Apps my surface
 seems less useful than my old iPad. &nbsp;Any suggestions for the next step gratefully received. &nbsp;I guess I will phone UK support again. &nbsp;

            <p>I have the same problem but worse with my Windows Lumia phone.</p>
I have a Microsoft Lumia 640 XL Dual-SIM phone.<br />
I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10. &nbsp;Since then, I could no longer reach the Store. &nbsp;I did not get the friendly message saying the Store region was not supported but received an uninformative error.<br />
To solve this, I used the Device Recovery Tool from Microsoft to take it back to Windows 8.1 then upgrade to Windows 10.<br />
This worked, until I changed my Region to Guernsey when the Store was no longer available. &nbsp;Changing it to United Kingdom allowed it to work.

                    <p>I was working on my computer and was trying to limit access to a hard drive installed on the computer (This is not the drive the operating sstem is on, it is a completely seperate drive)&nbsp; It is still visible but unaccessable.&nbsp; I deleted some of the groups
 and users for the drive and lost access to the hard drive completely.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did some looking online and found out that I could log in to the hidden Administrator account to enable the users again in the account.&nbsp; In doing so i managed to delete the access to the account though the Administrator Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway I can regain access to this drive?&nbsp; Or is all lost.&nbsp; I have been working on this for hours now and have scoured the internet looking for solutions.&nbsp; I have even tried downloading the MS ACL repair utility which didn't seem to do a lot of
 good either.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Photo email</strong> in Windows Live Photo Gallery enables users to easily add photos and videos to an email message that gets published to SkyDrive in the form of Albums. When receiving email messages with photos and videos, users can view them

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've mentioned that you don't have Microsoft Outlook client installed on your computer. If that's the case, you will not be able to use the E-mail function in Photo Gallery even you set Outlook as your default&nbsp;e-mail&nbsp;program. Photo Gallery&nbsp;will require
 you to use an e-mail program to send the photos. What we can recommend&nbsp;is that you use Windows Live Mail as your&nbsp;default e-mail program as it is included in Windows Essentials suite. If you don't have Windows Live Mail yet, please download it from this
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After getting the installer, please install it on your computer and&nbsp;set Windows Live Mail as your default program by following&nbsp;the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click Windows <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Go to <strong>Default Programs</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Set program access and set defaults for this computer</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Double click on <strong>Custom</strong> to show the complete details.</p>
<p>5. Under <strong>Choose a default e-mail program</strong>, select <strong>Windows Live Mail</strong> and ensure that the option to
<strong>Enable access to this program</strong> is checked.</p>
<p>6. Click <strong>OK</strong> button to save the changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open your Photo Gallery again and sign in your account then follow the steps provided by my colleague Christian_Co. and check if the issue still occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p>what cameras can be used for biometrics and what other devices are available for a pc running windows 10 pro 64 bit or windows 8.1 pro 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so far tried microsoft camera logitech camera and found unreliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also found that voice recognition software in windows 8.1 pro 64 bit is very poor as not designed for scottish accents but only queens english style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so hardware devices available and are they going to be expensive as the whole point of windows 10 is end users not just companies , so will devices reflect this or is it going to be a case of software capable but hardware too expensive.</p>

            You likely will need updated drivers. I notice my Fingerprint reader on my HP Elitebook does not work and the existing driver does not work, neither in compatibility mode.

<h2>            lag time from right-click on Desktop item to display of shortcut menu extremely slow</h2>
                    <p>I just got a new computer a week ago or so, and I'm not sure when this started happening, but now when I right-click an icon on the Windows 7 Desktop, the delay between the right click and the shortcut menu display is close to 30 seconds. I've googled this
 and people talk about uninstalling an Nvidia driver, which I don't have installed--I went through Control Panel to see installed programs and through Device driver tabs and didn't see Nvidia anywhere.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They also talk about context menus and going into registry and deleting there. As far as I know, I don't have any context menu in place in the registry. My registry for ContextMenu reads: (Default) REG_SZ (value not set).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any ideas? The wait time is driving me crazy. All help greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>An astute user at the Seagate Replica forums pointed me in the the right direction with a few cryptic steps, which I had to troubleshoot, but he said the resolution was to "unload replica file explorer hook." I have no idea what that
 means, but here is the resolution, thank goodness!! This has been a nightmare:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must run as Administrator or you get this error: the module "Seagate-Replica-Shell.dll" was loaded but the call to DLLUnregisterServer failed with error code 0x80040201. Also, make sure the Seagate drive is connected or this won’t
 work:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>1. On the Start Menu, type cmd; On the cmd.exe icon, right-click and click Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>2. From the command<span>&nbsp; </span>prompt, type cd C:\Program Files\Seagate Replica\bin and press Enter.</p>
<p>3. Type regsvr32 /u Seagate-Replica-Shell.dll and press Enter. You should see a prompt in a RegSvr32 window that says “DllUnregisterSeriver in Seagate-Replica-Shell.dll succeeded."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem had gotten progressively worse as time went on--I was at the point where any right-click in any Explore window or selecting a menu item such as Delete was taking 30 seconds or so to happen. I right-click way too much for
 that to be acceptable. Anyhow, I am very relieved to have gotten to the bottom of this. If anyone can explain why this worked, I would be ever so grateful to know. Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A HUGE thank you to James, our Forum Moderator, for directing me to the Seagate post or I would still be pulling my hair out. The Seagate moderator&nbsp;subsequently&nbsp;had this as a possible&nbsp;solution&nbsp;, but I'm leaving well enough alone:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"Arlene, here are the instructions for 64-bit operating systems:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Command prompt as an administrator</p>
<p>type in cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Seagate Replica\bin</p>
<p>&lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>Type in regsvr32 /u Seagate-Replica-Shell.dll</p>
<p>&lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A reboot should be necessary to unload the dll from memory."</p>

<h2>            Computer Hangs on Logoff </h2>
                    
<p>Recently I installed a new version of Windows onto my laptop. I reinstalled all of the drivers and everything is completely functional except the computer will not shut down. It hangs on the "logging off" screen where the mouse still moves but you are unable
 to do anything.</p>
<p>If I start in safe mode, it shuts down fine.</p>
<p>I have tried disabling, uninstalling, and reinstalling my sound drivers (a known cause of this problem according to the microsoft help page.)</p>

<h2>            Removing my name from windows 10</h2>
                    I purchased a laptop with the intent of giving it to another person. I started setting up the laptop, but now realize my name is attached to her laptop. Is there a way to start over and not include my name on her laptop?

            Hello, how are you to publish in our microsoft community? I am here to help you solve your problem
<br />
<br />I send you the following information I hope I help you
<br />
<br />How to remove name and email from Lock screen using Group Policy
<br />Click on Start, do a search and open the Local Group Policy Editor.
<br />
<br />Under the Local Computer Policy browse the following path:
<br />
<br />Computer Configuration &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options
<br />Find and double-click to open the setting “Interactive logon: Do not display last user name”, choose Enable, then click Apply and OK.
<br />
<br />While the previous step will remove your real name and email address from the login screen after boot, every time you lock your computer, Windows 10 will continue to display the current user information in the Lock screen, as such there is one more setting to configure. In the Security Options open “Interactive logon: Display user information when the session is locked” and select your preference from the drop-down menu. In my case I’ll choose to only display “User display name only”, then click Apply and OK.
<br />
<br />How to remove name and email from Lock screen using the Registry
<br />
<br /> 
<br />For Windows 10 Home users the process is a little different, as this version of the operating system doesn’t include support for Group Policy. If you are running Windows 10 Home, you will need to change the same setting but using the registry.
<br />
<br />Warning: It’s very important to note that modifying the Windows registry can cause serious problems if not used properly. It’s assumed you know what you’re doing and you have created a full backup of your system before proceeding.
<br />Click on Start, type regedit, and hit Enter to open the Registry.
<br />
<br />Browse the following path:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
<br />Double-click to open the dontdisplaylastusername key and change the value from 0 to 1.
<br />
<br />Double-click to open the DontDisplayLockedUserId key and change the value from 0 to 2.
<br />
<br />Now, when you reboot your computer, your user information, including your email address will no longer be displayed in the Lock screen. This means that you will have to manually type your email address and password to sign into Windows 10 and unlocking your PC.
<br />
<br />If you have other user accounts, those people will also have to manually enter their credentials, as none of the user information will be displayed on the Lock screen.
<br />
<br />Would you like Microsoft to add different options for users decide whether to display email address and name from the Lock screen? Would you like to be able to display only a username as we’re used to see in previous versions? Let us know in the comments below.
<br />
<br />Update, July 8, 2016: On the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, the operating system hides the email address on the Lock screen with a new “Show account details (e.g., email address) on sign-in screen” option located on Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options and under Privacy.

            Fastest way in my experience to do this is just reset it.
<br />Go to start - settings - update and security - recovery - get started on Reset.
<br />This will wipe it back to original.

            <p><span>Hi PerkyGal,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Did you make any software or hardware changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>You might try to perform System Restore to go back to previous state when it was working fine:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click
<b>Start</b>, type system restore in the <b>Start Search</b> box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<b>Continue</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>b. In the System Restore dialog box, click
<b>Choose a different restore point</b>, and then click <b>Next</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>c. In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click
<b>Next</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>d. Click
<b>Finish</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>System Restore: frequently
 asked questions</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) I would recommend you to run an online virus scan from the link given below &amp; check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, make sure that you have the latest update for the antivirus software installed on your computer, so that it works properly.</span></p>
<p><span>b)
</span><span>You may also download &amp; run </span>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/securepc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft Security Essentials</span></a><span> on your
 computer. </span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) You may also create a new user account with administrative privilege and check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Create a user account</span></a></p>
<p><span>b) If the issue do not persists in new user account, you may access the link below and follow the steps to fix a corrupted user profile:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></a></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope the information helps.<br />

            <p>Thanks for your suggestions, Dableena.&nbsp; However, none of them worked as I had already tried Methods 1 &amp; 2 before posting my question; I've had Microsoft Security Essentials on my system for many years now per Method 3; &amp; I am the administrator of my own
 home system &amp; network per Method 4.&nbsp; That's why this particular situation is very annoying.&nbsp; I'm an advanced computer user of some 32 years now &amp; have learned a few tricks over that time period, but this particular issue has been going on randomly for about
 a year now so that's why I'm finally asking for help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, it's just an annoyance at this time &amp; not causing any real problems, but I'd like to find a solution that will make it stop once &amp; for all because I hate being annoyed by these pop-up error messages.&nbsp; Hopefully, somebody&nbsp; out there will have a tried
 &amp; true fix for this problem.&nbsp; Thanks again for your suggestions.</p>

            <p>Hi Robert!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your suggestion &amp; for the compliment on my writing skills.&nbsp; However, my answer to your suggestion is simply "been there, done that."&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have tried solution suggestions made on older posts in this arena without any success
 &amp; that's why I decided to make a newer recent post looking for solutions that would apply to Windows &amp; IE software that has had updates within the past few months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I regularly use Disk Cleaner, Glary Utilities &amp; Glary Registry Repair for maintenance along with Microsoft Security Essentials to keep my pc in top shape &amp; I have Dell Support Center scheduled to run full scans on my hardware once a month.&nbsp; I am perplexed
 how this one little glitch is continuing to get through all my barriers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks again for the suggestion.&nbsp; Let me know if there's anything that's come out since 2011 that might be helpful to fix this bug.</p>

<p>The requested operation was unsuccessful</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver 5.93.98.187</p>
<p>there is no option to roll back just the driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>the dlls are 5.93.97.187</p>
<p>
</p><p>the Win10driver - vwifibus.sys is the only new one ? 10.0.10532.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>bcmfn2 Device will also not start - because it is waiting for the network adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tablet has only one USB port - Wi-Fi is the only way it can connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I guess I will try rolling back the build</p>

            <p>Same issue on two tablets: ASUS VIVOTAB&nbsp;and Lenovo Miix2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This build 10532 is really <strong>not usable </strong>for these devices - and I don't understand that this was not tested before, because this chipset is on a lot of small tablets!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to build 10525 is not a&nbsp;big deal, but now I have this 6 standard apps with stupid names:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>How to fix this? I found an info under this <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/224798/how-to-uninstall-windows-10s-built-in-apps-and-how-to-reinstall-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HTG-link</a>, but this is not working for Edge, Cortana, Feedback,&nbsp;...</p>
<p>With the following (Admin) PowerShell command I could fix nearly all these apps:</p>

</p><p>Only the @{winstore_...} I need to delete by right clicking and uninstall. The InsiderHub I&nbsp;could fix in the settings - optional features.</p>

            Broadcom Wireless and two other Broadcom devices shown in Device Manager did not function on my Asus Tablet (m81c) after installing build 10532.&nbsp; Rolled back and had to re-enter Wireless key - but things work (thank goodness).

            <p>Darn.. I was deleting the previous installations as I was reading this post... I didn't even notice it was an Internet issue first since I was at work and just tried get the email. I thought it was the app issue again. Started deleting the previous installation
 to free up space after windows started to nag me to do so while looking for solutions here and....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I desperately need a solution now. Without having to roll back.&nbsp;</p>
