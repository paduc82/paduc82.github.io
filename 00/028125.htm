            You need to purchase more advanced burning software like nero (<a href="http://www.nero.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nero.com</a>) or you could convert the files to a format that dvd maker understands using this:<br />

    <title>printing is slow. 30 seconds from clicking print to seeing the print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dropster.  say:</h3>
<h2>            printing is slow. 30 seconds from clicking print to seeing the print dialog box</h2>
                    <p>Printing is slow in any Access application that I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes 30 seconds from clicking print to seeing the print dialog box. Also, when I print multiple pages, it is slow for them to spool up. It used to be that the counter ran as fast as a gas pump. Now it says, "printing page 1, 2, 3 etc about one count
 per second.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may have started after running microsoft updates, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>This often suggests that&nbsp; you have a linked table that does not exist. Or perhaps a default printer that is a network printer&nbsp; (and it is not avaible).</p>
<p>If this is a split database, then #1 is to try a persistant connection.</p>

            There are several places that the problem could be occuring.&nbsp; Does this problem only happen in Access or all multi-page print outs?&nbsp; You've already taken the first step in troubleshooting, asking what has changed since the last time things worked "properly".<br />
<br />
In Access: possibly, but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
In the Printer Driver. That is my first suspect. Have you changed the printer you are using? Go to the printer manufacturer web site and confirm that you are using the most recent printer driver. Also check to see if anyone else has had a similar problem. There
 may be some other known fix for the problem.<br />
<br />
Windows Print Spooler on your computer. Setup of the spooler may have been changed, say by a windows update.&nbsp; Does the 30 second delay happen EVERY time you print, or just the first time. Maybe the Print spooler service has not been started and it requires
 that extra time to start the first time.<br />
<br />
Is the Printer connected diretly to the computer or via a network? Maybe the delay is on the network, print jobs are given lower priority?&nbsp; Or maybe the delay is on the Network Print Server? If the printer is connected directly to the computer unplug and replug
 both ends of the cable. It could be as simple as a bad connection.<br />
<br />
Finally, there could ba problem at the printer end too.&nbsp; Have you changed the printer?<br />

<h2>            Creating a Shared Document</h2>
                    <p>I have created a checklist, which I want to share with my team in a calendar invite in Outlook, however each one of us will be also using this checklist and updating the checklist. I created the checklist in Word, however I am open to other ideas or formats.
 I would love to be able to share this checklist with my team - however if I add this document as an attachment, each time one of us makes a change (like 1 check mark), they will have re-save it on their desktops and re-attach it to the calendar invite. I am
 wondering if anyone out there has ever found a simpler way so that you can save directly? We all talk a lot of about being more efficient, and I am wondering about something like this - it can be time consuming for people, especially those who are not as technologically
 savvy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask the same question for any savvy SharePoint users out there - We have a SharePoint website as well which I maintain, however I am not sure if you can build forms or checklists directly into it, without have to create, save, load (and repeat if anyone
 changes the document).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!!&nbsp;</p>

<br />
You can make use of <strong>Word Online</strong> in creating the checklist. Just send the link to the Word Online document to your team and the changes can be saved directly. For other options, you may also post your query on
<strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook UserVoice</a></strong>.<br />

If you have other concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.

    <title>End user retention policy documentation. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            End user retention policy documentation.</h2>
                    <p>I have found enough documentation of how Exchange On-Premise and Exchange Online administrators create and manage Retention and Archive policies. What seem to be completely missing is documentation for end users. I have found some third party sites that
 give acceptable explanations but I find very little Microsoft documentation and none on how to add a "Personal Retention Tag" to the list of retention tags that can be applied to a Outlook folder. As this is only accessible from OWA in Exchange Online/Office
 365 it is not something that most users will be able to figure out on their own. Does anyone know of any up to date documentation produced by Microsoft for end users trying to configure the setting for their mailbox in OWA?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: Have chosen to set the category to Outlook.com as there is no Office 365 option.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Ohalloran, </p>
<p>
</p><p>About "Personal Retention tag", as far as I know, when a personal tag is created, admin need to add this tag to the retention policy that is placed to your mailbox and run ManagedFolderAssistant, then wait for a while. This way will automatically show up
 when you right-click a subfolder or item-&gt;<strong>Assign policy</strong>-&gt; it will list under
<strong>Archive Policy or Labels</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8db2ebce-eee0-47b6-8c4d-cdd05b3c7f7a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8db2ebce-eee0-47b6-8c4d-cdd05b3c7f7a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>In Outlook desktop client, you may right-click an items<strong>-&gt;Assign policy-&gt;Retention Policy
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d130ed8c-fdff-4310-9ec0-350a8d15d244?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d130ed8c-fdff-4310-9ec0-350a8d15d244?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Or open item in a separate window-&gt;in Message tab-&gt;Assign Policy:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89b21ae5-22ca-45e1-9f08-536308a6ddef?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89b21ae5-22ca-45e1-9f08-536308a6ddef?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven’t found any end user document about retention policy, the contents for end-user and for admin are often combined together in official article. I suggest that you can refer to
More about personal tags section to obtain more inforatmion about personal tag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<p>Nonsense--only Word, OneNote, PowerPoint, and occasionally Excel are actually useful! :P
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But seriously, I bet they occupy more than that--the install overall used somewhere between 1-2 GB of HD space. And considering Windows' fast startup uses 8 GB for the hibernation file, and Intel's Fast Boot also uses 8 GB of HD space for its own hibernation
 file (redundant and ridiculous), and then there's the 5 or so GB for the bloody paging file... Well I only have a 128 GB HD in my laptop, so space is at a premium. Plus I hate having **** on my computer that I don't use! I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels
 that way. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway...thanks for your reply. </p>

            <p>I don't think you understood my problem. Like you posted screen shots I also posted my phone's screen shots and you can observe in those shots that my phone doesn't have any section where I can add apn or even see an existing one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your shots, under <strong>Active network, </strong>there are<strong> IMS Connection
</strong>and<strong> Internet APN </strong>sections then there is a<strong> Security
</strong>section where as in my phone, after<strong> Active network </strong>section there is<strong> Security
</strong>section, no<strong> IMS Connection </strong>and<strong> Internet APN </strong>
sections. I&nbsp;hope you understand the problem&nbsp;now.</p>

- It's Off in your first screenshot, which makes the APN setting irrelevant.

    <title>Microsoft Project Question&#58; Deleting an empty task line - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lmogg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Project Question&#58; Deleting an empty task line</h2>
                    <p>Through changes to the Project schedule, we have deleted tasks that were then re-created elsewhere in the schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, let's say&nbsp;I have tasks on lines 1 through 6, &nbsp;with lines 7 and 8 blank, and then tasks on lines 9 through 12 (and let's say
 that the task on line 12 is predicated on line 9)....can I delete lines 7 and 8 removing those ID numbers from the schedule?</p>
<p>Would my schedule then show ID #'s of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12&nbsp;or would it show ID#'s of 1 through 10?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about the predecessor?&nbsp; Would the predecessor for the last task show a predecessor of 9, or would it change to match some new ID#?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Barring deleting those task lines, is there a way to inactivate or hide unused task lines?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks you for your patience with this question.</p>

            <p>You should always delete blank lines because they serve no purpose, and also make it hard to read and align the headings and sub-headings.</p>
<p>As far as your question about "what happens if...?", why not just try it?</p>
<p>The predecessor links are always preserved, whether you delete or insert tasks or move tasks up and down in the list. Of course, in order to do this the ID numbers must change, but tasks stay linked.</p>
<p>You cannot remove ID numbers. If you delete a task, all of the others below it move up the list and they all get new numbers.</p>

            <p>Imogg,</p>
<p>You didn't miss a setting but you did miss a field, it's the Unique ID field. In Project the ID field will change to reflect a contiguous numbering sequence for all tasks, however the Unique ID field is permanent. Once a task is created it is given a unique
 ID and if that task is moved, it will retain it's unique ID. If that task is deleted, that particular unique ID is gone from the file. If a file is heavily edited over a period of time, the unique IDs may be "all over the place" even though the ID will show
 a nice continuous sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project has a built-in utility called "Compare Projects" and it is found under Project/Reports group. That utility uses the Unique ID field to index two genetically related projects to find differences. When I say "genetically related" I mean that both projects
 came from a single source (i.e. a project is created, saved and then edited and saved under a new name). The original version and a later version of that same file can be compared using the utility. However, the utility will NOT work for project that are simply
 "similar" but not related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

                    <p>I don't want&nbsp;my&nbsp;stand-alone computer to play any moving images, especially from Youtube. Previously it was sufficient to uninstall Adobe Flash Player, but now Youtube supports HTML5 video&nbsp;and I have Internet Explorer 9. I need a solution that can only be

See if checking&nbsp; ActiveX Filtering&nbsp; (Alt-x,S,X)&nbsp; does what you need.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you could probably find a&nbsp; GPO edit which would disable use of that command.

            The Compatibility View steps you describe above did not work. I can not view certain videos in IE because it wants to use HTML5 instead of Adobe Flash. I have an older version of Adobe Flash (10.3) installed because the lastest version does not work in
 Firefox 19. I have opted-out of the YouTube HTML5 but it has not been removed in IE. When I try to view certain videos in IE, I get an error message that says "HTML5 Video not supported by this browser. Please update or install Flash." In the past, my Adobe
 Flash 10.3 worked well in IE.<br />
<br />
How can I remove the HTML5 support that is now embedded in IE? I had initially opted-in at the YouTube.com/HTLM5 site. But opting-out has not removed the HTML5 from IE.<br />

            <p>I'm trying to figure out the same thing: I find it incredibly annoying when I go onto a site (even a reliable site like New York Times) and there's a video playing by default. I deally I'd like all videos to be in paused mode by default. Since that doesn't
 seem to be possible, I want to disable all video in IE, but can't find a way to do it. I disabled all my video players and&nbsp;checked ActiveX filtering (there's no compatibility mode button for NYT), but the videos still run.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I realize that means I won't be able to play any videos on IE, and that's fine. I use Chrome &amp; Firefox for that, and want IE to be my annoyance-free browser.

<div>First question. Have you updated Project to SP-1? If not, go to,&nbsp;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ee748587, download and install the update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Second question. To re-sort back to the original task sequence, go to View/Data Group and hit the Sort icon. Select "by ID". Did you try that?</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, if at some point after your original sort you selected the option to permanently renumber tasks, then you won't be able to recover your original task sequence unless there is some other field that can be used (dependent on your file structure).</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John's answer is perfect and complete, but now I have a question.</p>
<p>In all the years&nbsp; I work with Project I never noticed what is described here as:</p>
<p><em>(using the sort option available in the column itself from largest to smallest).&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p>What have I been missing?</p>
<p>Thanks aheead,</p>

<div>I think this may be new to Project 2010. If autofilter is turned on, clicking on it will bring up a drop-down window that includes both sorting and filtering.</div>

            <p>Hi Chen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your PC connected to domain?</li><li>Is this behavior arising on any specific website or any?</li></ul>
<p>This could be due to incorrect Internet Explorer settings. Let's try the following steps and check:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Turn Off to Store your Passwords from Desktop IE11</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Open Internet Explorer </p>
<p>b. Click <strong>Tools</strong> and then click <strong>Internet Options</strong></p>
<p>c. Click <strong>Content</strong> tab and under<strong> Auto Complete </strong>
section, click <strong>Settings</strong></p>
<p>d. Click to uncheck User names and passwords on forums</p>
<p>e. Click <strong>OK</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart Internet Explorer for new settings to make changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/fill-in-forms-remember-passwords-autocomplete#ie=ie-11-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remember passwords and fill out web forms</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Change Behavior of UAC Prompt for Administrators in Security Policy</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press the <strong>Windows + R</strong> keys to open the Run dialog, type <strong>
secpol.msc</strong>, press <strong>Enter </strong>(If prompted by UAC, click/tap on
<strong>Yes</strong>.)</p>
<p>b. In the left pane, expand <strong>Local Policies</strong>, click/tap on <strong>
Security Options</strong>, and double click/tap on <strong>User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode
</strong>in the right pane.</p>
<p>c. Select the behavior you want, and click/tap on <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>Note: <em>The default setting is <strong>Prompt for consent for non-Windows binaries</strong>.</em></p>
<p>d.&nbsp; When finished, close the Local Security Policy editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Hi <span>Niranjan,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your reply!</span></p>
<p><br />
For your Question:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your PC connected to domain?</li><li><em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Answer: Yes.</span></strong></em></li><li>Is this behavior arising on any specific website or any?</li><li><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I</span></em></strong><em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">t happened on a local html, not website. And internet access is needed to display the content in that html</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">.</span></em></li></ul>
<p>Here is a sample of my local html:</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------local html begin--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&lt;html&gt;<br />
&lt;head&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;meta HTTP-EQUIV="pragma" CONTENT="no-cache"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;meta HTTP-EQUIV="Cache-Control" CONTENT="no-cache, must-revalidate"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="no-cache"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;meta HTTP-EQUIV="expires" CONTENT="0"&gt;<br />
&lt;head&gt;<br />
&lt;body&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;!-- Here we need some Internet access to display those picture --&gt;<br />

&lt;/body&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------local html end--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;1, I have tried your Step1, but it is still reproduciable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2, I don't believe this is a UAC of local PC, for the proxy server is on another PC within same domain.</p>

                    <p>Hi. The only error message I've received actually is "PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGE_AREA" or similar; previous error codes has been generic errors, with no actual explanation. But what does this message really mean? And what MS is doing in order to fix that? I won't
 tell you about collateral damages to my running Build now! Have I to quit, perhaps? Thanks for suggestions, by the way. Cheers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: my OS is now compromized and standard setup too. Here a list of corrupted apps and features: MStore, online troubleshooters, start menu, Recovery (all), so, no Reset, no Clean Start, no roll back to Previous Build.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Hotmail asked me to re-update my account but I can&#39;t find a way</h2>
                    I have been receiving an email asking me to re-update my account to the 2013 standard over the past few months.&nbsp; I tried to update it by clicking the "update here" button inside the email but I couldn't find any specified 2013 standards from that pop-up.&nbsp;
 I have had several other hotmail accounts which have used my main hotmail account to sign up and I am sure that I am not going to re-activate these emails again.&nbsp; So I would like to know if those emails, which I received 5 identical mails today, are regarding
 my main account or those hotmail accounts that I have not used for a long time.&nbsp; If they are regarding my main account, hot can I upgrade/ update the account to the 2013 standard?&nbsp; Thank you for your help.<br />
<br />
P.s. the following is the content and the "update here" link inside the mail<br />
Problem with your hotmail account re-update your account to meet the 2013 upgraded standards of microsoft for better,safer and faster useage of hotmail. Click update here below to update<br />

<h2>            Resizing a table in Word 2011 for Mac without using &#34;table properties&#34; window</h2>
                    In Word on a PC, there is a toolbar option on the ribbon for resizing a table in Word - you can select rows or columns and manually enter a width or height or just tick the up and down areas to fuss with it visually. You can also remove spacing before/after
 text in a table with these toolbar options. Please tell me there is some comparable option on a Mac -- control-clicking for table properties and then selecting height/width and having to exit the table properties window is extremely tedious for complex table
 formatting.

            Those features cannot be added to the Ribbon but you have at least 3 options:<br />
<ul>
<li>Hold the Option key while dragging a Gridline. Numerical values will be displayed on the Ruler</li><li>Create a custom toolbar to include the TableRowHeight &amp; TableColumnWidth commands</li><li>Assign custom keyboard shortcuts to those commands</li></ul>

            I installed Sharepont Online P2 (I had P1) and this corrected the situation. I then went back to Sharepoint P1 (deactivated P2) and it worked fine--no more error messages and I was able to use Sharepoint Designer. I've since installed Microsoftproject

    <title>Manipulating shape data in Visio for export to SQL Server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve_b_2009  say:</h3>
<h2>            Manipulating shape data in Visio for export to SQL Server</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a specific problem with using Visio and trying to export to an SQL Server 2005 database. I originally thought I had a solution, as I want to export shape data to a database, and then use a trigger in SQL Server to start a job that transforms the data
 into a table in which it can be processed/analysed in a specific form.<br />
<br />
However, I realise that Visio doesn't update the table, it actually deletes and creates a new one which of course deletes the trigger. I then looked to use the Link to ODBC database, but when I do this and the extra columns are added to the shape data the key
 field isn't automatically populated (I have other 100 process maps) where as when I export to database there is a key number assigned in the table, which doesn't make sense as to why I should have to go through every shape, in every map assigning the keys
 to perform an update query. On top of this there is an error appearing that the trigger has caused a problem, but when I go to SQL Server there is no error at all and the task is performed by the trigger as requested.<br />
<br />
I wonder if someone has a suggestion, is there a way I can trigger an event when a table is deleted and created at the SQL Server side, or can this database update process in Visio get any easier?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Steve

<p>If your shapes do not contain the database table unique ID, but they do contain pseudo keys, then you could create an updatable view in your database that has the pseudo key.<br />
For example, your Employee table could have a guid as the primary key, but the combination of FirstName + LastName may be sufficient to uniquely identify a record.&nbsp; Therefore the FisrtName and LastName fields are a pseudo key.&nbsp; You should be able to create
 an updateable view defning these as the complex key in our view.&nbsp; You can then use the Viso Database add-on to link to the view, and revords should get updated, added, or deleted - thus performing these actions on your base table.</p>

                    <p>The responses from those who monitor Outlook is corporate cute. And expected.</p>
<p>But the new Outlook is so Very Terrible, that those of US who loved and have been a part of Hotmail since it's inception , might be lead to believe that the R&amp;D dept. or hired developer Never used it in their lifetime? ??</p>
<p>This new Outlook is a lazy, pathetic designers attempt to.......do nothing!!</p>
<p>What did you make better??</p>
<p>NOTHING!</p>
<p>What did you screw up??</p>
<p>- The easy one glance ability to either read " said email " or delete in up to &nbsp;a 10 email selection at once.</p>
<p>- The ability to easily place emails into folders.</p>
<p>Why explain it,..WE all know the new Outlook is a " Microsoft is done with your stupid account....." phase out.</p>
<p>Which in actuality is a shame from a business perspective.</p>
<p>Hotmail, may not be Facebook popular?&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, there ARE many longterm users!!!!!!</p>
<p>Microsoft, &nbsp;you are forcing Your Clientele to depart and sever ties with you.</p>
<p>I left the iPhone world long ago for Samsung / Android.</p>
<p>Why???</p>
<p>- Freedom, and elimination of loved apps being manipulated.</p>
<p>Microsoft is creating the Same Problem.</p>
<p>IF, the business is really about money????</p>
<p>And Microsoft " thinks " it needs to change??</p>
<p>Why not do the smart thing.........</p>
<p>Ask your client base what WE like, and what WE think you do well. Then work from there.</p>
<p>But this new Outlook??? Sorry but, IT SUCKS!</p>

<p>Half the time it doesnt load emails/ not displaying junk folder</p>
<p>Time to sort it out microsoft as it SUCKS</p>
<p>I have used your email service for a long time but i think it could be time to move on to a service that actually WORKS</p>

            I am really surprised that this new look was not checked &amp; reviewed before launching it. I agree it sucks, and looks like it is a primitive attempt to add extra features ignoring the basic interface. Please keep it simple and quick. thanks

            <p>This is ridiculous... Been using Hotmail forever and this new client is beyond garbage. I work in IT, I endorse change, I believe its all part of getting to a better place from a technological standpoint but ****!!!! this POS is crap. I had to delete and
 recreate my inbox rules b/c theres no support for the free version and theres no way to properly diagnose a failing rule or set of rules. Even after doing so the new rules fail to process.. I had a simple rule to move messages from a single sender to a folder,
 that sender doesn't change, 2 weeks later.. 35 messages in my folder from that sender.. Rule was there and "on". I created the very same rule and all the messages were moved- go figure.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not to mention the absolute fail for manually moving messages to folders, the interface that jumps all around when trying to scroll up or down, the inability to use it in chrome..UGH..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish that I wasn't so tied in professionally to this email address b/c i'd be out of here immediately!!</p>

            Microsoft obviously does not care that their email system now officially sucks.&nbsp; Mail not being received, not sent, not syncing properly, folders disappear. It is amateur hour on display and Microsoft seems rather proud of what they have "accomplished"......
 Perhaps we should all upgrade to "premium" so we can pay to have a crappy email system.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;Yes 2017 and you are still relevant today! I am leaving also. </p>
<p>On my iPad (Going android as well) I click on the &nbsp;link for the desktop site and then it goes back to the mobile site when I open my email so I cannot create or delete folders!
</p>
<p>I should not have to go to the library to use a desktop computer to do that! I am so tired of these mega corporations that don't give a damn about their customers...</p>

            I can not believe how **** this outlook is, i dont have the time or patient to go through it all. How could Microsoft get it sooo wrong. Reading emails is confusing, it doesnt send emails that i ask it to and tells me i have unread emails when i have already
 read them!! sort it out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<h2>            OneNote Report for auto refresh of items marked as TODO</h2>
                    I am new to the OneNote experience and am starting to see some utility in it, however, i really need a report/summary page.&nbsp; I'm trying to keep all customer notes and action items in meetings in onenote which is working out well.<br />
<br />
The issue i'm having is i'd like to have for each customer and then for all customers a "TODO Summary" page that auto-updates either all unchecked todo's in the entire notebook or only the current group of pages.<br />
<br />
I tried using the Tags Summary and then creating a Summary Page, but that's not auto updating and it's super annoying if i click "refresh" and then the summary page items duplicate the existing items.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

            AFAIK, I dont think you can have To DO Summary for each individual and also for all together.<br />
I could not do the same from my end.<br />
