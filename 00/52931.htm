<h2>            Error code&#58; 0xC004C008</h2>
                    <p>I've had my computer for about a month and a half now, and i decided the motherboard i have wasn't up to spec. I decided to get a MoBo better for gaming and overclocking, so i did. After installing the board yesterday, Windows 10 told me to activate, that
 my key was incorrect. After doing some research, i called Microsoft and after a long, long call he told me to do a clean install with my Windows 8.1 disc. So i did. Now Windows is giving me this error, telling me the "activation server reported that the product
 key has exceeded it's unlock limit". Everything about my computer is the same from when i first built it and installed Windows except the new motherboard and some ram.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows installed on a 128 GB SSD and a 1 terabyte HDD alongside it. I also have the original install disc and the product key with the computer. Any suggestions?</p>

            I called yesterday and was told to wipe my hard drive that Windows was installed on and use the installation disc to install the os cleanly. I entered the product key, everything that was required for setup i did. Yet i still get the activate windows message.&nbsp;

<h2>            Accidentally downloading to Recovery &#40;D&#58;&#41; Drive.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased and downloaded Windows 7 to my computer. Everything works fine except I downloaded it to my recovery drive and now I cannot update because of the lack of space. I tried moving the files to my C drive but it wont give me access.</p>
<p>Perhaps I somehow changed how to allocate the disk space and need to somehow change it back, uninstall windows and then reinstall it the right way.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

 If I may assume you have a cd Burner installed on your computer, it seems the best thing to do is to copy the Windows 7 software from the recovery drive
</span></p>
<p><span>to a Blank write once or a formated RW CD.&nbsp; Then you can install from the CD with no problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this solves your problem.&nbsp; Have a good evening.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi2.social.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fresources%2fimages%2ftrans.gif%3fcver%3d2.13.0068.2" /></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 does not see two identical external hard drives, 2 TB each.</h2>
                    Windows 7: I have two identical external hard drives, RetailPlus brand, 2 TB each. I want to copy files from one to the other. The LeNovo T510 recognizes each one when I connect them separately. When I connect both, the device manager does see both, but
 Windows Explorer does not see both, it only sees one drive and always as "E:" no matter which USB port I plug it into. I can see either one of the 2TB drives and any other smaller external drive (such as a flash drive, SD card, or 500GB drive) at the same
 time. What do I need to do so my laptop sees both 2TB external hard drives?

<p><span><span><strong>d)</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Scroll down so you can see your external drives</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></span>You will notice that the first External hard drive is
<strong>"Online"</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>f)</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You will notice that the other External hard drive is<strong> "Offline"</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>g)</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Right-Click on<strong> "Offline"</strong> and a shortcut menu will give the option to turn External hard drive<strong> "Online"</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>h)</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Wait for a few seconds and check in the Windows Explorer if both the External hard drives get detected</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps!</span></p>

            hello.&nbsp; I have experienced the same issue.&nbsp; The response proposed in the kb article wasn't helpful, because the unsuccessful initial login meant there was no SID created for that profile, hence no values to adjust.&nbsp; the only SIDs listed in the registry
 are for previously existing logins, not the new one that cannot be "logged in".

<h2>            Microsoft Movies Will Not Play Offline on Surface Pro 3 with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have downloaded movies that I have purchased from the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV application as I would like to view them offline when I am travelling and not connected to the internet.&nbsp; They are downloaded directly to my Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10 where
 they reside.&nbsp; When I attempt to play them offline I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Can't play.&nbsp; Make sure you're connected to the Internet, then try again.&nbsp; If you're definitely connected, make sure no firewalls or proxy servers are blocking access to online services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>0xc00d1126. (0xc00d1126)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are movies that I have purchased (not rented)&nbsp;and viewed before.&nbsp; That does not seem to make any difference.&nbsp; They work fine online, but not offline.&nbsp; By trial and error I found is that if&nbsp;I start the video for a few seconds while connected to the
 internet&nbsp;prior to attempting to watch it offline, it will play offline.&nbsp; While, yes,&nbsp;this&nbsp;is a workaround,&nbsp;it not very practical as it is a pain to have to open up each video and watch for a few seconds&nbsp;each time prior to traveling on the oft chance I might
 what to watch it when an internet connection is not available.&nbsp; This is silly and is not worthy of a modern OS like Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an addendum: prior to my current travel I rented a movie using the Movies &amp; TV app and downloaded it to my Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I did not start it first while contacted to the internet.&nbsp; When I tried to play it offline, it immediately told me
 that it had expired, which was only hours after downloading it.&nbsp; Thus, I paid for a rental I never got to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a better fix for this problem than each&nbsp;time&nbsp;having to open all movies you might want to watch offline just in case an internet connection might not be&nbsp;available?&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Hi fabioo75,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you sign in in your xbox? Is this error only on Xbox App?</p>
<p>You can try clear all the data for this app on Windows 10, just go to Windows Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Choose Xbox on the list &gt; Advanced Options and select Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good game! :)</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>It sounds like you are having trouble signing into the Xbox App on Windows 10 is that correct? If so, are you able to successfully sign into your Microsoft account at
<a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Account Website</a>? If you are I would recommend uninstalling and reinstalling the app and trying again after that. Let us know with a reply how it goes.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>             Windows Media Center recording becomes static&#47;choppy after 10 minutes.</h2>
                    
<p><span>After 10 minutes of recording analog cable signal in Windows Media Center, the video recording turns staticy/choppy.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I use a two-way The cable signal runs through a splitter, one to the cable modem and the other plugs into the Hauppauge WinTV-HVR 950Q tuner.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t know if the splt should make a difference because the problem occurs after the recording has been going about 10 min, but thought I would mention it just in case.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The video isn’t “choppy” like it is a buffering issue, it is more static, as if there was a bad connection.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My laptop heats up when watching live TV and eventually will shut down my laptop if it gets too hot so (Am NOT buying a laptop with AMD chip again).<span>&nbsp;
</span>But the issue is where I am setting it to record, and then shutting down WMC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It has been able to record 2 hour long shows without overheating, but the resulting video is unwatchable after about 10 min.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have been to the Hauppauge website and installed the Windows Media Center setup kit and updated the drivers.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any ideas would be really appreciated.
</span></p>

            Hi PronotPug,<br />
<br />
As a first step of troubleshooting, let us try changing the location where Media Center records TV shows<br />
Check the link below for the same.<br />
<br />
<strong>Set recording options in Windows Media Center</strong> <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Set-recording-options-in-Windows-Media-Center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Set-recording-options-in-Windows-Media-Center
</a><br />
<br />
You can also try connecting the cable directly bypassing the splitter and check if that works.<br />
<br />
You can also visit the link below that talks about <strong>Why didn't my TV show record in Windows Media Center?</strong>
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Why-didnt-my-TV-show-record-in-Windows-Media-Center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Why-didnt-my-TV-show-record-in-Windows-Media-Center

    <title>Enforce Startup Apps through GPOs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danieledm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enforce Startup Apps through GPOs</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My specific problem is that one of the applications configured on the PCs of my company doesn't start automatically at login of the users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found out that startup is turned off in Startup Apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>And disabled in Task Manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I enable the App, then when I restart the PC it comes back to disabled.</p>
<p>I would like to enforce the status Enabled on all the workstations of my organization, so I was looking for a GPO but I wasn't able to find it.</p>
<p>By the way the&nbsp;<span>\Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Logon "Run these programs at logon" doesn't work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you in advance for you help,</span></p>
<p>

<p>Eventually I figured out what was the problem.</p>
<p>In order to force a workstation to have a program in status Enabled in the Startup, is necessary to properly set the following Registry Key:</p>
<p>HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartupApproved\Run</p>
<p>with a value correspondant to the name of the application to the value&nbsp;([byte[]] 0x02,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance for OneDrive I entered the following powershell command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set-ItemProperty HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartupApproved\Run -Name "OneDrive" -Value ([byte[]](0x02,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00))<br />

    <title>Cannot Sign Up or Download Profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dooxn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Sign Up or Download Profile</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.&nbsp; I have been playing games offline on my XBox for years.&nbsp; Recently (today), I decided to buy an Ethernet cable and connect my XBox to my router (Netgear WNDR3700).&nbsp; When I went back into my XBox, it updated my system as expected (so the connection to
 the internet and Live servers is working, obviously).&nbsp; Then, I tried to sign up for XBox Live and it keeps telling me that my email or password is not valid (no actual error code).&nbsp; After an hour or so of scouring the internet and trying a few possible solutions,
 I realized that I had signed up for a Live account through GFWL to play Arkham City.&nbsp; So, I tried the Download Profile link on my XBox and I still get "This email address or password isn't valid. Try again."&nbsp; I'm at a loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the above, I have also unplugged my router, modem, xbox, and computers for a while.&nbsp; Restarted my XBox a few times. Cleared System Cache on my memory card. Verified that the Netork, Intenet, and XBox Live connected via the Netword Settings.</p>
<p>My only guess at this point is that it must have something to do with having signed up originally for GFWL?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Vibroplex, no offense meant in any way, but I'm not sure you actually read my problem. &nbsp;There is no Gamer Profile on my XBox that is associated with an XBox Live account. &nbsp;And I've already tried Download Profile. &nbsp;Not sure how your steps are going to help.
 &nbsp;I realize that you offer that solution in most threads and it probably helps in a majority of the cases, but I'm not sure it applies here. &nbsp;If you really think I need to delete the offline account on my XBox, I can. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, Mattom. &nbsp;When I click "Download Profile", there is nowhere for me to enter a gamer tag (that I see anyway). &nbsp;I just enter my Windows Live ID and password. &nbsp;Then, it tells me "This email address or password isn't valid. Try again." &nbsp;I'm sure I'm using
 the correct username and password. &nbsp;I've tried it multiple times (both on my computer and on the XBox).</p>
<p>The offline profile on my XBox is a different name than my GFWL tag. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>So, correct me if I'm wrong - you have an offline profile on your xbox currently, different from the profile you are using right now to post, that you are trying to now get online?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case, your Windows Live ID (now Microsoft Account) is the email address that you used to sign up. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx</a>&nbsp;to reset your password. Once you've
 done that, you should be able to login. Remember, your username is the email address you used to sign up, along with your password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Greetings DooXN!<br /> First: You only need the credentials from your Windows Live ID (email and password) to download your profile. Second: Could you verify if you can sign in properly to <a href="http://www.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live.com</a> Make sure that your WLID has not been temporarily blocked.<br /><br />For more information about how to manage your Microsoft account: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-microsoft-account</a><br /><br />Post back and let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Well, that fixed it. &nbsp;For whatever reason, I could sign in to Hotmail and XBox Live on my computer, but the password wasn't working on the XBox. &nbsp;When I tried to change my password on live.com, it told me that I was entering the incorrect old password, which
 is REALLY weird since I used that old password to sign in so that I could change my password in the first place. &nbsp;Anyway, I went through the steps to reset the password (the same steps you would use if you actually lost/forgot your password) and that worked.
 &nbsp;I just downloaded my Profile.</p>
<p>Next problem... &nbsp;I set up the original GFWL account to play Arkkam City on my computer. If I delete the GFWL profile on the computer so that I can associate my offline XBox profile with my current WLID, will I still be able to play ARkham? &nbsp;I mean, Arkham
 is tied to Steam right? &nbsp;Not my WLID? &nbsp;hmmm.... maybe this question is better suited to a GFWL forum?</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for your help!</p>

    <title>Master Chief Collection achievements not unlockign and progress not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pliantboat33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Master Chief Collection achievements not unlockign and progress not updating</h2>
                    <p>Hello. As of Friday achievements for Halo The Master Cheif Collection
 are not unlocking for me. Progress has stopped updating too. Played 
Friday with some friends. We were finishing up the beat Halo 3 campaign 
under 3 hours achievement. They got the achievement and I didnt. Final 3
 missions we did 2 of the 3 updated on Halo waypoint but 1 didn't for 
times. For difficulty only 1 updated to Legendary. the other two are 
Heroic and did not update. I was host. Tried after we stopped playing to
 get a terminal achievement to see if others worked and nothing.</p>

<p>I have tried restarting the console. Puling power brick. Playing Halo
 2 anniversary or Combat Evolved multiplayer all to see if I could get 
synced with servers. Nothing. Also read after resetting power brick to 
wait up to 72 hours for things to sync but nothing. I wonder if things 
were messed up by he last Halo 5 update but different games. Also have 
noticed xbox 360 having party and connection problems last week but 
different console. Not sure if they have anything to do with it. I know 
this has been a problem and achievements can take days or weeks to 
unlock. This is first time Ive had this problem.</p>

<p>I have been wanting to play to unlock achievements last few days but cant do anything. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Problems with achievements links is already outlined in my comment. Everything Ive tried or isn't a problem. that second link is useless. Telling people to check True Achievements when its Microsoft that oversees them and controls the infrastructure since its Microsofts equipment is stupid. True Achievements has nothing to do with achievement problems. I know that.</p>

</p><blockquote>Как решить эту проблему -&nbsp;0x8015DC0B?
</blockquote>
<p>Здравствуйте, Евгений!</p>
<p>Как давно у вас эта проблема? У меня уже дня 3. До этого все было норм, играл себе спокойно в Forza Horizon 3.</p>
<p>Я пытался гуглить по разным форумам в поисках решения этой проблемы, но все что там советуют - чистой воды кулибинщина.&nbsp; Больше всего меня волнует причина этого недуга, т.к. никаких изменений в системе не было.</p>
<p>Более того, я не могу залогиниться в xbox live ни с одно устройства - ни с ПК, ни с планшета, ни с телефона. Такое ощущение что мелкие просто положили болт на мой аккаунт без всяких пояснений.</p>

<p>Да, это я уже понял когда погрузился в дебри форума комьюнити. И да это хоть какое-то утешение, т.к. я тут у себя от отчаяния уже все девайсы перековырял пытаясь решить эту проблему - не думал что мелкие могут так лажать. Это фэйл.</p>
<p>И очень странно что мелкие молчат в тряпочку. Вообще ноль реакции. При том что эта хр*нь уже несколько дней меня мучает - все выходные убил. Чесс сказать, я в шоке от мелких.</p>
<p>Такая вот шняга вылезла без особых пояснений.</p>

<p>

<li><strong>Why do I get an error when I sign in?</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you get an error or are unable to sign in, there are a few common issues that could be causing this:</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you're connected to a network and that you can access the Internet. To test your connection, go to
<a href="http://bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p></li><li>See if there's an Xbox Live service outage at <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p></li><li>Check your PC's clock. The clock must match the Xbox Live servers for sign-in to be completed. Your date and time settings for
<strong>Set time automatically</strong> must be set to <strong>On</strong>. </li><li>As a final step, try removing the Microsoft account by going to <strong>Settings</strong>, selecting

<h2>            How do I force Windows 8 to update my pc&#39;s microsoft account password now that I have changed it online&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unable to get into my windows 8 account. It's a Live account so per the instructions online I logged into my microsoft account from another computer and changed the password. I restarted my laptop, and connected it to my wireless network, so that it
 could learn about this password change from the microsoft server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This hasn't worked, and it has been an hour. I've rebooted several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an effort to continue troubleshooting I enabled the local administrator account, and have successfully booted into it, so at least now I have some options. Is there a way to force a sync of the locally cached microsoft password with the live account password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Scott</p>

                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Xbox for many years without problems (with a high ping (170-210) for tests but all this years without packet loss or problems with download speed when I buy some game. Recently my xbox can't download with my ISP speed plan (120 download). The rate
 that used to be oscillating between 70-100 now is only 15, 10, 5 and I'm having a lot of packet loss (almost 15% few days ago).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For working with IT and being easy I did some traceroute tests for 2 hosts (xeas.xboxlive.com and local domain globo.com) and I asked some friends to do the same (to make sure the problem is not here with some ISP route), so:</p>

 referring to Live but notice how many hops there are in ntwk.msn.net servers.</p>
<p>Xbox live is currently bad for us Brazilians and getting worse. Could you help us? I'm bringing these simple tests that is the will and complaint of many Brazilians about the quality of Xbox Live servers for us ;/</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem on my home-built PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 Pro build installed in July works just fine. However, after the November Update of Win 10 x64 from build 10240 to 10586, neither the start menu nor any of the modern apps work. I know none of the modern apps work because I have access to them
 through Classic Start Menu (CSM), which I have installed. What I see when I select a modern app from CSM is a program window flash on the desktop for a fraction of a second and immediately disappear. Since I have system sounds associated with the Open Program
 and Close Program events, I get sound feedback that a program is opening and then closing a second later. I've tried every one, and not one of them will run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, the modern settings app does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with my keyboard or mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I applied the DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth command. After a while it reported: " No component store corruption detected."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Get-App-Package" command run from Powershell churned for a while and ended, with the result that there is no change: No start menu, No modern apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the second time I did an upgrade install (after restoring a system image, not uninstalling the update). Both times produced the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a Plan B (or C or D) short of a refresh or clean install of Windows??</p>

            <p>The mouse and keyboard work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wound up having to do a fresh install on 10586. &nbsp; After that things seem to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, 3 of 3 systems have had issues with the 10586 "update" which seems to indicate it was not fully tested.</p>

            <p>Same issue here. &nbsp;Upgraded three desktops, the first two are fine, my main one that I did last has no Start menu, either from left-click or from the Windows key. &nbsp;I can right-click on the Start menu to get right-click options. &nbsp;I can Windows-R on the keyboard
 to do a "shutdown -r" to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there's nothing wrong with my keyboard or mouse.</p>

            <p>Neither the right-click or the left-click worked on the start menu icon for me. &nbsp;The windows menu key did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, none of the "system" taskbar items (search, desktop, store, edge) worked. &nbsp;I could access the my installed Apps that I pinned to the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had 3 of 6 updates work well. &nbsp;Two had full lockups after the update with keyboard and mouse non-functional (Both were Lenovo thinkpad T410s), but I did a hard reset and then they were fine on reboot. &nbsp;The Acer D250 laptop described above had the non-funcitonal
 start menu and system functions.</p>

<p>Looks like your Start menu is corrupted. Type Windows Key + R and type "cmd". Type the command "sfc /scannow"</p>
<p>After the scan is complete, restart, and it should be working. If not you can uninstall the update by going to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery, where you should find the option to roll back to the previous version of Windows.</p>

<h2>            Issues Connecting to Xbox Live With AT&#38;T</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, there have been a lot of people having issues connecting to Xbox Live with AT&amp;T as a provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having an issue connecting your console, please follow these instructions that may resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Settings &lt; Network &lt; Network Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose Advanced Settings &lt; DNS Settings &lt; Then Manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Primary IPv4 DNS please enter: 1.1.1.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Secondary IPv4 DNS please enter: 1.0.0.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that happens, hold the power button on the Xbox console for 10 seconds and power it back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should connect you back to the WIFI and resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>

            Any other suggestions?&nbsp; I tried this but it didn't make a difference as I still cannot connect.&nbsp; Maybe I should ditch the wireless and plug it in.

<p>Hello MichaelEllis2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try that but I would first try the steps provided and also try clearing the alternate MAC address located in Settings &lt; Network &lt; Network Settings &lt; Advanced Settings &lt; Alternate MAC &lt; Clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
<p>

            I'm afraid it still didn't work.&nbsp; It may be an issue with AT&amp;T.&nbsp; It seems I frequently lose the signal on my cell phone.&nbsp; May a cable is the best choice.

<p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend if you can go hard wired then I would try that. I know for a while AT&amp;T customers were having a lot of issues. If they have been fixed or not that is another question. Have you tried calling AT&amp;T also?&nbsp; Please let us know if need anything else.</p>

<p>go across the screen. They are different colors at different times. I have a Compaq Presario, Windows 7 computer. What do I need to do? I know it's not from over-</p>

            <p>Hello Marcus,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span><span>Often we see crashes and hangs as the result
 of a program loading on startup.</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>To resolve these, we use clean boot troubleshooting.</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>The following article describes this process:</span></span></div>
<div><span><a href="https://mail.microsoft.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=f8thFxDfbU-xLjAxZTVyIZfXfqcmfc4IBkb66xzkhAgWkNaXRwm2pL519DloBKZgn8WlSJ_28zM.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fkb%2f929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How
 to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></a></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>In addition, the horizontal lines on your monitor may indicate issues with the video card.&nbsp; I would recommend checking with your manufacturer to verify that you have
 the latest drivers for it installed.</span></div>
