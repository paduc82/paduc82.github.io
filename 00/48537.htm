<h2>            Communication ban also bans CoD&#58; BO4 emblems&#63;</h2>
                    So i just got an arguably unfair communication ban which I‚Äôm fairly used to, despite RARELY if ever speaking in game or sending messages to randoms, and i noticed when starting Black Ops 4 that my emblem editor and Paintshop gun camo i had spent hours
 of effort in were also banned. Is that something you guys do? That‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous and unfair. Also, my only two communications with the general player base were one player in game yelling at me for saying I was better than him, and another person
 asking ME why my TEAMMATE team killed him in Blackout instead of asking my teammate himself, so my response was ‚Äú<span><strong>[Mod Removed ‚Äì Profanity]</strong></span>‚Äù. As far as I‚Äôm aware, while
 on the negative side of things, my interactions were not offensive to any degree reasonable for a week long ban. A single acronym that is WIDELY used throughout gaming platforms and gaming culture, and harmless in game banter doing nothing more than calmly
 pointing out the fact i was carrying my team. If mild and standard interactions like this are bannable then the enforcement team is out of touch with the community they are enforcing over and I‚Äôm sick of them.&nbsp;

<p>That would be something you would have to contact Activision about. Microsoft does not handle in-game suspension/bans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as communication suspension through Live, you can try submitting a case review at http://enforcement.xbox.com but profanity is a violation of the code of conduct. The action doesn't have to be offensive to warrant a suspension. It just has to violate
 the code of conduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suspension length varies based on the severity of the situation as well as previous enforcement actions. So while the suspension may be for something less severe, the length can still be lengthened due to previous suspension.</p>

            Profanity is against code of conduct? Let me know when an ACRONYM is considered profanity.<span><strong>[Mod Removed ‚Äì Profanity].</strong></span>. Yes one letter is the
<span><strong>[Mod Removed ‚Äì Profanity].</strong></span> word, but it is widely used over ‚Äúshut up‚Äù because it is faster to type. The moment a sting of letters that do not form a word is bannable
 is the moment you become a tool of censorship.&nbsp;

            Hi Polly6 
<br />
<br />You will need to do that manually, there is no feature in Windows for that . . .
<br />
<br />Connect up your camera to your PC
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar)
<br />
<br />On the left, click 'Pictures'
<br />
<br />Select the photos you want to put back on your camera, then press Ctrl + C to copy those
<br />
<br />Then on the left, click 'This PC' and on the right, double click your camera or the DCIM folder, whichever is visible
<br />
<br />Either way you must end up inside the DCIM folder
<br />
<br />Then Press Ctrl + V to copy those photos back onto your Camera . ..

<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your questions on transfering photos back to the camera.
<br />
<br />What kind of camera do you have?  Can you give me the brand and model?

            Hello Polly613
<br /> 
<br />Does your camera have an SD Card or will you be storing the pictures in your Cameras memory?
<br /> 
<br />If the camera has an SD Memory card then you need to place this memory card into the card reader on your PC. All you then need to do is copy the pictures you want to transfer to your camera and then paste them into the SD memory card.
<br /> 
<br />If your camera doesn't have an SD Memory card then you will be using the cameras' own memory to hold the new pictures. This will reduce the amount of memory you have for taking new pictures and, eventually, you will run out of memory and you will need to copy the pictures to another storage device.
<br /> 
<br />If you are just using the computers memory then the camera should have a USB lead which allows you to fasten one end to the camera and the other end to your PC's USB port to allow you to transfer data between the two.
<br /> 
<br />I am, however, assuming that your PC has an SD Memory card which stores the photographs.

Is the time enough?<br />
Do you have any suggestions?<br />

            Hello! Format the floppy normally, then try to create a ms-dos bootable disk with the option Create an Ms-dos startup disk. If it is agan greyed, try with this procedure:<br />
<br />
<br />
1) go on http://www.bootdisk.com/bootdisk.htm and download the bootable disk ms-dos 6.22<br />
2) after point 1, go where you have downloaded the file and open program. It will format floppy and create the ms-dos bootable&nbsp; floppy. Dont' remember! Insert floppy and format it before using program!<br />
3) after it has created bootable floppy, you insert the bios and upgrade program and you will go to update bios :) See istruction of the manual of the motherboard!<br />
<br />
edit: if files of ms-dos 6.22 will take up a lot, try version 6.00... It has less files but go well :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope you have been of help!

<h2>            Forza 6 online multiplayer lobby joining issue </h2>
                    
<p>I am experiencing issues when I'm trying to join the multiplayer online lobbies.</p>
<p>I can get to the "multiplayer hoppers pre race lobby" when I select a class of race, the "joining lobby" screen pops up.</p>
<p>But when it tries to connect to the server, it keeps disconnecting me from the server.
</p>
<p>I have preformed a reset (disconnected power plug &amp; re plug) on the unit.</p>
<p>Also did the same for my internet.&nbsp; This is the only game I'm experiencing issues.</p>
<p>Never had a problem playing online before, now I can not play this game online!</p>

<p>Please help!</p>

    <title>Xbox support staff lies - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xgn raginraptor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox support staff lies</h2>
                    <p>Xbox support staff are just plain liers they don't care what's going on they just want you gone, I had a broken game I've had to fight Xbox every step of the way to get a fix. No fix got offered refund and here the problem lies. The account I bought it from is closed ms policy bs says bank will send me a cheque I rang my old bank told them their policy is not to accept any monies to a closed account and bounce the monies back to which ever account it came from this case ms. So I ring Ms yet again tell them the issue with bank 1st rep tells me its been switched to my active account 2nd rep says I'm getting a cheque from Ms 3rd rep said its been passed to a team with no contact info surprise surprise. 4th rep said nothing on the account refund will be pending at my old bank. So I'm **** Ms are more than useless in helping I'm having to involve trading standards and possibly go to court just cause ms try to get out of their responsibility. I was told my old bank will one off refund me. Its

            <p>The problem is this per anti money laundering laws any refund done with a credit/debit card has to be put back onto the original account that the purchase was made off of. hence it going back to the original bank account that the charge was made on at that point it would be up to the issuing bank to then give you that money back.</p>

            <p>It's not that that's the problem it's the lies and the mess around they give support can't support anyone. Trying to get something rectified fixed or what ever is like trying to find rocking **** impossible. I understand the fact it was going back to bank it purchased from but the bank has sent it back de lined and Xbox won't help any further just saying I was recording the interactions the manager **** him self said its against the law for me to record them. Then hung up on me when refused to delete the recording. Now if they can record me I'm entitled to record them for my own protection against the lies if it wasn't for me doing this I'd have no proof of the lies and mess around. Then the fact I had to fight the whole way even to get a fix for my game I had to fight after being told to do the reset delete cache clear etcetera 4x over as well as re dl gears which is 100gb each time that's as much as support can help pitiful. That I can do without having to contact some 1 braincell support guy

I also had this BSOD today (16th Sep 2016) but this was the first time. There was a raft of Windows updates yesterday (most of them for Office, but also a few security updates). From the sound of it you've been experiencing this for quite some time, so it's
 unlikely to be a Windows update though. I hope someone here can help us. I clicked the two links from Arun B J but they were not relevant.

<h2>            Trackpad on Type cover does not work while charging</h2>
                    I spent all morning trying to figure out why my trackpad was not working, and after trying several things, I figured out that if my surface 3 is charging, the trackpad will not work. As soon as I unplug the charger, the trackpad works fine. I just tried
 to contact support, and surprise surprise - my warranty expired less than two weeks ago. What can I do to fix this issue?

<p>Original title: Security center.</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium 32 Bit</p>
<p>What I need to know is how do I&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop Monitoring Anti-Virus Status?</p>
<p>I have Verizon Fios with McAfee Security when I go to Action Center everything is set a ok and I have my windows defender&nbsp;firewall turned off along with windows defender anti-virus and I`m protected by McAfee but when I do a health report on my computer
 it lists a trouble saying windows defender is off and if your computer is using another security system to configure security center to stop monitoring anti-virus status.So once again how do I do this?</p>
<p>PS:Please if you know give me a step by step answer</p>

    <title>SurfaceBook crashing when resuming from sleep&#42; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SurfaceBook crashing when resuming from sleep&#42;</h2>
                    <p>Phone support has been horrendous, but I wanted to confirm if the issue I am experiencing is known issue. I've seen the problems reported by some regarding power management but I'm not sure my issue is included.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I leave my desk for an extended time (1 to 2 hours) my SurfaceBook crashes when trying to wakeup (very aggravating when you was in the middle of somethingl) even though it should not be sleeping. When plugged in I have it set for the monitor to
 turnoff after 15 minutes and sleep after 4 hours. The device is connected to a surface dock with 2 monitors connected via a VGA displayport adapter (for whatever reason I could not get hdmi to work).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's analyze -v of a kernel dump </p>

<p>Did you check and make sure you still have it unlocked? Sometimes when you purchase a skill and then die, it reverts your skill tree to a previous state. Furthermore, sometimes the game wants you to do things a particular way, specifically in story missions.</p>

<p>Oh, just a FYI: I just tested this out and he is a unique enforcer. You are supposed to use the explosive panel on the floor. Wouldn't be much of a "boss fight" if you could just hit B and kill him.</p>

    <title>keyboard driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave w.1  say:</h3>
<h2>            keyboard driver</h2>
                    <p>I can't find a driver for an 'MS wireless comfort keyboard 5000' - model 1394, on the MS website.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I want to use this keyboard on a new envy 750-414 pc. I'm assuming I will need a driver.
</p>
<p>Can someone supply a link or directions to find it ?</p>
<p>I plugged in the usb attachment for the keyboard but it didn't work. I also want to use a wireless Logitech&nbsp;mouse.</p>
<p>The batteries in both&nbsp;are good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you'</p>

            <p>Specific drivers are not required for keyboards or mice to work in the basic mode. Only where a device has special features such as extra keys or buttons might a driver be used to allow those features to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even then the device should still work&nbsp;with the standard operations as they are classified as HID compliant.</p>

            <p>You generally do not need drivers for mice or keyboards.&nbsp; You should be able to just plug in the USB transceiver and turn on the keyboard.&nbsp; If it doesn't work:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you sure that you have the correct USB transceiver for this particular keyboard?&nbsp; They have to be matched.</li><li>What happened when you plugged in the USB transceiver?&nbsp; Did you hear the USB connection sound and get a pop-up that a driver was being installed?&nbsp; If not, try another USB port.</li><li>With the USB transceiver plugged into your computer, open Device Manager (click Start Orb, type Device Manager into the Search box, press Enter).&nbsp; You should see a number of entries as shown below (all of these entries were created upon the connection of
 a USB transceiver for a Microsoft wireless mouse; a wireless keyboard is NOT present):</li></ul>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b26adab9-5c79-4ec7-9666-931002c021a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b26adab9-5c79-4ec7-9666-931002c021a0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do NOT see entries like these, then the USB transceiver you have is broken.&nbsp; Or, far less likely, the USB port is not functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although wireless mice and keyboards should work upon connection, Microsoft does offer additional drivers/management software that enable the "extra" functions of its hardware devices.&nbsp; You can, for example, create macros and assign hot keys to perform various
 functions.&nbsp; See, e.g.,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/support/how-to/keyboard/reassign-keys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/support/how-to/keyboard/reassign-keys</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/support/how-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/support/how-to</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As near as I can tell, the "wireless comfort keyboard 5000" was part of keyboard/mouse set:&nbsp; the Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000.&nbsp; You can find download links for the current versions of the Mouse &amp; Keyboard Center, IntelliType, and IntelliPoint here:
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/d/wireless-comfort-desktop-5000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/d/wireless-comfort-desktop-5000</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>AFAIK, the Mouse &amp; Keyboard Center combines the functions of IntelliType (keyboard driver) and IntelliPoint (mouse driver).&nbsp; If you only have a Microsoft wireless keyboard, you could just use IntelliType.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Microsoft software will NOT detect or work with your Logitech wireless mouse.&nbsp; And you'll need a separate USB transceiver for that.&nbsp; You'll have to decide if the lack of wires is worth losing 2 USB ports.</p>

<h2>            Surface Go&#58; UHS Compatibility</h2>
                    I tried searching but couldn't find this - any note on what the UHS grade is on the Surface Go 8gb Model? i was considering getting a fairly high-speed micro SD card for additional storage, but want to make sure the slot can actually take advantage of
 the card.

            Hi  IzzyQuiles,
<br />
<br />
<br />It should not be any issue with this.
<br />
<br />Just some members mention that UHS II will work only with speed as UHS I.
