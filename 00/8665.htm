<h2>            Error 452.4.7.0 &#40;F11-1&#41; Too many messages sent</h2>
                    <p>Over the last few days my microsoft outlook keeps having some messages (not all some are being sent) sitting in my outbox - when I try to send &amp; receive the error message Error 452.4.7.0 (F11-1) Too many messages sent is displayed.&nbsp; Having contacted tesco.net
 (my provider) they have advised that it appears that microsoft have made some changes which means there is too much sent traffic and their own mail gets the priority (not saying this is the case but this is what I was advised was the reason)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it that this has only just happened recently been using the same settings and equipment for years and why is it that some messages are being sent and others not and are sitting in my outbox no matter how many times I try to delete them and re-send
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting a bit frustrated with this now - is there a fix in the pipeline please</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            mute&#47;unmute on active call for 6650</h2>
                    I recently received my 6650 - a nice phone, but not having a mute/unmute toggle button on an active call is terrible! Is there any way to fix this? or is there a 3rd party application to allow mapping the mute/unmute "option" to a keypress?

            I have an N85, and very much want a simple mute key too.&nbsp; I've seen holding down the C button on other brands mapped to this and it works great.&nbsp; When doing a business conference call, such a feature is practically required.&nbsp; If this isn't coming soon
 via firmware, does anyone know of an app that adds this?

    <title>Outlook 2013 - How to sync only the inbox during imap send&#47;receive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bedjer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 - How to sync only the inbox during imap send&#47;receive process</h2>
                    <p>I did post that question in the "Office 2013 PREVIEW" forum.</p>
<p>The bug did not get fixed in the RTM version, and the question seems abandonned.</p>
<p>Answer I received from Microsoft was:</p>
<p>"We submitted the bug to the product team but they are not able to address it for the initial release. If we continue to get more feedback we can ask that it be reconsidered for SP 1 or a future product release. "</p>
<p>So I'm posting it again in this forum, just to know how many people are annoyed by that "feature"...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When configuring Send/Receive options for IMAP accounts, I can select "Download complete items includiong attachments for subscribed folders".</p>
<p>That feature works.</p>
<p>However, if I just want to synchronize the inbox, and not all the subfolders, I need to select "Use the custom behaviour defined below".</p>
<p>Problem is that below, I cannot select the inbox. The only folder I need to sync is not allowed to be checked !</p>
<p>Hitting send/receive button does not trigger the inbox sync unless "Download complete items includiong attachments for subscribed folders" is checked.</p>
<p>This is really annoying !</p>
<p>I've got 15 imap accounts configured, and I wish I'd be able to sync only the inboxes with the Send/Receive button.&nbsp; In Outlook 2010 it takes about 500 milliseconds to do the send/receive process for all the 15 imap accounts.</p>
<p>Still in 2010 version if I with to synchronize all folders I can still create another sync group called "Sync ALL" that takes longer to sync.</p>
<p>With Outlook 2013 if I want the inboxes ONLY&nbsp;to be synched, I Cant.&nbsp; &nbsp;I need to sync ALL the subscribed folders.&nbsp; So if I have 20 subfolders per account, it takes 20X the time to complete the Send/Receive operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't figure out why we're given the choice to select ANY folder to sync when selecting the custom behaviour, and at the same time the ONLY folder that we SURE want to be sync (the inbox) is not even checkable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is definitely a show stopper that will prevent me from upgrading to 2013.&nbsp; Especially if many users sync all mailboxes everytime it's gonna put more stress on the server / bandwith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI the Send/Receive parameters screen has been redesigned in Office 2013. It's no longer possible to do a Send/Receive to get only the email headers. We're forced to download the entire message and the attachments. I don't mind as I was always downloading
 complete items...&nbsp; But I do care that they removed the ability to sync inbox... !&nbsp;&nbsp; Too much code deleted while removing a feature !!

<p>I personally do not use that feature but understand that it would be useful as you&nbsp;described. Other than sending feedback, there is not much&nbsp;that can be done. Hopefully enough people will provide feedback so&nbsp;it will get fixed like they say.</p>

<p>Hi Judy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resizing desktop icons makes them easier to see. If you find them too large than normal, you can make them smaller. To resize desktop icons, Right-click (or press and hold) the desktop, point to
<strong>View</strong>, and then select <strong>Large icons, Medium icons</strong>, or
<strong>Small icons.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: You can also use the scroll wheel on your mouse to resize desktop icons. On the desktop, press and hold<strong> Ctrl</strong> while you scroll the wheel to make icons larger or smaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>

<h2>            Word 2010 - Template prompts ASK Field issues</h2>
                    Hi <br />
<br />
I have created a Word 2010 Macro Enabled Template with "Ask Fields" and "Ref Fields" so the user is prompted to fill these in once the document is opened. In the template when you open it by right clicking and selecting "Open" the following macro runs:<br />
<br />
<b><i>Sub autoopen()<br />
<br />
ActiveDocument.Fields.Update<br />
<br />
End Sub</i></b><br />
<br />
I have built in some auto text capabilities to this template. However when I open a new document from the template by clicking and selecting "New" when you right click the template or by double clicking it the macro isn't transferred and doesn't run.
<br />
<br />
Is there a way to make the Update fields macro run when a new document is created from the template?<br />
<br />
Many Thanks in advance <br />
<br />

<p>Since our forum is the English support forum, we cannot understand the language on your screenshot. To better help you to cancel it, I‚Äôd like to collect some information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Based on your screenshot, you only have one subscription. For my understanding, it should be the SharePoint online develop subscription and you want to cancel it. If I misunderstand anything, please feel free to correct me.<br />
2.&nbsp;I need to collect your tenant information to cancel the subscription. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please click on the link below to access to your Private MessageÔºö</p>

<h2>            Cant update from 10158 to 10159 - PC restarts back into normal login instead of update process</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried three times today to upgrade my 10158 build (which upgraded from 10130 yesterday without any problem) to 10159 build and each time with exactly the same result...frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps taken:</p>
<p>1&nbsp;- Run settings - System Update</p>
<p>2 - Windows Update discovers 10159 build, and downloads 100%</p>
<p>3 - Windows Update then 'prepares for update' and completes to 100%</p>
<p>4&nbsp;- Windows Update then schedules a restart, so I click on 'Restart Now'</p>
<p>5 - System then begins restarting, and 'configuring for windows upgrade' from 0% to 100% OK</p>
<p>6 - System then restarts after reaching 100%</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting, I get the usual windows login screen, instead of the upgrade screens, and after logging on, still on build 10158</p>
<p>Receive a notification that 'Windows was unable to complete the upgrade, click on this notification for more information' but when clicking on the notification, get taken back to the settings -&gt; system update screen where it starts to download the 10159
 build again</p>
<p>So then repeat from step 1 through to 6, with the same result three time so far..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas where I can investigate whats going on with this update? Previous ones have been fine...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tip, I disabled my wifi adaptor and left Ethernet plugged in, and tried again&nbsp;but still got the same result unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also searched on these threads and found a couple of more suggestions of things to try, such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1) Open "Services" (Win and type services) <br />
2) Stop "Windows Update" <br />
3) "Show hidden files and folders" ( Win and type, once opened the control panel apply)
<br />
4) Navigate to "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download" <br />
5) Delete folder contents <br />
6) Start "Windows Update" in services</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also these similar instructions</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>1. Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows Key + X&nbsp;on the keyboard and then select ‚ÄúCommand Prompt (Admin)‚Äù from the menu.</strong></span></p>

            <p>Further update - had the same problem with updating to build 10162 from 10158. Might have been a disk space problem, as I had 21Gb free, and Windows reporting a further 8.1Gb in 'Temporary storage' that no matter how many times I tried to clear up, would
 never clean up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only resolution was to download the .ISO image for 10162 from microsoft, wipe the partition clean and install from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Note I got the .ISO from here, but since then the downloads seem to have reverted back to 10130 for now so was just lucky to catch them at the right time it seems.
</p>
<span>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-download ]</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>So issue&nbsp;'resolved' in getting updated from 10158, but with the extreme approach of a complete clean install to 10162.</p>

<h2>            Three Finger Gestures Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I just recently updated my Toshiba Kira book to the 9926 build. Does this build support the three finger gestures? My touchpad can do all the original gestures (two finger scroll, pinch and zoom), but it doesn't register any of the three finger gestures.&nbsp;</p>

            Those gestures were only supported by Toshiba, and are not by&nbsp;Microsoft at this time.&nbsp; We will have to wait and see if they bring support for three finger gestures to future builds.&nbsp; If you can elaborate on what the gestures were and what they accomplished,
 that could bring fruition to future developments.

            <p>I was reading the "Get Started" app about gestures and it stated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Once you‚Äôre all set, try out some of the new gestures we‚Äôve added:<br />
‚Ä¢ &nbsp;Swipe three fingers up to open task view and see all your open apps.<br />
‚Ä¢ &nbsp;Swipe three fingers down to show the desktop.<br />
‚Ä¢ &nbsp;Swipe three fingers either left or right to switch between your open apps. Slide your fingers more slowly across the touchpad to flip through them all."</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, I thought these gestures were new to Windows 10 for all computers and not only Toshiba. I guess I was wrong?</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have the same problem with my Dell Inspiron N4010 with Synaptics v7.4 installed. I have all the functionality from my old driver - two finger scrolling, pinch to zoom, etc. but don't have any of the three finger gesture for launcing the taskview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the "Precision touchpad" essential for supporting this gesture or is it possible even in older synaptics drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the multiple desktop loses much of its charm if the older touchpads cannot use the gesture.</p>

            <p>Same problem here :Having an HP Zbook 15 with Windows 10. Synaptics touchpad. the driver is mentioning the availability of 3 fingers gestures, even allows to configure them in detail. However, in reality it doesn't work. Downloaded and installed the latest
 driver for Synaptics touchpad from hp website for Windows 10, didnt' work. Uninstalled it and installed the latest driver from Synaptics website directly. Helas, same result.</p>
<p>Any suggestions are welcome.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5130 XpressMusic original ringing and alert tones</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wife has 'accidentally' deleted all the original ring tones and alert tones that come with Nokia 5130 except the "Nokia tone" from the ringing tones and "On the fly" from the alert tones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried getting them back by resetting to factory settings, and reinstalling the software using Nokia Suite, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone can show me a way of restoring them then please help me. If [hopefully not] there's no way to restore them, then I hope anyone can help me by uploading them to any filesharing site (I don't think that's illegal). Please help me in anyway possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks alot..</p>

<h2>            DNS Records Incorrect in O365 but OK in 1and1</h2>
                    
<p>i'm trying to set up the dns in o365 and have followed the instructions exactly, i.e. i've verified i own the domain via the mx record and now i want to let o365 do the rest but it persistently fails to "find" the correct ns record information at my registrar,
 1and1. i've changed the ns records at 1and1 to the 4 ns&lt;x&gt;.bdm.microsoftonline.com values as specified and after a while, 1and1 has updated to show the changes have taken effect. when i try to get o365 to "set up my online services for me (recommended)), i
 get errors&nbsp;stating the&nbsp;current values are seemingly still the 1and1 defaults, see below. if someone can tell me where i'm going wrong and how to get over this, i'd be very grateful.</p>

            The default in Word is to (re-)display markup whenever a document is opened. This is a privacy option which reminds you that the document in fact contains markup.<br />
<br />
However, you can turn off the display of balloons for tracked changes and comments as follows: On the Review tab, click the arrow on the Track Changes button, and then click Change Tracking Options. In the "Use balloons (Print and Web Layout)" drop down, choose
 "Never." Click OK.

<p>Judging on your screenshot it seems track changes is active. Go to Review tab, see if the track changes button is active, deselect it, and while you are there&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Changes group you have to accept all of the changes.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office Setup Assistant won&#39;t launch</h2>
                    I recently purchased an Activation code for MS-Office 2011 for Mac.&nbsp; I downloaded the Free Trial software as per the instructions, but when I launch any of the applications, I'm never asked for an activation code. Meanwhile, when I try to manually launch
 Microsoft Office Setup Assistant, it appears to launch, but then immediately disappears.&nbsp; Meanwhile, everything about my application appears to be running normally, and I'm able to run and apply updates.&nbsp; But it just irks me that I paid for this activation
 code, but can't seem to actually activate the software, even though it does run...&nbsp; Anyone else come across this?<br />

<h2>            iCloud Calendar entrys entered on PC duplicate on Outlook synced iCloud Calendar when Outlook goes on line.</h2>
                    <p>My web based iCloud Calendar is synced to my PC Outlook, an iPad and my iPhone.&nbsp; New entries made on my PC iCloud Calendar duplicate when Outlook goes on line. Duplication is only on the PC, not on the other devices or the web.&nbsp; This first occurred in November
 of 2018. After a significant effort I was able to isolate the triggering to the Outlook "Go Online" event. I engaged Apple on the matter, thinking it was an iCloud hand shake issue. They are looking into it, but have not yet made a determination.&nbsp; The only
 way I have been able to eliminate the duplications is to uninstall and reinstall iCloud on my PC. This appears to permanently delete the existing duplications but does not prevent duplications of new entries. Has anyone experienced this problem and if so what
 is the solution?</p>

<p>Outlook 2013 is installed on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The iCloud Calendar is synced to my Outlook and presents itself as iCloud Calendar on the sidebar. I only make entries on the iCloud Calendar and do so just like I would on the Outlook Calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since reaching out, I did contact Microsoft technical support and worked with Freddy L in an attempt to resolve the issue. We did a screen share and as part of the process he set up a test profile and imported the calendar into that profile.&nbsp; While doing
 so he completely deleted iCloud access from the rest of my computer.&nbsp; I do not have access through my other profiles nor do I have access to my files.&nbsp; He bailed on me by disconnecting the Screen Share without consulting with me. &nbsp;</p>

Welcome to Microsoft Community. <br />

I will assist you in trying to resolve the issue; however I would require some more information;</div>
<div><br />
1) What type of email account are you working on? Is it POP3, IMAP or Exchange server email account?</div>
<div><br />
2) Is the email address selected from Address Book, Autocomplete list or entered manually? If it is selected from Address book or Autocomplete list, enter the email address manually and then try sending and verify the result.</div>

<h2>            Multiple item form construction in Access</h2>
                    <p>I want to create a form in access that uses multiple items and find the "Multiple Item" form very inflexible in terms of selecting and moving data around the form.&nbsp; It also won't let me delete one field of a multiple item without delecting all fields of
 the item.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Is there another way to construct a multiple item form that gives you more flexibility to how you want it to look and the content you want to show?</p>

            By multiple item form do you mean a continuous form with multiple rows displayed from your table?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>A continuous form is very flexible in design mode. You can control the type of controls displayed and how its placed on the form. But a continuous form is really one set of controls that are displayed multiple times. You cannot delete a control from the
 form without removing it from all records (not sure why you would want to).&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Here is a little more info on my dilemma:</p>
<p>I have 28 fields I want to display on one form, not 28.&nbsp; I use the "Multiple Item" form to get them on the same page.&nbsp; Once on the page I want to move some fields around but it won't let me do this - fields are all on one line.&nbsp; So, for example:&nbsp; I have
 the 28 fields (this is a quality evaluaton) that I want on the form.&nbsp; I also have&nbsp;fields for the employees name, date, manager, etc. that I only want to display and input once (at the top of the form).&nbsp; I can't seem to move these fields individally around
 the form AND I can't just use them once.&nbsp; Not sure if I have explained this properly but any insight you may have is&nbsp;appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Data is not stored in Forms; a Form is just a window, a tool that lets you manage data stored in Tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the structure of your Tables? If you have a one (employee) to many (evaluations??) relationship, you need two tables in a one-to-many relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is nothing (that I'm aware of, I haven't worked much with 2010 yet) in Access that I've seen called a "Multiple Item" form. A Continuous form can display multiple records, and is not restricted to displaying all the fields in the record on one line;
 are you perhaps using the Form Wizard to create a Subform? If so it defaults to creating a Datasheet form (which DOES display all fields on one row); but you can change that - open the form in design view, select the Subform by rightclicking the little square
 box at its upper left and selecting Properties. Change its Default View property to "Continuous Forms" and you should be able to move controls (forms have Controls, tables have Fields, they're NOT the same).</p>

            <p>There is a Multiple Item form in 2010.&nbsp; I tried using Continuous forms and it does solve the issue of moving controls around the page but does not solve the issue of just presenting certain controls just once in the form.&nbsp; Perhaps it is in how my data tables
 are constructed.</p>
<p>I have one table that houses all&nbsp;fields for the form.&nbsp; I then have separate tables that have employee and manager information.</p>
<p>I only need the employee name entered once on the form but I need some 28 other items in another field to be on the page. So, perhaps how I have structured my table is creating my limitations on the form?&nbsp;

            <p>It would seem so, but you haven't really said how you structured your table. You should certainly NOT have "one table that houses all the fields for the form" - you should have one table for each type of "Entity" - real-life person, thing or event - relevant
 to your database. There should be no information about personnel reviews in the Employee table, and no information about biographical data in the Reviews table, for example! Could you post the tablenames, table relationships (if you have any), and some relevant
 fieldnames of your tables?</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>There is a Multiple Item form in 2010. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
In the Create ribbon on the Form tab, when you select the pull down, at the top of the list is a Multiple Items form. This creates a Continuous form,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is how its been known from day 1. What I think is happening here, is that the form is opening in LAYOUT
 view, not DESIGN view. These are different views. Also, when you use one of those choices, it stacks the controls so you need to unstack them to move them around individually.
<div><br />
<div>Another point is the Multiple Items(Continuous form) form is use to display multiple RECORDS. Any form will display multiple controls (you don't have fields on a form, you have controls that may or may not be bound to fields in a record.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Given your&nbsp;structure, you do NOT need a continuous form. A regular form as a subform will allow you to display all the fields in the table associated with the Employee selected in the main form.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Having said that, your&nbsp;structure&nbsp;does not sound properly normalized. It sounds like you have 28 points to evaluate and you have a field for each of those points. That is using field names to define data which is incorrect. You should have a table like
 this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblEvaluations</div>
<div>EvaluationID (Primary Key Autonumber)</div>
<div>EmployeeID (Foreign&nbsp;Key)</div>
<div>EvaluationTypeID (FK)</div>
<div>Evaluation</div>
<div><br />
<div>You would then have a table of evaluation types to identify each record. This gives you a properly normalized VERTICAL&nbsp;structure&nbsp;instead of the horizontal one you have. And you would then use a continuous form to display all the evaluations for an employee.</div>

            Hi Andy,<br />
<br />
There are tools to step through your macros and run them individually. Click Tools &gt; macro &gt; Visual Basic Editor. Look at the six icons between the main and immediate window. They each have tool tips, so hovering over them will display their function.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Inbox Other folder empty</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>my Other folder in Inbox is suddenly empty. I have not changed any settings or made any other changes. All the emails were there last night and today morning when I checked it, there were no more messages. It says "Your Other inbox is cleared". However,
 I have not deleted anything. Any ideas what happened or how can I recover my e-mails?</p>
<p>Thank you.<br />

    <title>Creating a pedigree report with Access - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Creating a pedigree report with Access</h2>
                    &nbsp;First a bit of background. &nbsp;I have used dBase since Version III and have continued to do so in its various guises until recently when the product has pretty well disappeared. I have largely written ePOS, bookkeeping and accounting software.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been asked to rescue the herdbook for a small breed society. &nbsp;The data was given to me as an XML file which I have successfully imported into Access as three tables and it is producing useful information.. &nbsp;One thing I do need to produce is a pedigree
 form which is similar to a family tree showing five generations. &nbsp;This looks to be quite a challenge so any ideas you may have, even if it is 'don't even attempt it' will be gratefully received.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Malcolm</div>

</div>
<div>P.S. &nbsp;My eyesight is extremely poor and this text size is extremely small even on a 23" monitor. &nbsp;Ctrl+ unusually does not affect the text size. &nbsp;Any ideas on this problem would be helpful.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Unable to Update SP3 to 15014 Despite Multiple Reboots</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>I'm unable to update my Surface Pro 3 from 15007 to 15014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've restarted my Surface Pro 3 dozens of times now, and I'm still stuck at 15007. &nbsp;I get the Windows pop-up telling me that a restart is scheduled, and so I'll tell it to restart. &nbsp;I've tried to restart from within Windows Updates to apply 15014.
 &nbsp;I've tried Update and Restart from the Power icon. &nbsp;I've tried to Update and Restart from the login screen. &nbsp;I've tried hard power-down. &nbsp;I've rebooted while seated in the Surface Dock and while not connected to it. &nbsp;Nothing is working. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the windows update troubleshooter several times as well, and it's reported that it has found problems and corrected them, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, since updating to 15007, Microsoft Edge is not working on my Surface Pro 3 at all. &nbsp;When I click on a link, Edge will run, but the page is never displayed. &nbsp;The same thing happens if I key in a search term or URL. &nbsp;I can get the "Where
 to next?" page and text box, but nothing happens when I attempt to search or go to a web page. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea if the Edge issue is related, but it's the only real problem I've noticed with this build, aside from the "Some settings are managed by your organization." message in Windows Update.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>I've now worked through all of the below steps, and Windows Update shows "Downloading updates 0%', and is not advancing at all. &nbsp;That's a change at least, but the issue is not resolved. &nbsp;I have 175GB free on my SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p><span><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Run SFC Scan.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>To run an&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>SFC scan</span></span><span><span>, follow these steps:&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</li></ol>
<div>
<p><span><span>This will check and run an auto-repair on the issue.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Run DISM Tool</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>After running the&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>SFC scan&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>and the issue still persist, run the&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>DISM&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>to
 check the system health and to try restoring the files. To run&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>DISM tool</span></span><span><span>, follow these steps:&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><span>Run&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Command Prompt as Administrator</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><span>NOTE:&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>This might a while&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>to finish scanning.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Do not cancel</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><span>Method 3:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>After doing&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Method 1&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>and&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Method 2&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>but the
 issue still persist, you can&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>manually reset the Windows Update Components and Run Windows Update process again</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
