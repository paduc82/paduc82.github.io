                    <p>Error Code: 0xc0000034 in Windows 8 on Surface 2 that is only 2 months old!</p>
<p>Why are so many people reporting the same issue?</p>
<p>Is there a problem with this that should be a recall notice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My surface reboots and the same blue screen error code prompts. &nbsp;This was a Christmas present to me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How will Microsoft repair my Surface? &nbsp;What about my files? My time working I am losing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very upset about something that is so new having such a grave defect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a USB. &nbsp;Will microsoft please replace this surface 2 with something that works and will not do this again? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>While your Surface 2 (or is it&nbsp; Surface PRO 2?) is only two months old, it was discontinued a long time ago by Microsoft (so was the PRO 2). You can buy a 16B&nbsp;USB 2 stick and download a recovery image at
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage</a> after you register your Surface 2/Surface Pro 2.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unclear which Surface you actually have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need help using the recovery image or if it fails, contact Support at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> sheenaread  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 hard disc is full</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to upgrade to Windows 10 for months with no success because I have no hard disc space left and I have absolutely no idea why.&nbsp; I have deleted absolutely everything I can, files, folder, photos and documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I delete these items it uses up hard disc space instead of clearing it. Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use my computers recovery disc will this free up hard disc space? If I can't find the recovery dis can I recover the computer in any other way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Fujitsu Lifebook A Series. Can I restore it to factory settings to free up hard disc space? If so how do I restore it to factory settings?

<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to follow what you have asked me to do but could not complete it because I have no disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted the computer, waited over 20 minutes, I then typed <strong>System Information
</strong>in the Search Box above the start Button and press the ENTER key, I select FILE, EXPORT and gave the file a name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then got the following error message box whilst the new System Information was loading</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\system32\msinfo.32.exe</p>
<p>(Yellow warning triangle) Disk full whilst accessing an unnamed file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is as far as I can go. I am sending you this message from a different computer not the one with a problem.</p>

Thank you for responding. I have to empty the recycle bin every time I delete something and I have to use disc clean up regularly just to be able to use the computer. If deleting files etc does not help how do I gain space on the hard disc so I can actually
 use the computer?

<p>Apologies I forgot to ask last night when I replied to you. If deleting files etc. is really a waste of time because it does not free up hard disc space can I restore the files I have recently deleted?</p>

<p>Good Afternoon</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.&nbsp; After I responded yesterday I did find that despite the error message
</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\system32\msinfo.32.exe</p>
<p>(Yellow warning triangle) Disk full whilst accessing an unnamed file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The System Information File had been produced and saved.&nbsp; I have repeated the process today and produced another System Information File with the same error message as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also followed your instructions to access the System Log but have run into problems again due to lack of disk space. I got as far as
<strong>Save All Events as </strong>and give the file a name, which I did. When I pressed
<strong>Save </strong></p>
<p>another box came up with Display Options with the choice of clicking on No Display information or Display information for these languages. I have tried both options and come up with the same error message this time saying
<strong>Event Viewer </strong>The box has a red cross in a circle and then the words There is not enough space on the disk
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click ok the error box disappears and I don't appear to be able to complete the
<strong>Event Viewer </strong></p>
<p>process.</p>
<p>I have copied and pasted the System Information Files from yesterday and tried to send them in this message but there are too many characters. This reply box only allows 60000 characters. Both system logs work out to more than double that.
 I could not work out how to attach them to this reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you advise me how to attach them to&nbsp;this reply box or supply me with an email address to send them to you separately.</p>
<p>

            TJ, have you contacted your ISP support?&nbsp; They should be able to provide you with the correct Pop3 settings.&nbsp; I'll look through the GMail Help some more but I'm at a loss since I rely strictly on Hotmail\Outlook Express.&nbsp; Just for the heck of it, you might
 try 587 for the outgoing.&nbsp; At this point, I really think your ISP people would be your best bet for help.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - 100&#37; CPU usage &#40;also mathematically impossible values under the Resource Monitor&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize if this has been posted and answered before, but unfortunately I couldn't come across an answer that I could, as far as I know, perform on my end without the risk of running into issues afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been hearing lots of good things about Windows 10, enough for me to want to try it out. Sadly, I've been having issues with my CPU Usage. When I view my Task Manager, it's sitting at 100% constantly, people have reported this isn't an an aesthetic issue
 but a practical one (CPU-Z for example reports higher power consumption.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, when I view the Resource Monitor on the CPU, I'm getting mathematically impossible values such as 2 million percent and the like.&nbsp; Here's an image from another forum of the issue that I'm having:
</p>
<p>http://i.imgur.com/rKmPKHz.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, the issue doesn't persist if I switch to Safe Mode; however it does if I'm only using Selective Startup with non-Microsoft services disabled. This would imply it's some service or driver that doesn't boot up in Safe Mode, but I'm not
 quite sure what that might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read most people with this issue have been on Sandy Bridge CPUs and some of them have managed to fix the issue by updating their BIOS version. Unfortunately for me, a BIOS update doesn't seem feasible as ASRock's latest BIOS versions are mostly to add
 support for Ivy Bridge CPUs, which tend to cause issues for Sandy Bridge users. These issues include but are not limited to Blue Screens, which I'd rather avoid as my current BIOS version has no other issues. (I'm also not seeing the 100% CPU usage issue on
 Windows 7 x64, so it's only on my Windows 10 Home x64 [Even there the Safe Mode works fine.])</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any ideas one could bring up. Thanks beforehands!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specs are as follow:</p>

            <p>The instant I brought up the Task Manager, I saw 100% CPU Usage (while no process was using anywhere near that), and some million CPU Usage % under Resource Monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shall I run this in Safe Mode too (to create contrast)? (I don't have this issue there, I only have it in Normal Boot &amp; Selective Startup w/ non-Microsoft services disabled.)</p>

            <p>Apologies for the bump, but I felt I'll add a video (and new logs) to further demonstrate this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Normal boot and Selective Startup with non-Microsoft services disabled is video recorded</strong>; whereas Safe Mode is just a still picture in the end, because
<em>Nvidia GeForce Experience Shadowplay</em> would refuse to work while in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in my previous post about making the contrast, I chose to run Selective Startup (issue persists) and
<strong>Safe Mode</strong> (issue <strong>doesn't</strong> persist); as well as re-do the normal boot with the
<em>Nvidia GeForce Experience Shadowplay</em> (the recording program) running on the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Video</strong> can be streamed from <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/umypj3k74wx47fg/windows10cpu.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, downloaded from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/umypj3k74wx47fg/windows10cpu.mp4?dl=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should there be any doubt in my issue, the filenames &amp; sizes are shown in the end of the Selective Startup -part of the video and should match the unzipped files linked below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.</span></p>

<p><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>If Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Acrobat reader isn't available then click the browse button, locate Acrobat or Adobe Reader and then associate the file with the program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method 2:
</span></strong><span>Follow the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press the shift key and right click on&nbsp;any pdf file</span></p>
<p><span>2. select
<strong><span>Open with </span></strong>option and click on&nbsp;<strong><span>choose program
</span></strong>and&nbsp;select the option&nbsp;<strong><span>select the program from the list</span></strong>
<strong><span>option</span></strong> and click on OK.</span></p>
<p><span>3. select the program(adobe reader)&nbsp;you want to open with and place a check mark on
<strong><span>Always use the selected program to open this kind of file
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if this worked.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi lv2walk,</span></p>
<p><span>Angsana New is a Thai font designed by Unity Progress and offered under license from Microsoft.&nbsp; It is licensed
 for Windows 7 and up.&nbsp; &nbsp;Windows 10 has a <strong>Download fonts for all languages</strong> link in the
<strong>Settings</strong> app, under <strong>Personalization</strong> -&gt; <strong>
Fonts</strong>.&nbsp; For Windows 7, you can download the entire Windows 7 default font pack from
<a href="https://www.w7df.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">w4df.com</a>.&nbsp; Angsana New should be in that font pack, but I have not tested it.&nbsp; Instructions for installing the fonts are listed on the web site.</span></p>

    <title>ping only by IP, not FQDN - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ping only by IP, not FQDN</h2>
                    I have a very strange problem on my Win7-32 system. I noticed that my email was not updating (Outlook), and when I tried to manually "send/receive", I get an error message that "the server could not be found". I also cannot do a remote desktop session
 to another PC, even though I can setup a VPN session to the domain where that PC is located. I then tried to ping various PCs, and while I can ping virtually all PCs I tried (including some that are definitely on the internet, such as google, etc), I cannot
 ping them by their name. Ping says it can't find the server. NSLOOKUP, however, delivers the IP addresses for the servers. To make things really weird, Firefox seems to be able to resolve the addresses (I am writing this on the same laptop with Firefox), but
 Internet Explorer does not seem to be able to open any web page.<br />
<br />
Has anybody seen anything like this before?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I am logged into a wireless network here, together with another Win7-64 laptop, an iPad, and also my iphone. None of the other devices has this problem. I ran an ipconfig /all on both laptops, and the result is virtually identical (with the exception of Mac
 addresses, of course and the IP address they got from the wireless router). i have tried to renew the connection (ipconfig /renew) and flush the dns cache, but nothing helps.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Just a quick note that I wa able to resolve the issue. I looked at the system events and noticed that 2 services continued to unload or not load: tcpipbm and Bonjour. then I googled those files, and I found a bunch of web sites that referenced them. None
 of them seemed to have the same issue, but most of them talked about malware. So I researched that and decided to check out my computer with some of the malware detection programs on the web. none of them found anything. The last item I had to to was to disable
 my virus checker to run a specific program. The first thing I had to do was to uninstall a "google toolbar" using ask.com. I remember that I had foolishly agreed to install that at some point. (I actually missed the point where I could deny the installation
 and then thought "Oh, well, it's not going to do much"). After I uninstalled that, I was told to restart the computer. Upon checking, everything was fine again.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story: "Never install anything that you are not 100% sure of you need it and you know what it does...<br />

<p>Hi Dave, <br />
<br />
It seems that the Mail app is not running in the background. To show the app in the "Notifications &amp; Actions" settings page, we suggest running it in the background. To do so, please follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + i</strong> to open Settings, then select <strong>
Privacy</strong>.<br />
</li><li>In the left pane, select <strong>Background apps</strong>.&nbsp; </li><li>Under <strong>Let apps run in the background</strong>, toggle the switch to turn on or off the background apps.
<br />
</li><li>Once you're done, you may now turn on the Mail app in the "Notifications &amp; Actions" settings page to get notifications.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back with the result for further assistance. </p>
        </p>

<p>Thank you for the reply. <br />
<br />
Since the Mail app is not listed in the "Let apps in the background" page, we cannot set the notification for the app. Considering that the Mail app is a native app of Windows,
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>creating a new

<br />
Get back to us with the result. <br />

                    <p>Dear Microsoft Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem, and i see no other option than to write a message here,</p>
<p>msvcr100.dll file is missing after Win10 (x64) Update (not the initial upgrade, but update from the last month). Nothing helped.</p>
<p>I tried to copy the old .dll file from windows.old, then i tried for some tools to fix - no result, than manually downloaded this dll and system showed - "The module "MSVCR100.dll" was loaded but the entry-point DllRegisterServer was not found. Make sure
 that "MSVCR100.dll" is a valid DLL or OCX file and then try again."Then tried to write: "sfc /scannow" in command line, after several hours of checking - it was written, that there are no mistakes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway You may help me in solving this problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem appeared after updating Windows 10, it never occured before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>
</p><p>I forgot to mention in the initial report, that i re-installed (before reinstalling i also tried Repair button) Microsoft c++ 2012 - and it didn't help.</p>
<p>I've done it before trying to find manually missing .dll</p>
<p>This was part of what i meant by "used some tools to fix", I apologise for omission</p>
<p>
</p><p>for manual search i used dll-files.com and fix4dll.com files and at first i tried windows.old folder file that was on my computer</p>

            <p>I downloaded Microsoft Visual c++ 2010 and tried to install it - it gave me a message that the newer version of this program is already installed, so i thought that this would be the 2012 (i might be dumb, sorry) and used to re-install it,</p>

            <p>The problem occured after i updated Windows 10 recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first - it was just a message of missing .dll and i didn't give it any attention, because i didn't even know what it is..</p>
<p>I was surfing internet and found games website - Gog.com, where i found remastered version of Grim Fandango old game, i thought wow! that's cool and bought it, and after i installed it - it gave me the same message as when i started the computer after Windows
 update - about the missing .dll, so that's exactly how it was</p>

            <p>Dear Mr. ZigZag,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually decided to reinstall all Visual C++ programms that were on my computer and it helped. I think there was some missconnection between the different versions of Visual C++ (in Control panel i noticed that there was a doublet of absolutely same
 two versions of Visual (two for 2008x86 and for 2012x86) installed at the same time), how it is possible and why did this effect on my system i don't know, maybe the problem was in something else.. but at least now it is all ok</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for Your advises, they were most helpful</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

<h2>            I&#47;O error status of 0xc000009c</h2>
                    A few weeks ago I updated my computer. Now when I start up my computer is unusable until this message comes up. This can take hours sometimes. What is this and how can I fix it? Is this even the problem? I've seen some places say that my ram might not
 be working properly but under my devices nothing has any errors.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fab37b6-35a1-44bc-8d95-c514e8df63bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fab37b6-35a1-44bc-8d95-c514e8df63bf" /></a>

<p>Hi Bren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate all the information you shared and your efforts towards resolving this issue. We just isolated that this is not caused by default settings or basic device drivers, since the issue is not present in Safe Mode. It’s possible this is due to any

<p>Another step that you can do is by using the <strong>Check Disk tool </strong>
also known as <strong>chkdsk</strong>.&nbsp; It will scan your hard drive to find and fix problems.&nbsp; Below are the steps on how to run it:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>X</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Chkdsk /r</strong> (if prompted if you want to schedule <strong>
Check Disk</strong> on the next restart, type <strong>Y </strong>to acknowledge).</li><li>Type <strong>shutdown /r</strong> to restart the computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.

<h2>            connecting a zooka bluetooth speaker</h2>
                    <p>I have a zooka bluetooth speaker and just got a Windows 8 PC. &nbsp;It paired with the speaker but somehow it thinks its an input device like a headset not a speaker. &nbsp;Any idea how I can change the configuration so that it uses the speaker as an output device
 ? &nbsp;It did pair properly but it shows the device looking like a jawbone.</p>

            <p>Thanks for taking the time to reply in such a detailed way. I would be really anxious uninstalling anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to fix it by powering off the computer three times as it was restarting to get to the automatic repair process. This could not sort the problem so I did go back to a previous restore point. This was to avoid SA problem with Macanese vulnerability
 scanner I think.</p>
<p>So far so good. It has not ask to restart yet. So I hope it has sorted it.</p>
<p>once again thanks the time and help.</p>
<p>This seems to ba a common problem. Could Microsoft develop more robust systems?</p>

    <title>Bad Pool Header Windows 8 ASUS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mickey valentine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bad Pool Header Windows 8 ASUS</h2>
                    <p>So this is a friends laptop Asus Model x54c-bbk17.</p>
<p>Its running Windows 8, not 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is all I know about the machine. They handed it to me and told me to fix it (I fix alot of peoples computers when something small goes wrong and they freak out). All they told me was the screen would not come on after they gave it to someone else to
 fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moment I turn it on, BSOD comes up with bad pool header and does not disappear unless I physically force shut down the machine. Do not have a recovery disc (not sure what good it does if I can't access boot device options). I the machine NEVER loads up Windows
 at all so telling me to access things within Windows will be useless to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On HPs they have a trick that if you hold down an F-key as you power up the machine, it forces it into safe-mode. Does this have some trick like that? How can I load up Windows or Boot device selection?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Edit: So I powered it on immediately after I posted this. Did not press anything at all and it comes up with Asus Preload Wizard. Did it do this it self? What is going on with this machine......</p>

<strong>BCCode: 19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000019</strong><br />
<br />
That could be drivers&nbsp;although antivirus/antispyware/security programs and other hardware<br />
are also probable causes. Updating the major drivers and BIOS&nbsp;would be the best plan of<br />
attack. If needed also try uninstalling your antivirus/security as a test.<br />

<p>The BAD_POOL_HEADER bug check has a value of 0x00000019. This indicates that a pool header is corrupt.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code <br />
</strong><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update your major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi John, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 8.1. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 8.1 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

                    Has any one had success getting Dragon 11.5 to function adequately with Windows 8? I'd prefer to stick with it and not switch to version 12, since I've read too many complaints about it.

<h2>            Critical Structure Corruption BSOD Windows 10</h2>
                    So over the past week or so I have been having some issues. It first started off with my computer crashing or freezing and then having to scan and repair the C: drive. Then I started to get the BSOD Critical Structure Corruption. It seems to just happen
 out of nowhere. It happens maybe once every day or two. Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;Dump file:&nbsp;https://onedrive.live.com/?id=5F2EE4615F9ABF97%21110&amp;cid=5F2EE4615F9ABF97

 this? </p>

    <title>Cortana Memory Usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanbarnwell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana Memory Usage</h2>
                    Is it possible to disable Cortana's processes. I'm a gamer and getting lag due to lack of available memory. I went into task manager and noticed that Cortana is taking up approximately 1/4 of my memory. Here's the catch; i'm a "minor" and Cortana is unavailable
 for me. I do use search once in a while so hopefully there is an option do end Cortana's background processes and still have the ablility to use search when I need it.

<p>Dr Ardo;</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know about the HDDs and the three 360 console models (The E being the newest version):
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../add-remove-hard-drive</a> </p>
<p>If you had the original (also known as the fat) console, you'll have to do as Irixion suggested and use a transfer cable to move your data onto a new HDD for your new console. You can also get up to two 2TB external USB HDDs to use on your new console. I'm
 using a Western Digital myself and it works great. You'll still want to get an official internal HDD, however, because some games do require the official drive.</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>

<p>1. You'll want to buy a slim or super slim anyway.</p>
<p>2. If you still want your data, you can also purchase an HDD transfer kit to transfer your old saves and data to your new console.</p>
