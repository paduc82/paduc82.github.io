    <title>can&#39;t create a system repair disc windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lwdaddio  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t create a system repair disc windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've using the WIndows 10 'Backup and Restore (Windows 7)' to create a system image and then tried to 'Create a system repair disc'.&nbsp; It sees the blank DVD that I want to create the image to but when I 'Create disc' I get a window telling me to 'Insert Windows
 installation disc' and that the files needed aren't on my computer.&nbsp; I have a purchased Windows 10 USB installation disc and the computer sees it fine.&nbsp; But the drop-down on the 'insert windows installation disc' won't show the USB disc and only shows the
 DVD drive, which has the blank DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a system repair disc from Windows 7 but when I try to boot my HP Spectre x360 system to boot from it, all I get is to use a 'Solid State Disk' or 'USB Drive (UEFI)'; it doesn't seem to see the DVD repair disk &lt;sigh&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was running Windows 7 I was able to create and use a system repair disc just fine.&nbsp; I can't believe that Windows 10 is so broken in this area!</p>

            This doesn't address the question I asked.&nbsp; Why doesn't the 'create system repair disc' work as it did in Windows 7?&nbsp; Why isn't Windows 10 backup and restore at least as good as Windows 7 was, preferably better?&nbsp; There were no issues creating a system
 repair disc with Windows 7 but with Windows 10 it won't create it and won't find the system files it says it needs!

            I concur, between the manufacturer of devices washing their hands of supporting windows 10 and Microsoft washing their hands of most problems and making it very difficult to even get to&nbsp;safe modes,&nbsp; to make recovery extremely difficult.&nbsp; I say lets go
 back to windows 8.1 and dump 10.&nbsp; It really seems that the Microsoft programmers of windows 10 have absolutely no concern for fixing very much at all.&nbsp; I am extremely disappointed with windows 10 especially in the real of supporting easier methods to recover
 your system.&nbsp; I&nbsp;desktops,&nbsp; laptops and a SP4.&nbsp; I have experienced much pain recently with a system I have overclocked, using a&nbsp; premium ASUS motherboard, I7 920 Processor, 16GB Ram.&nbsp; Unfortunately ASUS decided not to support the motherboard past windows 8.1,

Prabhavathi Patil </span>did not address your question exactly, she did actually give you the answer to the question that you asked, she just did a poor job of explaining it. &nbsp;What you are both not understanding here is that the link which was supplied was
 a link to the Windows 10 media &nbsp;creation tool, obviously this is not a system repair disk. &nbsp;However, when you make a bootable USB with this
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">media creation tool</span></em>, you will want to
<strong>select</strong> the option to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>"create installation media for another PC"</strong></em></span> it is just as good as a system repair disk. &nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c3d945d2-ba74-462b-959f-bc701905cbe8" title="lwdaddio">lwdaddio</a>&nbsp;,
 you had mentioned that you bought the Windows 10 USB installation disk, this should be your answer. &nbsp;<strong>Use this disk to boot your system</strong>
<em>(*or the disk made from the media creation tool)</em>, but instead of choosing install now, you
<strong>choose repair my system</strong>. <em>&nbsp;*(I am not sure exactly what the selections say as it has been a while since I have seen it but it should be the very first options you have to choose from after booting from the USB, something similar to repair
 my system)</em> &nbsp;<strong>After selecting the repair system option</strong>, you are now able to
<strong>choose advanced options &nbsp;</strong>or of the like, which is essentially the same thing as recovery. &nbsp;All of the same options should be available.

 correct, yet it required us lamers to do it outselves. I downloaded the media creation tool&nbsp;</span>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209 and chose "for another PC". I chose the USB drive and it downloaded and installed the system repair options &nbsp;for

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t let me change my theme, use wireless internet, or recognize my speakers.</h2>
                    My computer froze earlier and upon restarting it, the theme was set to the "classic theme" and when I try to switch to the default theme, every other theme except classic is grayed out and unable to click on. With further inspection my computer is not
 "supported" for wireless connections and my speakers are&nbsp;unrecognizable. I cannot run my antivirus software as I get an error for it, and just about any other program. I gave&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;a call and they just tried to make me pay $15.00 a year for service I won't&nbsp;receive&nbsp;anyways,
 any suggestions?

            Going to factory reset the Xbox(keep the games) and see if that helps at all. Talked with Xbox support and that's what they advised. I have four kids and a wife that all stream via phones, tablets or tvs(they were NOT streaming yesterday while this happened)
 and several devices other devices like security cams lights and what not.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Fresh Start</strong> is a form of clean installation and update of Windows that attempts to keep your personal data and most, but not all, Windows settings. Kindly read the
<strong>Note</strong> on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026602/windows-10-give-your-pc-a-fresh-start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for further information when doing
<strong>Fresh Start</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If <strong>Windows Defender</strong> installed <strong>Windows 10 Home</strong> on your device, that is most likely because that was originally installed by the OEM. It could also be possible that the retail store where you got your device upgraded it to
<strong>Windows 10 Pro</strong> before they sold it. If you just recently purchased your device and is still under warranty, we recommend you to contact them so they can assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also check <strong>Don Cuthbert</strong> or <strong>nicomasr31</strong>'s answers on this

            <p>Hello, I had this exact same problem a few months back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember scouring google for a solution like crazy for days and finally stumbling upon a possible fix:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>disabling the monitoring feature of your antivirus software</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this sounds weird, and since I'm no expert I can't explain why this works or whether it will solve your case. At least it seems to do for error 6800 (I believe there are other occasions where dism would complain about 'reserved by another transaction')</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway, hope this helps. : )</p>

    <title>tablet stuck in restart loop during windows 10 reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            tablet stuck in restart loop during windows 10 reinstall</h2>
                    I have a Dell Venue 11 Pro 2 in 1 whose detachable keyboard stopped working suddenly. It did not seem to be a hardware issue so I tried a few regedit hacks without success. After that failed, I returned the settings to the original. At this point, the
 on screen keyboard was working but since it is my main work computer, I wanted the keyboard to work. I decided to reinstall windows 10. At 64% it has stuck and continually loops through restarting. I have attached a keyboard to the USB and tried to get the
 computer into safe mode without any success. I have tried putting in a recovery flash drive and the computer ignores it. I have put in a windows installation flash into the USB but the computer is ignoring that also. What can be done?

            <p>Hi Moshi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide the assistance required to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the information that you have provided, I would like to inform that the issue you were facing with the keyboard did not require a registry fix.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Registry of the OS is the back bone of the PC which ensures that all operations and devices run smoothly.
<span>Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. It is always advice that you create a backup of registry before any alteration so that you can restore the changes when it does not work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As now you are stuck in a loop and the media creation tool as well a recovery drive is not getting detected by your device, I recommend that you contact Dell support as they will help you perform Factory Reset on the device.
 This will return it to the original OS that was pre installed in your PC during purchase and all your document and programs will be lost.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To contact Dell support click on the link below</span></p>

<h2>            Search is not working</h2>

<p>look at the settings there and clear the history.</p>

            I tried all of these but unfortunately none of them worked. It seems that Windows Search is completely broken. Maybe I need to refresh/reset my PC and start over again...

<h2>            Skype Win10 Phone Video 90deg rotated</h2>
                    <p>Skype on Lumia 530 Win10. Video is showing 90 degrees rotated. When I move phone to try and correct, it moves 90 degrees again.
</p>
<p>Is this a bug. I have seen some other similar posts re Skype video rotation but not exactly the problem I am seeing.</p>

<p>Have not bothered to use skype on win phone much in past so do not know when the issue first appeared. Symptoms are when phone held in normal portrait position, skype video test shows image rotated 90deg clockwise. If try to follow by rotating phone 90 deg
 clockwise then image again rotates a further 90deg clockwise. However if phone is held in landscape i.e. 90deg anti clockwise from normal, then image appears correctly. But it is abnormal to use phone in this position on a call. I dont see same problem with
 skype on an android phone.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled skype as suggested. No change.</p>

</p><p>As of today, there are "I have the same question (23)" clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also reported it via Win10 Feedback App and it was already a dupe, others had reported it there long before me.</p>

            Only the video test seems rotated. Actual video, when video call is made, appears ok in the picture-in-picture. Having problem of other party not seeing video at all. I have dumped Skype and will use Viber as alternative. Skype user interface is appalling
 on Windows 10 phone IMO.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the hard drive works fine, when you connect it to different computer, it&nbsp;appears to be a faulty hardware(RAM or other hardware) in&nbsp;the&nbsp;HP3500 CPU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sortout the RAM issue, you may remove one RAM stick from the RAM Slot (if you have multiple RAM sticks) and start the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have&nbsp;only 1 RAM, you&nbsp;may get a RAM from any of your friends computer and insert it then start the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the computer is under&nbsp;warranty, I would suggest you to contact the HP support and check.</p>

<h2>            How do I get Lego Indiana Jones to run in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to run Lego Indiana Jones the first game on my Windows 7 laptop, and although it successfully installed, it cannot run.&nbsp; Every time I try to run it, an error message pops up that says something about an emulator being detected and to deactivate
 my virtual drive and emulator software.&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be a compatibility mode option for me to use.&nbsp; Any help?

I'm guessing you don't have any emulator software (Daemon tools, etc) or a Virtual Machine<br />
(Win7 XP MODE, etc. ) installed ? Well, the games copy protection seems to think so
<br />
(one example of why we love copy protection so - lol ).<br />

<h2>            Typing issues with windows 10</h2>
                    I am having consistent problems for months now with my typing not showing up on the screen with Windows 10 system. I have to shut down and reload, and it stops anyway. This seems to be a common problem with other users?? WHY has no one addressed this or
 instructed how to fix? This is not a problem with the key board and I am at my wits end with frustration. It's not a software problem to my knowledge since I had this computer taken back to factory settings in an effort to stop this to no avail. Why are so
 many having this issue?&nbsp;

<p>This is not a common problem. It is specific to your PC.</p>
<p>Which application do you use when you observe this problem? Word? Edge? Other?</p>
<p>Did you try a different keyboard?</p>
<p>Did you try the on-screen keyboard? You can launch it with the command osk.exe. Best to create a desktop shortcut for it.</p>

            Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall 
<br />
<br />4: Turn off filter keys in Ease of Access
<br />Type ease in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Ease of Access &gt; Click Make the Keyboard easier to use &gt; Ensure Turn on filter Keys is not checked

<h2>            Not receiving messages or able to call</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am mostly using Skype to contact one of my contacts. I had never had any issue until 2 days ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I write messages, he would receive them but I can't received his answers back at all. I appear to be offline to him when I am online and the app is clearly open on my device. He would sometimes appear online to me but if I exit the app and return to
 it straight after, I then can see that he has been offline for several hours. If he calls, I can receive his calls but I am unable to call him myself. The calls cuts off immediately and then they appear as missed calls, even though the call was never placed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, the app doesn't sync at all. I do no longer receive any notification and need to open the app for it to update existing conversations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked all parameters and settings I could find but can't find anything odd. He is using Skype for Mac, when I'm using Android and Windows, not that I think it would make much of a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me solve the issue? Thank you</p>

            Hi simple00,<br />
<br />
If for any reason, one or more icons are not showing correctly, you can repair by rebuilding the icon cache. Icon cache is a hidden file located at the Local Folder. Here is how to do it:<br />
<br />
1. Open Windows Explorer (any folder/drive).<br />
<br />
2. As the IconCache is a hidden file, you need to enable ‚ÄúShow hidden files‚Äù option to see the same. To do this, head over to Tools &gt; Folder Options, switch to View tab, and finally enable Show Hidden files, folders, and drives option.<br />
<br />
3. Now navigate to C:\Users\username\AppData\Local&nbsp; folder and then delete IconCache.db file.<br />
<br />
4. Reboot your computer to rebuild the icon cache.<br />
<br />
5. All icons should be displayed correct now. <br />
<br />
But, before rebuilding icon cache, I'd suggest you to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a restore point</a> .<br />
<br />

            <p>Please answer <em>all of the following diagnostic questions</em> in a numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>2. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>3. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>4. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ KB2598479, KB2631813, KB2585542; KB2633171, KB2639417, KB2620712, KB2618451 &amp; KB971029</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ KB2586448, KB2559049, KB2530548, KB2497640, KB2482017 and/or KB2416400</p>
<p>Most of the first set&nbsp;will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed,&nbsp;the second set&nbsp;will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>5. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>6. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; CCleaner)?</p>
<p>7. Have you ever had occasion to do a <a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Install</a> (or a clean install) of WinXP for any reason?
