    <title>Error code 80151006 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error code 80151006</h2>
                    
<p>I got a new Xbox, and downloaded my profile to it, no problem. &nbsp;Played a few games on it, then decided it was finally time to change my gamertag. &nbsp;Changed it, then decided to download xfinity. &nbsp;After xfinity downloaded, my Xbox restarted. &nbsp;When I went to
 download my profile again, as it requested, I got the message "Profiles can not be downloaded at this time", with the error code 80151006. &nbsp;I've tried clearing the cache, deleting the profile and any corrupt files from the Xbox before restarting it, then trying
 to download the profile again. &nbsp;Still no luck. &nbsp;It always gets to about 40kb before the message pops up. &nbsp;I did notice that my old gamertag is still being used on this site, but my new one is shown when it is trying to download the profile. &nbsp;Seems there might
 be a communication error somewhere. &nbsp;This is extremely frustrating seeing that I just spent $450 on a new Xbox, just to not be able to save anything on it.</p>

<p>Greetings, adladleng! Thanks for bringing your question to the forums. Have you tried downloading your profile to a different memory device, for example a USB device configured for use with Xbox 360 console? Here's some information about USB storage device
 support for Xbox 360: <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.xbox.com/.../storage</a>. Give it a shot and let me know how it goes!</p>

<p>It didn't work. I got the same error message. I tried it multiple times, deleting the 40kb it did download each time before trying again. I also restarted the Xbox a few times to see if that would help. Obviously it didn't. I'll say again...I changed my
 gamertag to SuspectThought. The actual, physical Xbox and emails I receive from Xbox both show the new gamertag. This website does not. What is causing this discrepancy? I believe that, and my situation, are connected.</p>

<p>Very sorry to hear you are still experiencing this issue. Do you have the option of downloading your profile onto another console? I'd be interested to know if the problem persists when you do that. As far as viewing your gamertag change goes, have you tried
 clearing your cache or trying another browser? Depending on how long ago you changed it you may need to wait a few days for it to prop on the website. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>I went to the Xbox 360 that my profile had initially been on when I tried to download it to the USB drive (which was a 4GB SanDisk drive that had no problems being set up). I tried to download my profile back on to that Xbox as well. That did not work either.
 As for viewing the gamertag change, I've used multiple browsers, computer, and other devices to access the website, with them all showing my old gamertag on this site...and it's been about 10 days since I changed it, so it's been more than enough time for
 it to update. Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>Now it just says "Loading..." at the top of this site instead of my old gamertag. &nbsp;Also, I noticed that on the emails that I have been receiving, despite the fact that they show my new gamertag, they don't show the picture of my avatar at the top. &nbsp;They
 just have the same grey silhouette that is on my Xbox when the profile won't download. &nbsp;I took a snip of the email to put in this post so you could actually see what I am talking about, but of course I can't add a photo to this post.</p>

<p>It seems like the thread is divided into two main issues, the first being the 80151006 error and the second being that your new gamertag not propping. For the 80151006 error code I would recommend getting in touch with phone support to make sure there are
 no account issues going on behind the scenes. Regarding your old gamertag, when I look up your account I see your correct gamertag listed - this is a good sign! I would recommend bringing this up with phone support when you contact them about the 80151006
 error to see if they can shed some light on the issue as well.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know what you find out and if you're able to reach a resolution with phone support. I'm here if you have any further questions!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Am x Poseidon, if you are having a similar issue would you mind creating a new thread detailing out your situation? This will enable us to provide you the best assistance possible for your issue. Thanks in advance!</p>

Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Screen resolution refers to the clarity of the text and images on your screen. At higher resolutions, items appear sharper. They also appear smaller, so more items fit
 on the screen. At lower resolutions, fewer items fit on the screen, but they are larger and easier to see. At very low resolutions, however, images might have jagged edges.<br />

<p>Hi <strong>Gaptroll</strong>,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: To confirm if this issue is related to graphic card, Boot the computer in enable low resolution video mode and then test to see if the issue persists. To do this, follow the steps below:</strong></p>
<p>Access the advanced boot options menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key before Windows starts. On the advanced boot options menu select enable low resolution video mode</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>If the issue doesn’t persist you can confirm that the issue is related to graphic card.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Uninstall and then reinstall the drivers and check if that makes any difference</strong></p>
<p>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; In Device Manager, Display adapter and then double-click the device name.</p>

<h2>            What the hell xbox live</h2>
                    So I woke up today to find that my gamertag had been changed yet again for the 2nd time by xbox live. Ive been a loyal customer of xbox live for over 10 years and have had the same gamertag for said 10 years. I am absolutely livid with xbox live at this
 point. There is absolutely no way to get in contact with anyone in customer support which is why I'm posting in this forum and their appeal process is basically non existent since they put in so many parameters to deter you from even putting in a ticket. Ive
 spent $600 on live membership alone, not to mention buying consoles, games, transactions through the marketplace and now I'm spending even more money because they keep changing my gamer tag to crap like sweetjoey and jollybunny like come on. I even changed
 2 letters from my original gamertag the first time they made me change it so It was basically the same gamer tag and it let me create it, so your own code of conduct didn't even pick up on the "Inappropriate" gamertag after I chang

<p>Submitting a case review at http://enforcement.xbox.com would be the only way to possibly have the change overturned.</p>
<p>You would have to try contacting support to see about a refund, but they generally won't in the case of forced gamertag changes. http://support.xbox.com/contact-us&nbsp; Otherwise, the enforcement team and support do not use the forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter if you've had a tag for 10 minutes or 10 years. It just took that long for the enforcement team to see it and take action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Playstation has similar rules only they do not allow name changes at all. So if your name violates their terms, the entire account is banned.</p>

 contact with someone from xbox support. Is this now how companies run? demonizing your loyal customers to appeal to some new generation of casual 7 year old gamers playing fortnite and cod all day? absolutely disgusting. I want to know when my original gamertag
 of ten years became inappropriate when I see gamertags like "[Mod Removed]"? not to mention the P.C garbage Insta ban system where you can't even say "damn" in a chat without getting the ban hammer. I demand that someone from live gets in contact with me and
 gives me a refund for the 2 gamertag changes I needed to make. Wake up xbox your loosing customers.&nbsp;

<p>If you only change a couple lettrs without removing the violation it only ends badly for you</p>
<p>Time to read the rules.common use comnon sense</p>
<p>The more you break.the rulles it can add up.to a perm ban.</p>

<p>It doesn’t violate free speech. You can say what you want or name your gamertag what you want, but you are not free from consequences if it violates MS rules on their system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The freedom of speach only prevents the government from being able to supress what you do/say on public owned property. Nothing less. Nothing more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Microsoft isnt the government and Xbox live is not public property you have no freedom of speach to oppress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

 new one, I end up at the Microsoft account, where I have changed my password twice now .. without any beneficial effect on the Skype issue.&nbsp; I would like to chat with a Microsoft or Skype technician, but it is impossible to make any kind of contact.</p>

                    Hi All, I've received approx. 20 reports from club owners and\or admins who can't like or comment on posts inside their own clubs. This issue has existed since at least Sept 10, 2018. Can this be escalated to Xbox Support for investigation and a fix?

                    <strong>Ok I am one of those rare people apparently that does &nbsp;not have any need to share my files with&nbsp;anyone ,or want&nbsp;to have a home group. with complete strangers . I have&nbsp; ONE laptop to watch you tube ,or videos', no work related anything ..BUT I am
 in a workgroup and I&nbsp;think, and I don't want to , I live in a business area &nbsp;.(down stairs is a store) and&nbsp;upstairs is apartments . that are close , like a house with rooms but not ..so the point is I&nbsp;am positive my computer has been accidentally or maybe&nbsp;not&nbsp;
 HACKED by snoops and my Wi-Fi leached and god knows what else ...&nbsp;&nbsp;can anyone please tell me&nbsp;why I am connected to a printer that I don't own ..as well as mystery devises that sometime are attached to my computer ,,and&nbsp;when I did update to windows 10 it had
 a recovery and backup for windows 7 that I&nbsp;never had on this laptop&nbsp;? I went back to windows 8.1 as it had a way for me to get back to it ..but if I stayed with win 10..my backup would be for a&nbsp;windows 7? that I don't own..BUT my last laptop did that I tossed
 in the trash after it died on me ...or maybe&nbsp;it wasn't dead and someone got it and hacked into my new laptop..ok I went far enough..(yes I know I shouldn't have tossed a laptop in the trash)&nbsp; but I thought it blew its hard drive or whatever..anyways can any
 one please tell me how&nbsp;YOU would set your computer if you were me ..I am already hacked so I am not surprised ,I just want to be hacked a little less that's all..i put&nbsp;no bank or credit card info in my laptop ..nothing for anyone to steal ..so its rather pointless
 for any hacker..but I don't like having a stranger following me around in my own apartment ...or in my laptop..thanks if you made it this far...I would be happy if one of you smart computer people could give me a point&nbsp;in the right direction..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look up
 to computer people , you are like gods to me for understanding&nbsp;complicated technical stuff, I think you are&nbsp;mans last hope for the world ..superior to doctors and lawyers..and other so-called&nbsp;geniuses..they are not in your&nbsp;league&nbsp;(iQ )&nbsp;you are the ones that
 should be paid like bill gates ..and sadly your porked ..but this will change .as your the next leaders if us mortals ..ok&nbsp;now hopefully you head is&nbsp;up higher than mount Washington and you can&nbsp;toss me a bone ..even though I am unworthy..thanks..i hope&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>

<p>So I'm really curious why a certain gamer hasn't been banned yet they are booting people offline everyday I have made many reports on my console and made three phone calls over the past 7 days but this particular person is still on line. Where is the enforcement
 team? I seen this person using mods on a game and reported it and he was banned with in 48 hours but yet an entire week goes by and this person has had no punishment at all this is ridiculous how are we suppost to deal with people like this when there is no
 one to back us up?</p>

<p>Phone support has nothing to do with enforcement so not sure why you phoned them.</p>
<p>As dave said,the PET team get probably 1000's of complaints per day,all of which have to be investigated so it will take time.</p>

<h2>            Two Computers</h2>
                    I have an old and a new computer and both have Skype. The old one does not have a camera or microphone. The Skype came as part of Windows 10 on both computers. I can connect with people on the old computer but cannot on the new one. I have put my email
 address into the new computer and created an account. I've also used my wife's email as a secondary account. But that doesn't work either. I call people and they get a message that they have missed a call. Nothing else goes through. Same on my end when people
 video call to me. What's wrong?

    <title>Is there a good way to cut and paste from one album to another&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom_wc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a good way to cut and paste from one album to another&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The Photos app supports copy and pasting from one album to another, but apparently not cut and paste. &nbsp;When you select the pictures and do "Add to Album" all the selections disappear afterward, preventing you from removing them from the original album without
 selecting them all over again. &nbsp;The only workaround I found was to copy to a folder (this retains selections), remove the pictures from the album and load the folder to the new album. &nbsp;But this creates duplicated files since you can't remove the copies without
 having them disappear from the album.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution seems to be for Microsoft to change "Add to Album" so that it behaves like Copy and doesn't clear the selected images. &nbsp;That would let us easily remove them from the original album.</p>

            <p>Photos does not support cut and paste between albums because it would make the far more frequent copy/paste ("Add to Album") function more awkward since you'd need to clear the selection(s) each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those that need cut/paste (splitting an album into two or more albums) you can use the above workaround or go into full screen mode and for each image to be moved use Add to Album followed by Remove from Album.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll open a request in the Feedback Hub to retain selections whenever there are more than one of them. &nbsp;That will make it far more practical to split albums apart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is there a way to get back the old messages that Microsoft occasionally sends us on Xbox One?</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Let's say they send us a message for a promotion and the message is deleted after a while, how can we get it back?</p><p><br /></p>

<p>﻿On the front, bottom, or side of your monitor there should be several buttons you can use to access the monitors menu.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In the on screen menu, locate the option to move the image horizontally and vertically, and adjust it until the picture fits correctly on your monitor. Every monitor is a little different for this process so I can't give exact directions - check the manual
 for more details.</p>

<h2>            Upgraded inspiron 14z &#40;5423&#41; to Win 10 and having boot up issues, can&#39;t go back</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my dell inspiron 14z (5423) to Win 10 on Jul 29th and having several boot up issues since then. The laptop starts with a blank screen and does not start up. Earlier thought it may be a laptop issue, tried resetting battery, CMOS etc, but now think
 its related to the Win 10 upgrade. Is there any was to go back? I dont have a Win 8 recovery CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            <p>Thanks Kishore. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I had to do: </p>
<p>
</p><p>After my laptop ended up with the blank screen and beeped when I restarted, I was left with no option but to dissemble everything. I checked some dell forums that suggested to remove RAM, keyboard, memory, hard drive and disconnect the coin cell, discharge
 the battery, press the reset button and let the charge drain for about 10 minutes. Then I put everything back and tried to restart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got to the blank screen with no beeping sound. Connected an external display and left the laptop with blank screen. After a few minutes, it started booting up (I think the batteries needed some time to charge up and the external display was required due
 to driver issues). I wasn't able to select to safe mode boot option, it never allowed me to.<br />
</p>
<p>Next step was to try to disable the device driver, tried the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Intel HD</span>&nbsp;one and everything went blank for some time, the laptop screen came back with a weird resolution but the
 external one was gone. Switched to enabling the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Intel HD and disabled&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">AMD Radeon&nbsp;</span>and both monitors
 seemed to work. Pulled out the external display and tried to reboot, that worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I tried to shut down and restart the laptop. Again, ran into the blank screen issue. No use connecting the external display too this time. Finally put a windows 10 install USB media and rebooted, and the laptop booted back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't see the rollback option on my PC. The only option was to factory reset the laptop. I did not create a rescue disk before upgrading to Win 10. Never thought it would be so bad :(.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With no other option left, I had to factory reset my laptop to Win 8, then upgrade to Win8.1. Has been a really long process to do this, but as of now things seem working. Haven't finished installing everything to say I'm successfully back to the state prior
 to upgrading to Win 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just finished upgrading my Inspiron 14Z from Win 7 to Win 10, and the display kept blinking at different intervals, and then it would just go weird (shrink to the left...kind of scrambled...color all whacked out...right 20% of the screen with narrow yellow,
 red, and black horizontal bands)&nbsp; and still be sort of readable, but not usable.&nbsp; If I&nbsp; reduced the number of open windows/browser tabs, it would be OK for a little while, but the weirdness kept returning.&nbsp; I could get the display to return to normal by also
 minimizing all windows (Windows Key + D) and then waiting 20 seconds or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first tried changing the screen resolution from the factory recommended 1366 x 768 to a couple of other sizes, none of which solved the problem.&nbsp; It was still 'blinking' and getting weird after a short while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then changed the display adapter refresh rate from from 60 Hz to 40 Hz with the full 1366 x 768, and now the display has been as normal for several hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, right click on the desktop and select Display Settings</p>
<p>Scroll all the way down and select Advance Display Settings</p>
<p>The resolution is probably already set to the recommended 1366 x 768</p>
<p>Scroll all the way down and select Display Adapter Properties</p>
<p>Then click the button to List All Modes</p>
<p>Now you can change the refresh rate from 60 to 40 Hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I didn't figure this out, I would likely have had to revert my laptop back to Win 7.&nbsp; Dell seems not to be interested in providing updates to make the 14z Win 10 compatible, so this 'trick' could really come in handy for those who want to make the jump
 to Windows 10. (See this page on Dell's site:&nbsp; Computers tested for upgrade to Windows 10&nbsp; Link &lt;http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/SLN297954#Inspiron-NB&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this helps someone else.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>C</p>

<h2>            Wont turn TV on or off</h2>
                    I'm having an issue with my Kinect but I don't see how to fix it. I have all the hdmi passthrough stuff working. Watch TV, change channels, volume up &amp; down, mute etc What it won't do is turn my TV on or off. I have the settings to allow it to so so -
 it turns my Fios cable box off &amp; on with no issues. Would a IR blaster fix this? Since my Kinect is at the base of my 6 month old Panasonic I'm wondering if it isn't getting the signal. But oddly it'll otherwise interact with TV just fine. Maybe a setting
 on the television?????????????

<p>Birdman LIVE,</p>
<p>&nbsp;When I was initially setting up mine, when going through the setup it said it sent a power signal. The first attempt did not turn off the TV but turned off the cable box. I had to select No and it sent a second power signal which did turn off the TV. You
 may want to try running through the setup process again to see if that fixes the problem for you since you already have the Power Settings correct.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You are getting charged due to the fact you chose a gamer tag when you first set your account up. That used the free one you got. If you would of used the gamer tag they gave you, you would have a free change. Any further questions you can request a call

<p>Hi Makc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question on why you being charged for gamer tag change. Here is the guide for
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/change-xbox-live-gamertag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how to change gamer tag</a> in case you need it.</p>
<p>Reason you are being charged is you most likely chose a name at the beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you find an available gamertag, click </span><strong>Claim it</strong><span>.
</span><br />
<strong>Note</strong><span> If your gamertag was created for you when you initially signed up for Xbox (meaning you did not choose it yourself), you can change it one time for free. Additional Xbox gamertag changes cost extra.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What this means is if you put anything in when you made your account, then you used the free change.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox Terms and Conditions Parental account problems</h2>
                    
<p>Like many other people, I can't accept the terms and conditions. I made my account when I was like 12, and gave my actual birth date. I'm now 17 and for the second time have been kicked off xbox live due to the fact that my xbox "Parental Account" (my older
 brother) needs to accept the Terms and Conditions. The problem is he has no idea what his information is. I can see the email used for the account when I try to accept the T&amp;C, but I need to put in the password. I have called Xbox support to try to get the
 Password Recovery Request escalated, but we can not input enough information to get by the security stuff first. I would be posting this on the microsoft forums except last year when this exact same problem happened, I called xbox and the man I talked to somehow
 made a new xbox account (CloudlessKnave1), Linked that to my xbox account (Snipers Recon), and made cloudlessknave1 the parent and I was able to accept the terms and conditions. When I try to use Cloudless now, I can accept the T&amp;C on that account, but it
 doesn't transfer over to mine and it still asks me to have my parent accept the T&amp;C. I would post the pictures of the 2 conversations I had with Xbox chat, except I can't figure out how to attach images, so here are the links to the pictures I uploaded to
 photobucket:</p>
<p>Conversation One (At around 12am this morning):</p>

<p><a href="http://s1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc431/Casey_Friedrich/?action=view&amp;current=10-13-201212-15AM.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://s1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc431/Casey_Friedrich/?action=view&amp;current=10-13-201212-15AM.png</a></p>
<p>Conversation Two (At Around 3pm this afternoon):</p>
<p><a href="http://s1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc431/Casey_Friedrich/?action=view&amp;current=10-13-20123-10PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://s1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc431/Casey_Friedrich/?action=view&amp;current=10-13-20123-10PM.png</a></p>
<p>Part two of conversation two:</p>
<p><a href="http://s1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc431/Casey_Friedrich/?action=view&amp;current=10-13-20123-11PM.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://s1211.photobucket.com/albums/cc431/Casey_Friedrich/?action=view&amp;current=10-13-20123-11PM.png</a></p>
<p>I can not change the email on my xbox from my brother's account to the email for cloudlessknave1, and on xbox.com if I enter the info for cloudlessknave1
 and hit accept terms It says (after hitting accept) that the parent info is invalid.</p>

<p>I have done that and I got my reference number. When I called support they said they needed to get through the initial security stuff and they couldn't.</p>
<p>I'm mainly asking why I can't use cloudlessknave1 as my parent account anymore or if xbox can repeat what they did last year and make an account and link it to my account so I can accept the T&amp;C. This is the last year I need my parent account because I turn
 18 in july.</p>

<p>I can get me and my father/mother on a skype call or something with both of our ID's or something to prove we are who we say we are and we can verbally agree to the ToU if you can just flip a switch for my account. I could email like, birth certificates
 or something. Or if you could repeat what happened last year and somehow make a new account that can act as a parent account for me and accept the ToU for just this once that'd work. I just don't want to lose years of effort and money on this account.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one disk drive not normal</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, I seem to have a&nbsp;cannibal disk drive.. For a while it worked great now I've noticed that not only 1 disk but many of my games centers are cracking.. I went ahead and tested this with a ordinary CD and it cracks in the circular center.. My question is
 would this be the drive motor fault? I can take this apart no probs I work on computers all day so this wouldn't be to much of a problem as long as I know what I'm getting into on replacing wise.. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>Cobra11Murderer,&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sorry you're having issues with your Xbox and games. This is something I've never seen on the forums before, so for sure an unusual problem. If you've determined that the console is causing damage to your discs, then I would suggest going
<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here </a>and submitting a repair for your console. I do not recommend a DIY fix as it can ban the console from Xbox Live, and all the other things that come with system modifications. Also, please be aware that discussing
 DIY fixes are against the forums ToU.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Cobra11Murderer, what you are describing actually sounds like the damage might come from the game cases themselves. If you do not press the "button" (latch that holds the disc to the case) all the way it can cause cracks in the plastic. &nbsp;If you search"new
 case design cracking disc centers" in google you will find plenty of results that show this. &nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<p>Nope not the cases that's what I thought at first to, however I put a disk in to make sure and sure enough it cracked the center I won't discuss diy option then.. I refuse to send it in since it's out of warranty and the company would want to much to fix
 the issue but thanks id rather just play buy games from live or whatever </p>
