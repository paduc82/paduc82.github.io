The unfortunate reality is, even though you might be able to run a version of Windows 10, it does not guarantee you will be able to run the latest version or the version after that.

            <p>Thanks, for your kind reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The model&nbsp;of my&nbsp;PC is Minix Neo Z83-4 with pre-installed&nbsp;Windows 10 (64-Bit) </p>
<p>I initiated the upgrade by Windows Update and failed 3 time: Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703 failed, so the last update is : Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3150513). and after reading&nbsp;by the link&nbsp;you suggested me I
 think the problem is that my system </p>
<p>hasn't enough disk space, indeed there is just only 5 Gb free, thats because in all there are only 32 Gb</p>
<p>of eMMC(5.0) built in storage: thats the system I have!! </p>
<p>So can you suggest me something to do or just I stay like this, what is better?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try an external keyboard and check if you can enter your password or&nbsp;<span>Go to the Ease of Access control panel (you will find it at the extrem left bottom of your login screen), choose Use the computer without a mouse or keyboard, check
 Use On-Screen Keyboard, click Ok.</span></p>
<p>, using the above methods if you can login to windows then follow the following steps..........</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to control panel-&gt;Region and langauge-&gt;change keyboards and other input methods</p>
<p>
</p><p>then click change keyboards.... tab and select the default input langauge as &nbsp;English (United states)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.Check and update your keyboard and mouse drivers from device manager&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Kinect stopped working&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I got a new Xbox One S and the free adapter from Microsoft for the Kinect sensor and now my Kinect isn't working at all.&nbsp; It was acting a little odd not long after I hooked it up but now it doesn't work at all.&nbsp; I tried disconnecting everything and reconnecting,
 but nothing helped.&nbsp; Anyone else having this issue with Kinect?</p>

<p>Ok, I got some good news about this issue. &nbsp;I called Xbox support and we went through a few steps and the technician determined that because I had the Kinect adapter plugged into a surge protector, it caused the issue with the adapter. &nbsp;I plugged the adapter
 into the wall plug directly and it solved the problem. &nbsp;He said there is a surge protector in the adapter power supply and it causes an issue when its plugged into another surge protector. &nbsp;Hope this helps anyone else that's having this issue.</p>

    <title>Ver 1809, dark mode in file explorer shoes black text on dark - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> al92lt1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ver 1809, dark mode in file explorer shoes black text on dark background. Can&#39;t read icin labels.</h2>
                    I have been using the Dark mode and find it easier on the eyes. I was looking forward to this update because Microsoft was expanding the dark mode to file explorer windows. On the 3 computers that I just updated, when viewing a file explorer window the
 icon labels are in black text and are almost impossible to read against the dark background. In all the articles that I've seen that are touting this new feature, the screen shots show the text and labels in white text which is easy to read against the dark
 background. How can I get the white text?

            Hi, i &nbsp;experienced the same problem with my update, but I have solved it using the registry. To be on a safe side u might want to create a restore point but nothing happened in my own case. First type win+r on ur keyboard and type regedit navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Control
 Panel/Colors. then in colors look for WindowText u should see the value at 0 0 0 change it to 130 130 130 which is a shade of grey because using white will make some text in a white background window invisible. hope this helps&nbsp;

    <title>USB3 Drive randomly disconnects when not in use - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB3 Drive randomly disconnects when not in use</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a Seagate 1TB Backup Plus USB3 drive which doesn't like to stay connected. I've researched this to find any possible solution before starting my own question, but none of it has helped. (I'm using this drive for saving File History, if it helps any)<br />
<br />
What I have done:<br />
<ul>
<li>Fully reformatted the drive</li><li>Used a different USB cable</li><li>Clean install Windows (for other reasons, but it still didn't solve this issue)</li><li>Turned off power saving on the drive</li><li>Turned off USB selective sleep in power options</li></ul>
<p>What it does:</p>
<ul>
<li>Randomly spins down and disconnects every 8-15 minutes when it's not being written to or read from on USB3.</li><li>Stays connected like it should on USB2</li></ul>
<p>Base system information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 8.1 Pro (fully updated)</li><li>Intel Core i7-4770</li><li>ASRock B87 Pro4 motherboard</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a portable USB3 drive that stays connected the entire time it's plugged in, which makes this situation even stranger. Any help is appreciated.
<br />

            <p>That's the only issue I know ofthat causes the storage device to connect and disconnect. If it's disconnecting after some number of minutes then&nbsp;the device is still&nbsp;going into power saving mode. That means either the registry setting hasn't be applied correctly
 or the device itself has an idle logic to spindown, and that causes it to drop off the bus. Check the Seagate site and see&nbsp;if they have any firmware update.</p>

            <p>I've got the same problem. I have two Seagate drives that both seem to disconnect at least once a day. I've done the registry hack and tried to change all the power settings, but I still get no joy. When I ran the cmd script, the drive with PID 3332 shows
 SuspendOnIdle as disabled, but the other drive (PID A0A4) doesn't show up at all.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Two drives are VID 0BC2 / PID A0A4 &amp; VID 0BC2 / PID 3332</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Below is a link to an .etl trace that should show what's happening. Thanks.</p>

            Hi Tom,<br />
<br />
Please check this Knowledge Base article below for details on the log.<br />
<br />
<strong>SideBySide Event ID 35 is logged in the Application log when you start Windows Live Movie Maker on a 64-bit Windows operating system<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976229</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
Apparently, you do not have to worry whether to uninstall Windows Live Essentials by judging from this log. Please continue running the application.

<h2>            How do I rename my DRM file when it is in use&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, recently I was having problems with my Rhapsody program on my computer. When I looked up the problem in the troubleshooting section, I found out that I had to rename my DRM folder. The DRM folder is hidden inside&nbsp;C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows
 not inside the Microsoft folder. Once I follow the instructions on the site, I right click the DRM folder and click rename and click continue to run it as an administrator. Then it pops up a message about the file being in use by another program. I was wondering
 if anyone had a solution for this. Your help would be greatly appreciated.

<h2>            Error code 0x080070103, Vista installation</h2>
                    Error code 0x080070103, It says there's not enough room in the temp. files to install Vista. I already have Windows 7 on my computer, but it's only an upgrade (my hard drive crapped out and couldn't find the Vista disc) and the only way of 'uninstalling'
 it is to install Vista, unless there's another answer to that. And if I don't install Vista, my product key is invalid because it's an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Oh, the circle of technology. Help!

Do a CUSTOM clean install of Vista, deleting Windows 7 as you do it:<br />
<br />
We do not know what type of Recovery Media you are using; all you said was: "my hard drive crapped out and couldn't find the Vista disc"<br />
<br />
<br />
Read the info below, and see if you can sort something out from that:<br />
<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

            I got a completely new hard drive and I bought a new Vista Ultimate from my university for the student price. When I insert the disc it comes up with "Install now" or "Check compatibility online". There are a couple other options but neither pertain to
 installation. Just after clicking "Install now" it gives me the error code, saying there's not enough room in the temp. files to install. So I can't even get far enough to choose custom clean installation or the other which leaves all my files/folders. I have
 no idea what to do.

                    <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;My automatic security download has been trying to down load a definition 1.129.1461.0 ( KB2310138 ) and I keep getting a "<em>failed</em>' notice with an error code of 80070666 !</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;BUT</strong>, my "update history" says this update was<u> SUCCESSFULLY installed</u> on 7/11, even though that same history states that this same download previously&nbsp;FAILED on 7/11 and 7/12. And even now, when I&nbsp;check for new downloads, this same
 definition shows up as an optional download ready to be downloaded. Can anyone tell me what is going on, and if this was "successful" back on 7/11, why does it keep appearing and failing, and getting error codes now???</div>
<div>Hope that is clear :)</div>

<h2>            Chrome recently stopped working</h2>
                    &nbsp;As of Jan 5 google chrome becomes unresponsive every time I open it. I'm on windows 10, version 1709, build 16299.192. It works in safe mode, so mainly I'm wondering how to go about narrowing down what is conflicting with the program.<br />
I'm not sure if this only started happening after a windows update or not.&nbsp; ive noticed others on the web having the same problem around the same time as me but no solutions.<br />
no error message appears, no black screen, and I can open tabs but not do anything else.&nbsp;<br />
Chrome works on my android and I have no problem with my google account.&nbsp;<br />
Ive tried reinstalling chrome, booting windows in normal mode but with non Microsoft services disabled, deleting browsers history cache and cookies (in safe mode). Windows Defender hasn't found any issues lately but I'm currently running a full scan and will
 try other AV's after in case it's a malware issue.<br />

<p>This didn't resolve my issue with Chrome.&nbsp; Since the update to Build 16299.248, Chrome will open up to a blank window with no option available or visible.&nbsp; If I hover my pointer over the window, I can see that it's recognizing links on the page, but nothing
 is appearing in the window except for in the Status Bar.&nbsp; It's getting really annoying to not be able to use Chrome.&nbsp; Do I need to revert back to another OS Build?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>The install file cannot be properly validated. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gustoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            The install file cannot be properly validated.</h2>
                    When attempting to install Symantec's Norton 360 from installation CD I receive the following error message: "The install file cannot be properly validated." I have used this same CD to install the program on a Samsung NC10 netbook run XP Home with no
 problems.<br />
<br />
The computer I am trying to install this program to is running XP Pro.<br />
<br />
I have spent four hours with two different Symantec Techs with negative results. The last tech stated it was a Windows Installer problem due to the fact the Symantec's Norton 360&nbsp;was not recognized by Windows as a valid program.<br />
<br />
I have gone through all&nbsp;of&nbsp;the solutions on Windows Article 555175 with negative results.<br />
I have tried downloading Norton 360 from different locatons on Symantec's website I receive the message that the publisher is unknown. When I click for it to continue with installation I receive the same message as with the CD: The install file cannot be validated.<br />
<br />
I have tried checking/unchecking the Windows Security check for valid digital signatures. Still no go.<br />
<br />
I have cleaned all temp files from hard drive. I have tried Wndows Installer key logging without success.<br />
<br />
Tried the unreg/reg for windows installer. <br />
<br />
Tried to download Windows Installer 3.1 ver 2, but recieved the message that my current Installer was newer.<br />
<br />
Norton 360 is not the only problem I have had this problem with. Sun Micro Systems Java (invalid digital signature, did not install,) Zone Alarm Pro (would not install)&nbsp;and Quicken (digital signature invalid, but did eventually install)&nbsp;also come to mind. There
 have been others. I have had this computer for approximately five years and the installing problems began approximately one year ago.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I am currently running Windows Firewall and security.<br />
<br />
Windows updates are current and running Service Pak 3.<br />
<br />
Please help.

            Perhaps the computer is already infected. What antivirus/security programs do you currently have installed? There is a built-in Windows Firewall but XP does not have any built-in antivirus/security programs.<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />

            Without seeing the machine I really don't know what is wrong with it. Certainly it sounds like you have some operating system corruption. Uninstalling/reinstalling the various antivirus programs didn't help either. Here are a few things to try:<br />
<br />
1. Back up your data to external media if you haven't already done this.<br />
<br />
2. Start&gt;Run&gt;sfc /scannow [OK]<br />
<br />
This will start the System File Checker. I rather doubt this will do any good, but it won't hurt.<br />
<br />
3. If #2 doesn't help, do a Repair Install.<br />

<br />
<br />
4. If nothing avails, since the problem has been going on for so long I'd just do a clean install of Windows. Since the computer is elderly (in Computer Years), I'd do routine hard drive and memory tests first before going ahead with the clean install.<br />

<p>Issue: &nbsp;&nbsp; “HPSETUP” appears in wireless connection manager</p>
<p>Causing “HPSETUP” to Hijack and cause interferences with my Wi-Fi Connection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can Please someone help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hewlett –Packard: HP G72 Notebook PC</p>

<p>Processor: Intel® Core™ i3 CPU M350 @2.27GHz</p>
<p>Memory (RAM): 4.00GB (3.80 GB usable)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a HP G72 Notebook PC and to access internet I use a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p>My connection was fine and stayed excellent for a long while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I struggle to get online or I cannot get on line at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my “Internet access” section (Small click Bottom Right of my screen” I can see several other Wi-Fi access point wish always been there and never caused me problems to connect t and access the Web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of them are problematic except the one that causing me grief: The Wi-Fi connection “HPSETUP” is there and over rides my usually fine working connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I think that the problem is connected to the “Wireless Network Connection Adapter” other than that I really don’t know anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It causes my connection to fail and let appear a small “Yellow Triangle” with a small black exclamation point sign in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some time it goes, sometime it stays and as long as it’s there my usual connection is like dead.</p>
<p>Please how do I solve this problem, how do I erase this Wi-Fi connection “HPSETUP” all together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have a wireless printer and I went true most step by step procedure and troubleshooting to: repair/correct/solve my connection but none of them was useful or working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks</p>

            <p><span>Hay Pinaki Mohanty,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First thank you for taking time and effort on my issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To answer you 2 questions:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not make any changes to wireless connection prior to this "hpsetup paradox Ghost Wi-Fi" issue</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This “Hpsetup” (so called available Wi-Fi Connection) only shows in: “Wireless Network Connection Manager” but Never Shows up in: “Manage Wireless Network” Page or in the” Network
 and Sharing Centre” page.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>*I tried to find it in both: “Manage Wireless Network” and” Network and Sharing Centre” to try to click on it and then “choose Remove Network” if it’s not visible there I can’t of course
 manually remove it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the: “Wireless Network Connection Manager” it’s the only place where it is visible but when I click on it doesn’t give me any option to remove it. It is like a “Ghost Connection” it
 is there but it’s not interactive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>*I tried: “Go into Network and Sharing Centre, and then click on the left side Manage Wireless Network. If you see HPSETUP there, right click and choose Remove Network, The problem can’t
 be resolved that way as the “hpsetup” Network does not appear there; the only Network visible is my usual “Kais SSII”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some believe that “hpsetup” is a connection feature for your printer that is supposed to have shut itself off after the first hour of that printer's service.&nbsp; That means, the "hpsetup"
 is a helpful broadcast setup service that helps the printer "jump" onto your home network during the first hour after the printer is initially turned on the first time.&nbsp; The "hpsetup" service is supposed to shut itself off after that first hour and not show
 up again unless the printer is "Reset", at which time hpsetup will again be available for one hour.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The thing is that I do not have/own any "Printer" what so ever to Turn Off/Reset/Set-up/Reinstall and as far as I know (Because I asked my entire neighbourhood) nobody around me does.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I also have in my Network Adapters 2 things:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Microsoft Virtual Wi-Fi Miniport Adapter</span></p>
<p><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Ralink RT3090 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi Adapter</span></p>
<p><span>Are this 2 supposed to be there together or are they possibly conflicting with each other causing this problem.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I also have "Snipping Tool" pictures of the "HPSETUP" Hijack but i dont know how to post them here</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>Dear Pinaki Mohanty i thank you in advance for all the patience and care you can put in to resolving the matter at hands.</p>

 I could find. Ultimately, we ended up resetting the entire computer and doing a clean install of Windows 10 from the original CD we used a few months ago. It worked! But after letting the computer sit to where it fell asleep, we logged in and it was back to
 not working. The only way to get it to work is wipe the whole computer and it only keeps working if it never falls asleep. I am desperate for a solution. It is a fairly new computer build so I'm pretty sure it's not a compatibility issue or anything. Nvidia

Does anyone have any ideas?</span></span>

            <p>When we did the reset we chose to wipe the whole computer and completely start fresh. When the computer started back up we skipped the part to log in with a microsoft account, thinking that could be the issue and it didnt work either.</p>
<p>A yes, i already tried that trouble shooter. It said something along the lines of "apps not installed properly" and "tile data corrupt"... but it said it disnt fix it. So i googled those problems to see how people fixed them, but none of those worked either.</p>
