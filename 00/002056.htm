    <title>Issues with copying from a Excel Online document to a normal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bichle_schenker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with copying from a Excel Online document to a normal &#40;desktop version&#41; Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems with copying from a Excel Online document to normal Excel document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a shared Excel Online workbook that contains lots of raw data. These data is to be transfered to a normal excel workbook for calculations. The problems occur when I try to open the Excel Online in Excel and copy data to another workbook. The whole
 thing just freezes and a "Not Responding" error message appears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed that this does not happen all the time, which means that the file is quite unstable. Has anyone had this type of problem with Excel Online before? (The shared Excel Online document is stored in OneDrive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate all the helps!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Profile Pictures are NOT Showing Everywhere in O365</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I instructed my users to go to <a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://portal.office.com</a>&nbsp;and to click the profile picture in the top right corner and click Change Photo, but I am not seeing people's picture replicated consistently throughout the site.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>I see them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching the GAL in the Outlook Online </li><li>When I receive email in Outlook Desktop </li><li>In the People viewer </li></ul>

<p>I don't see them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Via Delve's Profile page </li><li>In a SharePoint List's People column type </li><li>Actually, I really don't see them anywhere in SharePoint. </li><li>Not in the Newsfeed </li></ul>
<p>What do I do to get them Profile Pictures that people have uploaded to be present through Office 365?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any assistance,</p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>Try to edit profile via the steps below:<br />
1. Select your picture in the Office 365 header, and then select About me.<br />
2. In Delve, click Me from the left-hand menu and then selecting the Profile link.<br />
3. To change your settings, choose Edit Profile on your profile page.<br />
4. Click Change your photo on the Basic Information page to change profile picture.<br />
5. Update the profile pages as desired.</p>

<h2>            Notes on Mobile Outlook Truncated</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 with Outlook.&nbsp; I use Outlook and have Outlook Mobile on my Android phone.&nbsp; I decided to change from Google Contacts and use Outlook for all of my contacts where I have extensive notes.&nbsp; Google Contacts handles all the notes and sync's with
 my Andriod.&nbsp; When I do the same with Outlook on my computer, with my Office 365 subscription, my contact notes are truncated on my Android Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before a abandon Outlook for my Contacts and go back to Google Contacts, is there a way to stop Outlook Mobile from cutting off my contact notes (truncate)?</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'd like to know a few things. How exactly are they truncated? Does it appear that the notes are cut in the middle of the sentence or are you unable to scroll down at some point?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, can you send us a screenshot of the issue? If this is a software error, uninstalling and re-installing the app would easily fix it. However, we can't confirm until sufficient evidence is found.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response. </p>

<p><em><strong>Thank you for your kind reply, Jairit,</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't really do a screen print on the screen I've been working on because it has all my medical information and P/W information.&nbsp; I can explain what I see and some other interesting facts.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The page is truncated in the middle or the bottom half of a sentence. &nbsp;</li><li>When I went back and looked at the same contact on my PC (on my Outlook program - Office 365), about 20 lines of data disappeared, after I re-entered the information from my Google Contacts account the other night.</li><li>I do notice a few line spaces and when I attempt to correct this and re-select single space, there at a few line spaces that I can't seem to get rid of. &nbsp;</li></ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Note: </strong></span>Microsoft representatives worked on my PC remotely to copy my Google Contacts over to Outlook.&nbsp; A number of MS reps had difficulty with this because of something with Google.&nbsp; Finally,
 on MS rep was able to do this for me.&nbsp; The only problem is it created a pure mess in both my Google Contacts on my phone and my Outlook Contacts on my phone.&nbsp; I have in some cases 6 or 7 duplicates of the same contact but when you go into each contact, most
 have a little bit different information from the others (or so it seems).&nbsp; If I were not afraid of losing all my contacts, and if I knew how to get the contacts back right, without permanently deleting everything, I would just wipe it clean.</p>

<h2>            Exchange Server 2007 Sync to HTC HD2 Phone Problems</h2>
                    
<p>I have been advised by Microsoft that you can not sync Exchange Server 2007 Sync to HTC HD2 Outlook if your Exchange Server path utilizes a subdirectory.</p>
<p>(ie: <a href="http://mail.domainname.com/subdirectory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mail.domainname.com/subdirectory</a> )Is there a way to get this to sync without rewritting code on our server to be able to have main address without subdirectory.</p>
<p>Calling Microsoft CS does not help, all they ask for is a credit card number and this is an issue between their own software.&nbsp; I was advise that Window Mobile 6.5 and outlook by design do not sync with exchange server with subdirectories.</p>
<p>Anyone else have a similar problem and any solutions.</p>

<h2>            Company support. Merge users into one support account.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I wonder is it possible to:</p>
<p>1. Merge 10-20 people with skype accounts into a single business account.</p>
<p>2. Externally, client, who contacts our company by skype, should see our single company account.</p>
<p>3. Internally, I wish to see, who of our cooworkers answers to the client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is skype able to do such kind of stuff? Because it's really frustriating, when 4 cooworkers answer to the client at once and you don't even know, who is answering, because we are all on a single account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/71556936-9889-4862-ad5f-fcbf7e06d5c0" title="AlexisIndesign">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I just ask if you are using Skype for Business accounts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to answer your questions, it is not possible to merge different Skype accounts into a single account. As an alternative, you can create a specific Skype account that is dedicated for inquiries however, Skype account cannot be shared to multiple users.
 As for your visibility to your co-worker's Skype messages, it is not possible since only the account owner can view and access his/her messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Learning SharePoint Online</h2>
                    
<p>Split from here</p>
<p>I was so excited too! &nbsp;but my email was misspelled. Now I have 2 accounts and my personal one. It takes some navigating but now as I am creating my site (very cool they have come along way with these issues) I can add my schools link to my site. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This was my solution.</p>
<p>Go to office365 for universities/products &nbsp;create your account there. You may have to do this with the help of an admistrator. My administrator brought me here. &nbsp;I explained to her that this wasn't going to change the fact that I have two accounts but she
 doesn't understand it . &nbsp;I have had this issue with 365 with my personal account as well. And I once signed up for a trial SharePoint account. &nbsp;But I can live with this , &nbsp;it's easier than trying to explain to the administrator. &nbsp;So now I have the option ofd
 choosing which account I want to log into. Sometimes, I am in the wrong email but...it works. &nbsp;all you have to do is get someone from Microsoft or your administer to delete the original account.</p>
<p>I really love this account and I have already created a group and a subsite to promote student engagement using our free accounts. &nbsp;I have a whole pilot project I want to do but I'm not that far in my coding classes to implement integration.</p>
<p>I am guessing that a support person will read this. I really want to learn &nbsp;Sharepoint and this is the perfect platform for me to do this. &nbsp;I am have some really great ideas but getting past some of these issues and making it simple for the average person
 to get past these issues can be difficult because it is complicated with all these accounts that we have to sign into. &nbsp;and setting up separate accounts and stuff. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Publisher question re cursor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nancylef  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher question re cursor</h2>
                    <p>In Publisher when working with frames, occasionally (and I do not know what triggers this), my cursor will switch from the usual little arrow to one with a small plus sign + next to it .... every time I click on a frame when the + is visible, instead of
 being able to move the frame, Publisher pastes in a duplicate frame.&nbsp; So if it's a text box, I end up with a second text box exactly like the first.&nbsp; It seems that the only way I can get my cursor to return to normal and stop duplicating everything I touch
 is to shut down Publisher altogether and restart it again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it defaults to the correct, normal cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What makes this + appear and how can I get rid of it?&nbsp; There must be a good use for it, but I don't know what it could be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched for an answer to this in FAQs and various websites, but with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            Normally, the plus sign will appear when you hold down the&nbsp;<strong>Control</strong>&nbsp;key. As with Word, holding this down duplicates the currently selected content while dragging. If you're not actually pressing it, your keyboard may be in need of repair
 or replacement.

<p>Thank you but that seems to apply to outlook.com.&nbsp; My issue is with Microsoft Office 2013&nbsp;Outlook application.&nbsp; My ISP says everything is good on their side as I can log into their web based email with no issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am on my desktop for an extended length of time, I do not receive emails to my inbox after the&nbsp;application has been opened.&nbsp; It seems that it is stuck in a "processing mode."&nbsp; During this same time, I am receiving emails to the same account on my iPhone/iPad.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to close Outlook on my desktop and reopen it for emails to reach my inbox.&nbsp; Again, this is with Outlook within Microsoft Office 20013, not Outlook.com.&nbsp; Thank you again for your assistance.</p>

            Im so sorry for sending you the incorrect link, you are right.<br /><br />Try to open Outlook in safe mode just hold Windows Key + R then type Outlook /safe make a test if that does not work try to create a new outlook profile, also check your antivirus and firewall you might getting blocked

    <title>Excessive CPU Usage between Internet Explorer and Project Spartan - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excessive CPU Usage between Internet Explorer and Project Spartan build 10130</h2>
                    <p>I noticed since installing build 10130 of Windows 10, both Internet Explorer 11 and Project Spartan will at times experience massive spikes CPU usage. I normally have an average of 9 to 15 tabs open. This evening I resumed my laptop from sleep and its like
 the fans were revved up on constant. It would not stop until I closed the browser completely. This is something that was happening in build 10041 and 10049 and it looks like it has regressed.

            I'm not seeing that CPU usage spike, but I am seeing disk utilization go to 100% and stay there when Spartan is open.&nbsp; Spartan just stays at a white screen, never displays a web page.&nbsp; The disk utilization can be freed up by closing Spartan, going to Task
 Manager and ending the Browser Broker process.&nbsp; The universal advice to run "sfc /scannow" reports nothing is missing or corrupt.

            I'm not seeing a CPU spike with IE11 on Win10, what I'm seeing is an IE process staying in memory and eating CPU cycles after all IE windows are closed. I have to go into taskman and manually kill the process. It doesn't happen every time I run IE11, maybe
 25% of the time. it's happened for the past few Win10 builds. If I see an open IE11 window spike the CPU process I'll note it here.

            <p>I have to admit, Internet Explorer 11 is in bad shape under Windows 10. I noticed many websites have become broken again and subsequent builds are not fixing the problem. Comment systems from many websites dot not work either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if its all the work going into Microsoft Edge thats causing the neglect, but I am not seeing any fruits from that labour either. Edge just feels awkward to use at times and just some little nuances and flexibility I appreciate in Internet Explorer
 from a usability standpoint is not there. </p>

            I can confirm that on buld 10130 when I run Spartan browser the cpu frequency is always topped to MAX and never falls down until I completely close browser. This cause CPU fan to always work on maximum. &nbsp;So browser is unusable because of the noise from
 fan. (Intel Core i5 4570, MSI H81M motherboard).

<h2>            Windows 10 phone software no longer working &#40;contacts, accounts, emails, syncs &#41; etc</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I recently started having a problem with my windows 10 phone.&nbsp;<br />
The many ads and features on the phone no longer seems to work.&nbsp;<br />
Some examples:&nbsp;<br />
1) Facebook chat app only works one way. I can receive messages but not send them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I can't save/add contacts to the phone( using gmail account ). It will keep loading forever</p>
<p>3) settings - email + accounts, will not open. It will load...then close with no error.<br />
4) settings - Nokia account - will not open, gives no error either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other issues as well.<br />
Ive heard that Microsoft dropped support for some services on older phones ( mine is Lumia 1020 ) and that may be the cause.<br />
<br />
If so, whats the solution.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Rainer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To verify if the issue is software related, we suggest that you perform a <strong>
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft reset</a></strong>. Press and hold the volume down button and Power button until your
 phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also use the "Windows Feedback" app found in Windows 10 powered devices to send your feedback and other concerns.</p>

            Your phone is not eligible for the Windows 10 upgrade! You must be using Windows 10 insider and also you continued at your own risk because it was told that your phone may stop working because you are not using official builds but using beta builds and
 beta versions are always made for testing!!

<h2>            Bing Ads UET Tag Revenue Tracking</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, </p>
<p>I have added the UET tag for Bing Ads to our website in order to track both conversions and revenue. The conversions are correctly tracked in Bing, but the revenue isn't and I can't get it working. Also support from Bing isn't helpful so far, so maybe someone
 else can help me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The destination URL in Bing conversion goals is set up as 'contains = www.poobies.nl/site/index.php', as the URL has variables after ".php?" containing data of the customer/order. The revenue tag has also been added to the site. It seems to correctly report
 the revenue when I check the code on the thank you page after a test order (see below), but it doesn't report in Bing. Who knows how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;script&gt; <br />
window.uetq = window.uetq || []; <br />
<br />
window.uetq.push({&nbsp; 'gv': 26.15}); // Pass the computed revenue <br />
&lt;/script&gt; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;script&gt;(function(w,d,t,r,u){var f,n,i;w[u]=w[u]||[],f=function(){var o={ti:"XXXXXXX"};o.q=w[u],w[u]=new UET(o),w[u].push("pageLoad")},n=d.createElement(t),n.src=r,n.async=1,n.onload=n.onreadystatechange=function(){var s=this.readyState;s&amp;&amp;s!=="loaded"&amp;&amp;s!=="complete"||(f(),n.onload=n.onreadystatechange=null)},i=d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],i.parentNode.insertBefore(n,i)})(window,document,"script","//bat.bing.com/bat.js","uetq");&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img

            <p>Hi Elise, </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If you have the ({&nbsp; 'gv': 26.15});&nbsp; are all your sales 26.15 ? The gv value is a dynamic action so the ({&nbsp; 'gv': here }); will populate the last transaction processed. Also is the java script close enough to the push button as is stated above ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please keep me updated !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>
<p>Priscilla </p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d like to confirm some information to better understand the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>1. What migration did you perform, IMAP, staged, Cutover or hybrid migration?</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Connect PowerShell to Exchange Online:<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>3. Run the following commands:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Get-MigrationBatch | fl</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Get-MigrationStatistics | fl</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Get-MigrationUserStatistics -Identity user@domainom
<span>&nbsp;</span>-IncludeReport | FL</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Note:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>user@domainom</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is
 the problematic user.</span></p>
<p><span>To protect your privacy, I have sent a private message to request the PowerShell output. Please use this link to access the private message:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the information.</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, I know the url is linked to an IIS interface, but it is not right. Normally, the mrsproxy url should be something like mail.contoso.com and it should lead to the online mail sign-in page.</span></p>
<p><span>Given the situation, please go to your EAC in your Exchange server, navigate to servers – virtual directories – EWS, send us a screenshot for the internal and external url.</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, by saying “My set up is 1 Exchange 2010 server.”, do you mean your mailboxes are in Exchange server 2010? I’d like to confirm where your hybrid server is deployed, in Exchange 2010 or
 2013.</span></p>

            Hi Martin,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the information in private message. From the report, I can see the connection to the source mailbox on your on-premises failed. There is a proxy server named
<em><strong>mmexchange.domain.local</strong></em> in front of the Exchange server. Is it a network firewall in your internal environment? If yes, please check there is any rule that may block the IP addresses or Ports from Exchange Online. I suggest you try
 to bypass it and test the migration request again.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alex

    <title>Sharepoint online new user experience with document center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint online new user experience with document center template&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When we create a new sharepoint online site in our current site collection, I believe it defaults to a team site and has the new modern interface which, imo, is great and much easier to use than the classic interface. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I created a new site collection and chose the document center as the template, and it seems to be defaulting to the classic interface even though every setting I've checked shows the preference for the new interface -&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Switch-the-default-experience-for-lists-or-document-libraries-from-new-or-classic-66dac24b-4177-4775-bf50-3d267318caa9?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, why is does the document center template not use this preference? &nbsp;Is there a way to convert the site to the new interface? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. &nbsp;</p>

                    I recently upgraded from 2007 to 2010. I created 2 tables, 2 queries and 1 form. When I renamed the form all of my tables and queries were deleted. Just like that - gone!! I have also been having other miscellaneous problems and errors with this version
 - is anyone having problems with theirs?

<p>Hi IanHarper,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you received the Non-Delivery Report (NDR) with the error code 550 5.7.511, it indicates that your account is possibly blocked in Action Center. If so, the best way to solve the issue is to delist your email account. In this scenario, please contact the
 admin in your organization to help you remove the account from the restricted users list. As a side note, if you use Office 365 account to send bulk emails, it's possible for the backend spam detective activities to block your account.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to convert video resolution to 640 &#42;360 for 5800 XM &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all. I wanted to know of some way that I can transfer video files from PC to my device at native 640*360 resolution. I have transferred a few videos to my device from my PC using the in-box microUSB cable. These videos have to be stretched in the real
 player settings menu to enable them to play on the full screen of my device with no black bars above or below. Also the quality of these videos is somewhat lower as compared to the built-in batman video clip which has a resolution of 640*360. All my videos
 are in mpeg4 format, the same as the batman clip format. The problem is how can I convert my clips to resolution of 640*360 ???

<p>There are many ways of doing it, I think the easiest way is to use Super Video Converter. It's a free application build by eRightSoft.</p>
<p>On the free side you also have HandBrake. I consider HandBrake output better than Super Video Converter with free DivX MPEG4 encoder, but the problem HandBrake bugs, some video-audio codec combinations make it crash very easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The settings you need to get a video to run on your 5800 at an acceptable quality are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Container: MP4<br />
Video Codec: mpeg-4<br />
Audio Codec: AAC LC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Video Scale Size: 640×360 (please be advised that some encoders require 640x368 instead... works fine as well)</p>
<p>Video Aspect: 16:9<br />
Video Frame/Sec: 25</p>
<p>Video Bitrate: 800 to 1500 (you can go higher, but you may have hiccups and a very big file size)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audio Sampling Frequency: 44100<br />
Audio Channels: 2<br />
Audio Bitrate: 96-192 (you can go higher but i don't recommend it... 128 is quite good)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audio-Video Sincronization issues may arrise, if possible check any 48k audio codec box you see on your chosen application.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that 5800xm also supports H.264/AVC video encoding on MP4 files... ...But this really eats battery and at 640x360 you may get hiccups even at low bitrates (recommended bitrates for same quality are around half of mpeg4 ones)... on the positive
 side, files will take much less space (around half), this might be good for music video clips, where you can reduce resolution, giving priority to audio and allowing one to have more free space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HandBrake got a new update, i'll play with it for a while... if i don't get crashes and/or video quality comes awesome i shall say it later...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatives to this are <span>RealVideo 7,8,9/10</span>, <span>WMV 9 and .FLV (Flash video) files.... i don't have any experience in this type of file encoding for mobile devices so i'll refrain from saying more...
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps...</p>

<h2>            Screen goes black and PC restarts randomly, 90&#37; of the time when I play a game</h2>
                    Upgraded from 8.1, where I had no issues like this whatsoever. Every game I have tested, within 10 minutes the screen goes black and my PC reboots. Have tested every one of the nvidia W10 drivers and the issue still occurs. Happens with Rocket League,
 Football Manager 2015, GTA V that I've tested so far. Monitoring GPU and CPU usuage and temps nothing out of the ordinary and the restart doesn't happen at a certain temperature of % of GPU or CPU usage. Anyone else having this issue on 10162?

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
The issue seems to be with the graphic drivers. As Windows 10 is the new, the drivers for all the hardware might not be available. I would suggest you to install the derivers in compatibility mode.<br />
