<p>FAILED:&nbsp;attempted recovery of bad sectors (on hard drive C)</p>
<p>I was following instructions for increasing PC speed from microsoft.com's&nbsp; feature highlight box on the home screen.</p>
<p>I was able to access the program successfully on my own homescreen (Windows XP Home version 5.1 service pack 3.0).&nbsp; Phase 1 of the scan completed successfully, but about 70% thru phase 2, the scan stopped and I got this message:&nbsp; "The disk check utility
 needs exclusive access to some Windows files on the disk.&nbsp; These can be accessed only by re-starting Windows".&nbsp;&nbsp; I was instructed to re-start my computer &amp; try the scan again.&nbsp; I did this, but got the same message several times in a row.</p>
<p>I use the MS Update center regularly, my Windows XP software has been certified 3 times as being genuine Windows, and I update MS Security Essentials at least every 2 days.&nbsp; I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO TRY !&nbsp; Generally, ALL of my other&nbsp;Windows functions operate
 correctly &amp; completely from my homescreen.</p>
<p>I have also allowed Microsoft to have complete, remote access to my computer, so that they may analyze &amp; correct both hardware &amp; software problems automatically or from the MS Fix-IT center.</p>
<p>Please contact me at&nbsp;&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp; with specific instructions.&nbsp; I will try the Update center every few days in case you find any items that can be downloaded to solve this problem&nbsp; Thanks for your ongoing
 support.&nbsp; Joy Knobloch&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE ON DISK CHECK:&nbsp; 2 responses from LemP &amp; TWELCH have been marked as potential answers.&nbsp; After you schedule a disk check and shut down your computer, you have to&nbsp;WAIT an hour or two before restarting.&nbsp; Maybe there is a long line of users waiting to
 get their disks checked !&nbsp; I finally succeeded in getting the disk check to run (I also checked the box that said to automatically correct any errors).&nbsp; BUT I NEVER DID GET A CONFIRMATION MESSAGE THAT DIRECTLY STATED THAT ANY 'BAD SECTORS' HAD BEEN RE-COVERED.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>FINAL QUESTION: Can we assume that if the disk check ran completely and automatically corrected any 'problems',&nbsp; that the 'BAD SECTORS' have been recovered ???&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated in this forum.&nbsp;

            CAN YOU START WINDOWS AT ALL?&nbsp; If you can, then try to use the system file checking utility , sfc.exe , located in the system32 folder under "c:\windows\system32\sfc.exe.

<p>It's not quite clear what you were/are trying to do.&nbsp; Try this:</p>
<p>Start &gt; Run &gt; chkdsk /f &gt; OK</p>
<p>A box will pop up with the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The type of the file system is NTFS.<br />
Cannot lock current drive.<br />
<br />
Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by<br />
process.&nbsp; Would you like to schedule this volume t<br />
checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Type Y and then press Enter.&nbsp; Then restart the computer.</p>
<p>If, during the process that follows, you again receive the message "FAILED:&nbsp;attempted recovery of bad sectors (on hard drive C)" or something similar, go to the website of the manufacturer of your hard drive and download the appropriate diagnostic tool for
 your hard drive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have also allowed Microsoft to have complete, remote access to my computer, so that they may analyze &amp; correct both hardware &amp; software problems automatically or from the MS Fix-IT center.</p>
</blockquote>
Unless you allowed remote access pursuant to a telephone call to Microsoft support<em><strong>THAT YOU INITIATED</strong></em>, you should disable both remote access and remote desktop (right-click My Computer, select Properties, click the "Remote" tab).&nbsp; In
 fact, you should disable both of those features now and only re-enable them if you again initiate a telephone call to Microsoft support and are asked to enable them.<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My Firewall is ON. And controlled by <strong>

<p>I have no idea what the problem is. I have a <strong>router+modem</strong>. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

            <p>The complete error message i got was "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">A problem occurred while enabling ICS (null)</span>"</p>
<p>That's when i tried the ICS article. When i tick the ICS box. It just freezes and gives me ^ that error.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither Method 1 or 2 worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also contacted a friend in IT support. He said it might be that the WIFI adapter is configured wrong and i should go to my Browser &gt; 192.168.1.1 and see if anything there is making problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really puzzles me, how could my phone connect with no issue but my laptop can't. The laptop can connect only to my neighbors WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could the Adapter itself be the problem? Like outdated or something similar.&nbsp;That could explain why my OLD phone can connect but my NEW laptop can't.<br />

<p>I tried that. Some of those were set to "manual". I set them all to Auto and activated them all.<br />
Still the same issue.</p>
<p>Im sorry to take up your time. This is just really frustrating.</p>
<p>And for some reason... the "ICS" is now gone. The "Sharing" Tab doesn't display at all.</p>

<p>
</p><p>if you can't figure out the problem, i guess i'll just have to use my neighbor's WiFi.<br />
Unless i get a really long cable to plug in the laptop to the router</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are you using Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 (as the category shows Windows 8.1)?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Have you started facing this issue recently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Windows 8.1, then there is no option to uninstall Photo app and it does not appear in the Windows Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>If a license for an app is out of sync with the license installed on your PC, the app might stop working.</p>
<p>To sync your app licenses, follow these steps:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<div><span>On the Start screen, tap or click <span><strong>Store</strong></span>to open the<span>Windows</span> Store.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <span><strong>Settings</strong></span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click<span><strong>Settings</strong></span>.)</span></div>
</li><li>
<div>Tap or click <span><strong>App updates</strong></span>. <span>If you haven't signed in to the<span>Windows</span> Store, sign in using your<span>Microsoft</span> account.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div>Tap or click<strong> </strong><span><strong>Sync licenses</strong></span>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2: <br />
</strong>If that does not help, I would suggest you to run the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Apps troubleshooter</font></a> and check the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Let us know if it helps. If the issue persists, please reply, we will be happy to assist you further.</font></span></p>

Windows search is actually not running. &nbsp;It's set to automatic (delayed) start, but it's not running, and when I try to start it, it says it won't start but "doesn't return an error". &nbsp;The status says "Starting". &nbsp;

            <p>Hello DemetrusMallett,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sound like your PC is over heating. The hotter it gets the faster the fan(s) will work to circulate cooling air. This can easily happen if the fans are covered in dust/grime or, for that matter, if the fins of the CPU (computer processor unit) are blocked
 by dust. As Mahesh has also pointed out, it the fan(s) may also have to work extra hard if you are using numerous applications or you are using resource intensive applications. It may be worth giving the inside of your PC (if it is a desktop) a clean. If it
 is a laptop you will need to take it to a reliable repair shop for them to clean it for you.</p>

<p><span>Hi
<span><span><span>eMage</span></span>,</span></span></p>
<p><span>Let’s disable User account Control and check if Media Monkey is identified as media player however it’s not recommended to do.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, click <strong>User Accounts</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>User Accounts</strong> window, click <strong>User Accounts</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>User Accounts</strong> tasks window, click <strong>Turn User Account Control on or off</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the
<strong>User Account Control</strong> dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click
<strong>Yes</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>Security</strong> section of the <strong>Windows Solution Center</strong> page, click
<strong>Adjust UAC Settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong>User Account Control Settings</strong> page:<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span>To disable UAC, move the slider to
<strong>Never notify</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Later enable UAC or change levels of notification, move the slider to the appropriate notification option, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How do I change the behavior of User Account Control by using the slider?</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-change-the-behavior-of-User-Account-Control-by-using-the-slider" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://window<span>s.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-change-the-behavior-of-User-Account-Control-by-using-the-slider</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Also, follow the troubleshooting steps given in this link:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Multimedia Keyboard Buttons Don't Work</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it doesn’t help, I would suggest you to contact MediaMonkey support for further assistance.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">obviamente apenas empiezo a agarrarle la onda asi q realmente quisiera saber&nbsp; en q consiste un clan de x-box live ?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">es como los clanes de los MMORPG ?, en los cuales te brindan ayuda y consejos?; o solo sirven para encontrar gente&nbsp; q juege contigo online ? o para ambas cosas ?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2.- ahi requerimientos especificos para poder pertenecer a un clan ?;osea me refiero a tengo q ser un jugador muuuuy frecuente&nbsp; o tambien puede unirse alguien q no este tanto tiempo online
 ?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Bueno esas serian mis dudas mas importantes: si alguien pudiera tomarse el tiempo de responderlas de antemano muchas gracias&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Los clanes sirven para convivir entre los miembros, se ayudan para sacar un logro que requiera varias personas o simplemente si quieres ayuda para sacar solo el tuyo, uno o varios de ellos lo hará contigo, te dan consejos de lo que quieras y obviamente se
 juntan para jugar en linea y pasar el rato.</p>
<p>Sobre los requerimientos para estar en un clan varían entre los mismos, hay de todo, te pueden pedir desde que solo te registres a su página y ya estarás en el clan, y otros hasta te piden que seas nivel máximo, que juegues muy bien, te cambies el GT, etc.</p>
<p>Dentro del foro hay muy buenos clanes, unos de ellos es el Clan VGT's y otro Xibalbá (perdón por los otros, fueron los únicos que se me quedaron grabados).</p>

<p>Miren lo del clan match por el momento no se puede dar ya que por lo menos tenemos que ser 5 y tengo que retomar el proyecto ya que me fui de "vacaciones" a jugar el beta del gears 3 por algunas semanas, gracias por el clanmatch amistoso pero no me lo voy
 a hechar solo hasta que tenga confirmadas a 5 personas. Siganse apuntando<span> = Le falta Gente</span><br />
<br />
por otro lado les quiero comentar que el batallon oficial esta en stand bye y el señor ankoku y yo tenemos varios planes para el mismo solo que tenemos que pensar si va a ser en gears 2 o en el 3 ya que se viene con todo este nuevo juego, ya resiviran noticias
 en el podcast. <span>= se viene una reestructuración</span></p>

<p>An update,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Laptops are Dell e6430s, which has a built-in SD card reader.&nbsp; I have no issue reading or writing to any SD Card, but my wife's laptop always suggests formatting the SD card, and even if you do try to format the SD card, it will not complete the format.&nbsp;
 Upon startup the card shows on File Explorer as "Removable Disk (E:)" but does not show like it is reading the disk (no information on available storage).&nbsp; When I eject the card it shows a large "?" and then removes the E: drive completely.&nbsp; When I re-insert
 the SD Card, it shows "E:\&nbsp; &nbsp;The directory name is invalid".&nbsp; When I click OK, it then brings up the Format the disk in drive E: screen.&nbsp; It will take you to the "Format Removable Disk (E:) screen and the Format Warning screen.&nbsp; Once I click OK, it then has
 a screen that Windows was unable to complete the format.&nbsp; So right now, the SD Card slot is unusable in Windows.</p>

<h3> ac123_991  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Photo Viewer cannot open this file because either the file format is not supported or you do not have the latest updates to photo viewer</h2>
                    <ol>
<li>I have recently downloaded all photos from an iphone 5c to my PC. Having formatted the phone I then noticed when I went to copy the relevant photos to a USB that only 2/3rds were visible.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>The remaining photos cannot be displayed and none are displaying a thumbnail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to copy these to different folders and open them in different programs including windows photo viewer, the photo app, paint and google chrome- (none of which enable them to be viewed- paint responds with the error message "paint cannot read
 this file. This is not a valid bitmap file, or its format is not currently supported.")</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Additionally the affected files all appear to be abnormally large, between
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1.01 and 1.69 GB.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to recover the photos using Photorec- however the file I attempted to download was 'invalid'. Additionally I was unable to resolve the issue using Recurva's free trial as each file exceeds the trial's 100MB allocation to test if this would
 resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to how to resolve this would be amazing. Please help!!!</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;What is the file format of the pictures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the photos to a different location and then try to open it through Windows Photo viewer and check if you can open them.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Windows Photo Viewer can only view .jpg and .jpeg, .tif and .tiff, .png, .gif, .bmp and .dib, .wdp file types.</div>
<div>I would suggest you to follow the steps given and see if it helps:</div>
<div><br />
1. Right click on any one of the picture and select Open With and click Change Default program.</div>
<div><br />
2. Now select the Windows Photo Viewer in the list.</div>
<div><br />
3. Now put a check mar for “Always use a selected program to open this kind of file”.</div>
<div><br />
You may also try opening the same picture using Paint and check if you are able to open without any issues.<br />
&nbsp;Check if you don't have file extensions displayed by default, right-click on an offending image and look at the file's name.<br />
&nbsp;If you have not set it as default program to open images, do this :</div>
<div><br />
Change which programs Windows uses by default<br />
&nbsp;A default program is the program that Windows uses when you open a particular type of file, such as a music file, an image, or a webpage. For example, if you have more than one web browser installed on your computer, you can choose one of them to be the default
 browser.</div>
<div><br />
Open Default Programs by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Default Programs.</div>
<div><br />
In Default Programs, you can:</div>
<div><br />
Set your default programs. Use this option to choose which programs you want Windows to use by default. If you want to use your Windows Live Photo Gallery or Photo Gallery to open all photos, use this option.</div>
<div>
<p>Change default programs using Set Program Access and Computer Defaults </p>
<p>
</p></div>

<p>To shrink them, on the rich formatting, if you right click (i think) you get a choice to edit the image. Then on Advance settings I think, there is a choice to edit the size via numerical input of some poop. Just have a look around that and there should
 be an option.</p>
<p>But yeah, Edge is alright, not the greatest magazine, but then again, not the worse!</p>

            The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<br />
If you still continue to experience problems...<br />
<br />
I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.<br />
<br />
Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?<br />
Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.<br />
<br />
You can download it at the following link:<br />
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930 &nbsp;<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab</a><br />
<br />
After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.<br />
<br />
Click the Hide Updates menu.<br />
<br />
Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.<br />
<br />
If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:<br />
<br />
Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive.
 Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.<br />
<br />
Open Start, type: CMD<br />
Right click CMD<br />
Click Run as administrator<br />
<br />
Type each of the following then hit Enter<br />
<br />
taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)<br />
net stop cryptSvc<br />
net stop bits<br />
net stop msiserver<br />
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old <br />
rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore<br />
rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download<br />
<br />
When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.<br />
<br />
If that does not work..<br />
<br />
1. Open Start, type: CMD<br />
Right click CMD<br />
Click Run as administrator<br />
<br />
Type each of the following then hit Enter<br />
<br />
Run these codes:<br />
Net Stop bits<br />
Net Stop wuauserv<br />
Net Stop appidsvc<br />
Net Stop cryptsvc<br />
Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak<br />
Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak<br />
Net Start bits<br />
Net Start wuauserv<br />
Net Start appidsvc<br />
Net Start cryptsvc<br />
After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed. <br />
