<p>When I have trouble with my NAT, usually unplugging my Router for 30 seconds fixes it. I had a problem at one point where my NAT was stuck on Strict, I had to call out Comcast to replace my Router, and they found out my Router and Modem were outdated.
</p>
<p>That may be your issue, if not, maybe calling your Provider wouldn't be a bad thing to do anyways.

<h2>            Ubuntu Linux on WSL will not use Internet</h2>
                    I have asked for the last 3 weeks for help from Ubuntu for the Ubuntu app in the store. My desktop has no issues using the Internet no matter where I go. However, for the last approximately 4 weeks the Ubuntu WSL will not access the Internet&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">at
 all</span>. Using apt-get update/upgrade, wget, curl, anything simply comes back as "Unable to access &lt;whatever&gt; site. Please try later." I have checked hosts, host.allow, host.deny, all are empty except for the normal comments. I have deleted/reinstalled
 Ubuntu, deleted/turned off WSL/rebooted/used disk cleanup/turned on WSL/rebooted/reinstalled Ubuntu and nothing helps.&nbsp;<strong>Please,&nbsp;</strong>someone help me with this issue before I delete windows entirely and set it up as SUSE or Fedora only. Thank you
 for any help/clues you can give me because Canonical doesn't seem to care.

            Ok, I've figured it out. I recently had to update Bitdefender to a newer version and I didn't connect that to the problem due to it being about a week before I used wsl again. BitDefender's new version firewall is the problem here, I disabled it and turned
 on the Window's firewall instead and magically the wsl was able to use internet again. for where I found the lead to the answer see&nbsp;https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/5 and check the post by Thanok(sic). I'll be contacting BitDefender to get them to figure
 it out from here.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 is pre-installed on your laptop, you can perform a <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">clean

<p>Here are the&nbsp;possibility.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You can check the product key sticker under the laptop.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If your laptop came with pre-installed Windows 8/8.1/10&nbsp;you never need to enter the Windows product key manually, It's usually embedded in your UEFI/BIOS. Just install a fresh copy of Windows 10 and install all the drivers then it's activated automatically
 once you connect to the internet.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For drivers, You can always check the vendor's website.</p>

<br />
Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.<br />
<br />
BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card<br />
<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/</a><br />
<br />
Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here
<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.<br />
<br />
Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.<br />
<br />
Click Install now<br />
<br />
Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed
 to enter it.<br />
<br />
Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.<br />
<br />
The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro<br />
<br />
Wait while setup prepares to copy files<br />
<br />
Accept the license terms then click Next<br />
<br />
Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then
 go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Select the drive then click New<br />
<br />
NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.<br />
<br />
Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK<br />
<br />
This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.<br />
<br />
NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Wait while Windows installs<br />
<br />
When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.<br />
<br />
Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.<br />
<br />

<br />
The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.<br />

            hey guys thank you so much for the swift and ultra thorough reply. &nbsp;i've gone ahead and followed your instructions, gotten myself a skydrive account, and have successfully zipped up the contents of my minidump folder and placed it in my skydrive folder
 on my laptop. &nbsp;now, forgive the ignorance, but how do i create the link you need so that you can get into it? &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>thanks again for your help. i appreciate it very much.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>jeff &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>******UPDATE!! &nbsp;********</b></div>
<div>i think i figured it out. &nbsp;i "created a link" and made it public so if you run a search you should be able to find it. &nbsp; ??? &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

You definitely have the record for most crashes in a month (197).&nbsp; Over 100 of these point to an error in either the file system or the HD itself.&nbsp; So before we get any deeper lets eliminate 3 things.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
System file check, and CHKDSK are built into the OS so no need for connectivity, Malwarebytes is an easy download and burn to cd.<br />
<br />
1-OS corruption (run System file check)<br />
2-Hd issue (run CHKDSK)<br />
3-Malware (download Malwarebytes and run it per instructions)<br />
<b><br />
1-System file check</b><br />
<div><b>Please run a system file check</b><span>&nbsp;</span><b>(SFC)&nbsp; <br />
</b>
<div><b><br />
</b>
<div>All instructions are in our<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Wiki article</b><span>&nbsp;</span>below...<br />

Hum,&nbsp; I am not on a machine that has access to XP.&nbsp; Are you a member of the admin group on that machine or do you have access to the admin account?<br />
<br />
I have found a link (ancient but seems to work) from a wizard in the field of BSOD'S (in fact he taught me way back when)&nbsp; http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/43051/how-to-use-sfcexe-to-repair-system-files/<br />
<br />
See if there is anything there that can help.<br />
<br />
If I get access to a machine running XP I can be more helpful.<br />

So the link to USAMSA didnt help?&nbsp; When you opened the command prompt did it say administrator across the top (unsure if XP labels this)<br />
<br />

<br />
I am also unsure if CHKDSK needs elevation.&nbsp; SInce most of the DMPS possibly point to it Try to see if you can run CHKDSK.&nbsp;&nbsp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265<br />

    <title>transferring audio file for podcast production - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            transferring audio file for podcast production</h2>
                    Like many others, I'm using Skype for podcast recordings. In the past I've had no trouble transferring my Skype recording (audio and visual) to an audio-only file on iMac using Garage Band. But with my latest episode, the audio will only play to 12 minutes
 of a 23-minute recording --- the video continues for the duration. I have verified that the sound continues til the end when I play it back on Skype. I need to have a good audio file to product the podcast episode. Advice?

<p>I'm so frustrated!&nbsp; I was trying to download Google Earth and it wouldn't load----so I started experimenting and I have really messed up the system!!!&nbsp; Now I get error messages saying the C drive is not accessible and access is denied---when trying to do
 a System Restore I ge the message above saying the parameter is incorrect.&nbsp; When I do a right click on the c drive it shows that it is TOTALLY FULL---It wasn't a couple of days ago!! I am running Vista 32 bit.&nbsp; ANY help that you can give me will be GREATLY
 appreciated!!!&nbsp; I use the discussion groups in Office all the time and have always been able to get the right answer---am hoping that will be the case here as well, though I do understand that this could be a bit more complicated.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for getting back with me!&nbsp; But I was so freaked out I ended up taking it over to my computer gurus and it cost me $100 but it's fixed now!!!&nbsp; Yeaaaaaaaaaa!!! If it had been my own computer I probably would have kept trying here, but since it belongs
 to someone else, I didn't want to take a chance of really screwing it up.&nbsp; As it turns out, the C drive was showing full (in color), yet it said there were ZERO bites on it!!!!&nbsp; I wish I could have been with my guru to see what he did.....but at least I'm
 up and working now, so that's a GOOD thing!! :)))&nbsp; Thanks again so much for responding and trying to help me!!!! Have a great week!!

<h2>            Directx SDK &#40;June2010&#41; amd Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>This question probably was asked before, but I seem to be getting confused and a bit uncertain as to what is the best answer.</p>
<p>I am into game development, and some of the engines I am trying, request Directx 9, and so on.</p>
<p>I know that my system has Directx 11, and I want to be certain as to if it would be wise to install the DirectxSDK (June2010), or if there would be a conflict.</p>
<p>Also, Is there a way I can install it and make adjustments to remove any conflicting issues.</p>
<p>Thank you kindly for any clarity on this.</p>

<p>Have you gone to the BIOS and set up the DVD Drive as the first boot device so that it boots from the CD/DVD ???</p>
<p>You could also try a Systems Restore to a previous point.</p>
<p>This can be done in Safe Mode.</p>

<h2>            Great Legend&#39;s Guide to Fast XP in Multiplayer&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>This is the Great Legend Shemp Howard here coming at you live from Armadillo people! Today I am going to let you in on my little secret on How the West Was Won.<br />
<br />
The best place I have received XP is Twin Rocks! TWIN ROCKS PEOPLE! In the old days prior to the patches I would get about 1750 XP in under a minute on this hideout.<br />
<br />
Currently if you clear this hideout in under a minute you will average about 600 XP. 600 XP a minute is great XP. When you go to Twin Rocks you will want to bring a Evans Repeater (from the Pike's Basin hideout) and/or a Bolt Action Rifle (from the Tumbleweed
 hideout). The first time you do the Twin Rocks hideout make sure you go inside for the Mauser pistol. It is a great weapon to take out the Walton's Gang from up close.<br />
<br />
Before you start make sure you have a full bar of Dead Eye and make sure you have multiplayer aiming set to Casual in the options. For the best score make sure you kill all 22 Walton's Gang members in one kill combo. If you kill them under the one minute mark
 you will get an average of 600 XP.</p>

            Adaptive Brighness in power settings requires your display/monitor to have a sensor.&nbsp; Not all do. It changes the brightness of the screen a scaled amount depending on the ambient light levels -&nbsp; when lighting is less than ideal like when lights are off
 in your bedroom it dims the screen &amp; brightens the display when ambient light levels are high like in direct sunlight.

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition Key stolen</h2>
                    I remembered that windows 10 edition of minecraft was free if you have purchased java edition. Well I have and notice it said my key was already activated. I check my Microsoft account to see if it was used. And it was not. I know my account was breached
 not too long before this and i think they might have taken my key. I would like to know if there is any way to get a new one, because I don't want to have to spend money on a smaller version of the game that I already own.

<div>To 1. she logged into guest account but knows admin password</div>
To 2. Exactly, when guest knowing admin password, which she enters in appeared dialog box, the specified folder&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;open, rather it asks for change of security settings which&nbsp;requires complete security settings done till now. and then it allows the guest
 knowing admin password to access and again coming out if required again need set all security again.

I loaded Superantispyware into my computer. It is using a Vista platform. I also have MS Essentials (MSE) loaded. Since I put in the Superantispyware when I click out of Internet explorer, a DEP message comes up and I have no idea how to stop it. Is it due
 to having both Superspy and MSE loaded at the same time? <br />
<br />
I think it is, but I am not sure. I tried to uninstall SuperSpy but I stopped it because I was very confused on what to save and what not to save. I don't have any viruses, but I did have a lot of cookies which are quarentineed. Do I unquarinteen themj?<br />
<br />
I need some quidance on this.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
also, could it be that I have 2 spyware products (MSE and SuperAntiSpy)?</span></td>

<span>Hello Ray DeCormier,<br />
<br />
Thus far this is the only report of Data execution prevention we have heard of. I recommend you contact microsoft about MSE and see what they have to say. The developers have also noted that SUPERAntiSpyware cannot cause a DEP message.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you want to uninstall SAS then check with their Support&nbsp;for methods&nbsp;to be sure it is fully removed.<br />
<br />
For setting up SuperAntiSpyware as an on-demand scanner if desired :<br />
<br />
You have to check all the entries - the entries are by SuperAdBlocker which is used by<br />
SuperAntiSpyware.<br />
<br />
Autoruns - Free - See what programs are configured to startup automatically when your system<br />
boots and you login. Autoruns also shows you the full list of Registry and file locations where<br />
applications can configure auto-start settings.<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx<br />
</span></a><br />
Under this section&nbsp;in AutoRuns :<br />
<br />
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services<br />
<br />
SASDIFSV&nbsp;SASDIFSV.SYS&nbsp;SUPERAdBlocker.com and SUPERAntiSpyware.com&nbsp;c:\program files\superantispyware\sasdifsv.sys
<p>SASENUM&nbsp;SASENUM.SYS&nbsp; SUPERAdBlocker.com and SUPERAntiSpyware.com&nbsp;c:\program files\superantispyware\sasenum.sys</p>
<p>SASKUTIL&nbsp;SASKUTIL.SYS&nbsp;SUPERAdBlocker.com and SUPERAntiSpyware.com&nbsp;c:\program files\superantispyware\saskutil.sys&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There may be others as my memory is not clear - there are 4 and probably 5 entries and they<br />
will NOT be altogether so look close for both SuperAntiSpyware and SuperAdBlocker notations.<br />
<br />
============================================================<br />

<br />
The problem might actually be an addon or other program causing the problem and you<br />
should check that 1st.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have<br />
EVER had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which<br />
can cause strange issues).<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security - Reset all Zones to default level - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
Close&nbsp;IE and then try IE and/or IE with no Addons<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but<br />
Java still installs it and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.)<br />
Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look<br />
right. Permitted are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a<br />
program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and<br />
run - not all are bad however some can cause your issue. (Toolbars are BHO's)<br />

or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
If nothing else works you can try this however I would use as last resort.<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Options - Security Section - uncheck Enable Memory<br />
Protection to Mitigate OnLine Attacks - APPLY - OK&nbsp;&nbsp; Close and Restart IE<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>1. I've been facing this issue since the day my computer upgraded to windows 10.</p>
<p>2.no recent changes other than Microsoft upgrades</p>
<p>3.I did not receive an error message</p>
<p>4.every single app is working beautifully except for photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I spent 2 1/2 hours on chat with tech support without one question answered. I was also supposed to receive email documentation on how to create another admin profile, never got that help either. I can't get an answer on how I can fix this so I stopped
 using the computer for syncing &amp; downloads. &nbsp;I now use my old laptop Windows 8 where I actually have control of my pictures &amp; labeled albums. &nbsp;Thankfully I didn't upgrade to Windows 10, on that device</p>

<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

<p>32 vs 64 bit</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions
</p>
<p>Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7</p>
<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers</p>
