The Windows Insider Program already 2 million testers evaluating the Windows 10 Previews since October of 2014. With Microsoft planning a promotional upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 and the intention to provide a direct upgrade path from the preview to the final release, users are taking the plunge earlier. This does not exempt the fact that Windows 10 is still under heavy development and we are still in the early days before we are anywhere near the final code. With that said, users who are willing to give the Preview a spin early might be encountering issues getting Windows 10 to successfully install on their PC. This Wiki Article takes a look at some of the solutions you can try if setup fails.">How
 to: 10 things to do if Windows 10 Setup fails.</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to remember:</strong></p>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The benefits of testing Windows 10 on a physical&nbsp;partition&nbsp;or hard disk&nbsp;versus a Virtual Machine include full access to the hardware, which includes memory, graphics and input/output performance of the local disk in addition to the ability to fully experience
 all features of the operating system that are not accessible in a virtual environment. The biggest benefit is, you don't lose your production installation of Windows and you can reboot into it at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to consider before:</strong></p>
<p>Backup your current installation of Windows. Because you will be making signifcant changes to your computer, you should always backup before doing so. It is
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">strongly</span></strong> recommended! See links to resources about backing up by clicking the link for the respective version of Windows you are running:

This is the intention, but of course, things can always change on the road to RTM.

<p>As <font color="#FF0000">farby</font> points out provided that OVI Maps is set "Offline" and Integrated GPS the only positioning method
<strong>enabled</strong> in Menu &gt; Applications &gt; Location &gt; Positioning &gt; Positioning methods together with regional maps downloaded, I can confirm that you can use your 5800 as a SatNav within the constraints imposed by the compromise in GPS antenna/position
 within the candybar form of the 5800XM <strong>without</strong> SIM card.</p>

<p>Thanks for your replies guys...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your advice almost solved my problem. I can use my phone as a Sat Nav without a sim with one minor draw back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some reason, I can't navigate my favourite routes without a connection to the internet. These are routes I have plotted on Ovi Maps then saved to my favourites and synced with my phone.</p>

<p>Any ideas why this is the case?</p>

<p>Have to concur with <font color="#FF0000">farby</font> as removed SIM card from 5800XM enabled only Integrated GPS and took it outside to lock on to position and had no problems with navigation starting to favourite.</p>

<p>Hmmmm... It does seem a bit odd deosn't it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to make sure I covered all bases, here's what I have just done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Went outside, enabled integrated GPS only, fixed on a GPS signal and then tried to open the route I had saved in my favourites. Still get the message 'no route found'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then put the sim card from my new phone in the 5800, enabled all the positioning nethods except bluetooth, fixed on a GPS signal and opened the route in my favourites without any problems.</p>

<p>Clearly my phone requires some internet connection to enable me to use routes in my favourites, but it doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any more ideas guys?</p>

<p>Last observation would be is your 5800XM network branded or SIM free variant (my quoted example)?</p>

<p>It's network branded, but not sure why that would make a difference?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 suddenly unable to send emails- have tried all the obvious fixes from this forum- still not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I woke up, and my outlook 2016 no longer sends emails. It has the dread 0x800CCC6F error. I disable all my antivirus, and it now says error 554 impout001 server charter.net ESMTP not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have selected port 587. i have run both quick fix and online repair tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can, using my phone, connected to the same Wifi, send emails from my charter account. The length, size and attachments seem not to matter; it won't send from my computer, but works fine from my phone, as well as my charter webmail client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a bit frustrating to have a brand new PC that came with this software, to arbitrarily decide to stop working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm on a Dell Inspiron running win 10 pro,&nbsp; build 16299.192, MS Office build 8827.2148, click to run</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a fix for this beyond the std repair, "set your port to 587" "ensure you select SSL" generic suggestions?</p>

<p>Hello Amylove Loy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My account is configured as IMAP, and I am not sending multiples or distribution lists. In fact, a simple "test" in the subject line was not getting through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up completely removing Office 2016 and reinstalling to correct the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What concerns me most if the fact that it just stopped working, one day to the next. I can't recall any updates being pushed this week, so I'm not sure what caused it to break.</p>

<p>A re-install would have done nothing that a repair would not have done.</p>
<p>Your new Dell was supplied with various third party utilities that were integrated with MS Outlook, and its likely these are the cause of any issues.</p>

<p>I suddenly have the identical problem with all 3 of my computers, all running Win10 with Office 365 Outlook 2016 email program.&nbsp; I can receive emails from our Internet provider's server (Charter.net) but can no longer send emails from the charter.net account
 in Outlook 2016.&nbsp; I can receive/send emails from both Hotmail and Outlook accounts as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have talked to Spectrum (Charter) support several times, used the "auto-repair" feature, manually entered several variations of recommended settings, all with no success on any of the 3 computers.&nbsp; The "send" error message says I need to log onto the server
 or unable to contact the server, even though I've got the user name, password, and port settings exactly as specified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this happened after the latest Win10 update.&nbsp; Any suggestions??</p>

    <title>Word 2013 crashes on startup with 0xC0000005 or 0xC00000FD at offset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom ligon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 crashes on startup with 0xC0000005 or 0xC00000FD at offset 1E7C in version 15.0.4454.1513</h2>
                    <p>My problem is that Word 2013 crashes on startup. I have been through many forum discussions, including</p>

<p>and also two support requests, where the engineer discovered that the problem could be solved by creating a new user account. However, after some time (a few days or weeks), the same problem starts in the new user account, so I have to create yet another
 one.</p>
<p>I have been through many of the known issues, like ABBYY, Bluetooth, and various KB articles.</p>
<p>I am getting event ID 1000 with bugcheck 0xC0000005: Access violation and also sometimes bugcheck 0xC00000FD: Stack overflow.</p>
<p>When I examine the first one in Visual Studio debugger, I can see that </p>
<p>winword.exe version 15.0.4454.1513 at offset 1E7C</p>
<p>is calling a routine in the C runtime library loaded from an Office location, and it is trying to access an address that is not part of the address space of the process. The stack looks to me like a very long loop, so there might be some code running past
 the end of an array and sometimes accessing an unallocated address and sometimes overflowing the stack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what offset 1E7C in winword.exe version 15.0.4454.1513 is trying to do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, since this occurs in one user account but not another, I think that Windows 8 and Office 2013 are basically OK, but something in the user account is provoking the error.</p>

<p>was the information that I put on Skydrive useful? Is there anything specific that I should look at with the VS debugger? The offset 1E7C should provide a good hint to what is happening.</p>

            <p>This problem has been resolved! It was caused by the fact that I entered a tab ("^t") in control panel / region / additional settings / list separator. That makes it easier to open tab-separated text files in Excel, but causes problems in Word when it is
 parsing normal.dotm. Thanks to good help from Microsoft support; I have asked them to submit a bug request for Word to limit the loop and fail gracefully instead of crashing.</p>

            Have you checked (in Twitter on the web) that those apps have the right access rights to your Twitter account? If they haven't, might be worth removing and re-installing the apps (so that they can have another go at getting the access). Just a thought,
 I am not a Twitter expert.

 to go to windowsphone.com/family on their computer, sign in with their Microsoft account, and set up My family"&nbsp; And when I tried to fix the problem on my computer it still did not work.. I added an adult for the account, but I dont want to add any child to
 this account, the adult name should be enough. </p>

</p><p>For over a week I am trying to figure out why I have to share my shared folder every day to make sure the people I share it with are having access to the folder.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Im using onedrive for business and within the settings I see that I have shared my folder with all the people that I want to. But on the peoples Ipad, using the onedrive app, they only have access for one day, the next day the shared folder is invisible
 for them. the Ipads and app are up-to-date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody help me so they people I want to share it with are having access while I don't have to reinvite them every time?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Above was my last post which works great and my new query looks wonderful. The problem I am having now is when I try to add this new query (Contract Count Query) to my old query (where my report pulls from) I get an error:</p>
<p>The SQL statment could not be executed because it contains ambiguous outer joins.&nbsp; To force one of the joins to be performed first, create a separate query that performs the first join and then include that query in your SQL statement.</p>
<p>It sounds like it would be easy to do so I was researching on line, since I don't want to add it to the wrong part of the SQL (which is below).&nbsp; I did find a link to Rogers Access library which was helpful, but I cant get it to work as a stacked query when
 using query design or query wizard.</p>
<p>SELECT Vendor.[Vendor Name], Sum(Contract.[Original Leased Amount]) AS [SumOfOriginal Leased Amount], Sum(Payment_Details.[Monthly Cost Center Rental Amount]) AS [SumOfMonthly Cost Center Rental Amount], Sum(-(([Outstanding Payments Query]![Total Months
 Expensed]-[Outstanding Payments Query]![FirstOfTotal number of Payments])*Contract![Monthly Rental Amount])) AS [Outstanding Commitments], [Contract Count Query].[2010]<br />
FROM [Contract Count Query], ((Vendor LEFT JOIN Contract ON Vendor.[Vendor #] = Contract.[Vendor #]) LEFT JOIN Payment_Details ON Contract.[Contract #] = Payment_Details.[Contract #]) LEFT JOIN [Outstanding Payments Query] ON Contract.[Contract #] = [Outstanding
 Payments Query].[Contract #]<br />
GROUP BY Vendor.[Vendor Name], [Contract Count Query].[2010];</p>
<p>Also I have tried to update the report directly&nbsp;with out adding the new query to the old query and all I got were error#.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>i am running Windows 10 on Asus laptop with screen resolution set to 1920x1080.</p>
<p>i have read elsewhere that the resolution must be set to 1024x768. &nbsp;this is surely hogwash? right?</p>
<p>i have also tried another local user account. nothing doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>live tiles are arguably the most distinctive user interface on w10.</p>

            <p>hi Anil,</p>
<p>thanks for your quick response.</p>
<p>but unfortunately i have already visited the link you provided.</p>
<p>and just tried your suggested script to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when the script runs successfully, is there some sort of output?</p>
<p>when i ran it, it came back fairly quickly and absolutely no messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i consider the 'live tiles' a vital feature of windows 10 and</p>
<p>how could such be so subtle just couple of months before release?</p>
<p>and just to think, i am a retired windows programmer of 20 some years!</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope you can offer me some more guidance.</p>

<p>method 1: &nbsp;tried uninstall and re-install of weather, news, etc.</p>
<p>method 2: &nbsp;there is absolutely no network issues on my laptop.</p>
<p>method 3: created a test user account. makes no difference.</p>
<p>i get the impression that you are not quite understanding my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is not that the store apps are not running or producing error messages.</p>
<p>they are simply not updating on the Start Menu as tiles.</p>
<p>for example,</p>
<p>the Weather app does not show actual forecasts on the tile.</p>
<p>the News app has no updates on the tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hopefully problem description is clear.</p>

            Hi Andrew, Documents in Word cannot be rotated, unless you have the text in a text box . . .
<br />
<br />Try opening another document - is that upside down?
<br />
<br />If so, if you are running Office on a PC, follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the online repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .       
        </p>

            If the entire screen is upside down, you will have to consult the documentation for your computer screen. Some keyboards have custom shortcuts that control this (and these may be easy to press by mistake).<br />

            Text in tables can also be rotated.
<br />
<br />Does this happen to all files or just specific ones?
<br />
<br />
<br />Create a small extract (1-2 pages) from the file, 
<br />Use the macro in the tip below to randomize the text
<br />Upload it to your OneDrive
<br />Give us a Share / Edit link to it so we can play with it.
<br />
<br />You can randomize text in a copy of the file using the following macro
<br />
<br />@ Replace confidential text with filler in Word <a href="https://office-watch.com/2018/replace-confidential-text-filler-word/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office-watch.com/2018/replace-confident...</a>  
<br />Here’s a macro how to replace private or confidential text with truly random characters’ nonsense or anonymous text.  Handy for getting help with Word formatting or numbering problems where you can’t share the real document to an outsider. 
<br />This is often a problem for legal workers or others with privacy considerations.  It’s hard to ask for outside help with a Word formatting or numbering problem when you can’t share the troublesome document.
<br />
<br />Most of the ‘solutions’ to this issue aren’t appropriate.  Redaction or replacing text with black bars is hard to read.  Random text in Word using Rand(), Rand.old() or Lorem() will insert filler text but not replace existing text.  This macro will replace existing text with truly randomized characters to maintain the approximate page layout. If you translate the macro you'll see that it "seeds" each character individually before randomizing, so the conversion can't be recreated.
<br />
<br />You can test for yourself.  In a new blank document create an alpha paragraph of letters a thru z (upper and lower case) and 0 thru 9 (upper and lower case).  Copy paste it as many times as you want.  Run the macro.  You'll see that each letter has a random conversion, as confirmed by the fact that sometimes more than one letter in the line will be converted to same char.

<h3> majorfoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem Creating ISO from build 16199 UUP Files</h2>
                    <p>I have used the UUP to ISO program to create ISO's for the past several builds.</p>
<p>Today when I tried to create ISO for build 16199, I encountered a problem.&nbsp; When I opened the UUPtoISO program, I pasted the copied files from windows.old/windows/software distribution/download, and tried enter option 1 to create the ISO, my keyboard would
 not work.</p>
<p>I tried four other keyboards and the same problem.&nbsp; If I tried to select any of the three options available, nothing happened.</p>
<p>Something has changed to prevent selection of required option (1) to continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced similar problems with this program and if so, how did you resolve them</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem solved based on info in next post from J377</p>
                </div>

<p>I ran a similar script from MDL Forums (which the Tenforums tool is based on) <strong>
uup-converter-wimlib-10</strong>. I found that switching to Tablet mode and using the on-screen keyboard enabled me to enter the user response. ALT-1, CTRL-1 did not work for me. I was running it in a Hyper-V VM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have found that copying the files from their original location does not work. I leave them where they are and simply paste the path to that folder. The script only reads them from that location and does not write anything to the source folder.</p>

            <p>I would have loved for the undo to still be an option but sadly it is not!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Email Recovery add-on for Outlook looks promising, and I've installed it, but reading the reviews has made me a bit wary. Seems like there are a fair few people who have lost everything permanently and I really don't want to risk it if there is a Microsoft
 employee answer previously who looks to have helped someone else (in my previous response).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don't hear back from someone soon I will give it a shot as I guess I'll lose lose everything in 5 days anyway according to other users!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just find it frustrating that you don't even get an 'Are you sure?' pop-up when emptying a folder of this size. You're asked if you're sure you want to discard drafts but not to delete every email you've ever received!?</p>

</p><p>I am using a web browser, on Google Chrome. It says 'Outlook Mail' across the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless it's been backing them up for me I don't think I've done a manual backup from the web version, the only other client I use is the Mail app on my iPhone (Apple's standard app, not the Outlook app).</p>

                    <div>Hello,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've seen other posts talking about this issue but they are all old and a few are locked preventing me from adding to them. They say to start a new thread so here I am. Whenever I try to log onto Outlook.com to view email online it gives me the following
 error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<a href="https://pod51043.outlook.com/owa/?hm=1&amp;owa=1&amp;f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147205086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pod51043.outlook.com/owa/?hm=1&amp;owa=1&amp;f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147205086</a>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was given an email for Outlook.com from my employer and this is the email I am trying to check. My employer also has provided a machine with Windows 8 on it so I created a Windows Live account with the same email the employer provided for me to associate
 with it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also receive this error in all browsers that are available to me. These include: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer 8. I do not have the ability to install updates currently on the machine I am using as it is a client's machine and
 I do not have permissions and I need IE 8 for testing purposes.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am trying to access my email from a Windows 7 machine provided by my client. I have Microsoft Outlook on my employer provided computer so I am able to check my email there but I should not be limited to using an email client and should be able to use
 a web browser to check my email.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a fix to my situation?</div>
<div>Thanks for your time.</div>
<div><br />

            I was running into this issue for a little while but my issue was due to me not knowing that my account was actually an Office 365 account. Wish someone had told me(from my place of work), because I swore it wasn't one. Anyway with you going through a
 school you may have the same issue.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>What I suggest going through your schools links to get to where you sign into your email. Don't go to mail.live.com or outlook.com by typing in the address. Go to your school website and follow clickable links to get to your email.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I was in school (graduated this past May), my school had clickable links to get to email, this takes all the guess work out of which Microsoft product your school is using.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps!<br />

I determined the problem was attempting to login to my account using Mozilla Firefox 22.0&nbsp; Once I opened Internet Explorer 9.0, I was able to login without issue.<br />

<p>Office 2016 / 2019 / 365 licenses are tied to your email account. The product key is one time use. You use it to activate the license and associate it to your email account.&nbsp; After that you manage you license through the MyAccount website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2019 only allows install on one computer at a time. So on the new computer, login to the MyAccount site.&nbsp; "Deactivate" the installation on the old computer and install on the new computer.</p>

<p>If you have an Office 365 subscription or 2016 or 2019 license, you can deactivate Office on a PC or Mac that you're no longer using. Deactivating an Office install doesn't uninstall Office, remove Office documents, or cancel your Office
 365 subscription.<span>&nbsp; </span>It just removes your license from that computer to free it up to use on another computer.</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />You won't need a product key again. The "perpetual license," one-time purchase Office Home &amp; Business, Office Home &amp; Student, and Office Professional can only be installed on a single computer at a time. If you either want to move it to a different computer or reinstall after a repair to your current computer you need to first deactivate the initial install.
<br />
<br />The method for doing this is shown here:

            Hi Justin
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />The first thing you need to do is ensure the installation on the dead computer is deactivated.
<br />
<br />Step 1:
<br />
<br />From any computer, go to your Microsoft account, Installs page and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/office/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/services/office/i...</a>
<br />
<br />Under PC/Mac installs used, locate the computer where you want to deactivate Office 365.
<br />
<br />Select Deactivate to deactivate Office 365 on the PC or Mac. 
<br />
<br />Step 2:
<br />
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.
