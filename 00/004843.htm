<h2>            HP iPAQ 910 &#61; WM 6.1&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recetly bought an iPAQ 910. I thought it had windows 6.1 on it. The site says it does and all the videos I have seen say the same. However, I dont have the new fancy today screen that all the videos show and after trying everything and looking
 every where just don't see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Did I really get 6.1 with this device?</p>
<p>2. Can I get it. Either by buying it or perhaps from HP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've made some research about this and it seems indeed that touchsceen devices do not have the sliding panel. Bear in mind that the upgrade to WM6.1 is not about just the sliding panel. You have threaded SMS, the ability to mange the device using System
 Center, the Gettings Started application&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Jack will agree with me on this. You have a great device. I'd love to have it because it has a QWERTY keyboard in front and a touch screen as well. I own a HTC S620 with the type of keyboard but no touchscreen. I also have a touchscreen
 device with a sliding keyboard. I'm not a fan of devices with sliding keyboard. I'm always scared the sliding mechanism mighy break.&nbsp;The perfect device for me is one like the Ipaq 910c or the Treo 800w.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The homescreen does not make the device. It's the usability or the ease of use if you prefer.</p>

<h2>            Transfer of Microsoft Office Home &#38; Business 2013 to new computer</h2>
                    <p>At some point in the last 5 years I bought a standalone copy of Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am <strong>not</strong> interested in subscribing to Microsoft's subscriber based MS Office 365 software. I do
<strong>not</strong> want to buy Microsoft Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old computer on which MS Office Home &amp; Business 2013 has recently gone Kaput!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new computer and I want to transfer and use my standalone MS Office Home &amp; Business 2013 to the new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the software onto the new computer. I have gone into Outlook only to be greeted by a message which says, essentially
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Hello, despite the fact that you bought MS Office Home &amp; Business 2013 some years ago, you cannot activate the software that you bought via the internet because, allegedly, you have used the product key for the software too many times [<strong>yes, every
 time a major upgrade to Windows 10 was installed on my old computer, it crashed my computer, which meant I had to reinstall the application software on my old computer several times, including MS Office Home &amp; Business!!!]&nbsp;</strong>you need to activate it
 by ringing (<strong>an unavailable</strong>) telephone number. In the meantime, Microsoft will let you use the copy of MS Office Home &amp; Business for the next 29 days ONLY."</p>
<p>
</p><p>What on earth is going on? What happens at the end of the 29 days? Is Microsoft really going to stop me using for as long as I wish to do so the MS Office Home &amp; Business 2013 standalone software product that i bought, in good faith, within the last 5 years
 on my new computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft trying to force me to buy MS Office 2016 (either as a standalone software product or, preferably for Microsoft, as a subscription service) when I have a perfectly useful older version of their product which suits my current needs?</p>
<p>

    <title>Can I reset &#47; recreate &#47; reboot my Outlook.com account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> road hazard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can  I reset &#47; recreate &#47; reboot my Outlook.com account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My main login ID has stopped syncing, so I created a new outlook.com account ID, which works fine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is, can I somehow reset, reboot, or delete-and-recreate my original account? I prefer the e-mail address for that account, but I also need sync to work. If I can somehow nuke the original account and then reuse it, that would be great. Is that
 possible, or do I&nbsp;have to live with the new ID from now on?</p>

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">Road Hazard</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community. It's my pleasure helping you and enlightens you regarding your question about your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to clarify first what you said that your main account stopped syncing; do you configure your account to a mail client? What specific mail client are you using? It is still possible to re-sync your main account again to your mail client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding to your main question, you can delete your main account and re-create it again but you need to wait for 30days to re-create it again. If you wish to close your account, please follow the steps in the article below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/account-close-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I close my account for Outlook.com, Hotmail, and other Microsoft services?</a></strong></p>
<p><br />
If in case that the first step didn't work, you can try to go to this <strong><a href="http://mail.live.com/mail/CloseAccountConfirmation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to close your account. It will prompt you to sign in. Make sure that you use the login credentials
 of the account that you want to close.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Once you close your account, all emails, folders and contacts will be deleted and purged in the system and it is also possible that we can't recover it back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have other concern or question, don't hesitate to inform us and we'll be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Yes, my original outlook.com account has stopped syncing contact and calendar data with Outlook 2013 running on Windows 8. Contacts no longer sync with "the cloud," nor do calendar appointments, etc. (Mail is not a problem.) I've spent many weeks trying
 to fix this, and part of my debugging was to create a second outlook.com account. The new account syncs perfectly, even though it has the same calendar data, contact names, etc. as the original account. Because of this, I believe the original outlook.com account
 is "broken" and needs to be reset or deleted and recreated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try closing my original outlook.com account, waiting 30 days, and recreating it. After that, we'll see if it correctly syncs again. In the meantime I will continue to use the second account for my calendar and contacts.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the additional information you have provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that if you choose to delete your original account, it will take 365 days&nbsp;before you can&nbsp;recreate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I suggest that you try reconfiguring your account to Outlook 2013 and see if the issue will still persist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post back with any results you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Eugene (above) said 30 days; now it's 365 days. That's unfortunate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say, "try reconfiguring your account to Outlook 2013," what exactly do you mean? I've spent many weeks trying to get Outlook 2013 to sync with outlook.com, to no avail. If "reconfiguring" is all it takes, I'd love to hear how you do that.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do apologize if you got confused on the recreation of a closed account. <font>
Let me clear things for you on this.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>I would like to inform you that the recycling period for you to be able to recreate the account depends whether it is a EASI account or&nbsp;a Microsoft account. The former, which is originally a third-party account and eventually became a Microsoft account,
 gets&nbsp;only a 30-day recycling period while the latter, created as a Microsoft account (Outlook.com), gets a 365 plus 10 days recycling period.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>When you say "reconfigure the account," it means you have to re-add the account to a mail client or a device. If it's already added, then you have to remove it and add it again. Below is a link in which pertinent information are need when you reconfigure
 your account to a mail client such as Outlook. </font></p>

 as it's my main domain forwarding address. &nbsp;I don't want to have to wait 30 days . . . or is there a way to restore my original outlook.com account? &nbsp;Help!!!

            This is funny. I am also having the same problems with my outlook.com account and was thinking about deleting it and recreating it, this is how I got to this thread. Waiting for 365 is not an option...

            Hi Kaypup 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Looks like you are talking about Forecast Sheet option  which is found under Data tab, next to What-if in Windows version. 
<br />
<br />If yes, this is still not available on Mac version. On uservoice, Microsoft is accepting votes on this. You should also go there and vote for this suggestion.
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<br />My name is Kyle and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />I would like to help you.

<br />It is possible that you have files that work in the system and due to these applications that do not work correctly, I suggest you try to update your MS Office application to correct this problem.

    <title>How to export the content search results and then import them - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aleksey shevandin  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to export the content search results and then import them back&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to export the results of the global emails content search to the external cloud storage and then, after the further processing, import them back to one of the mail boxes. I'm looking for the solution that does not involves the local Outlook client.
 I had found that the Security &amp; Compliance <strong>Advanced eDiscovery</strong> has a feature that enables to export the search results to the external Azure Blob Storage. Than I had tried to import the results back using the Security &amp; Compliance, Data governance,
 Import.</p>
<p>The problem is that the <strong>Advanced eDiscovery</strong> export generates the
<span style="font-weight: bold">set of separate .eml</span> files and the import expects
<span style="font-weight: bold">the single PST</span> file.</p>
<p>Is it any way to overcome this limitation or maybe there is an another solution to export the content search results and to import them back?</p>

<p>Hi Aleksey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no official articles about how to overcome the limitation of the pst file. However, you can change the size of PST files when exporting eDiscovery search results. For more info, please see:&nbsp;</p>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-the-size-of-PST-files-when-exporting-eDiscovery-search-results-04e9de2d-765b-457b-a98a-d0f60bfb13f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-the-size-of-PST-files-when-exporting-eDiscovery-search-results-04e9de2d-765b-457b-a98a-d0f60bfb13f2</a>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Instead of exporting the full set of search results from a Content
 Search in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center (and from a Content that's associated with an eDiscovery case), you can just export the same reports that are generated when you export search results. An article for your reference:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Export-a-Content-Search-report-5c8c1db6-d8ac-4dbb-8a7a-f65d452169b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Export

<p>Hi Aleksey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>.eml file should not be generated when you run an Export batch. .eml file is generated in Outlook for Mac and it's a mail file, like the .msg file in Outlook for Windows. May I confirm if you are using a PC to do the exporting? Are you referring to the procedure
 listed in the article below? Are you going to the correct path to get the export report output files?</p>

<p>&nbsp;I'm using a PC. Yes, I'm referring exactly to the procedure listed in the article. I believe that I'm going to the correct path. I can even provide you a path/SAS to the Azure Blob Storage with the export results (there is some small test data inside).
 The export result path in report looks like this: <em>Input_or_native_files\19\00\25<strong>.eml</strong></em></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;as we had already discussed I'm interesting to export the search result to the&nbsp;external<strong> cloud</strong>
<strong>storage&nbsp;</strong>and then import them back. Therefore, as I had stated it my early posts, I'm using the export option that is under
<strong>Advanced eDiscovery</strong> . The export screen there definitely does not look like the one you had attached.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Okay. As I had stated it in my early post, when you use Advanced eDiscovery to export data from Office 365, it's packaged with a CSV file&nbsp;</span>that contains the document properties and analytics metadata.
 I'd like to confirm whether the file you export is a CSV file at this step before you export the result to the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Azure Blob Storage.</span></p>

            If you have the picture inserted In-line with text, or change the text wrapping so that it is that way, then select the picture and then press the right arrow key and press Enter, a new paragraph should appear under the picture and you should be able to
 enter text in that paragraph without affecting the picture in any way.

    <title>Normal Distribution Bell Curve - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt7878  say:</h3>
<h2>            Normal Distribution Bell Curve</h2>
                    I am taking a Statistics course and am learning about bell curves. &nbsp;In the Office program for windows I have seen an online tutorial on you tube for making normal distribution bell curves, and Standard normal distribution bell curves. &nbsp;The function to
 make the Standard normal distribution bell curves in that program is NORM.S.DIST. &nbsp;It requries that you enter your z variable and then false. &nbsp;In this version (2008 Mac) it only allows you to enter your z variable, and then gives an error if you enter false.
 &nbsp;The result is a wrong calculation. &nbsp;Can anyone help me out here? &nbsp;Thanks in advance!!!

            <p>Instead, you could use the older NORMDIST worksheet function:</p>
<p>
</p><p>NORMDIST(x, mean, standard_dev, cumulative)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the density function (bell-shaped curve), set "cumulative" to FALSE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For standard normal, use mean = 0 (zero) and standard_dev = 1 (one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some fancier examples, download</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.mikemiddleton.com/Excel-Shaded-Normal-Density-Curves.xls</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting the question. As per your description you are unable to set Outlook 2011 as default email client. Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before troubleshooting on the issue I need more information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the type of email account configured in Outlook? E.g. POP/IMAP/Exchange</p>
<p>Do you face the similar issue with other Office applications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to troubleshoot the issue, I would suggest you to try the below steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a new Identity and see if you can set Outlook as default. If this works, this indicates problem in your current Identity. You will need to export that data into the new Identity.</p>

                    Hi there, &nbsp;I purchased X-men Apocalypse on 19/6/17 at approx. 6:58pm. I paid for the item and was waiting for it to buffer and begin playing when an error message popped up "Cant play - the item is missing or we cant get to it. 0xc00d001a". &nbsp;I have tried
 getting to it via my Windows PC via Xbox website and I still get the same error message. any help to get the video working would be great or a refund of the purchase price.&nbsp;<br />
Many thanks.<br />
Jack.

            dear MVP, the point<br />
1. I did not receive incoming messages from that address (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)&nbsp;, I tried to use another e-mail service, and I can get it. I wait for activation code from the group<br />
2. The same problem to send a message, I also can not send to group with other email services.

            <p>I'm sorry, but call it what you want - it's not the intended operation of the program (unless Excel uses a different form of math that I've never heard of). And since other office suites don't have this issue, there's certainly no technical reason why Office
 shouldn't be capable of display the expected result. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said, it's nothing major, but still worth noting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where can I report it?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cpearson.com/excel/rounding.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cpearson.com/excel/rounding.htm</a></p>
<p>You may be correct in saying that "Excel uses a different form of math than I've never heard of" if you have not delved into IEEE standard 754, which is not actually a different form of math, it is a defined format for presenting the results of math operations
 on digital systems.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe a user shouldn't need to understand the technical reasons why Excel would display something other than the expected answer. But just because there IS a technical reason, doesn't mean it's ok to display an incorrect answer in such a simple case
 as this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for both of the links though.</p>

            <p>Most of the time, when you need just get a number to display to a certain number of decimals, the ROUND() function is used.&nbsp; An alternative is to choose the Excel option "Precision as Displayed" - and that in itself can cause problems because you loose that
 internal precision.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>why don't you try the classic way ?<br />
Since you have a formula that returns&nbsp;number.<br />
By default, cells are formatted as General<br />
so,<br />
select format, Number format (with 1,2,3,,,,15 decimal places)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also,<br />
type (in cell A2)<br />
=A1+0.2<br />
</p>

<h2>            Saving Styles in Word 2016</h2>
                    I'm having a hard time permanently changing styles in Word 2016. I open an existing document, modify the formatting of Heading 1 and Heading 2 styles from the defaults (or whatever they are at time of opening the document). To do this, I work with the
 "Modify Style" menu. Everything looks great and all of my Heading 1's and 2's are updated and formatted correctly. I then save and close the document, and open reopening, all of these style changes have been lost: the Heading 1's and 2's revert to the defaults.&nbsp;
 Why can't I permanently change these?

<p>There is only one reason I can think of for this, but it's a long shot.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>File | Options | Add-Ins</strong>.</li><li>Beside <strong>Manage</strong>, select <strong>Templates</strong>, and click <strong>
Go...</strong> This will open the <strong>Templates and Add-ins</strong> dialog.</li><li>In the dialog, if the box for "Automatically update document styles" is checked, clear it.</li></ol>
<p>When you modify a style in a document, it is not changed in the attached template unless you have selected that option (<strong>New documents based on this template</strong> rather than
<strong>Only in this document</strong>). If the described check box is checked, then the next time you open the document, the style definitions in the template overwrite those in the document. Ordinarily you don't want this. Occasionally you would check this
 box if you're attaching a different template to a document and want to update the styles, but you don't usually leave it checked.</p>

    <title>Word for iPad bug when using Slide Over etc. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hermanr1964  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word for iPad bug when using Slide Over etc.</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Word on an iPad Air 2,with latest iOS. When I first used this setup, about a year ago, I could use Slide Over to access my mail or do some other work while working in Word. At some point, however, a bug was introduced: after using Slide Over (or
 Split View, or using some other 'multitasking' function like double pressing the home button, or returning from the iPad's 'sleep mode') several functions in Word stop functioning. At that point, it is not possible to use italics or bold, copy and paste, or
 search in a text. Also, the 'smart' quotation marks do not work any more. Basic functionality still works, however. The only way to get everything back to normal is to exit Word, remove the app from the iPad's memory and start the app again. I have not noticed
 any similar problems with Slide Over etc. with other programs. Turning the iPad off and on again did not fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted this problem earlier through a review in the App store, but the problem has not been fixed in any of the Word-updates since then.</p>

<p>Hi Herman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge that you are experiencing with Word can occur due to several reasons, such as, compatibility issues with the operating system's version, hardware limitations, etc. Just for clarity, when did the issue start? Did it start after you updated your
 operating system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>I found the setup very easy so lets see if we can figure out what is happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What device do you have?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you look at settings and scroll to WiFi then click on it, can you verify that the WiFi button is On and can you also see the name of your network with "connected" under the name?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, a pivot chart does not pick up Row/Column Grand totals from the Pivot Table.&nbsp; You could, copy and then paste special values the Pivot Table.&nbsp; Then create a normal graph from this pasted special data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi Jagan,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community and thanks for posting the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided you are receiving the Office File Validation warning when you try to open the Excel workbook with XenApp published application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mention the complete error message given by the warning red bar for the workbook opened without the XenApp application?</p>
<p>Does it happen with a particular workbook or all workbook, is the workbook shared on a network drive?</p>
<p>Provide more details to assist you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you may run the fixit from the following Microsoft article and check if the issue occurs:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the workbook is unable to open when using the XenApp application, you may also post your question in Excel IT pro forum for better suggestion:</p>
