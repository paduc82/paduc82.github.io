            <p>Hi,</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply - in my case, I ended up reverting my machine to its previous Windows 8 installation state, then applied patches, updates etc...this time everything worked fine.&nbsp; I'm sure your solution would have been considerable less work :)</p>

<p>Many thanks nonetheless.</p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div><span>I have an HP laptop that came with windows 8.0 installed. I installed the 8.1 preview and then I updated to 8.1 (final version).</span><br />
<span>The system is activated but I still have the Windows 8.1 Pro. Evaluation copy. Build 9600 watermark.</span><br />
<span>I tried your solution (using telephone activation since the key is encrypted in the BIOS so there is no sticker) but the watermarks remains.</span></div>
<div><span>I also tried to go back to 8.0 (instead of 8.1 preview) but I don't have any restore point and the HP factory restoring software doesn't work.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>This problem is NOT the secure boot watermark, my windows 8.1 version is legit and it's fully activated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I found a similar thread in another forum but none of the solutions worked.</div>

I upgraded my windows from 8 to 8.1 preview and then to 8.1 pro.
<div>But somehow the evaluation copy watermark was still present at the right bottom of desktop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I used your solution (slui 3) and when system prompted to enter the product key I entered my Windows 8 product key. After restart the watermark was gone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am super happy now :) Thanks a lot Ravinath...</div>

            <p>I have the same problem. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>I bought a Surface Pro with Windows 8 installed.</p>
<p>I attended the MS Build conference and received a copy of Windows 8.1 Preview</p>
<p>I installed the Preview on my Surface Pro</p>
<p>Yesterday (11/26), I installed the store version of Windows 8.1</p>
<p>I still have the Evaluation copy: Build 9600 listed on my desktop</p>
<p>Windows is activated (the product key starts with 00191...)</p>
<p>I attempted the above steps with the following results:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- net stop sppsvc resulted in the "service is not started" message</p>
<p>&nbsp;- del ...\cache resulted in the "could not find" message</p>
<p>&nbsp;- slui 3 resulted in an activation screen that wouldn't accept my product key (didn't like 001, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- slui 4 resulted in a phone activation process that I completed, apparently, successfully (no error or warning messages) but the Evaluation copy: Build 9600 text remains</p>
<p>- Restarting didn't change anything</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure how concerned about this we should be. Is it a meaningless glitch showing up on the desktop or will I find my machine to be inactivated in January?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This needs resolution from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

            I don't think it'd be a major problem or the computer might stop working but it's clearly a bug and it should be addressed. I haven't seen many people with this problem so Microsoft is in no hurry to solve it t(mainly early adopters that tried to help
 testing their beta software).<br />
Anyway it bugs me to see the Evaluation Copy text all the time on my desktop :(<br />

            Still no fix from Microsoft? I now it's not a big bug but it's annoying from a user's perspective.

            I'm having this same issue -- did the slui 3 and Windows didn't like my key, tried slui 4 it worked and activated successfully, no error, rebooted still receiving the Evaluation copy and now I'm being prompted with the "your PC will be rebooted every two
 hours" prompt. Is there any movement from MS on this?<br />

            I just want to post an update about what happend. As non of solutions worked I tried to find fix online. &nbsp;I found a program that would remove it I ran the program and it started messing with my computer. It restarted and when it came on screen would flash
 between my default color theme(green) and desktop background . I tried to use installation disk and refresh my PC but it said that disk was locked. I had so many problems that I decided to go back to windows 7 , so I did. I might go back to windows 8.1 in
 some point in future but that is not going to be very soon

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot automatic repair loop</h2>
                    <p>I updated iTunes this morning and had to restart to finish the update. When my computer restarted it went to a blue screen that said the pc ran into a problem</p>
<p>and needs to restart with a wdf_violation error. When it tries to restart it gets stuck on a black screen that says automatic repair. It looks like it's loading but then crashes back to the blue screen and keeps repeating. Is there anyway to fix this? If
 so please try and explain literally step by step. I'm not the best with computers so every detail will help when explaining. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype has added my phone contacts to my private Skype account without asking for permission</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Today I saw that I had a new group on my Skype account called, 'My Family' it had someone I did not even know, and my ex boyfriend (who sexually assaulted me), whom I have blocked. It totally freaked me out and triggered my PTSD. I had a really bad panic
 attack from this. I looked at my notifications and it said something along the lines of: 'Your family group is ready, go say hi.' Something like that. I also looked at my contacts and saw that I had contacts from my phone added on Skype. I never ever friend
 requested them. I'm not sure how or why this happened without my knowledge. I have never once turned on the "Sync Your Contacts" setting on my profile. I also looked on the My Family thing on Microsoft, and did not have a group there. I'm very confused and
 worried about how and why this happened. Please help.</p>

            Hi Jane
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an Independent Advisor, here to help the community with issues that they are experiencing.
<br />
<br />When you are part of a MS family group on your MS account, Skype automatically adds these as contacts as a family group.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34739/connect-with-your-family-anywhere-with-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34739/connec...</a>
<br />
<br />However, if you would like to be on the safe side as you do not recall creating such a MS group, I would reset your account password just to be safe:-

<h2>            How to prevent Windows 7 from crashing</h2>
                    I have experimented with Windows 7 and Linux programs, and Linux is a very stable OS that does not crash unlike Windows 7, which contains bloated codes that a simple large file transfer would crashed it, but I have found a solution, that will prevent Windows
 7 from crashing, and is stable as a rock, it is to use BitLocker and AppLocker technology to create an environment for Windows 7 OS to run it, to prevent it from crashing. Nobody in the world has patented the use of this technology this way, and I reserve
 my rights. In order to run your app without crashing your Windows 7 OS, you can use Bitlocker to prepare your HD and environment, thereby running your apps with AppLocker, which will ensure that application run smoothly until completion, if errors are encountered
 to dump your output, this way your apps never crash, and will run completely until you finnish your processes, before you unlock your HD with BitLocker. This modification can be done easily by any developer, to give Window

<h2>            Stuttering Every 2-3 Minutes, Lock-Ups with Clean Windows 10 Install</h2>
                    <p>My desktop was working fine with Windows 10. &nbsp;Did a clean install and have run into this weird stuttering issue. &nbsp;It pops up as early as when I am customizing the settings during the Windows 10 install. &nbsp;The mouse pointer will still move around the screen,
 but whenever I click on something, it won't register. &nbsp;Can't click buttons or icons, can't drag and move windows, etc. &nbsp;The computer will be in this semi-locked up state for around 20 seconds, then there will be a flurry of activity as the computer processes
 everything I clicked during that 20 seconds and temporarily work as normal for maybe 2-3 minutes before it happens again. &nbsp;Keyboard input behaves similarly. &nbsp;During the 20 second lock-up, sometimes programs will show up as 'Not Responding' until the computer
 snaps out of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing a second fresh install of Windows 10 with an ISO that I re-downloaded, to make sure it's not a corrupted download issue, but the same exact thing happened after the second install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 was previously working fine from when I did an in-place upgrade from Windows 8.1, so I'm thinking maybe it's a driver issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using an old-ish HP Pavilion p7-1207c. &nbsp;The only upgrades from the stock hardware I've made are replacing the HDD with a SSD and adding a Geforce 660 ti graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">From your description, I suspect that there might be some applications&nbsp;creating conflicts on background or due to drivers malfunctioning. Let's perform a
 clean boot in Windows and&nbsp;check if it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when
 you install a program or an update or when you run a program. Follow the below mentioned steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press
<strong><span>Windows Key ,</span></strong> t</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ype
<strong><span>msconfig</span></strong> in the search box, and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. On the
<strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></strong> check box, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Disable all</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. On the
<strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong><span>Open Task Manager</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. On the
<strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong><span>Disable</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e. Close Task Manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">f. On the
<strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If a service is causing issue, I suggest you turn on 5 services at a time, reboot and then see if the problem reappears, keep repeating this until you find
 a group of 5 services, which are causing this issue, then check the one by one, till you find the one which is causing your issue. Perform the same divide and apply for
<strong><span>Startup's </span></strong>too.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Refer the&nbsp;below article on&nbsp;"How to Perform Clean Boot". As the&nbsp;article is designed for Windows 8.1, Windows 8 and Windows 7. Unlike launching step for&nbsp;'System
 Configuration', options and steps to Clean Boot are same for Windows 10. </span>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Moreover, ensure that your system is up to date with Windows Updates. Go to
<strong><span>Start Button/&gt;Settings/&gt;Update &amp; Security/&gt; Windows Update</span></strong> and check for any available updates. Also suggest you to check and install all latest and compatible windows 10 drivers from Manufacture's
 website for your device. Most probably it will fix all issues.</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Right-click the Windows Installer list item and then click Stop, right-click again and then click Start.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unregister and reregister Windows Installer.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow these steps:<br />
1. Click Start, and then click Run.<br />
2. In the Open box, type msiexec /unreg, and then press ENTER.<br />
3. Click Start, and then click Run.<br />
4. In the Open box, type msiexec /regserver, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: SFC Scan</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The
<strong>SFC utility</strong> allows administrators to perform a scan of all protected resources to verify that they are the correct version. If SFC should find any incorrect versions in any of these protected resources, SFC will replace them with the
 correct versions.</span></p>
<p><span>You can always run a sfc scan on the windows vista computer. To run a sfc scan follow the steps below:
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on start and in the start search bar type cmd, right click on the command prompt icon in the programs area and then click
 on run as administrator. </span></p>
<p><span>b. At the command prompt type
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and then press enter. </span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>NOTE: You need to login using the Administrator account and try to Install it that way. Or you can also
<span>try running the program by right- click and select 'run as administrator'. This should work</span></span></em></strong><strong><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4: Windows Installer CleanUp Utility:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows Installer CleanUp Utility might be able to help you. You can use the utility to remove installation information for programs
 that were installed by using Windows Installer. Be aware that Windows Installer CleanUp Utility will not remove the actual program from your computer. However, it will remove the installation files so that you can start the installation, upgrade, or uninstall
 over. </span></p>

<h2>            Surface book base battery not charging</h2>
                    Hi, I have the first gen surface book. The surface book base battery does not charge when plugged in. The led light on the connector lights up but the battery indicator status neither show that it's plugged in nor charging. This is only for the base battery
 as I can still charge the clipboard when I detach it and plug in. I have tried the uninstalling the battery drivers but it does not work.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing this battery problem for more than half a year. My Surface Book is only slightly more than 2 years old. I noted that many customers have faced the same issue but so far most of the threads ended up not resolved (including mine),
 which is extremely frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to give it a shot again regardless to see whether there is any hope of me still trusting Microsoft products in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased Surface book in December 2016. 95% of the time it is plugged in. Earlier this year, I started noticing that both battery 1 and 2 are not charging despite being plugged in. I discovered this because my laptop started to randomly shut down presumably
 due to the plugged in power switching to battery momentarily for not sure what reason. It happens very regularly until I got very frustrated. This is how I discovered that the batteries are not charging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my wife has a Surface too, I swapped the adaptor to test out whether this is due to adaptor issue. Battery 1 managed to charge with the other adaptor but not battery 2. When I revert back to my adaptor, battery 1 maintained 50% battery life but battery
 2 is still 0%. As such my laptop is now becoming a desktop as it relies on being plugged in all the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft Support few months ago on the problem. I have done everything stated on the Microsoft website but in vain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now questioning whether this is a major hardware issue that Microsoft is not admitting or it is merely a software problem that Microsoft can't be bothered to investigate for older Surface Book? Never in my life have I purchased a laptop where the battery
 is 0% after 2 years. I was very excited to own my first Surface Book but my trust in Microsoft products is now wearing thin with this experience including poor support and customer service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can't get a satisfactory answer or solution from Microsoft, unfortunately this will be the end of my journey with Microsoft hardware. There are too many people with the same problem unresolved. I am sure they are equally as frustrated.&nbsp;</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your awesome patience on this and for bringing this issue here at Surface Community. We appreciate some troubleshooting steps that you tried specially in trying to uninstall the battery drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can try to check this steps here below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Recommendations:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Please try to Permanently delete the Battery Driver of your Surface Book. Then download the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Firmware and Driver</a>.</strong> Once you click on
<strong>Download</strong> please refer to your <strong>OS Build</strong> you will be guided on what to chose.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(Just go to Windows Icon on your Taskbar then type directly "<strong>Winver</strong>")</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persist, please make sure your device updated (Windows Settings&gt; Update and Security&gt;Check updates).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Other wise, you can go on doing a <strong>Fresh Start</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To use </span><strong>Fresh Start</strong><span>, select
</span><strong>Start</strong><span> </span><span>Windows logo Start button</span><span>&nbsp;&gt;
</span><strong>Settings</strong><span> </span><span>Gear-shaped Settings icon</span><span>&nbsp;&gt;
</span><strong>Update &amp; security</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Circular arrows Sync icon</span><span> &gt;
</span><strong>Windows Defender</strong><span> &gt;</span><strong> Device performance &amp; health</strong><span>. Under
</span><strong>Fresh Start</strong><span>, select </span><strong>Additional info</strong><span> &gt;
</span><strong>Get Started</strong><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong><span> </span><strong>Fresh Start</strong><span> will remove most of your apps, including Microsoft Office, third-party anti-virus software, and desktop apps that came pre-installed
 on your device. You will not be able to recover removed apps, and will need to manually reinstall these apps later. You may also lose your digital licenses and digital content associated with apps, which may impact your ability to use these apps or app-related
 content you paid for.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Just in case the issue still the same, we highly recommend in proceeding on Resetting your Surface book device. You can proceed on "<strong>Remove Everything</strong>" or "<strong>Keep my files</strong>"</span></p>
<p>Proceeding on doing a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recovery Imaging</a></strong> the device will be an option if
 those recommendations above wont fix it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OE is part of your OS and can only be reinstalled by reinstalling XP. You don't need to though.</p>
<p>Move most of your messages out of the Inbox and move any messages you want to save out of Deleted Items and Sent Items. Find the location of your message store&nbsp;and then close OE.</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.</p>
<p>With OE closed, find the Deleted Items.dbx and Sent Items.dbx files and delete them. New files will be created automatically when you open OE.</p>
<p>Compact all folders as described below.</p>
<p>To help prevent this in the future:</p>
<p>Do not archive mail in the Inbox or Sent Items. Create your own user defined folders and move the messages you wish to save to them. Empty Deleted Items folder daily. Although dbx files have a theoretical capacity of 2GB, I recommend about a 300MB max for
 less chance of corruption.</p>
<p>Information about the maximum file size of the .dbx files that are used by Outlook Express:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095</a></p>
<p>After you are done, follow up by compacting your folders manually while working *offline* and do it often.</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.</p>
<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs and account setting changes. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently.

            Hi Bruce.&nbsp; Question...&nbsp; my parents have a bug in their OE 2007.&nbsp; They've contacted support spent a great deal of time on the phone with them but they can't figure out how to fix it or what to do.&nbsp; They can't send / receive e-mails.&nbsp; If they press the send
 / receive button it will show or act as if it's processing but then it stops.&nbsp; They've gotten a couple error messages, something about receiving reported error (0x80040600) unknown error.&nbsp; They've also gotten something using a "repair tool".&nbsp; I thought about
 uninstalling and reinstalling the program.&nbsp; Your thoughts?

            <p>My thoughts are that there is no such program as OE 2007. There is an Office Outlook 2007, but it is completely different. Please repost in the correct forum for the best help. Include any error message and exactly what this "repair tool" is. It doesn't
 sound like anything I would want to have on any machine of mine.</p>

            OE 2007 is outlook express 2007 as it is associated with Microsoft Office Outlook 2007.&nbsp; Unfortunately my parents didn't write down the exact error message....they're not computer suave shall we say.&nbsp; I haven't been able to locate the "repair tool" either,
 however, it does mention using a .pst file to repair the problem which is supposedly found in the programs folder.&nbsp; I was just curious if there was a way to uninstall outlook and reinstall it, without having to purchase the program again.&nbsp; I doubt they even

<p><br />
There is no such program as OE 2007. Outlook Express,&nbsp;the last version being 6,&nbsp;was built-in to&nbsp;XP and earlier Windows versions. Outlook Express also used .dbx files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Outlook 2007&nbsp;is a part of Office and uses .pst files. Again, they are not the same program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please ask your question on the Outlook forum that I provided for you. I have no way to assist you with that program.</p>

<p>Being a good Samaritan that he seems to be, his suggestion and screenshot of Window 3.1, along with his original reply floored me. I have been rolling on the floor with laughter since 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a more serious note, do you have an internal hard drive at all? If you do, your Command.com has got corrupted. To fix this, you will need a DOS bootable floppy disk of the same version with SYS.COM on it.</p>
<p>Once you boot through the floppy, type sys c:</p>

    <title>Wolf Among Us Season Pass FAIL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glfan2814  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wolf Among Us Season Pass FAIL</h2>
                    
<p>Today was the day when episode 2 for Wolf Among Us was supposed to be available for XBox 360. &nbsp;Season Pass owners are being asked to pay $4.99 to access the download when this episode was paid for in advance by the season pass. &nbsp;So far MS and TellTale Games
 are just blaming each other and it's been 14 hours, I'm stuck home thanks to the ice storm, and I have no new game content to play. &nbsp;Someone needs to fix this, please.</p>

<p>This game came out early October and it is now early January. Four months they had to prepare. No apollogy, No communication, And No sympothy for the new telltale fans that bought the season early on a leap of faith. and dosn't matter who's fault it is.
 They should let the one's with season passes buy it and then get a refund. EASY FIX!</p>

<p>So, the email claims that a console message will provide a code to redeem. Well, where the hell is my code? This isn't the first time a season pass has been available from xbox live. This is no different than any of the previous ones. The game is available,
 it is paid for, downloading should not be an issue. What is the hold up?</p>
<p>There was no issues billing me when I paid for it.</p>
<p>MS or TellTale - it doesn't matter who is at fault. It is about customer service for the features YOU offered. Just get it fixed.</p>

<p><span>The Event log error may be related to incompatible device driver or hardware defect. Since you have replaced you motherboard recently, I suspect
 it is the hardware issue. However, there are steps, suggestions and workarounds to fix the issue.</span></p>

            Hello 
<br />I'm Peter F  independent  Advisor 
<br />You will get this error when you are using diskpart clean command on system disk. The system disk contains the Windows operating system files and other critical files, if you are allowed to clean the system disk, all the data and partitions will be gone. That will result in a lot of errors and chaos. Meanwhile, the delete volume is greyed out in Disk Management. In this case, the new SSD drive may be regarded as the system disk due to the system files, etc. 
<br />
<br />Using Windows installation disc to clean
<br />If you have the Windows installation disc, you can follow these steps to solve clean is not allowed issue in Windows 7/8/10:
<br />
<br />1. Insert the Windows installation disc, then boot from it.
<br />
<br />2. Click Repair your computer&gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />3. Then input the diskpart commands to clean hard disk:
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />list disk
<br />
<br />select disk [disknumber]
<br />
<br />clean
<br />
<br />Diskpart Clean
<br />
<br />Then you could create a new partition on the drive to solve this problem.

<p>Actually, I was going to say, it probably only for sure cleans the <strong>Windows partition (C:)</strong>. Likely the EFI system &amp; the Recovery partitions are rewritten too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've got a data partition(s) separate from C:\, I doubt very much it is touched.</p>

<p>Hi FSXguy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>First thing to make sure is to start with the installation in the Administrator account and also;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Verify that the Windows Installer service is set to Automatic</strong></p>
<p>1. Windows Vista or Windows 7</p>
<p>Click Start, type services.msc in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />

3. In the Windows Installer Properties dialog box, click Automatic in the Startup type list.
<br />
4. Click Start, click Apply, and then click OK. <br />
5. Start the software installation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If that does not make any difference then;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Perform a clean startup and clear Temp folder</strong></p>
<p>When you start Windows as usual, some programs start automatically and run in the background. These programs may include antivirus programs and system programs that may interfere with product installation. When you perform a clean startup before you start
 the installation, you prevent these programs from starting automatically. To perform a clean startup, follow the appropriate steps for your Windows version.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Restart the computer by using a clean startup</strong></p>
<p>Note To complete this procedure, you must be logged on as an administrator or as a member of the Administrators group. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from completing this procedure.</p>
<p>1. Open System Configuration.</p>
<p>Windows Vista or Windows 7</p>
<p>a. Click Start<br />
b. In the Start Search box, type System Configuration. <br />
c. In the Programs list, click System Configuration.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup. <br />
3. Windows Vista or Windows 7</p>
<p>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the following check boxes: <br />
o Load system services <br />
o Load startup items <br />
o Use original boot configuration<br />
4. Click the Services tab. <br />
5. Click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
<br />
6. Click OK, and then click Restart.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Clear the Temp folder</strong></p>
<p>To clear the temporary file folder, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Windows Vista or Windows 7 <br />
<br />
1. On a computer that is running Windows Vista or Windows 7, click Start <br />
, type %temp% in the Start Search box, and then click Temp in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
2. On the Edit menu, click Select All. <br />
3. On the File menu, click Delete. <br />
4. When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes. <br />
5. Try to start the FSX program. If you receive the error message that is mentioned in the "Symptoms" section, delete the program, and then reinstall the program.</p>
<p>Let us know if the information helped to reinstall the game or for any further assistance.</p>

<p>After you downloaded it did you also install it? If not double click on the Winzip installation file you downloaded to start the installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other zip programs:</p>
<p>7 Zip: <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.7-zip.org/</a></p>

<p>Troubleshoot Compatibility<br />
<br />
This can help with some (but not all) programs:<br />
1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"<br />
2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next windows click "Start the Program" to install it.<br />
3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in windows 7.<br />
<br />
