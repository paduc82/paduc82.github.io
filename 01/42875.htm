<h2>            Usb tv tuner over air, analog and digital.</h2>
                    <p>Win 7 HP pinnacle tv center pro not windows media center driver for pctv &nbsp;800e usb.</p>
<p>The device worked on win10 for a few months but after a few updates it does not work properly.</p>
<p>Previous channels that were stored &nbsp;as found and would render do not, only composite or svideo input shows through the program.</p>
<p>Win10 installed an audio device 800e line in, no tuner options are listed, only the 800e in sound video and game controllers.</p>
<p>I have downloaded and updated the win10 version and still the same issue.</p>
<p>I never used windows media center on any version of windows, found it to be lacking in functionality and buggy &nbsp;and always using the devices accompanied software.</p>
<p>Going to guess this is another issue with win10 drivers installing the wrong version for the hardware or blocking the correct one to install.</p>
<p>Or recent win10 feature updates for skype, contra voice recognition etc are causing hardware , driver issues again.</p>
<p>I do not use skype, contra on occasion, voice recognition one one of four pc's and stopped using that because of issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fixing the MS toys are not my priority &nbsp; and do not care if any of those things work ever, but I want my hardware that worked only a short time ago to keep working.</p>
<p>I had this same issue on vista exactly the same issue.</p>
<p>This pc is still on 1511.</p>
<p>Win7 is looking better every day, or maybe linux ultimate edition &nbsp;or oz.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Updating the os will not fix this or many other hardware drivers put out for win10.</p>
<p>It is just not on this device but other win7 and 8.0 drivers that have been hijacked to
</p>
<p>not install or run correctly not dues to the hardware but the other junk MS is cramming into 10
</p>
<p>to get us all on one platform, one video driver, one audio driver, one input device and so on.</p>
<p>I have been able to tolerate the os in hopes it would evolve into something better then anything</p>
<p>MS has done in the past, but it seems I have been delusional to this regard.</p>
<p>Many on 10 have had little to no issues &nbsp;running the os, but many are not as lucky.</p>
<p>For them as well as myself, on every new update we find things not working properly.</p>
<p>If MS does not want to support a piece of hardware but the OEM does &nbsp;why should it matter to MS.</p>
<p>In a nutshell $$$$$$$, buying new hardware, movies music etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is not with the hardware or software, but in how MS flags the device or software as incompatible because of its age and age alone.</p>
<p>No new parts or pc's for me unless they run linux.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Stolen Gametag &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamrobinson4u  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stolen Gametag &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, for a good week before last Friday I kept getting messages asking me to reset my password, around 30 times. But last Friday I noticed 3 £15.00 purchases on my account ?&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft Support and they refunded me, and locked my account. They
 releases it again so I could log in on Monday but my Gametag was gone, I had a new, blank one with none of my games or achievements in there. I searched my Gametag and it is there but not on or attached at all to my email. I again notified Microsoft and although
 they have asked for more information I still have no games or achievements on my account.... I want my Gametag back ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this happened to anyone else and if so, how long does it take to get my account back the way it was ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When last contacting Support the guy was not helpful at all, and it ended with him saying "Well you got your money back didn't you" then cut the chat off. I was furious at his attitude. All I was asking was how did someone access my account, how did they
 make 3 purchases from my account and how did they take my Gametag off my account and he lost the plot ? I've kept the chat and I'm thing of complaining but will that make any difference ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The highest Level is now looking into it but as said, it's a week now I've not had access to my Gametag ….</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help out there</p>
<p>
</p><p>William</p>
<p>
</p><p>By way of an up-date, a month on now ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>STILL NOTHING AT ALL FROM MICROSOFT..... DO THE STAFF KNOW WHT THEY ARE DOING ? IT SEEMS TO ME A VERY SIMPLE TASK BUT ABOVE ALL MY DISSAPOINTMENT IS THE QUALITY OF THE&nbsp; CORRESPONDANCE ? IT'S TERRIBLE...….</p>

<p>
</p><p>How can someone just change your password, at the vey least they send a email verification ? All I got was notification my password had changed ? I'm in the UK so found it odd that my last 3 log ins were USA, INDIA, and FRANCE&nbsp; surely Microsoft security

<p>My old email is still in use, I use it now to see if there is any messages from the higher level Support, but the gametag that is o it is not mine ?

<p>My frustration is, I'm not being told anything despite my emails to the higher level Support who have responded to me but last week, to ask for more information. So I know they are receiving my mails.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t unlock from AT&#38;T, or use with T-Mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john wulf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t unlock from AT&#38;T, or use with T-Mobile</h2>
                    <p>ENVIRONMENT:</p>
<p>Used Surface 3 LTE AT&amp;T branded, running windows 8.1, from a friend who closed his account in good standing with AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Restored to factory original conditions.</p>
<p>Installed T-Mobile sim card.</p>
<p>I have, but can not use an unlock code from AT&amp;T</p>
<p>Sim card is visible to the tablet, but the broadband network is listed as "Unnamed"</p>
<p>WIFI is enabled and connected, so I do have internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PROBLEM</p>
<p>AT&amp;T says to swap the SIM, done, then to launch "AT&amp;T All access" and put in my unlock code. I launch All Access, but I am not prompted to put in an unlock code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>T-mobile says I need to adjust APN settings, but we can't seem to find any way to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on start - settings (purple gear icon) which takes me to "PC Settings" - network - connections. Under mobile broadband I see "Unnamed". I click on that. It shows my IMEI and SIM card, but no mobile number and no settings I can adjust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>STEPS TAKEN:</p>
<p>Called T-Mobile, they say I have to get it unlocked from AT&amp;T</p>
<p>Called AT&amp;T, they provided unlock and instructions, and on subsequent calls they say it is a Microsoft problem.</p>
<p>Called Microsoft, 888-665-4228 (1 for English, they say "Microsoft provides this information online at Microsoft.com/mobile and then hangs up on me.)</p>
<p>I did go to this site "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49039" and I downloaded three files and ran them. Surface firmware tool,
<span>Surface3_4GLTE-ATT_Win8x_161250_0.msi, and wintabX64. I can not notice any changes or adjustments after installing these files and rebooting.</span></p>
<span>Surface3_4GLTE-ATT_Win8x_161250_0.msi, and wintabX64. I can not notice any changes or adjustments after installing these files and rebooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>DESIRED RESOLUTION</p>
<p>Unlock the device from AT&amp;T and set it up to use with T-Mobile.</p>

<p>Hi Joyee91:<br />
<br />
What is the make/model of your computer, Windows operating system (including whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit system), MS Office version, antivirus program(s) and default browser?<br />
<br />
If you have a <strong>Vista SP2</strong> computer, please note <strong>that there is a known issue where Windows Update can hang on "<em>Checking for updates...</em>" for several hours (or even days)</strong> and cause serious performance issues - see the FAQ
<em><a href="https://www.vistax64.com/threads/how-to-fix-vista-sp2-checking-for-updates-hangs-and-slow-windows-updates.305124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Fix Vista SP2 "Checking for Updates..." Hangs and Slow Windows Updates</a></em> in
 the VistaForums. If you have have a Vista SP2 computer and are able to open your IE9 browser go to Help | About Internet Explorer and let us know the Update Versions of this browser, since the KB number should give us a good idea of the last time Windows Update
 ran to completion on your computer.&nbsp; Extended support for Vista SP2 ended on 11-Apr-2017 so if your Vista SP2 OS and IE9 browser are fully patched you should have
<strong>Update Versions 9.0.60 / KB4014661</strong> (<em>Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 9: April 11, 2017</em>).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0edf403-258c-42ed-ac3c-8bcb28d50e7d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0edf403-258c-42ed-ac3c-8bcb28d50e7d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the "<em>Checking for updates...</em>" hangs many Vista SP2 users are currently experiencing just cause Windows Update to run very slowly and hog an entire CPU core, but affected users
<strong>usually don't see an error message</strong>.&nbsp; The <strong>0x80070246 (ERROR_ILLEGAL_CHARACTER)</strong> error code you are seeing usually points to a more serious problem with a damaged system component, but if this turns out to be the case this is
 one of the common Windows Update error codes that can often be fixed on Vista SP2 machines by the
<strong>System Update Readiness Tool</strong> (a.k.a. SURT or DISM) - see the MS support article
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>Fix Windows Update Errors by Using the DISM or System Update Readiness Tool</em></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a <strong>Win 7 SP1 or higher</strong> OS the <strong>Windows Update Troubleshooter</strong> (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter</a>)

            In order to use an Anytime Upgrade, you must already have existing edition of Windows 7 installed and activated. Anytime Upgrades cannot upgrade older versions of Windows such as Windows XP or Vista. Also, an Anytime Upgrade Key Card is usually accompanied
 by a PIN which must use to retrieve the product key. <br />
<br />
What is a PIN and why is it required?<br />
<br />
A PIN is a unique 27 alpha-numeric code used to verify Windows Anytime Upgrade was purchased at a participating retailer. Customers will go to www.windows7.com/getkey to exchange their PIN for an Upgrade Key. A PIN can only be used once to obtain a Product
 Key.<br />
Where do I find my PIN?<br />
<br />
The PIN is printed inside the package that you purchased. To find your PIN, open the packaging and pull the tear away tab to expose the 27 character alpha-numeric code.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sample PIN format: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XX<br />
Is a PIN the same thing as a Product Key?<br />
<br />
No. A PIN is used to verify Windows Anytime Upgrade was purchased at a participating retailer and is used to obtain a Product Key. The Product Key is used to add features to Windows 7. You cannot use a PIN to upgrade.<br />
My PIN is not working, what should I do?<br />
<br />
If your PIN is not working, try the following:<br />
1. Verify the PIN was entered correctly. PIN is not case sensitive and is alpha-numeric.<br />
2. Make sure the PIN has not already been used to obtain a Product Key. A PIN can only be used once to obtain a Product Key. If the PIN has already been used, you can log into your account with your Windows Live ID (if you established it when the PIN was first
 entered) to access your Product Key or you can check your email for the confirmation email you received when the PIN was first consumed to access your Product Key.<br />
3. Contact support if you are still having issues: www.windows7.com/getkeysupport.<br />
What is a Product Key?<br />
<br />
A Product Key is a unique 25 character alpha-numeric code that is used to unlock additional features and upgrade Windows 7. It is used to verify that your software is legitimate.<br />
Why do I need a Product Key?<br />
<br />
Product Keys are used to unlock functionality and add additional features to Windows 7. It is important to keep your Product Key in a safe place.<br />

<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)

<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.

<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.

<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709/1803 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709/1803, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709/1803 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

            Not trying to be coy here and it may not have anything to do with it but.Server 2008 x86 is for a 32 bit system.Your not by any chance using a 64 bit system are you.Just a thought?Because if you are using a 64 bit system yes it will fail.I don't think
 they have made universal programs to suit both types of systems.If your not sure which you are using you can check by clicking start,rightclick my computer or computer in the list and go to properties and click.Under system properties general tab it will show
 you which system you have.If it is 32 bit it will show x86 or possibly nothing in the space.If it is 64 bit it will show 64.Just trying to help.

<strong>PART ONE: MORE QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Answer the following questions in a corresponding-numbered list (per the quote above)&nbsp;without quoting my post this time:</p>
<p>1a. When (exact date, preferably) does your Spyware Doctor with AntiVirus expire?</p>
<p>1b. Has your subscription EVER expired, if only for a day or two?</p>
<p>2. What, if any, anti-virus application was installed&nbsp;<em>before you installed Spyware Doctor with AntiVirus</em>, was your subscription still current &amp; did you uninstall it before you installed Spyware Doctor with AntiVirus?</p>
<p>3. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?&nbsp; [YES/NO]</p>
<p>4a. Is Internet Explorer (8?) working OK when you choose to use it or...?</p>
<p>4b. Is Internet Explorer or Chrome your default Browser?</p>
<p>5. Do you have backups of ALL Registry changes that Paretologic PC Health Advisor has EVER made since it's been installed?</p>
<p>6. You won two (2) BONUS POINTS for #8!&nbsp;&lt;hoorah&gt;&nbsp; Now tell me if&nbsp;KB2656351&nbsp;listed in Add/Remove Programs?</p>
<p><em>After writing down your answers to the&nbsp;questions above, proceed to... </em>
</p>
<p><strong>PART TWO: ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p>1. Open Internet Explorer (<em>only!</em>) to <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a> | Select CUSTOM and scan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • IMPORTANT! =&gt; Assuming KB2656368 is listed in the main scan&nbsp;results window,
<em>uncheck</em> but do NOT "hide" it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • If a Root Certificates (KB931125) update&nbsp;is listed in the <strong>Optional Software</strong> updates category on the left-hand side of the scan results window, check &amp;&nbsp;install&nbsp;that one&nbsp;to take full advantage of IE8's enhanced security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • IMPORTANT! =&gt;&nbsp;If KB2600217 is still&nbsp;listed in the <strong>Optional Software</strong> updates category,
<em>uncheck</em> but do NOT "hide" it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Tip: Do NOT install any <em>other</em> <strong>Optional Software</strong> updates (e.g., KB2468871; KB2533523)&nbsp;<em>nor any</em>
<strong>Optional Hardware</strong> updates, just uncheck &amp;&nbsp;"hide" them all!</p>
<p>Now install any/all <em>checked</em> updates (e.g., KB931125); follow all prompts.</p>
<p>2. Assuming you installed the Root Certificates update, repeat Step&nbsp;#1 above, this time checking &amp; installing&nbsp;ONLY
<strong>Optional Software </strong>update KB2600217. Again, follow all prompts.</p>
<p>3. Assuming you've now&nbsp;installed KB2600217, repeat Step #1 (if need be), this time around checking &amp; installing KB2656368 (if offered).</p>
<p>4. Reply to this post with a status report. Don't forget to&nbsp;include your answers to ALL of the questions in PART ONE on your reply.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            A COMPLETE list of 3D games for the Xbox 360&#63; &#40;searching for 3D doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work, etc&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I absolutely LOVE 3D games... &nbsp;I hadn't touched my ps3 or my 360 in about a year.. and then I happened to try the game "unchartered 3" in 3D and LOVED the 3d.. &nbsp;I ended up running out and getting a 3D tv ONLY for the games.. I don't even have regular tv.
 &nbsp;Since then, I have now gone out and bought just about every single 3D game for both the ps3 and the 360. &nbsp;I don't plan on getting either the ps4 or the One since neither apparently supports 3D.</p>
<p>In fact, just last night I stumbled upon the game on the xbox arcade called "3D Infinity." &nbsp;It is a blah game, but in 3D, it is GREAT! &nbsp;If you haven't tried that game in 3D, I highly recommend it. &nbsp;Plus, its $5.</p>
<p>If anybody has any recommendations for other 3D video games, PLEASE let me know.. I thought I knew about all the available titles, but I stumbled upon "3D infinity" just last night.. &nbsp;Its really is kind of DUMB that I have to "SEARCH" for 3d games so hard.
 &nbsp;For example, you can't just type in "3d" to find many. &nbsp;Sometimes, you have to type in "tv" or "glasses". &nbsp;Another example is Gamestop has a 3D category for the ps3, but NOT for the 360. &nbsp;Duh!</p>

<h2>            chkdsk &#47;r stuck at 10&#37;</h2>
                    Ok, so i ran chkdsk /r because i was getting problems with some programs, and the event log was showing that the HD had defective sectors. I restarted it and now, 6 hours later, its still stuck at 10% in the 1st stage. Is there any way for me to stop it
 without turning off the computer? I have some data not backed up (yes, my fault), and i can't risk corruption.

            Hi, Danilo,
<br />This counter is not linear so some stages may take a long time depending of disk size, data size on it, the number of problem sectors.
<br />You may try to press Ctrl+C but not necessary it will work immediately.
<br />Is you hard drive of several TB in size? If it is less than ~0.5TB I recommend to reboot PC and check drive's SMART with any third-party utility e.g. CrystalDiskInfo.

    <title>Windows 7 Starter HP Mini 110 Laptop administrator password lost - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mitterdoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Starter HP Mini 110 Laptop administrator password lost</h2>
                    Hello. My sister got a laptop for Thanksgiving of '09 and she had abandoned it for at least a year. Very recently she tried to start it up, but she had forgotten her password. Her user is the only user on the computer. I have tried pressing F8 and going
 to Repair or Safe Mode with Networking. I cannot find another method that can work. She was getting upset because she thought she would never be able to use her laptop again. The laptop doesn't have a CD drive, so I can't use a repair disc or a Windows 7 boot
 disc. She did not set up a password recovery thing that can be used by a disc/flash drive. She really needs help and I want to help my sister, but our only options is to post here and wait for an answer (could take several days), or go to our local computer
 store and hopefully get it fixed. Thanks for reading this and I hope you can help.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As it does not have a DVD Drive, there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;the operating system&nbsp;back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p><strong>HPs are normally press F11 at Boot to start the reinstall process.</strong></p>

    <title>Black Screen in preview, first video plays, rest are black - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wendy_931  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen in preview, first video plays, rest are black</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; I made a football highlight video with a bunch of 3-8 second video clips in .MOV format. Used slow-mo in some of them and added a song and a title slide.&nbsp; I saved it as a movie maker video (wlmp file) and played it at least 5-7 times
 and it worked just fine.</p>
<p>A few hours later was going to play it again.&nbsp; It played, but had no sound.&nbsp; I checked all the volume settings and all was fine.&nbsp; I paused and restarted the video several times and eventually just played it all the way through.&nbsp; Still no sound, but all videos
 played.&nbsp; I close Movie Maker and open it back up and now I have sound.&nbsp; BUT, now I have a black screen in the preview window on all videos except the title and the first video.</p>
<p>I search through this forum and see I am not the only one with this problem!! Wow!!</p>
<p>So&nbsp;I find that I need to check my video card (it's fine according to my computer).</p>
<p>I see I need to do something with codec, but I'm not sure how to do this.</p>
<p>I also see that I can convert the file to .wmv format and that will solve a bunch of issues.</p>
<p>So I do this with one of the videos and start a new project in Movie Maker.&nbsp; The video plays and I edit it.&nbsp; I set my start and end point, then I copied and pasted a part of it and put it at 0.5 speed.&nbsp; I play it probably 5 times and it works.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I convert another video and add it to project.&nbsp; I put in a title slide.</p>
<p>I go to play again.... And same problem.&nbsp; Title slide and first video plays but the rest do not.&nbsp; There is a black screen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The 1st, 2nd and 3rd videos are all from the same file, same video, just clipped in a couple of different places and one of them put in slo-mo.</p>
<p>What is this problem!?!?!?&nbsp; </p>

    <title>OneDrive failure on secundary harddrive installation using BitLocker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alias.me  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive failure on secundary harddrive installation using BitLocker</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got OneDrive installed in my "D" drive which is an internal harddisk other then my bootup "C" disk. A couple of weeks ago I've encrypted my whole system using BitLocker. My bootdrive is password protected and prompts at startup and after entering the
 passcode my computer boots. My "D" drive is also password protected by BitLocker and automatically opens at logon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: My user account on Windows does have a password but it automatically logs on because the boot is already password protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, on some boots I get the following error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Title: "Microsoft OneDrive", "OneDrive isn't signed in"</p>
<p>Text: "Please enter your sign-in info to start syncing again. (Error Code: 0x8004def0)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ca36786-f72f-44f2-a9f5-25d651a2ceef?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ca36786-f72f-44f2-a9f5-25d651a2ceef?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that there is a race-condition happening. On most boots BitLocker wins and the "D" drive is opened prior to OneDrive being started/mounted.... On few other boots OneDrive wins and the "D" drive does not exist yet in which case the above error
 occurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you press "OK" the OneDrive login dialog appears and after login in OneDrive works as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to fix this? Or, perhaps Microsoft can fix it with an update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advanced for any help on this.!<br />

            Hi Alias.Me... this is a bug.
<br />I have this happen as well.
<br />Can you put into Microsofts feedback hub and then post the link here so we can vote on it so they look at it quickly.
<br />They need to write a delay like you say for onedrive to connect\sync.
<br />

</p><p>Hi SarahKong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I've made an report on it on the Feedback hub. I couldn't seem to find a way to copy/paste a link though. But you can probably find it with this information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Title: "OneDrive failure on secondary harddrive installation using BitLocker"<br />
Catagory: "Files, Folders and Online Storrage"<br />
Sub Catagory: "OneDrive"<br />
</p>
<p>Searching the title should be sufficient!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tip and lets hope it helps!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compatibility is the reason for this driver issue. We suggest that you download the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/store/p/windows-mixed-reality-pc-check/9nzvl19n7cnc?rtc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Mixed Reality PC Check</a></strong> to assess if your device is well-matched to use Mixed Reality. You can also
 check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4039260/windows-10-mixed-reality-pc-hardware-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to see the Windows Mixed Reality system requirements. With regards to the CPU and
 GPU, here are the minimum hardware guidelines:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Compatible CPUs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Intel® Core</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">™</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> i5 7200U (7th generation mobile), dual core with Intel®
 Hyper-Threading Technology enabled or better</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Compatible GPUs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Integrated Intel® HD Graphics 620 or greater DX12-capable integrated GPU</span></li><li><span>Nvidia MX150 discrete GPU</span></li><li><span><span><span>Nvidia 965M discrete GPU</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As you noted, the Surface Pro 4 is equipped with a 520 GPU which is below the minimum hardware guideline. It also is equipped with an Intel 6th generation processor. Qualifying Surface devices include the Surface Laptop and the new Surface Pro, with the
 620 or 640 GPU; and the Surface Studio, with the 965M or 980M GPU. The upcoming Surface Book 2 also qualifies for Mixed Reality Ultra support with the&nbsp;NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 and 1060 discrete graphics options.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Only .mp4 videos can be edited</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to edit some .avi and .mpeg videos, but the preview screen is blank throughout the length of the video. This doesn't happen when i try .mp4 videos, which can be seen on the timeline. Does it not support .avi and .mpeg videos? I downloaded
 the latest version just today.</p>

            <p>AVI is just a wrapper and can contain well over 800 different file types, so unless we know exactly which type of avi file it is, we can't answer for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MPEG's also come in several flavours, mp4 is MPEG4, so it is working with at least one type of mpeg.&nbsp; We need to know which type you are trying to use again, to answer properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are often two options to get rogue files working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install the codec required to use them.&nbsp; So if your mpeg is an mpeg2, you need to install the mpeg2 codec.&nbsp; If your avi is a divx.avi then you need to install the divx codec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file still doesn't work, as can be the case with many files, as not all work with MM, then converting them to a wmv or mp4 file type using a quality converting programme will solve the problem.&nbsp; I like freemake, you need to be careful when installing,
 as to make it free they offer you lots of other programmes to install, which you can say no to all the way through.</p>

<h2>            After Windows 10 upgrage error BOOT MGR is missing after sleep</h2>
                    <p>I successfully upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; All seemed fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my machine went to sleep I tried to wake it.&nbsp; I got the error </p>
<p><strong>BOOT MGR is missing</strong></p>
<p><strong>CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I continued to get the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned the machine off and on and it rebooted fine.&nbsp; After it went into sleep mode I got the same problem when I tried to wake the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diag tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody seen this behavior?</p>
<p>Does anyone have a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hotspot 2.0 networks are a new wireless standard designed to make it easier and more secure to connect to public Wi-Fi hotspots.&nbsp;As you move around different locations and if this feature is enabled, your device will connect you to available public hotspots
 automatically. These hotspots are also more secure since encryption is mandatory.</p>
