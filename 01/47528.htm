<h2>            Wifi Connection issues with Dell Studio 1558 Laptop after upgrade to windows 8</h2>

                    <span>Hello, I've been having an issue with my dell studio 1558 laptop's wifi connection. The router that I currently use is medialink wireless n router 150 mbps single band with the n mode configuration. I believe that ever since I have upgraded
 to windows 8, I would get download speeds as slow as 1 mb/s, even if I am right next to the router. Upload speeds are normal. When I connect my laptop directly to the router, I get normal speeds of 17 mb/s. However, when I connect my laptop to my older router
 via wifi, a belkin g plus MIMO router, I would also get normal speeds of 15-17 mb/s. When I use my parents laptop, it can connect to both the medialink router and the belkin router just fine, so it seems as if the issue is just isolated between my laptop and
 the medialink router.&nbsp;</span>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The driver for my network card uses the Broadcom 802.11n network adapter. I've tried downloading drivers off the manufacturer's websites such as a newer driver version of the broadcom driver as well as a dell WLAN 1501 half mini-card driver, which
 actually caused my computer to crash every time I installed it and forced it to restart. I would then go to the device manager to "revert back to previous settings" to rollback to the broadcom driver, which would actually lead to my wifi speeds being completely
 fine, but only until I close my laptop to hibernate. After that, the speeds become sluggish once again. I've tried contacting the support of medialink and they said that the issue may be with my network card and the driver, but so far nothing has really worked.
 I've also used inSSID to compare the channels to other routers in the neighborhood and change the channels as to not overlap as much as possible. Is there anything I can do to try to resolve this issue? Thank you!</div>

            Hi Bennet,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help. I've installed the driver using the clean boot, and it did not crash. I ran speedtest and I had normal speeds. However, after restarting and doing a normal boot of the system, The wifi connection kept connecting and disconnecting,
 similar to previous tries of installing a new driver. I rolled it back again to the regular broadcom 802.11n network adapter. The speeds are fine, but if i restart the computer or bring it back out of hibernation, it will result in the same slower speed that
 I've been having.&nbsp;</div>

<p><font color="#000000">You have mentioned that you were able to install the driver in clean boot and the system didn’t crash and you were also able to get normal speeds. But issue recurred
 when you restarted the computer in a normal boot. In this case, it appears that some service or program is conflicting and causing this issue. I would suggest you to perform the clean boot procedure once again and try disabling the services one by one to find
 out which service is causing this issue. If you don’t face the issue when a particular service is disabled, then that particular service might be causing the issue. I understand that disabling the services one by one and checking will take a long time. So,
 to avoid this you can try disabling 5 services at a time and repeat the same till you find the service causing the issue.</font></p>

            Hi Ben,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you. I'll do that and I'll let you know the results when I get through everything. I have an additional detail that I just discovered today. In one of of the public libraries that I was studying in, the wifi network is in the n-mode. My speeds on
 this network were similarly slow to the speeds of the medialink n-mode router, around 1 mb/s. I've noticed that my speeds are normal, 13-17 mb/s, if I am connected to a router in the g-mode. Could it mean that a program possibly causes the driver to be incompatible
 when connecting to networks in n-mode?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>

    <title>Surface Dock inconsistently recognizes 2nd monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pdh_957  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Dock inconsistently recognizes 2nd monitor</h2>
                    <p>I got a Surface Book and Dock (sn 1415154618574) in June 2016. I had issues with the setup not displaying on a 2nd monitor from the beginning and spent hours with MS tech support. Dock is up to date on latest firmware, I've replaced display cords, and I've
 completed all the recommended fixes multiple times. I gave up on tech support and had hoped a fix would be deployed eventually, but apparently not.&nbsp; To get the 2nd monitor working, I have found 2 work-arounds, but not ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Sometimes it works to hit Windows-P (Project options). It will show Extend Display (last option I was using). If I select PC Screen only, sometimes the Surface screen will briefly flicker black and then both Surface and 2nd monitor come to life in extended
 mode.&nbsp; If it doesn't work, then option 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) With Surface Book running, disconnect Dock power blade from Surface. Remove display cord from Dock and plug directly into Surface. 2nd monitor comes to life. Disconnect monitor from Surface and re-plug into Dock. Re-connect Dock power blade to Surface.&nbsp;
 2nd monitor is active. For some reason, this also usually results in my mouse (USB, connected to Dock) losing its calibration (ie, the pointer visible on the screen is not aligned with where it is active in a program - pointer is usually high and to left of
 "hot" spot). I then have to restart the Surface to get the mouse alignment back. 2nd monitor is usually active on reboot. Sometimes have to do option 1 to get it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works 99% of the time, but it is a bit of a pain to have to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another (newer) Dock at my office. So far that setup has worked 100% of time. It's when I bring the Surface home that I have to repeat the ritual of option 2.&nbsp; On rare occasions I get surprised and it works right off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had similar persistent issues and have you had better success in fixing it?</p>

<p><span><strong><em>Has anyone had similar persistent issues and have you had better success in fixing it?</em></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You have the right idea of getting the video system to refresh in any way that you can.&nbsp; Try
<strong>Win+Ctrl+Shift+B</strong> (more than once with psychic pauses is often needed). &nbsp; Switching to Second Screen Only may help (<strong>Win+P, End, Enter</strong>) but be aware that you would be getting a Keep this? prompt that you would have to respond
 Yes to. &nbsp; Press <strong>Tab, Enter</strong> for that.&nbsp; Having Narrator running so you can at least hear what is happening can be useful.&nbsp; Press
<strong>Win+Ctrl+Enter</strong> for that.&nbsp; Then a problem is that I don't know how to make Narrator use the default communications device (e.g. my headset) because if the default audio is the HDMI audio port while the HDMI video is not working, there is no
 sound, including no Narrator sound.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Does your monitor have a VGA connection?&nbsp; That one seems to be working best for me.&nbsp; HDMI has been flakey since W10 FCU and before that HDMI audio was problematic with W10 CU. &nbsp; I naturally disable the (incongruous) HDMI audio connection for the VGA
 connection but would prefer to have it work for HDMI connections.&nbsp; Note that an MWDA can take advantage of both but then we have to work around its usability issues (e.g. regularly having to press
<strong>Win-K, Tab, Enter</strong> at least).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this has reminded me that since I have just been updated to 16299.214 I had better test the HDMI connection again.&nbsp; TBD.</p>
<p>

<p>Robert - I was not familiar with&nbsp;<span>Win+Ctrl+Shift+B&nbsp;</span>and will try that later in the week when I bring the Surface Book home again. That would be a simpler fix than unplugging everything if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win+P has only worked when I unintuitively select PC Screen Only. When that doesn't work, no other selection works either - I've tried them all.&nbsp; When it does work, the Surface&nbsp;screen blanks out momentarily before activating 2nd monitor. Once active, other
 Win+P options all work as well.&nbsp; When it doesn't, the screen does nothing (ie, just displays as is). Even when the 2nd monitor isn't working with the Surface, when I boot up the 2nd monitor momentarily wakes up as the Dock starts but then goes back to sleep.
 And since plugging the monitor directly into the Surface always works (but you can't use the Dock then since the blade covers the monitor port) and seems to reset things, the issue may be in the Surface side of the equation as much as the Dock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Monitor only has HDMI input. I first was using HDMI/HDMI cable to Microsoft HDMI/mDVI adapter. Switched to HDMI/mDVI cable.&nbsp; No difference with either. The HDMI/HDMI with adapter is in use now at my office and works there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post an update Fri when I boot up and try your suggestion.</p>

<p>At Robert's suggestion I tried the&nbsp;<span>Win+Ctrl+Shift+B to reinitiate communication with the displays.&nbsp; Unfortunately it did not have any impact on getting the 2nd display active.&nbsp; Briefly, I had both Surface and 2nd monitor
 working at home over the weekend. Took the Surface to work and that setup with Dock always sees both screens. Brought it home and, as usual, the setup there only saw the Surface.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So it remains that the ritual in option 2 in the original post is the only thing that works consistently to get the second screen active at home. Bummer.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Too bad you don't have VGA.&nbsp; I wonder if HDMI-VGA-HDMI would help? &nbsp; MWDA would be a possibility but as noted the general usability is not good.&nbsp; Still it would be easier than what you are doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other possibility would be Intel generic driver.&nbsp; What driver are you getting from Surface?&nbsp; In any case, you would get the Intel Control Panel utility that way (or at least I did) after Surface support deleted it long ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh.&nbsp; You have two video systems?&nbsp; How does that work?&nbsp; E.g. which one interfaces with the dock?</p>

<p>Barb - ran the Updater initially in 2016 and have repeatedly checked for updates to see if any have been made available. For the last 6 months plus, the Dock Updater has indicated I have the latest firmware.&nbsp; I had also followed the multi-step process recommended
 by MS:</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023496/surface-trouble-connecting-surface-to-a-second-screen&nbsp;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023468/surface-troubleshoot-surface-dock-and-docking-stations</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Support also had me do a complete (painful) reinstall of Win 10 when we were attempting to resolve it in 2016, and they sent a new Dock (July 2016, so pretty close in timing/manufacturer with the original one from Jun 2016 - and same result). Interestingly,
 the "new" Dock I purchased for my work office in Feb 2017 works fine with the same Surface Book every time. It's when I go home to the older Dock that the issue repeats almost every time if I've undocked and traveled with the Surface Book before re-docking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My home Samsung monitor (<span>U28E590D)</span>&nbsp;is on the compatible list as well.&nbsp; My office display is a Dell S2817Q.</p>

<p>Barb - I see I erred in describing my cabling up front.&nbsp; I had tried HDMI/HDMI to mDP adapter (MS brand) and then switched to Display port to mDP.&nbsp; Same outcome with both setups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To rule out monitor vs Dock, I need to bring that Dock to my office and try with the Dell monitor and bring my office Dock home to try with the Samsung.&nbsp; Perhaps something for this weekend.</p>

<h2>            Video Editor Application has stopped working. </h2>
                    This is the message I am now getting when I try to access 'ImageMixer3 for Panasonic' software so that I can edit videos taken with my camcorder.&nbsp; I have un-installed the software and then re-installed, but that did not help.&nbsp; This software worked fine
 for about 2 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions on how to fix?&nbsp; I get the usual message that 'Windows is looking for a solution to this problem', but so far no solution.&nbsp;<br />

I have Vista Home premium on a Dell inspiron 1520.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for using
<strong>Microsoft Answers </strong>Forums!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To assist you better I would like to ask a few questions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Are there any other specific details that you can provide that will help us to understand and resolve your issue?
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>Since when are you receiving this error?
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>Did you make any changes to your system?
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We can try these steps and check if it works:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Put the computer in clean boot (to figure out if any third party software is hindering the process)
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Check with the Step 1 (Perform a clean boot):- if everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;(<strong>Note</strong>: After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program and also remember to put
 the computer back to normal startup)</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Are there any updates released for&nbsp;the Imageviewer 3.&nbsp;If there are update the drivers.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also copy the files from Camcoder to&nbsp;Hard Disk and then try accessing the files from
 Imageviewer and&nbsp;check if you are able to view the files? </span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t shutdown completely or awake from sleep.</h2>
                    <p>So, I've been having this issue ever since upgrading to Windows 10 where my laptop will not fully shutdown or awaken from sleep mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue only arises after I have my laptop on and running for awhile, but works fine if I only have it on for a few minutes. I've tried turning off fast start up in the choose what the power button does in power options, as well as upgrade my display
 driver, but none of that seems to of fixed my issue. Does anyone know any other way to resolve this?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Mike,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We apologize for the inconvenience caused.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try to follow these methods, mentioned below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Power troubleshooter:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can run the Power troubleshooter to adjust your computer's power settings. The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine
 how long the computer waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep mode. Adjusting these settings can help you conserve power and extend your computer's battery life.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under&nbsp;System and Security, click&nbsp;power Option.</span><span>‌</span><span>
 If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Clean boot:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying, if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from
 the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally
 after clean boot troubleshooting".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The troubleshooting steps in the above links are meant for windows 8, however, you can use
 the same for windows 10 tech preview as well.</span></span></p>

 would cause me major problems. This is Microsoft's responsibility to help me fix my problem. &nbsp;My previously perfectly running HP is now having shut-down problems that I cannot resolve. Also, the sleep function is not operating correctly. I'd really like to
 actually speak with someone at Microsoft who could walk me through the clean boot. It's not fair that I should have to take my computer somewhere and pay someone to troubleshoot this for me. Your assistance in setting up a Microsoft appointment would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lisa</p>

            Unfortunately, none of this really helped with the issue. I am not the best with computers so I'm not sure what to really look for in Clean Boot but neither option really helped resolve this issue.

<p>I am sorry but we can not see your Tower to advise you what&nbsp;the problem is.</p>

<p>HP has detailed information about what "blinking", etc&nbsp;lights mean on their Computers.</p>

<p>Go to this HP website &gt; key in your Computer Model Number and Operating System.</p>

<p>You should be able to find a Manual to download for it <strong>and troubleshooting steps</strong> for it.</p>

 do my gamertag change for the first time ever and it's trying to charge me 9.99? I have never changed my gamertag before and your supposed to get your first change for free...</p>

            <div>Hi Bernie,<br />
Some of the new printer does not support printing from DOS. However, there are several third party software that will allow you to print using a USB printer<br />
You can use your preferred search engine to find the application that will help you print from the DOS box.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disclaimer: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved.
 Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try troubleshooting this issue as if the mic didn't work at all. Be sure to contact Toshiba<br />
Support, check their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about<br />
known issues.<br />

<br />
===================================<br />
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High
<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down
<br />
version. Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying
<br />
drivers. Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver
<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
You may have the windows default or an older certified driver and that is part or all of the
<br />
issue.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and get latest Sound/Audio drivers - Download - SAVE - go to
<br />
where you put them - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN - Reboot <br />
<br />
<strong>Check the Version on Driver's tab in Device Manager as often sound drivers rollback<br />
and then finally install the current version. Reboot and check after each try, not
<br />
unusual to have to run the driver 1-4 times or so. Just make sure the version you
<br />
installed shows up in the driver's tab.<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Then go to Device Maker's site and look for even newer drivers and repeat install
<br />
procedure. Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click on - RUN AS <br />
ADMIN - Reboot</strong> <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is
<br />
preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After updating driver.<br />
<br />
<strong>Right click Speaker near Clock -&nbsp;Recording Devices - right click in box - check Show&nbsp;<br />
Disconnected Devices and Show Disabled Devices - check your mic - highlight them <br />
and then on lower right properties. Make sure the proper one is enabled and check
<br />
other settings - on Levels tab make sure MUTE is unchecked and APPLY / OK changes</strong>.<br />
Or in this case you might want to MUTE the mic.<br />
<br />
Also in Control Panel look for some Audio Manager (maybe named after sound driver maker). Mine<br />
is RealTek Audio Manager, yours can be entirely different name if you have one.<br />

<h2>            Why is Windows 10 the worst operating system ever released by Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Why? Literally why is this garbage out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is the absolute biggest&nbsp; pile of F******* Sh****** I have ever had the misfortune of using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually had to come here to vent my fury, the hours of lost productivity because of this disease of an operating system. I wish it was an isolated issue but it isn't. I've had trouble with Windows 10 on tablets, laptops AND DESKTOPS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why? seriously?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Infuriating windows 10 updates that take FOREVER and often screw up drivers/functionality</p>
<p>Constant driver issues, find me a Windows 10 PC where you can get a normal microphone to work on any fu***** jack port</p>
<p>Constant locking up with apps, how? I've ran it on Core i5, Core i7 and Core i9 with 16gb / 32gb RAM, M2 SSD and it still crashes? And this is from a CLEAN INSTALL, no anti-virus other than the diatribe rubbish that comes with Windows 10</p>
<p>Constant Notifications</p>
<p>Horrible Clunky Start Menu</p>
<p>Horrible integration with One Drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had issues with Windows 10 on EVERY DEVICE I have ever used with this rubbish. I brought a BRAND NEW LINX TABLET from eBuyer that shipped with Windows 10, after first boot it did a load of Windows 10 updates and low and behold all of the USB's stopped
 working, because the tablet had a keyboard pad that connected at the bottom that also stopped working, I was never able to get the USBS working again even after restoring the first driver. I had to return the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I brought a brand new Lenovo YOGA that also came with this shoddy operating system. Running an i5 with 16gb Ram and M2 SSD and guess what, it struggled. I had constant driver issues with the video card. Windows 10 did a series of updates and fu***** itself,
 I had to do a clean install of Windows 10. Just when I thought all was good I couldn't get the onboard MIC to work, no matter WHAT I DID. I brought a USB MIC which was running REALTEK drivers, guess what? It wouldn't work. It installed and was recognised by
 Windows 10 and the bundled software but no recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I brought a new ZOOSTORM PC from eBAY running an i7, 32gb Ram, M2 SDD. It also came with Windows 10 diarrhea edition. Spent hours installing all of my software, photoshop, CAD the works. Did a round of updates and the internet stopped working. WIFI wouldn't
 connect, tried a different WIFI adapters and Windows wouldn't accept the drivers, had to connect via Ethernet then I had constant issues with Microsofts lovely built in Virus and Threat protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have given up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a TERRIBLE OS, Microsoft you should be ashamed for putting this f****** piece of s***** of a cun***** operating system out there.</p>

                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 2017 (i7 CPU - 1TB SSD) and use it as my main computer. </p>
<p>I am mobile so I connect to many different SSIDs over the course of a day.</p>
<p>What I have found is that switching between several SSIDs seems to make my WiFi connection slow down.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's difficult to explain so here's an example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say that I am connecting to 4 different WiFi connections over the course of a day.</p>
<p>ie: </p>
<p>If I switch from SSID&nbsp; "1" to SSID "2", and then to SSID "3", before returning to SSID "1"........ I find my bandwidth on SSID 1 is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">massively </span>reduced compared to all other devices I have connected to that WiFi connection.
</p>
<p>All other devices connected to SSID 1 are still showing full bandwidth but my new Surface Pro seems to be choked somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">For example. </span></em></p>
<p>If I (after connecting to all 3 WiFi networks) return to SSID 1 and run a speedtest (Speedtest.net) I see my download bandwidth is 1.3MBps.
</p>
<p>Going into flight mode and then back on Wifi doesn't give me any speed improvement.
</p>
<p>However, if I actually reboot my Surface Pro and then immediately run the speedtest again, I see my download bandwidth has jumped up to 33MBps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only happens on my 2017 Surface Pro. </p>
<p>I also use a Surface Pro 3 (i5 - 256MB SSD) which I also take to the same places (ie: Same SSIDs) and it doesn't have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried switching Wifi channels to ensure I am not hitting a congested channel but it makes no difference. The only fix is a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Max,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several factors why you're having an issue with the WiFi speed of your Surface Pro. One of which may be due to some programs running on the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>install all the latest Firmware and drivers for Surface</strong></a>. Choose all the updates on the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, perform a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>clean boot</strong></a> instead. This will help eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also run <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/comprehensive-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Defender</a></strong> to scan for possible viruses on your device.</p>

            <p>Hello LotusQiu, <br />
<br />
Are you talking about disabling the built in games in Windows Vista? If so, then disabling in Programs and Features is the best way to disable the games.
<br />
<br />
If you want to remove the games from your computer, follow the steps in the thread below. It is for Windows 7 but should be the same for Windows Vista.
<br />

    <title>Windows 10&#58; Is V-Sync Forced in Windowed &#47; Windowed Fullscreen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peptobismalaaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Is V-Sync Forced in Windowed &#47; Windowed Fullscreen Games&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay... okay, so... I was watching this video on Fortnite just out of curiosity if the guy knew anything I didn't. He brought up this point:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"...if you play in 'WindowedFullscreen' or 'Windowed' mode,&nbsp;<em><strong>Windows&nbsp;</strong></em>will automatically enable VSync, which will make your game a lot slower and your mouse will feel sluggish."</p>
<p>Video link (starting at the statement): https://youtu.be/ghYYd8C3OBc?t=44</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now... this <strong>I have never ever heard of and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>can't seem to find actual documentation</strong> on Microsoft.com about it either
<strong>just seemingly uninformative discussions saying yes or no.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So... is there any truth to this now or was there ever? I have seen people claiming that
<strong>Windows 8/8.1 did on different forums</strong>, but all the posts are like... 2014-2015 pretty dated; and I am a desktop user... so I never ever had any interest in using 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And never have I ever seen a Vsync where the frame rate wasn't directly affected (capped at monitor's max/current refresh rate) so if Windows 10 IS forcing Vsync... how would I still be showing 120-159 fps in game with a refresh rate of 144Hz? Why would
 Microsoft implore a "discrete" Vsync when DirectX 12 is/was supposed to be the "future of gaming"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this just outdated information or famous misinformation? I am truly curious to see if there is any reputable documentation that Windows 10 does force Vsync.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get clarification on the above Fortnite game statement, I suggest you to contact
<em><a href="https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fortnite Support</a></em> or contact the video owner, who uploaded this video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the documentation, which talks about Vsync: <em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3158621/hybrid-graphics-and-vsync-results-in-graphic-tearing-in-some-games-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hybrid graphics and Vsync results in

<p>I have heard of thism but don't really think VSync is being forced. It looks more like a frame rate limiter is being used in Windowed</p>
<p>and Borderless Windowed mode on v1809, and this is probably happening on a good number of games, but not all games.
<br />
I tried games that are linked to Steam and UPlay, and a few that are not linked to any online retailer, so what triggers this in
</p>
<p>some games I have no idea. Windows does appear to be involved though. </p>
<p>I don't have Game Mode or the other Gaming stuff enabled either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I always run games in Fullscreen mode, but Ihave a clone of 1803 so I was able to test and compare a few games with 1809</p>
<p>with my monitor set&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">@60 &amp; 85 Hz</span>&nbsp; and....</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Far Cry3</em> - Fixed @60 fps in Windowed mode - Not fixed with v1803</p>
<p><em>The Witcher 2</em> - Fixed @60 fps in Windowed mode, which also induces tearing which is not fixed using VSync for some reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v1803 - not fixed and no tearing even w/o VSync</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>DuesX HR </em>- Fixed @60/85 fps in Windowed mode with 1809, but not with v1803</p>
<p><em>Skyrim -</em> Fixed in Windowed mode on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
both 1809 &amp; 1803</span>, but check this out... <em>Not fixed</em> @60 fps in fullscreen on 1809</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but fixed in fullscreen @60/85Hz on 1803. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tested on 1803 first and first thought they may have patched in a fps limiter because of the way the physics tends
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to go bat guano crazy in this game when running over 60 fps (or is it fps higher than the refresh rate ?) .</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Stalker SC </em>- Fixed @60 fps in Windowed - Also tears with VSync on or off, but no tear at fullscreen w/o VSync. Not fixed with 1803</p>
<p><em>Far Cry</em> - Not fixed @60 fps in Windowed or Fullscreen when using the 32bit .exe, but fixed @60 fps in both when using the
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64bit .exe.&nbsp; Never noticed this before, but must be built into the 64bit .exe.</p>
<p><em>Oblivion</em> - Not fixed .</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT:&nbsp; Far Cry 5 - Fixed @60fps in Borderless and Windowed. Also disables the in game refresh rate option, and induces tearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting that even with Nvidia set to use 60Hz the in game refresh rate option will override that as still
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use 144Hz in Fullscreen mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - Haven't tried with v1803 yet&nbsp; ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- All up. Not looking like a good 'feature' for people who don't use Fullscreen mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----------------------</p>
<p>Regarding your comment -&nbsp; <em>"VSync, which will make your game a lot slower and your mouse will feel sluggish."</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may already be aware of this, but for other who may read this...</p>
<p>In some instances, yes VSync can cause mouse lag, but it shouldn't normally if a game is running over 60 fps.
</p>
<p>Mouse lag should normally only happens if the game is running well below 60 fps with VSync enabled, as VSync is fairly system intensive.<br />
<br />
Enabling Triple Buffering can help reduce mouse lag when VSync is enabled as well.<br />
I believe VSync had more impact on games in the past, but I still only enable it when there is tearing. Not something I see<br />
often see on a 144Hz monitor though.<br />
<br />
While still a fairly system intensive feature, I don't reckon modern VSync is as likely to make games 'run a lot slower' as it once</p>
<p>may have done. Not if the cpu/gpu are up to the task of running the game in the first place.</p>
<p>Machines with Integrated Graphics are still likely to suffer under VSync though.<br />
<br />
Having said that, VSync seems to affect some game engines more than others, and in different ways. It's one of those settings</p>
<p>I reckon has to be dealt with on a game by game basis.</p>
<p>I have a couple of games that get vertical tearing, (as opposed to the traditional horizontal tear) if I don't enable VSync, even with the game only running around 40fps, but it still does not affect the frame rates or mouse response when enabled in those
 games.<br />
I have had a couple of games in the past that introduced general lag as well as mouse lag when Anti Aliasing was set over 2X as well,</p>
<p>but this was linked to a big drop in fps when using 4X AA.<br />
<br />
- I believe a lot of people are not aware that mouse (input) lag can also be caused by the
<p>can be quite high (8+ ms) on many monitors that are not intended for gaming. Particularly monitors with IPS screens.<br />
Monitors designed for gaming generally have a response time below 4ms, with many have as little as 1-2ms.</p>

<h2>            Problem with uploading files larger than 1MB</h2>
                    <p>Sorry if this was asked before, I couldn't find a similar topic.</p>
<p>Recently I've been having problems with uploading files larger than 1MB on various services(GitHub, Dropbox, Facebook, pretty much any file sharing service). I tried uninstalling antivirus software(I scanned the system before uninstalling it, no malware),
 completely turning off firewall, ran the System File Checker(no errors) and even made a new user account, tried uploading with it and still received the same error. What should be my next step? I wouldn't like to perform any OS fixes that might result in me
 losing my files. Also, I'm not sure if I can even diagnose what kind of error is causing all the uploads to fail, so if someone can tell me how to do that, that would be helpful as well.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your questions:</p>
<p>1.I'm not</p>
<p>2.I don't know, it just doesn't upload(on github it says "Failed to sync branch", on Dropbox it says "Upload error", etc.). In my original question I asked if there was a way to diagnose exactly what kind of error is happening, so the question still stands...</p>
<p>3.It's: "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling proxy and performing a clean boot didn't help, unfortunately, I still can't upload files. What would be the next step then? Also, I can upload files from other devices in my LAN, so that rules out ISP's fault.</p>
