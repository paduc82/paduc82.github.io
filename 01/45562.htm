<h2>            Windows 8 Will Not Automatically Connect to My Broadband Network on Boot</h2>
                    When I start my Windows 8 desktop, it does not automatically connect to the Broadband Connection to access the internet. I must then click on the Networks icon in the Taskbar, click on Broadband Connection, and click connect. After that it connects and
 behaves normally with no issues. How do I get Windows to connect to the internet without having to go through these steps?

<h2>            Xbox 360 Hard Disk Drive - Installing Need for Speed Rivals</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there - I hope someone can help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We bought our son Need for Speed Rivals not realising it needs Hard Drive installation, and so to curb his disappointment we bought (admittedly) a second hand 250GB hard drive as we can't afford new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drive arrived today and we firstly tried to copy profiles and games from Arcade to the hard drive, but they all failed apart from some save games that came up with exclamation marks next to them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Next we tried to install Need for Speed. The screen comes up and and says "Install HD content to Hard Drive?" press A to continue or X to quit. So we press A, nothing seems to happen and then the game screen goes back to the above. An endless circle.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I also noticed tonight upon start up, after pressing power, the Xbox takes ages (3-4 minutes) to get past the Xbox splash screen. And when it does eventually get to the login screen it takes ages as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice please? Is it a faulty hard drive and should I have not bought a second hand one?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>
<p>Jon</p>

<p>Not sure what you are taking about with fraud Xbox live payments, but you can only remove a card if all subscriptions are changed to a different payment method.so if the card is removed, there can't be any subscriptions attached to it.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us on the forum. I'm sorry to read/hear that. I recommend you to go to your bank asap and ask for a new card and let them know what's going on. I'm having a problem like that too. The bank should investigate your case and they
 will cancel everything. I hope this can help you.</p>

 your bank and report the fraudulent charges on your account they have policies that deal with fraudulent charges on accounts. Which includes giving you a new debit card with a new number.&nbsp;</p>

            if your card was stolen and missuses it's your responsibility to inform your bank and get it cancelled. Also, normally your credit cards are insured and banks need to reverse charge any amount that was spent during a fraud. I don't think Microsoft needs
 to do anything in such cases.

<p>
</p><p>I have exactly the same issue, and can't find anyone to contact to help. I am a paying customer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When skype was taken over by Microsoft I was prompted to link it to my Microsoft account. I did this. Now when I try to sign in with my original skype account and recover its password, I am forwarded to the new skype/microsoft account which is not linked
 to my skype name but to a newly generated one. I can still access the original skype account, and see an option to link it to a Microsoft account although I believe I had done this already. Whenever I want to change settings on my original skype account especially
 the password, I am prompted to the Microsoft account that is not linked to my skype. The accounts shared the same email, which the customer above noted may have caused the clinch.<br />
</p>
<p>Could someone look into this issue, as this is clearly a Microsoft fault?</p>

    <title>Microsoft Remote Desktop keyboard shortcuts don&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrpinson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Remote Desktop keyboard shortcuts don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Microsoft Remote Desktop, the replacement (upgrade?) to Remote Desktop Connection (mstsc) for some time now on a number of Windows 10 machines however, recently I've noticed that keyboard shortcuts aren't working when the window is full
 screen. By shortcuts I mean ones like Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Tab, etc... basically anything using the Alt or Control keys. If I minimize the window, shortcut functionality returns however, in doing that it means that the remote session becomes just another open app
 in the local environment so it often means that I click outside the window or accidentally Tab out of it; very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if anyone else is seeing this issue, or even if this is the best place to report it. I've tried posting a review on the Store page but the support link on that page is actually broken so I can't find any more details.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I appreciate the efforts which you made to fix the issue. Error code 0x80070005 is also known as "ACCESS DENIED." It usually occurs when you lack file or registry permissions that are required to access Windows Store apps.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please answer the following questions, so that we can assist you better:</div>
<div>1. Is the computer is on domain? </div>
<div>2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>3. Why did you run SFC in the computer? Are you facing any other issues in the computer?</div>
<div>4. Are you facing any issues while booting the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if the issue gets fixed. Proceed to the next method only after performing each if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong></div>
<div>Make sure that the date and time are correct on the computer.</div>
<div>a. Check the setting for Date/Time by choosing the Desktop tile and then left click on the date/time in the corner.<br />
b. Click on change date and time settings. And then verify the time zone is correct as well as the internet time tab has the option to Synchronize with Internet time server.</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<div>You may also check if you are using any Proxy connection. If yes, try disabling the proxy connection and check. Follow the steps to disable proxy:<br />
a. Click the Gearbox at the top right corner in Internet Explorer.<br />
b. Click the Tools button, and then click Internet Options.<br />
c. Click the Connections tab, and then click LAN settings.<br />
d.&nbsp;Uncheck <strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN </strong>and check the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<div><strong>Method&nbsp;3</strong></div>
<div>Try to reset the store cache and check the issue. Follow the steps mentioned below.</div>
<div>a. Press the Windows key +&nbsp;R <br />
b. In the Search box type in WSReset.exe.</div>
<div>
<p>This will reset the store cache.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Method 4</strong></div>
<div>If still the issue persists then create a new user account and try to access Windows Store.. Refer the article below.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8</a></div>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is not possible to uninstall and reinstall Windows Store. However we will resolve the issue.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please provide us the information that was&nbsp;asked on January 7, 2015 to get clear picture of the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did you check the issue in new user account as suggested above?</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps mentioned below and check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
You may try to re-register Windows Store. Refer the steps below:
<div>a.&nbsp;Type <strong>command prompt </strong>in the start screen.<br />
b.&nbsp;Right click on the <strong>command prompt </strong>and select “<strong>Run as administrator</strong>”.<br />
c.&nbsp;Type the below command and press enter.<br />
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage&nbsp;-DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.xml</div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<div>
<p>Try automatic repair and check the issue. Follow the steps below to do that.</p>
<p>a. Go to start screen and type advanced.</p>
<p>b. Click on Settings and <strong>Advanced startup options</strong> respectively</p>
<p>c. you will be brought to the General PC Settings screen. Scroll down to the bottom until you see an option labeled
<strong>Advanced startup</strong>. Click on the <strong>Restart now.</strong></p>
<p>d. Windows 8 will restart your computer and go directly into the Advanced Startup options menu.</p>
<p>Now click on the <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> button and then the <strong>Advanced options</strong> button. When the advanced options screen opens, click on the
<strong>Automatic Repair</strong> option and follow the onscreen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to&nbsp;Boot into command prompt using win 8.1 disc and run check disk. If there is any issue regarding hardware then it will fix that. Refer the steps:</p>
<div>
<p>a.&nbsp;Click on <strong>Start</strong>, type Command prompt&nbsp;in the start search, right-click on&nbsp; Command Prompt and then click
<strong>Run as Administrator.</strong><br />
b.&nbsp;Type the following&nbsp; command: </p>
<p>chkdsk /r (there is a space between k and /)</p>
<p>c. Press <strong>Enter.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note</strong>: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>You may try to reset the computer and check the issue. Refer the section<strong>, "</strong><strong>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</strong>" from the link below and check.</div>
<div><strong>How to refresh, reset, or restore your PC</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <span>B</span>acking up of&nbsp;all your important files and folders into an external storage is&nbsp;highly recommend device
<span>before attempting any type of Operating system repair or upgrade.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your response. Answers to questions: Not on a domain. No changes that I recall. Ran sfc to discover possibly corrupt file that could be fixed. Instead apparently found files that could not be fixed. The only other issue has to do with 'winload.efi'.
 I found a way to replace it by taking ownership of the file and then changing the permissions. Generally, that seems to allow me to exercise more options, though I still got the winload.efi error but I don't exactly remember what I was doing at the time. Otherwise,
 the computer boots fine. No problem. Weird. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 did not work. Method 2, my copy of Windows 8.1 does not have <strong>
automatic repair</strong> at that point in troubleshooting. I have <strong>startup repair</strong>.&nbsp;I would like to&nbsp;get some clarification on that before going on to method 3, if necessary. Thanks.</p>

 future breakdowns. Can the WinStore folder in c:\Windows be replaced? I'm guessing no. Also, this is a Toshiba Sat C55t-A5314. They had no answers. HP machine can access Windows Store, no problem. Thanks</p>

<p>In my Jan 7 2015 reply, I stated 'These fixes did not work'. That included the new user profile. I logged in as the new user. Checked the user account settings by clicking on
<strong>Change&nbsp; </strong>user account settings instead of Check user account settings. Whenever commands don't match, I wonder if I'm missing an update or something. I found the settings at default which means they are enabled. I turned them off, tried WS and
 then back on. Still no worky. </p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for the update on this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since winload.efi is corrupted you will not be able to do System refresh or reset. This might be because the Windows 8.1 doesn't updated properly.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may try to reset the system to factory setting but you system will be back to Windows 8 and you have again upgrade to Windows 8.1. All of your applications and data will be lost if you do factory image restore.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may contact Toshiba to do factory restore since the recovery partition is created by system manufacturers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>you can also refer to Toshiba forum how to reset system to factory setting. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please refer to the title "THROUGH F12 AT STARTUP" in the link below to do factory image restore.</div>

            The black squares have not formed on any of my other projects, and my last update was the 2018-02 Security update for adobe flash player for windows 10 version 1709 for x64-based systems. I have yet to try the trouble shooter I will do that now.

            Thanks for keeping us updated. Upon checking, none of these updates should have caused this issue with your project. For now, we would like to ask you to save a new copy of the affected project by choosing Save as, instead of Save. After saving a new copy,
 try to open it and see if the black squares still show up.<br />
<br />
Also, we would like to verify if you have ran the troubleshooter provided above.<br />
<br />
We're looking forward for your response.

    <title>&#187;&#187;Windows 10 1709 Update fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marclapierre  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#187;&#187;Windows 10 1709 Update fail</h2>
                    <p>We have 3 computers running windows 10. The 1709 update has failed on each of the 3 machines. What surprises me is that the machines are not that old, have plenty of storage and system resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have a 100% failure rate and this after multiple tries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen solutions here that suggest a clean install, which to me is totally unacceptable. MS designs an update, forces the install and then suggests that I spend hours backing up, installing the update and then reinstalling my programs and the backup?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was perfectly happy with the previous install so as far as I`m concerned, MS should correct the install problems before sending updates out to torture users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the first machine that experienced a fail, after multiples tries, I decided to go back to Windows 7 because it just isn't worth the hassle going through hoops to install the update. Having done the backup and all, I relented and decided to take a shot
 at installing the update anyway, managed to get it done and then reinstalled all data and programs, which is a fairly lengthy process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then booted up the machine to discover that my sound drivers had disappeared and were replaced by ones that Windows selected. Even after downloading and installing the latest drivers from the manufacturer, Windows re-installs the drivers it prefers and
 I can't get my speakers to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after considerable effort, I have a machine that I'm not satisfied with and two that are in some sort of limbo. I certainly won`t go to all the trouble that forcing an install involves to have lousy results on the other two machines as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I have a fourth machine which is older and which runs Windows 7. It just keeps chugging along without a glitch ... tempting!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, MS should fix the update before it alienates more users.</p>

<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue may be caused by an improper Windows Update installation. For example, a Windows Update installation interrupted by a crash may result in a corrupted system file. A third-party

<p>
</p><p><span>Let us narrow down the possibilities why your PC encountered this issue. You can follow the troubleshooting steps below:</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I really do appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to respond, but the main point of my initial post seems to have been missed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before highlighting that point, let me say that I go back to the days of DOS, command lines and having to go through marathon sessions to try to get each new program installed to work with your printer. In other words well before the Plug &amp; Play era.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mention this to show that, while I'm not an expert, I'm not traumatized by having to edit the registry and using the command line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reached the point however, where I do have better things to do than to go through hoops to try and install updates that won't install. In my case I had 3 machines where the installs failed, a 100% failure rate on machines with widely differing configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The amount of time that would be required to install these three updates ( in other words, the amount of time that Microsoft expects me to waste researching and fixing&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">their</span></strong> installation problems)
 is nothing short of horrendous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company seems to automatically assume that everyone is so enamored with their operating system that we will gleefully spend hours and even days finding the fix only to, of course, again be submitted to more torture down the road.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a news flash ... That's not the case and frankly as the roll out of 1709 gains momentum, I suspect that will push some people over the edge and outrage many others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed one system at the expense of hours of my time and I do not intend to do that again for the other two systems. The rewards ... the satisfaction of knowing that I was able to accomplish it ... just aren't worth it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will leave the two systems as is until the repeated installation efforts, and the resultant slow down of the systems, result in my family members complaining enough that I bite the bullet and either go back to windows 7/ 8.1 or consider finding a good
 distro of Linux, of which there are more and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, again, thanks ... but no thanks</p>
        </p>

<p>Windows is constantly developing fixes for windows update. Since you mentioned that you were able to fix one out of your three system, we recommend that you mirror the fix that you've done in order to check if the issue will persist with the other two devices.
 If the issue persists and you wish to continue with troubleshooting your query, you can update this thread for any development on the status of your device. We are still here to continue working on the issue once you're ready.
</p>
<p>

<p>You still fail to get the point that Marc is making.&nbsp; He does not want to waste any further of his time "mirroring the fix" as you state.&nbsp; Frankly, nor do I.&nbsp; I face the same issue and I find it totally unacceptable that we are forced to deal with this update.&nbsp;
 In fact, the system that keeps failing is part of a network and all the data is attached to a server connected to this machine.&nbsp; Every time this miserable update fails, it shuts the pc down entirely, breaking all the connections to the networked computers.&nbsp;
 This causes us significant time in re-starting the computer, waiting for it to "restore to previous version of windows", and then reconnect all the computers.&nbsp; Windows has now become such an albatross that we are seeking alternative solutions to the operating
 system, especially when we cannot trust that Microsoft can come up with reasonable solutions to resolve an issue such as this (this issue has been happening since last year and MS has done nothing that I am aware of).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, I would like to reiterate- WE AS THE CONSUMER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FIX ISSUES THAT YOU ARE THRUSTING UPON US!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marc is on point here.&nbsp; These forklift updates to Win 10, ie Feature Update, choke the network and require multiple attempts to install - at best.&nbsp; And if it does install you can be sure the system will be sidelined for 1 day while it churns and burns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is annoying on my multiple home systems but downright unacceptable in the corporate world.&nbsp; It should be easy to skip/forego these huge updates - and just let the normal win update kb fixes and patches through.&nbsp; I don't care about a 3d version of Paint
 and other eye-candy that we don't need/use in the corporate world - SO LET ME CHOOSE WHEN TO REIMAGE MY SYSTEM VIA FEATURE UPDATES.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd much prefer to download the ISO and install when I'm ready rather than having system/network resources wasted while Win Update continues to churn re-downloading and attempting to re-install over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS - you wonder why Win10 has been so slow to penetrate business...?&nbsp; We shouldn't have to subscribe to WSUS to have control over these unwieldy updates.&nbsp; And so far - 1709 has been the worse.</p>

            I must agree. I have tried everything short of a clean install (which to be honest is not an option given how many hours it would take to reinstall all of my applications) to get this 1709 version installed from 1607. It has been months of continuous downloads
 and updates and failures to no end. The level of frustration this has caused leads me to voice my opinion which I rarely do. MS Fix your update issues and stop forcing your poorly tested updates on us expecting us to waste countless hours troubleshooting your
 garbage or give us real tools to ascertain the root cause of these repeated failures instead of cryptic error codes that lead to nothing more than your "pat" answers to solve your issues.

            I also had difficulty installing 1709 on a recent model Acer laptop.&nbsp; I eventually had success by doing the update on a wired internet connection.&nbsp; I suspect wireless drivers are causing the update to prematurely terminate or hang . MS should probably
 suggest updates be done on a wired internet connection .

            That programs never worked either on my machine.&nbsp; You just don't get it, do you?&nbsp; The majority of Microsoft released software is untested rubbish.&nbsp; You expect the users to waste countless hours doing your testing for free.&nbsp; I don't even want the frigging
 update!&nbsp; I just want to be left alone without the hassle or failed updating that you have stopped users from turning off.

<p>I have the same problem on 3 different computers. Plus I only have one NEW computer that actually did the upgrade only to find out that on version 1803 the Edge Browser is running cache in the background (without being open) and it is slowing down the internet
 speed a huge amount while all our other computers still run FAST. (The ones that will NOT upgrade)</p>
<p>Is there any hope in sight for those of us that LOVE Microsoft to EVER get a real upgrade for the Windows PRO 1607 (OS Build 14393.2273) ?</p>
<p>I have tried every suggested tip that is on the web. That includes updating from a usb .iso image and every other stupid suggestion that simply do NOT work on the 3 computers that I need to update because Microsoft no longer supports version 1607.</p>
<p>I must have at least 4 full work weeks of hours in trying to solve this issue.</p>
<p>It is not odd that I have the SAME errors on all 3 computers that are even different brands with intel i7 cpu's and large amounts of RAM and SSD hard drives.</p>
<p>I have spent tens of thousands of dollars buying and supporting Microsoft over the years always buying legitimate licensing. Only to be punished (and forced) into in-installable upgrades. (Really?)</p>
<p>From what I have read, there are also thousands of other people just like me that would LOVE to have a simple upgrade that actually WORKS. (Please Help!)</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

<p>Appreciate if you could post up the make and model of your modem.</p>
<p>Could you power cycle your network equipment. Turn them off for a couple of minutes before reconnect your modem and router.</p>
<p>Make sure your D-link is up-to-date with the latest version of firmware. Do not update from your router's web-config page. Visit the manufactures website for updates. Ensure that UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is turned on. If you have manually open ports
 used by Xbox LIVE or placed your Xbox in the DMZ, turn off both of these features.</p>

<h2>            Failing updates to Windows 10</h2>
                    My computer has tried to update Windows 10 version 1709 36 times.&nbsp; At some point during the update, it gets interrupted and exists without updating.&nbsp; I tried to restore to an older version but the only restore point is the last update attempt.&nbsp; Short of
 doing a complete reinstall of windows what can I do?

<p>The machine is an ASUS Desktop PC M11BB Series with 8 GB of Ram.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The current OS is Windows Home version 1703 Build 15063.909.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Processor is AMD A10-6700 APU with Radeon™ HD Graphics 3.70 GHz</p>
<p>There is no error message given during the attempted update; however <span>&nbsp;</span>“Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709 - Error 0x8007007e” shows up on Windows update settings.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>I decoded the update log and the following appears at the bottom: “{1EB90BFF-2A9E-427F-8496-0C3183C54D99}<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>The updater reinstalls the existing Version so I am able to use the machine; it just tries to update every time I restart.<span>&nbsp;

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

            Thanks for the detailed update in the current scenario. On our understanding, the download of the patch was being interrupted. It must have been downloaded but it was downloaded incompletely.
<br />
<br />
To get rid of the fail update file, you need to go to this address: <br />
<br />
<strong>This PC &gt; Windows &gt; SoftwareDistribution &gt; Download</strong>. <br />
<br />
Delete all that are in there. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, we have to try <strong>re-downloading</strong><strong> the patch while any (or all) antivirus program is completely disabled, including Windows Defender.</strong> The protection software is most likely to be the culprit. Once you're done downloading the
 patch, restart the PC as usual in order to let the system install the update. This time, when you boot the PC (or before installing the update),
<strong>turn off your WiFi router or unplug the Ethernet cord from the back of your PC to disconnect internet connections</strong>. This is necessary to avoid any network interference, given that the patch, when completely downloaded, will no longer need any
 internet connection upon installation. <br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to update how it goes. <br />
<br />
<br />

            I deleted all the download files and turned off the fire walls and anti-virus software; however the software did not download.&nbsp; Here is the message: 'There were problems installing some updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want
 to search the web or contact support for information, this may help:&nbsp;&nbsp;Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709 - Error 0x80246010".&nbsp; What should I try next?

            I did a little housekeeping on the C drive to free up some space and get rid of some unneeded files and restarted the download.&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems to have downloaded fine and I will try rebooting without the internet connections as soon as all the files are ready
 to install.

            I followed your instructions but the update still did not load.&nbsp; This time there is no error code just a message that it requires a restart to finish installing.&nbsp; Of the 43 times it has attempted to update, about half of them have the same message.&nbsp; I
 have restarted several times without success.

<p>Hello Stephen, <br />
<br />
<br />
To better manage this thread related to Windows Update, we'd like to verify if the issue persists. If yes, we'd recommend running the
<em><strong>Windows Update Troubleshooter</strong></em> to diagnose and repair any broken components that's causing this issue. To do this, download this troubleshooter on this
<em><strong><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em>, locate the file in the download folder, right-click on it and select
<em><strong>Run as administrator</strong></em>. Then, follow the on-screen prompts.
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Note</strong></em>: <em>After running the troubleshooter, try installing the said Windows Update again and check if the issue persists.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that the above steps doesn't suffice, we'd recommend turning on the
<em><strong>Windows Update services</strong></em> via <em><strong>Command Prompt</strong></em> (<strong><em>Admin</em></strong>). Here's how:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the <strong><em>Search</em></strong> box, type <strong><em>cmd</em></strong>, right-click the result and select
<em><strong>Run as administrator</strong></em>.</li><li>Once Command Prompt starts, copy and paste the following commands and press <strong>
<em>Enter</em></strong> after each line in order to run it:
<p><br />
<strong><em>SC config wuauserv start= auto </em></strong><br />
<strong><em>SC config bits start= auto </em></strong><br />
<strong><em>SC config cryptsvc start= auto </em></strong><br />
<strong><em>SC config trustedinstaller start= auto </em></strong><br />
<br />
</p>
</li><li>Once done, restart your device to apply the changes and try to install the Windows Update again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back for an update with the outcome and let us know if you need more help.</p>

<p><strong>The clock on my computer stops every time I shut down or set it to sleep. &nbsp;I thought it was the cmos battery and replaced it, but the problem has started again. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The problem started shortly after I installed windows 7. &nbsp;Could it possibly be a software glitch?</strong></p>

<p>Hi ppphhh,</p>
<p>My first suggestion would be to see if restarting the time service can fix the issue. Follow the path below to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>Start</strong>&gt; Type in <strong>Services.msc </strong>in the search bar&gt; Look for
<strong>Windows Time service </strong>in the window that opens up&gt; <strong>Restart
</strong>the service running.</p>
<p>If restarting the Time service will not solve, try to "<strong>Stop</strong>" it then restart your computer.&nbsp; It should restart itself again. If not manullay go to the location and restart it.</p>
<p>If that does not fix the issue then you may want to look for any third party application conflict. Perform a
<strong>Clean boot </strong>and see if you can find any third party applcation that is conflicting with the normal performance of the computer.</p>
<p>To perform a clean boot on a computer that is running Windows 7, follow these steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If your issue is resolved, follow the How to Determine What is Causing the Problem section in the KB article to narrow down the exact source.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Volume Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tommyjgrimshaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Volume Problem</h2>
                    <p>For some reason, I keep encountering an issue where whenever I pause a video/music and then begin playing again, the volume becomes
<strong>very</strong> loud.&nbsp; This problem only seems to happen when I'm listening via headphones, and the volume on the taskbar doesn't change even though the volume has actually become much louder.&nbsp; The only way I can fix the problem at the moment is to unplug
 my headphones and then plug them back in, which is obviously quite annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, my speakers show as "Conexant ISST Audio".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas/help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Win 8.1 Update failure, error code 80240055 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swegnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 8.1 Update failure, error code 80240055</h2>
                    <p>We have a Lenovo laptop about 2 years old that recently failed. We sent it in for "depot repair". It just came back with a new motherboard and reset to when it left the factory. The OS is Win 8.1. &nbsp;Windows Update was set to update automatically so we let
 it run overnight, plugged in to mains power. This morning the system shows a long list of updates (as expected) but every one failed to install. I checked a number of the failures and each shows error code 80240055.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have several questions -</p>
<p>1) What is error code 80240055 (and why does Microsoft assign error codes and then not make it known what they mean; searching yields no list of error codes and what to do when you get them)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) after all the failures, don't the downloads at least stay on the system? I reset Win Update to let me manually install updates, but it seems I have to rerun "Checking for Updates" for hours to get the list again&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) when you know you are going to have a lot of updates, is there anyway to get less than all at once? It would be wonderful if one could ask for, say, 10 at a time, max.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking Windows Update History, the most recent cumulative update installed successfully was KB3000850 on 11/21/2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then ... I downloaded and ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter. It indicated that it fixed a couple of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to the first update that had failed to install (KB3153704) and tried to install it manually to see if that would work. I downloaded it, saved it, and the double clicked on it. That started the Windows Update Standalone Installer which has subsequently
 been "searching for updates on this computer" for a very long time. It would be hard to articulate how very frustrating this is.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>So, in the end, I was able to answer some of my own questions. The underlying problem, whatever it was, was resolved by the Windows Update Troubleshooter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With respect to the time it takes / would have taken / to test whether in fact the problem was solved, I found it helps greatly to go to Windows Update Change Settings and Choose - How Windows Can Install Updates, and select "Check for updates but let me
 choose whether to download and install them". This ensures that at you are not stuck waiting for downloads, so will shorten the time it takes to check whether the problem is solved. It has the additional benefit that Windows Updates retains the list of updates
 proposed. It seems when you are set to update automatically and something goes wrong the list of updates is lost and you have to check for them all over again. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Hello bsaukas,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you try the below methods to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Enable line-in connection for the Microphone. To enable sound for the line-in connection:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 Audio Devices and Sound Themes by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Hardware and Sound, and then clicking Sound.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 the Playback tab, click Speakers, and then click Properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 the Levels tab, and then, under Line In, click the Mute button to enable sound for the line-in connection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also follow the below link and run the Fix-it. It will ‘Diagnose and repair problems with sound and audio’:</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Make sure that the default sound device is set correctly for the sound device that you are using. To set the default device, follow
 these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click

<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select
 the sound device that you want as the default sound device, and then click Set Default.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Internet is slow after enableing ICS.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Having issues using ICS to share my Tethered connection to my router</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok so here is the deal. &nbsp;My set up is currently Windows 7 as my main computers operating system. &nbsp;I have tethered my phone to my main computer and it works perfectly. &nbsp;Now i have enabled ICS to my computers lan port and attached a netgear n150. &nbsp;I have changed
 the WAN settings on the router to point to my LAN port for internet and it works fine all devices that connect to the router get internet. &nbsp;My issue comes after about 1-3 hours the internet gets EXTREMELY slow games will still function mostly as long as i
 connected to the server before it starts to bog down. &nbsp;but it comes to a point where i am unable to access even the simplest of web pages they will not load i get timeout errors. &nbsp;to fix this the only thing i have found to work is restarting my main computer.
 &nbsp;Disabling and enabling my LAN port does nothing restarting the router does nothing the only thing that will fix this error is restarting the computer. &nbsp;any help or advice on this issue would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Hi Michel,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response. I really appreciate your help. I tried the troubleshooter that you suggested. That did fix few of the issues in my system but not this. Still, I get the same error&nbsp;(Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703 - Error 0xc1900107)
 whenever I try to install the update.</p>
<p>Even I tried few restarts as the system suggested, unfortunately, that doesn't help. Could you suggest another solution? Thanks, Christopher.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            HP5200 w&#47;duplexer will no longer automatically duplex</h2>
                    My workhorse printer, a HP5200, has always worked effortlessly, until yesterday when my computer established a "copy" version of it in my print menu. When I try to print from a pdf file to the HP5200, I have entirely different print window now that only
 includes the option for manually 2-sided printing. When I try to reload my printer software from the CD that came with it, I keep getting a message that it can no longer "find the path."<br />
<br />
I'm not technologically sharp, but I've tried reloading the drivers from the HP site, etc., and went through the troubleshooting suggestions, but nothing works. How can I get my printer's duplexing function&nbsp; back?? and what would have caused it to disappear?
<br />
<br />
I get the impression that this is a Windows problem rather than a printer problem.<br />

    <title>Lost local network connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grangeek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost local network connection</h2>
                    I'm running Vista on a Medion laptop. After connecting to the wireless network as an official guest at a local university, my home network connection (WORKGROUP) is fried. This has happened before, but System Restore always did the trick. This time I restored
 as far back as I could go, but WORKGROUP has not been restored. (I set a Restore point when everything was working fine just before I connected at the school, but that point was corrupted and did not work when I got home.)<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>I can connect to the Internet with no problem </li><li>The wireless connection shows that I have both Internet and local connectivity, but I can only connect to this computer.
</li><li>WORKGROUP does show in Explorer, but this is the only listed machine. </li><li>There are four other computers active in WORKGROUP. </li><li>Nothing changes when I plug into the ethernet connection. </li><li>I ran the sfc/scannow command. Corrupted files were found and fixed, but that did not fix this problem.
</li><li>I am unable to remove Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6). the Uninstall button is grayed out.&nbsp;
</li><li>I did not uninstall the adapters in Device Manager, because both the wireless and ethernet are functioning the same. This is obviously a Vista problem, not a hardware problem.
</li></ul>
<br />
I went into the Security tab in Properties window for the wireless connection and discovered that the 26 character WEP security code is being reduced to 8 dots, even after I reenter it. But that would not explain why the ethernet cable won't work. It is not
 dependent on a security code. <br />
<br />
Any new ideas?

            Thank you for the detailed reponse Uma. All of the instructions are so clear and easy to follow. I did not make it all the way through, but I think I may have found the root of the problem. At the point where you suggest updating the driver, I opened PC
 Wizard to find out what device to update. PC Wizard showed that WEP is not enabled for either device -- LAN or wireless. Device manager did an online search for driver updates and indicated they are both up-to-date and functioning properly.
<br />
<br />
I did note earlier that the WEP code was not "sticking" in the properties window for the wireless card.
<br />
<br />
How do I change this to re-enable WEP? <br />
<br />
