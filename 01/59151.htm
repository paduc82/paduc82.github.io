<h2>            Windows 10 User Account Gone&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>Disaster after helping elderly relative (Call her Mary Smith) transfer from old Vista computer to new Windows 10 computer using PCMoverExpress.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>I spent several days with the transfer &amp; setup. Uninstalling the trial&nbsp;version&nbsp;of McAfee as well as D/L &amp; running McAfee removal tool. Installing the free Cox
 McAfee program.Finally had everything set (Except old mail &amp; folders failed to transfer &amp; tech support from PCMover... worthless) I had installed Mozilla Thunderbird as email client &amp; set that up just fine. (Do not like the Windows 10 mail client) All her
 folders, documents, etc. did transfer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Windows 10 set up was not user friendly &amp; never asked what do you want to name your computer, which accts. do you want to set up, do you want a&nbsp;password&nbsp;to be
 required to log in, etc. It forced you to set up a&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;acct. with PIN. I set up ‚ÄúMary Smith.‚Äù It also tried to spy on your browsing, invade privacy in a myriad of ways. Had to say no to many such attempts. Then it made one acct.: ‚ÄúMary Smith‚Äù as&nbsp;Admin!
 So, I created a 2nd Admin acct.&nbsp;&amp; went in under that &amp; deleted the 1st acct.; ‚ÄúMary Smith.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The PCMover let me transfer her QB user acct. with all her stuff from old computer to a new acct. ‚ÄúQB‚Äù under new computer &amp; transferred the old Administrator
 to my newly created Administrator acct. on new one. I then learned (not easily apparent!) how to created an acct. w/o the *@! MS acct. or giving MS email or phone # &amp; created a guest acct.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>New computer HAD 3 user accts.; Administrator, QB &amp; Guest-Test. QB is the main account with limited privileges that Mary Smith will use, I am the administrator.
 I ran a quick McAfee scan &amp; no malware found.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>I tried to set up a file sharing network between old &amp; new computers &amp; drag that old ‚ÄúWindows Mail folder‚Äù to new&nbsp;desktop&nbsp;&amp; then knowing&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;the file path,
 have Tbird import mail &amp; folders. Couldn‚Äôt do it. Did get as far as having new computer&nbsp;‚Äúsee‚Äù old computer name &amp; clicked that folder to open it but was denied access! &nbsp;I gave up &amp; put file&nbsp;sharing&nbsp;back to off on both computers. Shut down both computers to
 physically move them into final positions. (Everything was as we wanted it, except still had to transfer old mail later.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Booted up new computer &amp; to my horror, her entire user folder, QB was‚Ä¶.gone! And the deleted account ‚ÄúMary Smith‚Äù is mysteriously back from the dead! ****!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Only accounts now are; Administrator, Mary Smith &amp; Guest-Test. I logged in as Admin &amp; went to user folders &amp; did see QB folder but alas, it is EMPTY! I tried
 to log into Mary Smith acct. but the PIN I had created does not work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>I don‚Äôt see how an entire user account can be gone w/o an administrator purposely&nbsp;deleting&nbsp;it. Messing with file sharing settings should not cause this.&nbsp;And
 how can a deleted user account reappear?</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>All my days of work gone!</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Any help or suggestions appreciated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>If I re-do the transfer &amp; set up what if it happens again on 1st restart?</span></p>
<p><span>I‚Äôm really hoping someone can explain what happened &amp; how to restore the missing QB account &amp; keep this from reoccurring.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Antony,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Windows 10 was preinstalled on the new Acer computer when purchased.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Windows seems to have worked OK, since computer booted &amp; began the initial set up process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3) I set up &amp; created the 1st account ‚ÄúMary Smith Administrator‚Äù &amp; the Microsoft account under same name, with Password &amp; PIN.&nbsp; Restart &amp; sign in under that user name. I then tried &amp; failed to change the name of the account from Mary Smith to QB. Also
 unable to receive email to verify microsoft account, since we shut down her email on old computer since we were about to transfer data. I then tried to create a 2nd Administrator account but could not do so w/o also creating a Microsoft account. (BTW, I now
 know how to do just that) So, gave up &amp; began the PCMover transfer.</span></p>
<p><span>During the transfer I mapped her old QB limited account on old Vista computer to a new limited account on new computer with all her data. I also mapped my old Administrator account on old Vista computer to a new Administrator account on new computer.
 When this was done new computer had 3 accounts; Mary Smith Administrator,&nbsp; Administrator &amp; QB.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I logged in as Administrator (NOT as Mary Smith Admin) &amp; I deleted the Mary Smith Account. Now there were 2 accounts. Administrator &amp; QB. Neither associated with a Microsoft account. I then learned how to create a new limited account without a Microsoft
 account or email &amp; PW &amp; created a 3rd account.&nbsp; I called it ‚ÄúGuest-Test‚Äù since it would not accept the name ‚ÄúGuest.‚Äù Now the new computer had 3 accounts; Administrator, QB &amp; Guest-Test. QB is the main account with limited privileges that Mary Smith will use,
 I am the administrator.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then logged in as ‚ÄúQB‚Äù &amp; did many hours work from there setting up everything including Downloading &amp; setting up Mozilla Thunderbird mail.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Everything seemed to be working OK. My only remaining task was to figure out how to transfer her old email which failed to transfer using PCMoverExpress. But, she WAS getting new email.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then shut down both computers (so I could physically move the new one to the spot where the old one was, etc.) When I booted up the new computer,&nbsp; QB account was gone. Mary Smith Administrator was back on the login screen as was Administrator &amp; Guest-Test.
 I logged in as Administrator (NOT as Mary Smith Administrator) &amp; checked the Users folder &amp; saw QB was there but the folder was empty! There was no folder labeled Mary Smith (I assume bc I DID delete that account) Since Mary Smith WAS listed on the login page,
 I tried to log in as Mary Smith Administrator but, password not accepted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4) No error messages when I restarted the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, I don‚Äôt think I deleted the Mary Smith Microsoft account, just deleted the user profile associated with that account.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I will be back at Mary‚Äôs house tonight &amp; will try to click on the key option &amp; login to her Mary Smith Microsoft Account &amp; respond here when I do that.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Update: When I went back late Sunday night &amp; booted up, I was able to login again as Administrator &amp; again checked the User folder &amp; now QB folder is no longer empty! Seems to have all her data in there. But still no option to login as QB! If open
 start menu &amp; click user (Administrator) upper left the only other user options are Guest-Test &amp; Mary Smith. So, I think the QB user account is not gone just hidden! I started a Full McAfee scan. I am copying the entire QB folder to a USB Flash drive in case
 it disappears again. I am copying her Old Windows mail folder to the Administrator desktop.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If I am able to restore the QB login, I will transfer the Old Mail folder to QB desktop &amp; try to have Thunderbird mail import it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I enabled System Restore &amp; allocated 10% of the HD.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I was thinking about trying the procedure: ‚ÄúFix a Corrupted user profile‚Äù</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-corrupted-user-profile#1TC=windows-7</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I read on some help site that this will work for Windows 10 even though the instructions are for Windows 7.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, I create another user acct. call it QB2015. I think the computer is on a workgroup &amp; not on a domain. (I need to find out how to check b4 I proceed.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After creating new acct., restart.</span></p>
<p><span>Login as Admin, Enable show hidden files, folders &amp; drives. Uncheck ‚Äúhide protected operating system files.‚Äù</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Locate User folder QB</span></p>
<p><span>Copy everything except:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36px; color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)"><span>‚Ä¢<span> </span>Ntuser.dat</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36px; color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)"><span>‚Ä¢<span> </span>Ntuser.dat.log</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36px; color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)"><span>‚Ä¢<span> </span>Ntuser.ini</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I‚Äôm not sure exactly how to exclude those 3 folders.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe I copy everything from QB folder &amp; paste into new User ‚ÄúQB2015‚Äù folder &amp; then go in &amp; find those 3 files &amp; delete them?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After pasting the contents of QB into the QB2015, log off as Admin &amp; Log on as QB2015. Then import the email messages &amp; addresses from the QB acct to the QB205 acct. Not sure how to do that. I would need to know the file path to the Thunderbird email
 messages.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you think that will fix this issue? Or, do you have another solution?</span></p>
<p><span>And do you know why QB folder appears to be there but not appearing as a user choice for login?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            GTA IV on Windows 10 After Fall Creator&#39;s update.</h2>
                    I want to play GTA IV on my Dell Inspiron 15 3000 series laptop. It has 4 GB of RAM and an Internal of 1 TB. After installing and Activating GTA IV, Whenever I click on LaunchGTAIV.exe after I click on play button, A CD starts spinning and after sometime
 it does not do anything and no game is running. My friend too has the same problem. Please Help. I have updated my GTA IV to latest patch level 8. And I tried it running using Compatibility Settings. I have enabled Direct Play in Turn On or Off Programs and
 Features.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why GTA IV won't play on your PC. It is possible that the game needs an update or is not compatible with the current Windows Update versions installed on your computer. To properly isolate your concern, please clarify the following
 information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you able to play the game on the same PC before installing the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update?</li><li>Have you tried to run the game in compatibility mode?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you may <span>
run the <strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</strong> by following the steps on this

<p>As I have already mentioned that I have installed the latest patch version and have tried running it using all possible compatibility settings. Now I have updated mt Windows 10 to latest March Update. Still the issue is not rectified. I hope the creators
 will work hard to rectify the issue mentioned above.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">[EDIT:</span> Latest March update ? The cumulative update ? Nothing in that regarding games. ]
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I hope the creators will work hard to rectify the issue mentioned above."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You wish... (btw - The 'creators' catchword refers to Windows users who are supposed to get all involved and 'creative' with the 3D Paint</p>
<p>and similar stuff added to Win10 )</p>
<br />
<p>This game was released ten years ago, and even Rockstar won't have done&nbsp; anything to 'fix' it in at least eight years.</p>
<p>GTA4 always had an issue from day one with the dread <em>Games For Windows Live</em>, which was a form of&nbsp; copy protection from MS. GFWL is perhaps the most reviled DRM ever, and MS dropped it years ago. Leaving many gamers in the lurch with games that stopped
 running.</p>
<p>- Fortunately, GTA4 is one of the games that will still run, but maybe only if it was installed long ago if using the disk based version ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your title says <em>'after fall creators update'</em>, but you also say <em>'After installing and activating'...</em></p>
<p>So were you able to play the game prior to the 1709 update on the Dell Inspiron 15 3000 at some point ?</p>
<p>- I see one variant of this laptop uses Intel HD405 graphics. Is this the same graphics processor used on your laptop ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You should be able to get the game to load if you use an <em>xliveless </em>
fix. This is a hacked xlive.dll, which helps circumvent GFWL, which</p>
<p>caused problems with this game from day one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=452840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">GTAForums.com -&gt; [FAQ]How to use xliveless to load savegames</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Another problem with the disk based version is the disk installs an out of date (even when first released) version of GFWL, so you need</p>
<p>to install the most recent GFWL (Unless the 1.8 patch fixed this issue. Last patch I heard of was 1.7, which was released years ago)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download: Games for Windows Software Setup 3.5 - Microsoft Download Center - Download Details</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There was also a GFWL Marketplace client that you needed to install as well, but I believe it was shut down (with GFWL),
</p>
<p>and I no longer have a link (I still have both installed, but my Win10 is a upgrade from Win7 that dated back to 2010).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The game still runs fine on my machine with the 1709 update using my dedicated Nvidia graphics card, however</p>
<p>I can't run the game using my Intel HD4400 integrated graphics because my machine does not allocate enough system RAM to
</p>
<p>graphics when using the HD4400.</p>
<p>Even with all settings at low and the resolution set to 800x600 the game uses too much RAM for the way my system works</p>
<p>when using the HD4400 graphics.</p>
<p>The game loads easily to the setup screens, but when I load the game play there is no scenery. Only a few objects and my character,
</p>
<p>and the game crashed my machine when shutting down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your laptop will allocate 2GB of the 4GB system RAM to the Intel graphics (integrated graphics have no dedicated VRAM)
</p>
<p>your machine may run the game, but only with low settings at a low res, and will probably not run at all well when driving.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you already set up your Skype number as Caller ID? If you haven't done so, a random number will appear when you call someone from Skype.&nbsp;Caller identification using your Skype Number is available in:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>USA</li><li>UK</li><li>Chile</li><li>Denmark</li><li>Estonia</li><li>Poland</li><li>Sweden</li><li>Switzerland</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To set up caller identification using your Skype number: </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://secure.skype.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Sign in</span></a> to your account.</li><li>In the Manage features section, click<strong> Caller ID</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>select a pre-saved number</strong>.</li><li>From the bulleted list displayed, select the Skype Number that you want to use as your caller identification.</li><li>Click <strong>Save Settings</strong>. Your caller identification is now set and ready to go.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Caller identification is activated immediately for Skype Numbers.</p>

<br />
<div>A far safer way would be to do it like this:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Create a spare admin account (same as you have a spare house key).</li><li>Test it.</li><li>If successful, change the password for your normal account.</li></ol>
<div>You can recover from your predicament like so:</div>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.</li><li>Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.</li><li>Press a key when prompted to boot from the DVD.</li><li>Select "Repair PC" from the menu.</li><li>Select "Repair" when prompted.</li><li>Select System Restore when prompted.</li><li>Set Windows back to a point before you changed the password.</li><li>Create, test and document the spare admin account I mentioned above.</li></ol>

<h2>            Title bar becomes smaller, so do the buttons on the top left of the bar.</h2>
                    My title bar got some problems. Suddenly it went missing by a quarter, i think and the close, minimise, maximise and restore button become really small and do not cover the whole column of the title bar. The buttons look like they are floating at the top
 left of the title bar. Normally, those buttons should appear bigger and cover the bar. No remaining spaces left.&nbsp;Everything in my pc is working fine, including those buttons. It's just that those buttons appeared to be&nbsp;really small and annoying. It happens
 to every programme too. Picture can be provided if required. Many thanks!

    <title>Xbox One Turning On Wrong TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g3n0unknown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Turning On Wrong TV</h2>
                    
<p>So this is peculiar. I am visiting my friend for a couple days, irrelevant I think. But I left my TV at home and I hooked my Xbox to his roommates LG tv. (No idea the model). His VIZIO is right next to the LG. (My tv is also a VIZIO). When I go to turn my
 xbox one, the LG tv does not turn on. That's not the issue. The weirdness is that when I turn my Xbox One, &nbsp;the vizio next to it turns on. The vizio and Xbox One are not connected at all through any means except the same wireless network. &nbsp;Is it turning it
 on through the wireless? If so, why is that a thing? I thigh it sent HDMI signals. I mean, my tv is not hooked up to the internet at home but it still turns on when my Xbox One is connected to it. The same thing happens with smart glass too. When I turn the
 volume up, both tvs turn up. It's really strange to me.</p>

<p>The reason for this is the Xbox controls the TV's via an infrared signal emitted by the Kinect sensor. Because you have a Vizio at home, the kinect is calibrated and using the remote code for Vizio products, which makes it control the Vizio tv. You must
 go through the TV and OneGuide troubleshooting to reset the device and set it up if you use a different tv.</p>

    <title>No EMS after last update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No EMS after last update</h2>
                    Goog morning/afternoot.<br />
After last updates pack for (10th October 2012) we can't use our wages system, becose it's DOS based application (.NET version is in beta) and need EMS in NTVDM.<br />
System is written upon Advanced Relevation[AREV], and needs EMS. But after last update of WinXP, AREV reports "Out of Memory" (on all clients). PIF of application and _default.pif are changed to give 8192 KiB, but program reports 0 (zero).<br />
Has anybody some solution, or is possible report bug in update?<br />
Best regards, thanks for answers<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Window Color Change</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to change the global&nbsp;Window and Message Box&nbsp;color from white default&nbsp;to light grey in Windows 10 in order to reduce strain. Responses posted on the same question to date have&nbsp;not properly addressed this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In previous Window versions (i.e. Win 7 Pro), this was done simply by accessing Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Personalization &gt; Window Color and then choosing a desired color for the "Window" item on the popup window. Windows 10 appears
 to have a more reduced personalization menu that only allows the user to change Windows Borders and Taskbar color in the same path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could somebody from Windows please advise&nbsp;how to show Window and Message&nbsp;Text on a non-white background (there is always a way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>financier90&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have the same issue as Financier90 and do not believe any of the links provide the appropriate answer. &nbsp;I am not looking to change the color of the taskbar, the window title bar, or the window border. &nbsp;Specifically, I want to change the Active Window color
 like you could in Windows 7 (per photo below showing yellow). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This option in Window 7 would cause all the Microsoft Office Programs as well as Internet Explorer to default to a yellow background (much easier on the eyes than white). &nbsp;It appears that Microsoft has taken away an easy way to get to this option. &nbsp;Can you
 provide any method to do this?</p>

<p>To all the other meaningful helpers that are missing the mark, we are not referring to the borders, bars or desktop backgrounds, etc. We have already looked through all those options trying to find a way to edit window background colors.</p>

<p>I have the same issue as Financier90 and do not believe any of the links provide the appropriate answer. &nbsp;I am not looking to change the color of the taskbar, the window title bar, or the window border. &nbsp;Specifically, I want to change the Active Window color
 like you could in Windows 7 (per photo below showing yellow). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This option in Window 7 would cause all the Microsoft Office Programs as well as Internet Explorer to default to a yellow background (much easier on the eyes than white). &nbsp;It appears that Microsoft has taken away an easy way to get to this option. &nbsp;Can you
 provide any method to do this?</p>

<p>Change the registry setting.. its the only way! They removed this option in Windows 10</p>
<p>Change the RGB value and then log out and back in again.</p>

            <p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>This problem occurs because the Chkdsk utility may not find references to all the security IDs if the master file table is larger than 4 gigabytes (GB) or if there are more than 4,194,303 files on the volume. Therefore,
 the undiscovered security descriptors are reset.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>You will need to update the computer to the latest Windows updates.
</font></font></span><span><font color="#000000"><font>Chkdsk requires exclusive access to a volume when it runs. Therefore, if one or more of the files are open on the disk that you want to check, Chkdsk displays a prompt asking if you want schedule the disk

            <p>Hi Ganesh</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply however my computer is fully updated with all windows updates except 1</p>
<p>which is Intel&nbsp; other hardware -intel management engine interface which fails to install
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer manufacturer says this update was already installed when they fitted a new hard drive to my computer and to disregard this update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have run chkdsk&nbsp; with automatically fix file system errors and scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors-(-approx. 2 hour scan steps 1 to 5)&nbsp; but still have original fault unused security descriptors</p>
<p>file 0x9 when running chkdsk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>all drivers up to date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsft support lists this fault to windows xp but I cannot find any info regarding this fault to windows 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any connection to the Intel update above? Or is this something that can be ignored?</p>
<p>I would appreciate any comments you may have</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<h2>            My Notifications Are Delayed.</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know what's going on, but I've been having this issue since I got the console in December of 2013. &nbsp;It seems all notifications sent to me rarely get to me right away and when they do it can be any where from 10 seconds to 15 minutes later. I've tried
 hard resetting many times and it never seems to work. I'm guessing &nbsp;my connection may have something to do with it, but I'm really not sure. I average around 80 ping so could that be the problem? Is anyone else experiencing this?&nbsp;</p>

<br />You can perform a cold boot by holding down the power button until the machine is powered off.
<br />
<br />Keep your USB Install media connected, power on the system then configure your computer to boot from the USB media then perform the custom install:

<h3> happysahm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Block Microsoft Store COMPLETELY&#63; How&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there not a way to block access to the Microsoft Store completely? &nbsp;My reason is I have a child and his account had purchases blocked and the account is set for age 13 which blocks rated R movies basically. &nbsp;However, he still can get on the store and search inappropriate movies and even watch the previews to rated R movies. &nbsp;He can not buy them but still can view them. I also put a pass key on his account to block all content while he is signed out and he needs me to sign him in but even signed out he still has access to the store. &nbsp;I just want the store to be blocked. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            building a new PC, but want to keep the same hard drive and windows install as from old PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I currently have a copy of windows 8.1 installed on my desktop (upgraded from windows 7). I am giving away this computer without the HDD and want to build a new PC with the same hard drive and windows install/license as from the old one.
 How can I transfer the old windows install/license to this new PC?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I've got some old PHP files from Microsoft Home Publishing 2000.&nbsp; What current Microsoft products can read these files?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>If they are saved with just the extension .php then I would see no reason why the current version of Office Word wouldnt be able to read them.&nbsp; You should even be able to just open them with NotePad or WordPad.&nbsp; I have looked at old files like that with
 such applications with no issues.</p>
