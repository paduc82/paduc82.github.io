<h2>            How to get desktop to show signal strength&#63;</h2>
                    I am connected to internet with excellent signal strength. My desktop is showing no bars at all. There are no symbols around the gray out signal bars. How do I get the desktop to show the signal strength?

            When you click on the the wireless bars in the Taskbar Notification area, what signal strength does it show in the window that pops up?&nbsp; Just suggesting you look at that in case you aren't aware that Windows 7 doesn't display color in the icon on the taskbar
 (e.g., 5 green bars - full strength - in the window should show as 5 plain white bars in the taskbar) and some have interpreted that as no bars.<br />

    <title>Power Up Problems, Fast Startup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Power Up Problems, Fast Startup</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Windows 10 pro 1803 17134.228, Surface Book 2 15"</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Ever since the August 2018 Updates (including the Firmware Updates for SB2) my SB2 oly powers on after extensively Pressing the power button. Sometimes, more than 30 seconds of pressure are necessary until the SB 2 starts up, the equivalent of a full Reboot
 (2 Button).</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The problem is consistently and significantly less acute if Windows Fast Startup is switched off. With this measure, the SB 2 only needs the usual 2 - 3 seconds to power on. Of course, the Computer starts up significantly more slowly.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I had modified Fast Startup by setting hiberfil.sys to "reduced" (the necessary size for Fast Startup). This will save more than three GB provided you do not need "Hibernate" which I do not.</p>
<p>Method: powercfg /Hibernate /Type reduced bzw. full.</p>
<p>This Modification has no effect on the power up behaviour of the SB 2, I tested both variants fully.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Workaround: Switch off Fast Startup if you have power on problems.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>It is interesting to note that Fast Startup has already been cause of significant problems with SB 1 (early 2016), it caused problems with Windows Hello as well as with the loading routine for drivers at Startup.</div>

<p>Well I called Microsoft and told them the issue I had which was that my Microsoft Points where spent on this Harry Potter DH2 game which isn't in the marketplace. Obviously an error. Anyway they told me they would lock my account until the investigation
 is over. How long does the investigation last? And when they said lock what did they mean by that? I can still play online.</p>

<p>Lock (at least used to) means that you won't be able to connect to xbox live, until the investigation is over, as far as long it takes it always varies, i would say most likely around 48 hours though.</p>

<h2>            So they fixed the dGPU disappearing, but I still can&#39;t get my Nvidia Card to work</h2>
                    <p>I was just wondering if anyone else has this issue ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>let me start and say I have the 15" i7 256 16BG ram GTX 1060, I just got it a month ago, and so far I'm not impressed.. I got it to use Lightroom and premiere and do "creative" stuff with it, but it all seems to run on the integrated 620 card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the 8/1 update to the SB2 the disappearing GPU seems to have been solved, though I myself only owning the SB2 for a 4-6 weeks never really had that issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main issue is I've never seen the Nvidia card run, after the 8/1 update I set chrome to run on the Nvidia card in both Nvidia control panel and the windows one, and started a movie on Amazon.com then opened up Lightroom&nbsp; and premiere, after about 10 mins
 with each new program before opening another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 620 and the Nvidia both show their running but the Nvidia&nbsp; and 620 are mirroring the usage stat % but when you go look at the Nvidia&nbsp; graphs it's&nbsp; like a blip for a second... the computer runs to a crawl because the 620 is doing all the work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if I make it so they all run on the 620 its actually faster... So it seems like the programs or system are trying to work but not ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this thing need to be connected to an external monitor to use the dGPU ? or am I totally alone here ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm all updated and running all current to the time of this posting drivers win updates etc..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even uninstalled all the nvidia drivers and experience center etc from nvidia, and rolled back the driver to the just released ver. they put out on 8/1
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help&nbsp;<br />

            Hello nullc0de.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for informing us. For us to understand the issue better, we would like to know if there are any error messages/codes prompts on the screen immediately? How about in Device Manager? Have you tried to detach then reattach the clipboard? Were there any
 differences?<br />
<br />
To help solve this issue, we suggest that you check these solutions:<br />
<br />
Method 1: Use the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You can download and run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>. It is a self healing
 tool which looks for potential issues and fixes them, as well as ensures your device is completely up to date. To tool takes about 10-15 mins. to run.<br />
<br />
Method 2: Perform a force shutdown/restart of your Surface. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If the first step did not work, you can click this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036280/surface-force-a-shut-down-and-restart-your-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to get started. This process will

</p><p>Surface diagnostic = Fine. I've been doing all that generic stuff you posted for the 6 weeks I have owned this laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had a "vanishing GPU" error. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is a screenshot attached where I have chrome open watching a amazon video, outlook 365, and resource monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome is set to run on the NVIDIA GFX Card...&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can't even watch streaming video... I bought this Surface book 2 because it was touted as a "you can replace your desktop and create amazing things on this device" IMHO the surface pro 3 is better..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed the latest Nvidia Drivers and Nvidia Game ready = nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled the above and reset the drivers for the 8/1 update to "fix the disappearing GPU" and updated to the new "fixed" drivers from MSFT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FFS give all SB2 owners proper power supplies, and fix this crap. From what I can tell the SB2 has had issues since day 1.&nbsp; I really should have a) done a little more research (though I figured I own a surface pro 1, 2,3,4 and a surface laptop and they all
 work) Which is why I moved from Apple Long long ago, because MSFT was finally making their own proper windows gear and I loved it.&nbsp; Now it seems like your turning into a worse version of apple..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my old trusty Ubuntu never lets me down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean look at the screen capture, he CPU is running @ .4ghz the 620 GPU is @ 100% with 1 tab open in chrome watching Netflix and outlook just idling.. nothing else was running, I disabled all the other things that start up like adobe creative cloud etc...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to kick it off the GPU that I set in both nvidia control panel and windows control panel to use the Nvidia card and then launched chrome with "run with high performance Nvidia" and the dGPU is doing nothing..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated in my first post, it either does nothing, or both cards "mirror" each other So if I tell everyting to run on the NVIDIA in control panel the NVIDIA will show 23% and the 620 will show 23% but you can look at the graphs and see that the NVIDIA
 is doing nothing... &nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the update. We apologize for the delayed response. We would like to know if you're still having issues with the dGPU of your Surface Book 2. Were you able to check for new updates? If you haven't, there's a new driver and firmware update that
 was published on 08/16/2018. You can start downloading the .MSI file <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
As for the right file to download, this may depend on the current OS Build and version of your Windows 10. To do this, type
<em><strong>'winver'</strong></em> on the <strong>Search</strong> bar/<strong>Cortana</strong>, then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>. This will show the Windows build and version installed on your Surface. You can check this file format:
<em>[SurfaceModel]_[WindowsVersion]_[MinimumBuildRequirement or current OS Build]_[DriverReleaseNumber]_[UploadNumber].[Extension]</em>.<br />
<br />
Keep us updated on the outcome.

            <p>Have you installed the Dell Quickset application? If you can give the full model number of the Dell I can advise specifically which one (There are many variants of the Inspiron 15R).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also think it's unlikely that the inability to change display brightness is impacting your system performance and thus temperature. Have you performed a clean install of Windows 10? Could it be malware? I'd recommend shutting the system down and allowing
 it to cool, boot Windows into Safe Mode and let it run there and check if temperature/performance issue remains.</p>

<h2>            Java Installation Downloads Corrupt .MSI</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install the latest Java and I keep running into the same problems. &nbsp;The .msi file is corrupt. &nbsp;If I download the file manually I get a 1603 error which suggests all of the same fixes as the corrupt file. &nbsp;I have researched this several times
 and have tried all of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Run SFC/SCANNOW - this produces no errors</p>
<p>2) Disable antivirus - I don't have anti-virus and have even disabled windows defender</p>
<p>3)Download the manual file - Did this an got a different error (Error 1603) which led to several other fixes but those did not work</p>
<p>4) Update all drivers - Drivers are all updated</p>
<p>5) Check RAM - Ran Windows Memory Diagnostics with no errors found</p>
<p>6) Check RAM - Check both sticks of RAM individually to see if one or the other was the problem. &nbsp;No errors</p>
<p>7) Checked Windows Registry with CCleaner - No Errors found</p>
<p>8) Downloaded the file using Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge. &nbsp;All files were corrupt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not quite sure where to go from here. &nbsp;Is this an Oracle problem or a Windows 10 problem?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Restart Requests Never Stop</h2>
                    <p>I have a asus x202e running windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer notifies me that I have to restart when I turn it on after a restart. The loop is neverending. It has been continually prompting to restart and I have let it restart close to 25-30 times over the past 2 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Update menu says that updates are available and that a restart will be required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the info the system provides about the update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Upgrade to Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system tells me that it wants to restart, I let it restart - the windows screen turn a dark shade of yellow - i see no percentages or anything indicating that an installation happened. The computer restarts - same yellow screen back to the normal login
 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i log in - i'm served a notification indicating that windows 10 needs to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My update history shows me that there have been several updates made to&nbsp;KB2267602 over the past months. Most recent were&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>My wife changed it to manual after the computer restarted a couple times and the computer did not like that. Changing it back made everything ok.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This did not solve the underlying problem that "notify" users may have (which would really suck if updates cause critical software compatibility issues), but it made my wife's computer usable again.</p>

<h2>            Do Windows 7 32-bit and 64-bit use the same product key&#63; Am I able to install 64-bit over the 32-bit with the same product key&#63;</h2>
                    I have Win 7 Professional 32bit which I bought from Software 4 Students(UK). I have the option to download the 64bit version. As I now have more than 3gb of RAM in my PC I would like to install the 64bit version. Will it install over the 32bit (ie as an
 upgrade)and accept the same Product Key?

            You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications. <br />
<br />
32 vs 64 bit<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions
<br />
<br />
Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7<br />
<br />
Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32
 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.<br />
<br />
As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.<br />
<br />
There are no key advantages, but there is nothing preventing you from running it either, also, your system won't slow down. I see many systems come preloaded from DELL, HP, LENOVO, ACER, with 3 GBs of RAM and Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.<br />

<h2>            How to change resolution setting for a particular program</h2>
                    I have installed EA Sports Cricket 2011 game which requires 1024 x 768 resolution. Whereas my screen has got 1366 x 768.
<div>Thus my game isn't occupying the whole screen. How should I solve this..</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to set some higher resolution in the game display settings but 1024 x 768 is last one. How should I deal this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A step by step solution would be much appreciated.</div>

            The problem is with the game which doesn't support 1366x768 resolution. The only way is to play it in 1024x768.

    <title>Prevent Windows 10 from restarting, disabling Defender and Automatic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justice88c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Prevent Windows 10 from restarting, disabling Defender and Automatic Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 Enterprise on my laptop. I have 3 issues with it:</p>
<p>1.I do NOT want my computer to download any updates without my consent. I don't want my connection to slow down because of updates, I don't want it to restart in the middle of the day to install updates and I definitely don't want to wait half an hour for
 my computer to install updates instead of just shutting down.</p>
<p>2.I do NOT want my computer to shut down/restart unless I click on the shutdown button.</p>
<p>3.I do NOT want Windows Defender, Smart Screen or any other virus protection program running on my PC.</p>
<p>4.I want direct instructions on how to do these 3 things. I do NOT want to be told that I should not stop Defender, I know how to recognize a virus myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>This is one of the most hilarious posts I have ever read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start, if you are so smart and can detect a virus on your system (LMAO), then why would you need simple help on how to change Windows Update settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then if you run a computer with no anti virus, then your system will tell you when you have a virus when it crashes (LMAO).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not stop windows from updating in Windows 10. You can set the times and dates to update and select to restart yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you are the expert that can find the Virus on your system (LMAO) but can not figure out easy Windows Update and smart screen filter settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TOO HILARIOUS!</p>

<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I was able to get to advanced recovery with the multiple on/off method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restore did not help as the only listed restore point was from earlier this am, after the "fresh start."</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I then did a Reset.&nbsp; I had backed up all files prior to the "fresh start" so I did not loose anything by resetting.&nbsp; The computer seems to be running fine now.&nbsp; Because resetting erased all user data, log in and password info was re-entered during
 set up.&nbsp; I restarted and it accepted the password with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Hello Andre,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, <strong>thank U thank U thank U </strong>for the above help. I did a Win 10 fresh start and I had the SAME issue as James did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily for me your power on, power off trick worked and I did not have to go through all the other recovery steps. Data is still there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had scoured the web and YOU were the only &nbsp;one who knew.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>OK, SO HERES THE ASK—</p>
<p>Do you know of anywhere on the web that I can find a GOOD list of what to reinstall
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">in what order</span></strong> after a fresh start is done?!? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I &nbsp;have all internet and usb devices disconnected to avoid messing up my clean system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything I research just randomly lists all the things I should re-load. &nbsp;But I’m not in I T guy.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>1). &nbsp; Internet.</p>
<p>2). &nbsp; ALL Microsoft updates;</p>
<p>3). &nbsp; removed apps list on my desk top, half of which I don’t know what are or if they are important or bloatware. I guess i’ll look these up individully and hope. &nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft visual C ++ looks a little scary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4). &nbsp; antivirus— shouldn’t this be immediately after internet?&nbsp;</p>
<p>******FYI - Norton Security Suite regular and the included Norton Security Suite for Comcast customers are NOT the same product. This is what led to all my windows problems.... &nbsp;I’m taking suggestions on a good free replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5). &nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Before</span> I add anything, should windows run a diagnostic to confirm fresh start /OS ok?</p>
<p>6). &nbsp; Etc, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m really confused. &nbsp;Help!! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>few minutes ago I added a second e-mail address to my microsoft account which I now set as primary address. I don't have any problems signing in with the new address but when I start a game on my xbox one it says "we couldn't get your latest saved data".
 How can I fix this?</p>

<p>Hey Manu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. Try clearing the local save games on your console. This will remove the current save data that is local and re-download it from the cloud as long as you have Xbox Live Gold.</p>
<p>

<li>Enter <strong>Settings</strong> for the Xbox One</li><li>Choose<strong> System</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Storage</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Clear local saved games</strong></li><li>Confirm and allow the console to restart</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how this goes, thanks again!</p>

<br />
I followed the help instructions and installed the "System Update Readiness Tool" but that did not fix the problem.<br />
<br />
I installed Microsoft Fix it and that did not fix the problem.<br />

Has anyone else had this problem and were you able to resolve it?<br />

                    <p>I was having some issues with the app store after the TH2 update and decided to reset (Removing everything), well it fixed the issue but now I couldn't open any of the default apps. Someone suggested this powershell command:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><code>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</code></p>

<h2>            xbox.com sign in issues</h2>
                    <p>I can't click the sign in button, even when i somehow managed to sign in, I click on the settings button on the profile, it just brings me to the support page to change your child's xbox privacy settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026796/microsoft-account-change-childs-xbox-privacy-online-safety-settings<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on xbox setting link, it brings me back to the same page linked above</p>
<p>
</p><p>This website is so garbage, I expected better from a multi million dollar company and not a garbage website that you can't even sign in to</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to change the parental control settings, but i can't because I can't even access the settings page, this account was created days ago without me changing any settings, but somehow, it has parental control when I play forza horizon 4</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I tried on both my windows 10 PC and android phone but has the same issues, I have also rebooted my PC</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks or reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. Sorry to hear you're having difficulty in changing the privacy settings on your account.
<span>You'll also need to make those setting changes to your account from the parent account associated with yours.
</span>You may also want to check out the support article entitled&nbsp;<a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/xbox-one-privacy-and-online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One online safety and privacy settings for parents and children</a> for assistance/instruction
 on how to make those changes since the other link isn't working for you. Be sure to clear the cache/cookies from your browser, try a different web browser or device if you're experiencing difficulties with any web pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out and please let us know the results!</p>

<h2>            I can hear Microphone, and realtek soundcheck sounds but nothing else </h2>
                    I can plug a mic. in and listen to myself talk through the speakers (though not very intertaining)&nbsp;or use the realtek sound check (test audio left to right channels)&nbsp;but I cannot hear sound from websites like youtube, or anyother audio playing sites. I
 have installed all drivers manually no errors that i could see, I have a d915gag mainboard. Please help I have spent hours troubleshooting to no avail. thanks

<p>YouTube and other sites use a flash player. Make sure that the sound on the player, when it pops up, is not muted.</p>
<p>Idem if, when you visit a different site, WMP pops up.</p>
<p>Both have volume controls independant of your main sound device volume control.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>I certainly have checked the players volumes, and every volume control i could find myself and with windows assistance. I am still stumped! thank you for the help though</p>

<p>For web work etc, make sure your sound device is selected as the default option.</p>
