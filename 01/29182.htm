<h2>            system and compressed memory high CPU usage</h2>
                    <p>So lately i've been having problems with a process called "system and compressed memory". It uses over 1gb of ram, which is unacceptable. I found out on the interned that many people were able to end the process by turning off "superfetch" in Services.msc.</p>
<p>The problem is that i don't have "Superfetch" in Services and i can't disable it. Also, does anyone have an idea when Microsoft might give a simpler option to remove their "helpfull" service (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>system
 and compressed memory), or maybe you can help me by giving me an altrenative way to stop the process? Thanks for your help in advance.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Do you have any third party security software installed in the computer?</p>
<p>2. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>3. Did you have numerous&nbsp;programs and windows opened when you noticed the high memory usage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The memory usage depends on&nbsp;the number of programs running in the system. Moreover, High CPU usage occurs for various reasons, for example: virus/malware infections, out-of-date drivers, anti-virus programs or other third-party programs, etc;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: System maintenance troubleshooter </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with system. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter by following the steps given below&nbsp;and &nbsp;check if it helps.</span></p>

            <p>Ok so first of all i'd like to apologise for the late reply. Now let's anwser your questions:</p>
<p>1: no i'm pretty sure i don't have any extra anti virus installed other than windows defender.</p>
<p>2: No, the problem came with am update for windows 10, i didn't change anything.</p>
<p>3: it doesn't really mattter how much i have opened, the usage is allways at least 500mb of ram, even at startup. The problem just zet worse with time.</p>
<p>Now over to the methods:</p>
<p>1: i ran the system maintainance, it didn't detect anything</p>
<p>2: i tried clean booting it helped a bit, but the usage still got higher and higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, i noticed u changed the title to system and compressed memory high cpu usage. I was worried more about the ram usage, because it really doesn't use much cpu.</p>
<p>

            I was having the same trouble with "system and compressed memory" using up lots of memory. I've been trying to troubleshoot it for a few months. Tonight I did the sfc /scannow command, it found a few problems and fixed them. After rebooting and working
 for a few hours, it's only using .1MB of memory. I've opened and used lots of different programs (including browsers, video editing software, etc.) and it's still sitting there at .1MB of memory in the task manager.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this was just a quirk on my system or if it will work for others.

            I had this problem on a Lenovo X1 Carbon. Here's how I solved it. I used Process Explorer (downloaded from the Web) to determine the thread under the System and Compressed Memory process that was taking up the CPU. It was the RICOH SD/MMC Driver (risdxc64.sys)
 which I believe I installed from the Lenovo web site. I uninstalled this driver from Device Manager, rescanned for new hardware, then updated the driver for the newly found hardware (using Search&nbsp;automatically for updated driver software). As soon as I uninstalled
 the Ricoh driver, the problem went away.

            <p>On my clean install of Windows 10 (installed about 10 days ago) on a new, blank, SSD, the System and Compressed Memory Process uses approximately 37% -42% of the CPU when I simply start up my computer without even opening up any programs. This process continues
 to use a high % of the CPU regardless of how I am using the computer -- so the fan is always on full tilt. &nbsp;I am concerned that my laptop will be burned out in no time by Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent countless hours reading numerous web pages where many people describe similar problems they have been having with the System and Compressed Memory Process -- for months. &nbsp; Most of the suggestions for solutions I read are very vague generic troubleshooting
 routines. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have not yet found a solution to this problem, I would appreciate any help I can receive in solving it before my computer dies from exhaustion. I think the simplest and clearest way I can define the current status of my troubleshooting efforts is
 to state the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot my laptop in Safe Mode, the problem does not occur. &nbsp;However, when I disable all the "Startup items"(using Task Manager) and disable all non-Microsoft "Services" (using MSConfig) and boot up, the problem does occur. &nbsp;So my current focus is on
 trying to figure out: what is the difference between the two boot modes I just described above? &nbsp;I assume the answer to that question might really narrow down the possible causes of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I temporarily uninstalled my antivirus program to be able to truly disable all services. &nbsp;It didn't help. &nbsp;My laptop is an HP (Hewlett-Packard) DV4 with an Intel i5 processor, was produced about January 2010 and came with Windows 7 Home Premium . &nbsp;It has
 8Gb RAM. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the only programs I have installed after the clean install of Windows 10 are Google Chrome, Linkman, Sticky Password, Samsung Magician (for the Samsung SSD), &nbsp;MalwareBytes AntiMalware, Microsoft Office 2010 Pro and Avira Antivirus (which is currently
 uninstalled). &nbsp;However, I believe the problem I &nbsp;described above was present before I installed any of these programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help you can provide. &nbsp;But after all the headaches I and so many others have gone through already with this problem, I feel the need to say the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It amazes me that, with so many people suffering through this problem for months, that Microsoft apparently has neither provided a solution or an explanation of the problem or even acknowledged the specific problem. &nbsp;Sending us poor customers off on wild
 goose chases via vague generic troubleshooting routines -- instead of acknowledging the problem and clearly publishing the best direct solutions to the problem -- comes across as a serious lack of respect for their customers.</p>

            <p>After many more hours of troubleshooting, I was able to determine the offending driver and then fumbled around some more trying to figure out how to get the system to begrudgingly allow me to replace the newer (offending) driver with an older driver that
 worked before when I was running Windows 7 on this laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By replacing the Windows-10-installed driver with my old driver, I was able to get the CPU usage by the&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System and Compressed Memory
 Process from a constant ~40% CPU usage down to 0.1% usage. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this was not actually a true solution -- it just created another problem. &nbsp;Now, my media card reader (e.g., for SD cards for cameras) will not work.</span></span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks to&nbsp;</span>OSosyacoub's post (above) and similar posts on other web sites, I used

Process Explorer</a>&nbsp;to find a specific thread (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">rtspstor.sys</span>) that was using 25% of the CPU along with a related thread that was also using some more
 of the CPU time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just ran Process Explorer from a link on the web site without installing it and couldn't access the help file so I really didn't know what I was doing. &nbsp;But after staring at the program interface a while, I found a listing for the "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System
 and Compressed Memory Process", right-clicked on it, and selected "Properties" in the pop-up menu. Then, if necessary, select the "Threads" tab. &nbsp;At this point, I was able to see a specific thread, "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">rtspstor.sys</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">",&nbsp;</span>that
 was using 25% of the CPU (sort the thread list by "CPU usage" if necessary to see the thread with the highest usage).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that it appeared &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">rtspstor.sys was a big part of the problem, I Googled it, of course, and found this text about this driver file: "</span>This
 files most often belongs to product Realtek Pcie CardReader Driver for 2K/XP/Vista/Win7. and were most often developed by company Realtek Semiconductor Corp..&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">".
 &nbsp;Next, I went into Device Manager on my laptop, disabled the&nbsp;</span>Realtek PCIE CardReader driver (under "Memory Technology Devices"), and sure enough, the CPU usage of&nbsp;the "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System
 and Compressed Memory Process" dropped down from around 40% to more or less zero. &nbsp;That confirmed that this driver was indeed the problem.</span></p>
<p>Next, I created a system restore point and read this helpful article:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">
How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</a>. &nbsp;But&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I still had trouble because updating the driver did nothing but tell
 me I had the most recent driver already. And I wasn't sure what would happen if I uninstalled the driver. &nbsp; So I felt I had to try uninstalling it -- and then the entry for the
</span>Realtek PCIE CardReader disappeared! So now how was I going to even access it to fix it? I eventually found a command for searching for hardware changes on the Device Manager menu and it re-installed the nasty Windows 10 drivers and the high CPU usage
 came back right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So finally, I gambled by going onto my old Windows 7 system hard drive (connected via USB) and ran the setup.exe file in the folder with a year 2010 version of&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">rtspstor.sys</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">".
 &nbsp;It did successfully install the version of&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">rtspstor.sys</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"
 that worked under Windows 7 over the current version. &nbsp;The&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;CPU usage went back down near zero right away. &nbsp;But, unfortunately, the memory card reader does not work with that driver in Windows 10. (I'll try some more restarts later just in case it might
 eventually work.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand it can be risky to manually install drivers from web sites but the only other option I know of now would be to try installing a
<a href="http://www.realtek.com/Downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=15&amp;PFid=25&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
driver from RealTech's web site</a>&nbsp;( version = V10.0.370.125 ; date &nbsp;=&nbsp;2016/2/24)&nbsp;I found with a higher version date than either of the two I tried. I don't know how I can be sure it is actually the correct driver for this specific item on my laptop or what
 might happen if it isn't and I attempt to install it. The driver version that came from my clean install of Windows 10 about 10 days to 2 weeks ago was 6.3.9600.28156 &nbsp;and the version that worked in Windows 7 was 6.1.7600.63 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope these details might help someone and that someone might be able to help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to share a couple of additional things with anyone who hasn't yet spent many days researching and trouble shooting the&nbsp;"<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>System
 and Compressed Memory Process" problem. &nbsp;Many people are struggling with this problem and although some have found solutions, the few solutions I have seen have varied quite a bit depending on what particular thing or things are causing the problem on&nbsp;their&nbsp;specific,
 possibly unique, computer configuration. &nbsp;(Problems with drivers conflicting with Windows 10 does seem to be one of the more common problems identified in the end by users).
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I&nbsp;have also seen a variety of relatively general but different troubleshooting techniques suggested by different Microsoft representatives
 for essentially the same "symptoms". &nbsp;So I can only assume that either Microsoft doesn't have a clue what the commonality is among the problems causing the "</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System
 and Compressed Memory Process" issues, or they must not be sharing the information with their technical support people. &nbsp;In either case,
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">it is extremely frustrating for us, the customers, and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I

            Hello, <br />
<br />
It's possible that the reason why the window prompt for User Account Control won't show is most probably due to the initial configuration you've done on the system. A possible scenario would be, the system applying the changes made, but showing no confirmation
 of the process, resulting in the missing window prompt the second time you try to configure. In other words, the system didn't refresh.<br />
<br />
<strong>Restart </strong>your computer then check if issue persists.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't do the trick, run the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello jmarhoon,</p>
<p>There is not a registry key with the default of: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINES32\ that I can find.<br />
<br />
I suggest you delete the current download of iTunes. Then reboot. Next, download iTunes from the following location:<br />
<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/</a>&nbsp;The latest version is iTunes: 10.1.2.</p>
<p>Now see if you still get the same error when trying to install iTunes. <br />
Please reply back with an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 reactivate on same computer after reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 reactivate on same computer after reinstall</h2>
                    <p>Will I need to reactivate Windows 8.1 by phone if I reinstall Windows 8.1?&nbsp; How long is the waiting period between reactivations to avoid having the key blocked with a 0cx004c008 error?&nbsp; I have already purchased a Windows 8.1 full version from Best Buy.&nbsp;
 I used to have the Windows 8 System Builder Edition but have gotten a 0xc004c008 due to too many reactivations on the same computer after reinstallation after diskpart cleaning the disk.&nbsp; If I do a repair install by doing an upgrade from an existing version
 of Windows 8.1 from DVD will this upgrade trigger a reactivation?</p>

<h3> tjskater  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t standard user print over network&#63;</h2>
                    <p>- Computers A and B are networked wirelessly via Linksys router.</p>
<p>- An HP printer, set to share, is attached to Computer A via USB</p>
<p>- Both computers are running XP SP3</p>
<p>- All users on both computers can access the Internet.</p>
<p>- All users on Computer A can print</p>
<p>- But only administrators on Computer B can print. Why???!</p>
<p>This is a maddening problem - I've spent hours trying to figure out how to give printing capability to the standard user on computer B.
<strong>But he can only print over the network&nbsp;if I make him an administrator. </strong>
</p>
<p>If I keep him a standard user, he can see the printer. His printer status shows as ready. If he sends a print job, it goes into the queue, it&nbsp;shows as printing, then it&nbsp;disappears into the void.
</p>
<p>Already tried&nbsp;rerunning the Networking Wizard on both computers. Printer and file sharing are enabled. Nothing works.&nbsp;No one on Computer B can print unless I make him&nbsp;an administrator. Then there is no problem. Please help!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try configure security settings for printer on Computer A. Click on Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Printer and Faxes -&gt; Right click your printer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Security -&gt; Check for the appropriate permission for everyone .. You can also add the user id of other
 computer (Computer B) and provide access rights on printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Making my &#34;New Volume E&#58;&#34; my main memory storage unit</h2>
                    I have&nbsp;a 40 GB memory unit that has all the mandatory programs on it for my computer. Then I have a 900GB storage unit as well. The smaller devise is now full and everything keeps trying to download and install on to that storage devise. I would like to
 switch it so that my 900GB devise is the default storage unit and everything from now on will now download to that unit and do not know how to do that. Any ideas or suggestions? anything helps. thanks

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that your console is experiencing this issue. I'd be happy to try and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First let's clear some data cache and reset the power unit. Do you have an Xbox One or a One S or One X?</p>
<p>Follow this guide to help you with the hard reset and power cycle: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
<p>
</p><p>Make sure to leave the unit unplugged for at least 5 minutes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help then the operating system will need to be reset to factory defaults, but you can keep your games and apps installed. Make sure you have your account login information available because you will need to re-add it during the set up. Follow
 this guide to lead you through the process: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults">

                    hello, i am trying to add something to a file but when i try to save a change, it states that the file cannot be created and that I should check the path and file name. it seemed to be a permission problem so i am in the original administrator account
 (the one you have to activate) and i changed the security properties of the file so that I would be the owner and would have full control of it, but it still won't let me make changes to it. i tried deleting the file as well but it states that I need permission
 to do it. how can i solve this problem?

Try turning off user account control temporarily while you make the changes you need to make:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety (or clicking User Accounts, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking User Accounts.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Click Turn User Account Control on or off.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp; Select the Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer check box to turn on UAC, or clear the check box to turn off UAC, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            Hi markallaire 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Apps - Default Apps
<br />
<br />At the top are the main File Associations
<br />
<br />Under those options you will also have the 3 options pictured below:

            Hi Mark
<br />
<br />a Quicker way to do this would be:
<br />
<br />Locate the program you want to set to open shp files and note down its location
<br />
<br />Right click any shp file and choose 'Open With' - Choose Another App
<br />
<br />Important - Check the box marked 'Always use this app to open shp . . .'
<br />
<br />If the app you want to use is not in the list, scroll to the bottom and click 'More Apps'
<br />
<br />Again if the app is not in the list, at the bottom, click 'Look for another app on this PC', then navigate to find the application you noted down the location of earlier

 like 2 or 3 days and sometimes bsod happens after every 1 and a half hour (when it comes to playing GTA V and talking to my friends using teamspeak maybe there's something wrong on RAM&nbsp; or something) idk why but it started to happen as soon as i upgraded my
 pc specs, If you want to know my specs here:</p>

</p><p>CPU: Intel core i7 4770k</p>
<p>Graphic Card: NVIDIA GeForce HTX 770</p>

            Well then problem is that my computer was built from scratch not premade so it is most likely that my copy of windows is not genuine<br />
<p>
</p><p>But to be sure I'm gonna ask some questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>First when it comes to installing windows 7 with a cd and make it genuine does it require a format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And second if I change from windows 7 to windows 8.1 by using a cd and also make it genuine does it requires a format too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know some of these questions are stupid and kinda hard to understand since English is not my mother language but to tell you the truth i never got to have one of these discs.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update - unable to connect to internet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update - unable to connect to internet</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 just completed an auto update onto my HP Envy laptop and now I cannot sign onto the internet.&nbsp; I was on the laptop and the internet when the update message appeared and performed the update.&nbsp; Within a minute of the updates completion the internet
 site I was on disappeared and the site showed a message that I was not connected and now I continually receive this message whenever I attempt to connect to the interne.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;when I use my other laptop which has&nbsp;Windows 7, I have no problem connecting.&nbsp;
 Is there a fix for this problem and if so will this problem whenever I get the Windows 10 auto updates?</p>

            <p>You are the 2nd Moderator who sent this article to me and "NO" it did not help me at all.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I am even more aggravated as my other HP laptop and desktop PC (both are&nbsp;Window 7 based) are not having any problems connecting to the internet
 so I know its not a cable or adapter device problem.&nbsp; It is only the laptop with Window 10 which was working fine before the auto update (I was on the internet when the update occurred and when update completed no more internet).&nbsp; Trying to get this problem
 resolved is stressful and probably will be expensive for me to get a Tech (some one who would know what they are doing) as I am totally baffled and reading your article and trying to implore those possible solutions are going to send me to the looney bin.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 should have left well enough alone and just stuck with Windows 7 as Windows 10 is becoming a pain!!!</p>

            None of the suggestions from the community worked so I contacted my former co-workers who are network/tech knowledgeable.&nbsp;&nbsp;With their assistance, I was&nbsp;able to remedy the problem.

<h2>            Windows Sonic &#47; Dolby Atmos for headphones&#58; proper in-game settings</h2>
                    <p>I've looked far and wide and can not find a definitive answer: </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a regular stereo headset (no processing) connected to an Xbox Controller. I also have Windows Sonic selected in the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For games that have their own audio settings and let you choose between '7.1' and 'Headphone', which should be chosen? Because at that point I'm indeed using headphones, but also have a processor working to down mix 7.1 into spatial stereo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen people swear for both sides, and I'm aware that I can just choose what sounds best to me, but just wanted to know which would provide something more true to how the devs intended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out here in Xbox Forums. I recommend trying the following article:

<p>So....</p>
<p>Since nobody has given an answer yet (the link for xbox troubleshooting doesnt even mention in-game settings), let me try to explain whats happening. Windows Sonic as well as Dolby Atmos for Headphones downmix a surround signal to stereo in a way that makes
 it seem as if you're listening to surround sound. If you set your Game audio to Headphones the Game will not output 7.1 Surround&nbsp; sound but either pure Stereo or already have done the work that sonic is supposed to do. So, if your game has built in surround
 sound (or binaural sound) for headphones turn off sonic and use that or use the speaker settings and turn on sonic. Dont turn on both or sonic will try to make a surround sound out of a binaural stereo signal. Trust me, that's not a good listening experience.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
For the sound issue :<br />
<br />
You should be able to determine if the sound comes from the mouse or the system by<br />
MUTE the system. If the mouse itself is that loud then you should seek a replacement.<br />
If its from the system then you need to do a little experimentation to find the root<br />
cause. Double Click the little speaker Icon next to Clock on lower right - MUTE.<br />
<br />
You can turn all Windows Sounds down or off - Double Click the little speaker near the<br />
clock on lower right - Mixer - reduce volume on or Mute&nbsp;Windows Sounds.<br />
<br />
To stop just the navigation sounds and leave the other Windows Sounds working - Right<br />
Click the little speaker - Sounds - under Windows Explorer - Start Navigation. There may<br />
be others that you want to control. Control Panel - Sound - Sounds tab also gets you there.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>
