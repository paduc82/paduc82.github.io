<h2>            Unknow artist are linked to wrong album and album cover.</h2>
                    
<p>I was trying to label songs listed as unknown artist from mix cds on Windows Media Player. When I used the find album info for a song, I was not aware that by clicking it for one song all the songs would now incorrectly be put into that album, until after
 the fact. I have tried manually&nbsp;re entering the information, and deleting and reloading the songs, but no matter what I do the wrong album cover and the year of the wrong album is listed in the Unknow Artist and if I update album info it moves the songs back
 into the wrong album again and then I have to start over.</p>
<p>Is there a way to move back all the songs that are not in that album to unknown and get the album art back to the paste art here that it originally started with.</p>
<p>I am running Windows Vista and it says I have the most current Window Media Player when I hit update.</p>

<p>What's the file type of these music files (MP3, WMA, WAV...)?</p>
<p>You can try entering the correct album info by right-clicking the field that you want to edit (such as artist), and selecting&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong> .</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 installed on SSD has slowed down after latest update on Dec 17th - now can&#39;t even reset the PC</h2>
                    <p>I had upgraded my HDD to an SSD and reinstalled my Win 10 to the SSD - first 7-8 days worked well - then Steam games (not installed in C drive - installed on separate E: HDD drive) developed some issues.
</p>
<p>When I tried to uninstall Steam, the uninstall process crashed Windows 10 and had to hard shutdown. On restarting, new Windows update started up - took a LONG time (overnight)!
</p>
<p>Then finally the PC restarted and it took 15 mins to startup - and had to rescan/ repair the E: drive (where Steam was being unistalled) before Windows will start. Now, everything is super slow and cannot even reset the PC - if I try, nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my options? Can someone advise me how to fix Windows and the Steam install?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Why do Windows Updates regularly cause the deletion &#47; corruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clivehenderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do Windows Updates regularly cause the deletion &#47; corruption of a file critical to the PC booting&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For the 2nd time in 16mths, my Intel i5 powered computer has failed to boot up following Windows 10 updates. I am fed up of with these Microsoft debacles.
<br />
<br />
Why am I forced to endure hours of lost time fixing the chaos Microsoft imposes on me? Financial compensation for users' inconvenience is the ONLY answer. Does anyone share this view?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The firs time this happened it was due to a corruption of the boot file - the precise name eludes me. Y'day the cause was C:\windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop being "unavailable".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I desperately want to get take myself out of Miscrosoft's tyrannical enthusiasm for imposing chaos on my life.</p>

<p>I don't have any of those problems, and I've got all the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not saying that to be a smart*ss - my point is: before blaming everything on Microsoft, you really ought to find out what the underlying cause is. As everyone knows, just because 'B' follows 'A' that doesn't mean 'B' was caused by 'A.' Ultimately, you
 don't want to have the problem, of course, so you owe it to yourself to find out why it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may not have anything to do with an update. Or it may be the result of how an update interacts with something you've done to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all you do is throw up your hands and blame it all on Microsoft you haven't solved anything. And considering that millions of people all over the world have no problems with Windows 10, you could at least consider the possibility that you made a mistake
 along the way.</p>

<p>If you are a genuine user and not an expert MS employee then I'm very happy for you. I am neither and I have very pedestrian set up: no weird or exotic hardware or software set-up because I don't have the need, nor capability, for creating that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you say is not correct though. I went to a computer repair shop today in England to obtain a Win 10 Recovery USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I told them the file I'd had problems with and the man behind the counter, completely unprompted replied, "Yeah, we've had a few machines in for repair with that same problem following updates".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's one shop in one small town. Scaling that up means there is almost certainly a significant proportion users, in each country, impacted by Microsoft's inability to prepare updates that don't f**k up people's computers. You may not wish to admit that
 but you know it is true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I intend to install a Linux OS on my machine asap. Any time taken to learn a new system will be more than offset by increased reliability. I cannot afford all the downtime.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I NEVER had problems with XP. Why is it acceptable that Win 10 performs worse than versus a legacy version?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I NEVER had problems with XP. Why is it acceptable that Win 10 performs worse than versus a legacy version?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember the introduction of Windows XP very well. The newsgroups that preceded this community forum were replete with angry complaints how about terrible is was, how could Microsoft do this to its loyal customers, etc. etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That continued until Windows 7 became the new target of hatred. The bitter comments decried the stupidity of Microsoft programmers, doesn't Microsoft care about what they release etc. etc. and now, remarkably, Windows XP (which needed three Service Packs)
 that everyone hated so much was now held up as a shining example, etc. etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And so on and so on. Every new version of Windows is 'the worst ever' until the next version, when the previous version now becomes the symbol of quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people just aren't good with software. Many of them post here, looking for someone else to blame, how can I join a class action lawsuit, who's going to compensate me and so on. (I'm not accusing you of being in that group; I'm making a point.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am neither a Microsoft employee (or an apologist) nor am I a computer genius. I'm merely someone who makes an effort to learn how to use my computer well and to best advantage. Anyone can join that group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, it's an unfortunate truth of all software today that quality is no longer valued as it once was. Speed - being first to market with the newest and the latest - is much more important. Nobody cares if the product is unstable or breaks something
 else. Speed pays the bills, and Microsoft discovered that the hard way. That's why, for example, there are no more Windows phones and why Cortana is no match for the Google Assistant or Alexa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the old days, big fish ate small fish. Today fast fish eat slow fish. For you and me, that means that people who either can't keep up or choose not to get buried.</p>

<p>[/quote]I don't hate Obsidian, they've done nothing to me personally. I just think they make really quite shoddy games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Console friendly does not mean that PC controls have to suck. The Mass Effect games, Dragon Age: Origins and it's sequel, Arkham Asylum, Resident Evil 5, Gears of War. Just a few titles that are very console friendly and yet have excellent control schemes
 on the PC for the keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is only so long that people can keep making excuses for poor quality. Hell I think Alpha Protocol is the best game that Obsidian has made and yet it is so rough around the edges that you have to wonder if there was any quality control going on at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While playing Dungeon Siege 3, I got the same feeling as I did when playing Alpha Protocol. The feeling that when they were working on the game, they stopped each piece before it was finished and said "that's good enough."</p>

<h3> 21khanmaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 807 From VPN Created On Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had recently created my own VPN server using the built-in feature for Windows in ncpa.cpl. I made the new incomping connection, allowed TCP port 1723 and GRE protocol 47 in Windows Firewall and port forwarded it on my router with the following settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internal Port: 1723</p>
<p>External Port: 1723</p>
<p>Host IP: 192.168.1.119 (This is correct as I checked it on CMD)</p>
<p>Enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the correct public IP which I got from searching what is my IP on Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I am trying to connect from another computer, errors 800 and 807 come. I have continuously double-checked the details of my VPN and changed the username and password but still the error codes come up. Right now it is error code 807.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited*:</p>
<p>If the VPN Type is set to PPTP: Error 807</p>
<p>If the VPN Type is set to Auto: Error 800</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve this problem?</p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Is the computer able to detect any other USB devices on the same USB port?</span></strong></p>

            thanks for the help but it still does not work and I am getting the same message "the specified port is unknown". All the usb ports work with other devices, the printer software is fully installed and the device is shown as operational . The printer is
 installed on another desktop and works fine so there is a glitch I guess in the printer sofware. Any other suggestions would be gratefully received as HP are not interested.

            Hi OlgaAndreyevskikh 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />You will need to see if you can get in via safe mode.
<br />So at the login screen hold the shift button and restart.
<br />Login to safe mode with your local admin account.
<br />Then go to start - settings - accounts - your account and remove the PIN.

            Hi Olga,<br /><br />I'm an independent advisor for Microsoft specializing in windows 10.<br /><br />When your Microsoft Account is linked to your windows PC it requires network connectivity to keep the password in sync with the cloud. If you haven't already please check your compters network connection weather it be Ethernet or wifi. A WiFi icon is located in the bottom right corner of the windows 10 login screen to assist in connecting to the internet prior to login.<br /><br />Annother trick that may help you to get back in is to use your older password to login, then once in check your internet connection and reboot once you've re-established internet connectivity your login password should update.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try booting into Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />5. In Startup Settings screen, you need to click Restart.
<br />
<br />6. After restart, press F4 or 4 to boot into Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />This will allow you to login as built-in administrator, then you can manage your system.
<br />

<h3> ruthlinden  say:</h3>
<h2>            What to do with 2 Skype accounts based on the same email address&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I set up a Skype account many years ago on a PC and have hardly used it since. &nbsp;Today I have tried to access my account via my Mac: I no longer have a PC. I couldn't remember my Skype name so entered my email address. I couldn't remember my password so I
 reset my password. This led me to setting up a new Skype for Mac account.</p>
<p>I now find I have two Skype accounts, both based on the same email address but with different passwords. I've remembered my original Skype name so can now access both accounts. &nbsp;Of course, I only want one though.</p>
<p>Should I delete one of the accounts? &nbsp;If I do, will it nullify the email address? &nbsp;I don't want this to happen as I want at least one Skype account. &nbsp;I do not use MS Outlook and only use Office for Mac.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f3f6a4ef-9479-4b29-8140-acf56d60d099" title="RuthLinden">
<p>
</p><p>One possible reason why you are seeing two accounts under one email address is because you signed in to Skype using your account's associated email address instead of your Skype Name
<em>(since you forgot it)</em>&nbsp;without merging them first, thus resulting to a new Skype account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can proceed with closing one of the accounts, however please be reminded that the associated Microsoft account
<em>(along with the Microsoft services and products tied to the account)</em> will be closed as well. You may want to check this FAQ for additional details.

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you merge your Skype and email address instead. This will eliminate the account created with your email address automatically<em> (live).
</em>Please see details of updating accounts on the links below. </p>

Both our 8.1 laptops started having crashing print spoolers at the same time (within a week of eachother).&nbsp; No new software added, only windows updates.&nbsp; The two computers use different anti-malware software, and both are regularly updated.&nbsp; VERY frustrating...</p>

            Hi sorry you are having issues.&nbsp; Sadly this is the case with a failed update.&nbsp; It deletes the game and you have to reinstall.&nbsp; My son had the same issue with RDR2 recently which is a very large game.&nbsp; Are you having this issue with every game that requires
 an update?

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error code <strong>0x80048849 </strong>may occur due to one of the following reasons:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An email is stuck in the Outbox folder of Windows Live Mail </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not be using the latest version of Windows Live Mail </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your computer needs Microsoft’s latest updates </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your mail account may not be properly configured in Windows Live Mail
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet Explorer settings may be causing connectivity problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SSL settings are incorrect </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incorrect Proxy settings&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet Explorer may be set to work offline </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow these steps to troubleshoot your Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An email is stuck in the Outbox folder of Windows Live Mail </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the Outbox folder and delete all of its contents before sending a new e-mail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you’re unable to delete the email from the outbox folder, you may have to first go offline, delete the email and then go back online.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not be using the latest version of Windows Live Mail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure that you are running the latest version of Windows Live Mail. The latest version of Windows Live Mail can be downloaded here. To determine the version of Windows Live Mail installed on your computer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Windows Live Mail. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the file Menu drop down in the upper left corner.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click About.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The version of Windows Live will be displayed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not running the latest version of Windows Live Mail you may need to uninstall and install the latest version.
</p>

<h2>            Will a Surface Pro 3 run java applets&#63;</h2>
                    I am attempting to figure out if a Surface Pro 3 will be a viable option for an application that I am currently investigating. Will the Surface Pro 3 be able to run a Java applet that is installed in its operating system, not web-based?

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with the concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need some more information about the applet that you mentioned about. I would like to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the applet used for?</li><li>Does it work on other Windows based computers?</li><li>Have you developed the applet or have you downloaded it from somewhere?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You may also refer to the following article on Java website and check if it helps.</p>

<h2>            MOHAA and MOHAAB keyboard problem</h2>
                    Recently I was the guy that says that can't run MOHAA(Medal of Honor:Allied Assault.)Now it runs perfectly.About 1.5 weeks ago I updated the drivers.Recently,I have a problem with the game.After playing and restarting the map,the game does now recognize
 Walk and Duck functions(Walk-Left Shift,Duck-Left Ctrl.)Don't suggest restore points-I deleted them because they were wasting too much disk space.How can I fix the problem?

            I have MOH - AA, PacificA &amp; Airborne. The all installed straight. No need for compatibility mode, etc.<br />
<br />
Does the keyboard function properly in other games ?<br />
Have you setup any&nbsp; other keyboard profiles that may be overriding the games settings ?<br />
Have you made any changes in the config files in the games folder in My Documents/EA Games ?<br />
The keys are still properly bound in the games in game keyboard settings ?<br />
<br />
I don't know if restore points would have helped, but if you don't have space on your HDD for<br />
at least two or three you really need a bigger HDD. System Restore is your friend.<br />
But better than that, Win 7 (but you may be using XP - you user name ?) can restore individual applications so you don't need to worry about undoing other system changes to fix a game.<br />
This is done by R/clicking on the game install folder and going to properties / Previous Versions.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp; the keyboard is functioning properly in other applications and none of the above helps reinstalling the game should fix the problem. You can back-up your saves for after the reinstall (I don't recall if this game offers an option to keep the save files
 when uninstalling).<br />

            As the keys function correctly in GTA4 (which uses the same sprint and crouch keys), and everything else work correctly,&nbsp; it would be likely something has happened in the game/s.<br />
( Is breakthrough an old style 'expansion' that needs the original game to install ? )<br />
<br />
If the settings are displayed in the games keyboard settings options correctly the keyboard should work correctly, but there is a small chance&nbsp; of a corrupt save game causing the problem, and while it may not seem logical if the game shows the correct key&nbsp;
 binding, a reinstall of the game may fix the problem.&nbsp; Sometimes you just have to try everything.<br />
<br />
Not sure which drivers you are speaking of, but graphics and chipset drivers should not bother the keyboard. Obviously keyboard drivers for gaming keyboards with profile software could if it installs pre-set profiles.<br />

            Yes,the Breakthrough is an old "expansion"" that needs MOHAA to work.I'll unistall it and install it back to see if the problem is fixed.<br />
