<h2>            Printer installation on Win 7 64-bit and D-Link DPR-1260 print server</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>I have been using a D-Link DPR-1260 print server for my home network for more than 1 year. The computers were all running XP XP3 32-bit. When I upgraded one to WIn 7 64-bit, I have problem
 installing printer. The two printers are Samsung scx-4521 laser MFP and CLP-315 color laser. The drivers are already properly installed on my computer and I was able to print if they were connected via USB directly. I was also able to see DPR-1260 and the
 attached printer. But installation stopped because it was not able to find the proper drivers. This is odd as I was able to print via USB. Help please. I have not upgraded other computers yet even though I will only be installing 32-bit version instead of
 64-bit for the remaining. </span></p>

<blockquote>I have tried this fix as well, however it will not allow me to select the folder in which I think the driver is located within.&nbsp; Basically, it can't find the 64bit driver...any other solutions?</blockquote>
<p><br />
to connect to the d-link 1260 printserver you have to treat it as a network server with an attached device. here is what you will need the name of the print qeue and the ip adress. and a COMPATIBLE printer one that is in the d-link1260 list they have a better
 list on their website.. <a href="http://www.dlink.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dlink.com</a> <br />
1. goto devices and printers" in the start menu&nbsp;<br />
2.at top click "add printer" if you do not find it in the device list below.<br />
3.next select "add network printer" <br />
4.next click "stop" hen click "the printer i want is not listed"<br />
5.select "add a printer using tcp/ip adress or hostname" click "next"<br />
6.select device type and enter ip adress i.e. 192.168.0.xxx a window will open and request more<br />
port information click "custom" at the bottom.<br />
7.when sub menu opens select "LPR" then enter the name of the printer queue also i checked " LPR&nbsp;byte counting enabled" click "next" &nbsp;you may not need this.&nbsp;i.e. my queue name&nbsp;was ml-2010. you can get this from the dlink1260 setup page.<br />
8.next page will ask for printer driver. if the list is not current then try&nbsp; "windows update" first the list will update for more models this will take a few minutes be patient.&nbsp; or lastly you can try the driver for what ever model you have i recommend downloading
 the most current drivers from your manufacturer... select MAKe of printer on left and MODEL on right. then click next<br />
you are done if you can print a test page.</p>
<p>guys its best to assign a static i.p to the dpr 1260 print server and lock this in the setup. also reserve this i.p into your router setup. for 64 bit systems many drivers were not yet available as of this listing they may be available now. i would suggest
 using BASIC driver not those all in one packages with all the demoware..most hp's are capable of being used in this setup configuration like i said in the beginning make sure you have a supported printer by veryfying the dlink.com list of supported printers
 found here..</p>
<p>http://www.dlink.com/products/default.aspx?pid=DPR-1260&amp;tab=3</p>
<p>goto the "FAQ" section and see list of printers. and more details on manually installing this item and configuration settings for most windows editions.</p>

<h2>            Skype system sound share not working right.</h2>
                    Hello. The system sound share feature on Skype is really cool. I mostly use it for when me and some friends are streaming shows. I usually stream them off of my computer, but most of the time, when I click "Share system sound", it doesn't do anything.
 The pop up menu just goes away, and if I click on it again, it hasn't changed to "Stop sharing system sound", so I know it isn't doing anything, and the other people can't hear anything. This has been going on for a while, And I don't know what to do. Sometimes
 rarely, it will work, but if I turn it off, then turn it back on again later, it will not work again. Any ideas? My Skype version is 7.40.0.103.

<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><br />
I found a thread here on answers with this text in it. That thread was started in 2016 so I'd prefer to start a new one.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is a big problem! Does MS know about this? Have they used android and apple tablets before? Can we expect better on screen keyboard prompts. I realize it's more difficult to put this functionality into a OS that still supports software that is literally
 decades old as opposed to OS specifically designed with touch interfaces in mind -&nbsp; but surely we can do better than this?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This makes websites, slack, and discord basically unusable =[&nbsp;<br />

Issue:<br />
Popup keyboard will not stop opening.&nbsp;<br />

Question:<br />
What is being done about this?&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi so first off thanks for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you've done is instructed me to input commands to my PC as an administrator without telling me what that they do. I appreciate the help but blindly entering commands I don't understand into a terminal is never a good idea particularly with elevated
 privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next - after trying these commands it disabled the popup keyboard on input focus which is great! That solves my problem. Except it also prevents me from manually launching the touch keyboard at all which is an entire step in the wrong direction. If I had
 a keyboard I wouldn't be with this problem in the fist place.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
and again - I have no idea what else I've disabled. Is this service just the touch keyboard? etc. ( rhetorical )&nbsp; I'd recommend taking more care in your responses this seems dangerous for someone who doesn't know how to use a terminal. \</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly that doesn't answer my question about what is being done about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            You have disabled the on screen keyboard, and the reply gave you the instructions how to enable it again. 
<br />
<br />sc config "TabletInputService" start= auto
<br />sc start "TabletInputService" 
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try is the following:
<br />
<br />Run the Start menu troubleshooter:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />Scroll down to Windows Explorer then select it
<br />Click Restart
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart

<h2>            Me and my brother forgot his password</h2>
                    
<p>so, I made my brother an xbox account, after a couple of months or maybe even a year, we forgot his password. I have tried everything, I have exceeded the attempts to try guessing it, and have tried the security question which I dont remember if we even
 put an answer in, i cant do the phone verification because i dont think we put a number in, i also tried to fill out a couple of forms but dont have enough info on them to verify it is really his account because we didnt put most of the stuff that is in the
 forms. i dont think there is any other way. i was hoping that microsoft could just trust that it is his account and let us change his password but that is probably not going to happen. Any help, i would appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

I would recommend you try the resetting password option on your e-mail account as suggested above.

            <p>Hi Selinabarron,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the complete and exact error message?</p>
<p>2. Were there any changes or updates made on the computer?</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>a. If your Bluetooth device uses batteries, make sure that your batteries are charged.</p>
<p>b. If your Bluetooth device uses a transceiver that connects to your computer through a USB port, try connecting the transceiver to another USB port on your computer.</p>
<p>c. If there are multiple Bluetooth devices connected to your computer, temporarily remove the devices that you are not troubleshooting. If there are additional
 USB devices, try removing any USB devices that you do not have to have installed during the troubleshooting process. If you have multiple devices that are connected by using USB, this can interfere with a Bluetooth transceiver.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer the article and try to run the troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, it seems that you are having an issue with connecting your device to your network. The possible reason for this might be your network driver. For us to isolate this, let us do the following methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Check Wi-Fi drivers and settings in Windows 10</strong></p>
<p>Usually, having the latest driver for your device is the best policy because it has all the latest fixes for your device.
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To check for the latest drivers automatically:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In Device Manager, select
<strong>Network adapters</strong>, press and hold (or right-click) <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select
<strong>Search automatically for the updated driver software</strong>. If a new driver is found, it will be downloaded and installed automatically.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>If a new driver isn't found, check the device manufacturer’s website for the latest driver, download it, and then install it manually. To find out how to do this, see
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix network connection issues.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Check Wireless driver settings</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Wi</span></span><span><span><span><span>-Fi adapter manufacturers might have different advanced settings you can tweak based on your network environment or connection preferences.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check the Wireless Mode setting for your network adapter and make sure it matches the capabilities of the network you’re trying to connect to. If it doesn’t match, you won’t be able
 to connect, and the network might not even appear in the list of available networks. Many times, the Wireless Mode will be set to Auto or something similar by default, which allows connection for every kind of network that’s supported</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>To find the wireless mode setting</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>In <strong>Device Manager</strong>, select <strong>Network adapters</strong> &gt; the network adapter name.</span></li><li><span>Select the <strong>Advanced tab</strong> and look for a <strong>Wireless Mode setting.</strong> Make sure it’s set to the mode your network is using.</span></li></ol>
<p>Update us with the result so we can further assist you.</p>

            <p>Dear Anne</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for you support. Unfortunately I was not able to solve the problem with the steps described above. I had contact with the provider of the access points (TP-Link, Archer C7). It seems that the firmware&nbsp;of the AP&nbsp;has a bug which&nbsp;they have to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great day.</p>

    <title>Got &#91;Not responding&#93; error using the scan function of Canon MF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> plau42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Got &#91;Not responding&#93; error using the scan function of Canon MF Toolbox 4.9 after upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using Canon imageCLASS MF4150 multi-function printer with Windows 7 (x64) for many years. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Home (x64) as suggested by Microsoft, the scanning function is not working with the program of Canon MF Toolbox 4.9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to solve&nbsp;my problem by getting the&nbsp;latest driver and software in Canon US official website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/printers/support-laser-printers-imageclass/imageclass-mf4150</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) MF4150_MFDrivers_W64_us_EN</p>
<p>2) ToolBox_4911mf18_Win_EN</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this solution does not work for me. After I installed them, the problem is still there. Should I uninstall the driver and the associated software before I install the latest ones?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope anyone can help!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p><span>Hi Saeef,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the screenshot posted in the description, we notice you have ran
<strong>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong> for experiencing <strong>File Explorer</strong> issue. Since
<strong>File explorer</strong> is a file related issue, I suggest you to run <strong>
System maintenance troubleshooter</strong> and check if it replaces the corrupted or missing system files and folders.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Run
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter by following the steps below and check for the status of the computer behavior. System freezes and other irregular behaviors is mostly caused due to the unwanted/unused files retained in the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>System Maintenance</span></strong><span> troubleshooter will find and clean up unused files and shortcuts present on the system
 and perform maintenance tasks which will enhance the performance of the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard, type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and select the top most search result.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
View all </strong>from the left side panel of the window.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
System Maintenance</strong> from the listed options, click on <strong>Advanced </strong>
option and check <strong>Apply repairs automatically </strong>option.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the troubleshooting to complete.</span></li><li><span>After the troubleshooting is completed, check the status for any missing system components on the computer.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and check if&nbsp;the changes are effective.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, boot the PC in
<strong>Safe mode with networking</strong> and check if similar issue persists on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using. Logging into
<strong>Safe mode</strong> will help in diagnosing if the issue is caused due to the corrupted user profile or the services disabled on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select appropriate options to boot the computer into
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong></a><span>.
<strong>Reboot</strong> the computer to exit from <strong>Safe mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To know more about
<strong>Safe mode, </strong>refer to the article on </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe
 mode)</span></strong></a><span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the status of the above issue on the computer for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>

<h2>            Two consoles, same house, sharing issue.</h2>
                    
<p>I've been reading up online about the ability to share your games if you have two consoles under the same roof with digitally bought games. Is this possible to do with physical copies of games? My brother and I both have an Xbox One each and want to play
 GTA online together, except we only have one physical copy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With you being able to share if you download digitally, surely there is a way for those of us who went out and bought a copy of a game?</p>
<p>Any reply is appreciated.</p>

<p>With physical copies you would need two copies of the game. You have to have the disc in the drive in order to verify that you own the game, so it would not be possible to have the game running on two consoles with 1 disc.</p>

<h2>            Installation Stopped</h2>
                    <p>I've been having this problem for about a year now and I've tried all sorts of fixes but nothing seems to be working permanently. Every time I try to reinstall&nbsp;an old&nbsp;game of or even update one it comes up at any random&nbsp;point during the installation&nbsp;with&nbsp;"Installation Stopped"</p>

<p>Clearing&nbsp;my local saved games or hard resetting my Xbox doesn't do anything, does anyone know how to fix this?</p>

 </blockquote> <p>I did exactly that just yesterday, I went and got a replacement console hoping that things would be fixed, turns out that I'm still having the same issue. With the game I've been trying to install on disc I'm going to say it's probably the disc fault since it always stops at the same percentage however with my online game I have no idea. It would be amazing if there was a fix to this.</p>

            <p>The answer is quite simple...</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the Desktop and select Personalize</li><li>From the Main Menu (left side) Click Background</li><li>Choose from Slideshow, Picture, or Solid Color (Slideshow works best for multiple images)</li><li>Browse for and select the folder where the images are stored.</li><li>Select image duration</li><li>Select image sizing</li><li>From the Main Menu (left side) Click Themes</li><li>Click Theme Settings</li><li>The first Theme shown (Unsaved Theme) contains the photos from the folder you selected</li><li>Right click on the theme and you can save and name it.</li></ol>

            Then how do you preview the images, change slideshow time to less than 1 minute between images, check or uncheck any images within that slideshow that you want to show or not show, view other background/screensaver themes and all the other things I was
 able to do before this awful Windows 10 (with the supposedly helpful Cortana which is not helpful AT ALL) ?

            Done exactly that. Windows doesn't use the photos in the folder. Every time I go into the menu it's reset to picture. Since there is no SAVE button I exit with clicking the x. How do I save the settings?&nbsp;

<h2>            windows 10 mail app error 0x80040b0b</h2>
                    <p>Today, i opened my mail app and try to add my hotmail account. I received a error.</p>
<p>Mail app was working fine before.</p>
<p>So i tried to solve this problem by uninstall maill app through windows powershell, and used commands "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">get-appxpackage *microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps* | remove-appxpackage</span>"
 to remove the app.</p>
<p>After i reninstall mail app from the windows store. I get a new error code or 0x80040b0b.</p>
<p>I am using windows pro 10 x64 (10.0,version 10586).</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to fix this problem? I can't fing any useful solution anywhere.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance. xD<br />
