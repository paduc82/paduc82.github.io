<h2>            I get an error message, &#34;Unidentified network with no internet access&#34; when I connect to the Internet.</h2>
                    My Vista computer is connecting to the same router just fine, as are all the other computers in the house - mac airbook etc., so it's not the network router, network cable etc.,
<div>The onboard ethernet adapter on my Dell is an Atheros AR8151 PCI-E Gig, and it says it is connected to an Unidentified network with no internet access. &nbsp;If I run the Windows Network Diagnostics on this device, the diagnotics &nbsp;reset the adapter, and the
 Troubleshooting reports, "Local Area Connection" doesn't have a valid IP configuration - Not fixed. &nbsp; &nbsp;I've already taken the step of rolling back the recovery option to 'undo system files and program's in case it was as the result of a recent update. &nbsp;</div>

    <title>Laptop goes to sleep when lid is closed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djonne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop goes to sleep when lid is closed</h2>
                    My Windows 7 Asus laptop goes to sleep after a while when the lid is closed although everything in the power options and advanced power options is set to never go to sleep nor hibernate. This is a problem because I have some devices that don't come back
 on after sleep and that causes blue screens (I've looked it up a lot and there's no solution) so I really need this laptop to NEVER go to sleep or hibernate!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance</div>

            <p>I think you&nbsp;have the power settings set up because it stayed on all night.&nbsp; I cannot see that it is an overheating problem as that would crash the system rather than put it to sleep.</p>
<p>I assume you have checked the BIOS to make sure there is nothing in there controlling the sleep event but this is unlikely or you would have spotted the pattern.&nbsp; Similarly, I asssume you are using Balanced or High performance power plans but that is not
 going to be the explanation as you'd also have spotted the pattern.</p>
<p>You could&nbsp;recheck your drivers in Control panel, Device manager but I'm only saying that because of the lack of any pattern to the sleeping.</p>
<p>If the laptop came with Win7 installed that that bowls out Win7 compatibility issues for the system itself.</p>
<p>I would suggest booting into Safe mode &amp; doing clean boot checks [see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>] but I appreciate that this would be very time-consuming as you'd have to leave the system on for over a day at each check to see how it behaved so it would be impractical.</p>
<p>I don't know what extra devices you have connected ["<em>some devices that don't come back on after sleep</em>"] &amp; I assume you tried testing without them but it would be worth checking their drivers &amp; their compatibility as such behaviour is not the norm.&nbsp;
 Even with these devices disconnected they could still be giving a problem as they could still be affecting the system [components are likely to be loaded when Windows starts as you'll see in the safe mode&nbsp;/ clean boot article above].</p>
<p>There might be useful&nbsp;info tucked away in Event viewer but I am not familiar with that tool [see Windows help &amp; there are also some forum threads that explain it]</p>
<p>Have you suspected any pattern at all to the sleeping [either in time or related to what devices are connected or what tasks you have been doing]?&nbsp; If you do deliberately set it to blank the screen then sleep after particular delays does the system respond
 correctly to these settings?</p>
<p>I assume you have searched the forum for "sleep problem" already.&nbsp; Anyway, most people reporting such problems are reporting that the system will not sleep.</p>
<p>You might get some more useful assistance in this forum if you do a fresh post with the title "Asus &lt;state model name etc, Win7 version&gt; laptop sleeps despite power plan settings not to do so" and do state in the new post what the extra devices are.</p>
<p>If Asus has forums then they might have useful info unless it is related to these extra devices of course.</p>

            Hi Ender.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What happens if you click on the button?  
<br />
<br />What happens if you change the Theme in Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Themes where you can pick free spectacular slideshow themes, including more from the Store link which will load in there to choose:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/windowsthemes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collectio...</a>
<br />
<br />If it still doesn't go away then:
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues with Windows Updates one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I forgot to add this in my post: Sometimes my desktop icons will disappear, but when I click the button, they come back in the exact order I had them in. After they reappear, the button becomes nothing more than a background picture. Btw, the dark area in
 my pic is my apps. I put an overlay on them. Thanks for the quick feedback! EDIT: I just had my apps go away, so I took another pic:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d82b842b-97cd-462d-bae1-2dae2d656ad2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d82b842b-97cd-462d-bae1-2dae2d656ad2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Then I clicked the button again, and they all came back. Now the button is useless again.</p>

            Please reply to every step I gave so I know what else to suggest, although completing every step should fix the problem and even leave you with a much better install.  In Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install so the steps I gave will either assure it's integrity or repair or replace it.

            As long as you checked from the links I gave and not just run Auto Update from Device Manager which only checks Windows Update which doesn't have half the drivers.

<br />Continue with the steps and reporting back.

<p>Before I do so, I do want you to know that it only happens on my profile. This is why I am questioning the driver theory. If you think I should go on with the process, let me know. Also, I do not own an administrator profile.</p>

            Having the latest drivers is always a benefit anyway.  
<br />
<br />But if you've tested and it only happens on your account then that proves account corruption which we see a lot in Windows 10, often caused by compound tweaking or program conflicts.  
<br />
<br /> I'd create a new Local Admin Account, sign into it, move your files over, test all programs work from it, then when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other People. 
<br />
<br /> You can then change the Local Account to your MS Account if you want in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info &gt; Sign in with a MS Account.  
<br /> tall it.

<h2>            Rear speakers with 5.1 surround sound not working with windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there, i did a few searches for this topic, couldn't really find any direct answers.&nbsp; I'm sorry if this was answerd already, if it is, please just send me the link to the forum or directions to fix problem.</p>
<p>Basically, i have a AOpen Cobra AW850 sound card from 2006, and it works perfectly.&nbsp; I realized it is a bit outdated (which may be the problem), but it works on the C-Media CMI8738 audio chipset.&nbsp; On windows 7, the rear two speakers are not working.&nbsp; I tried
 configuring them to 5.1 surround sound via properties from the Sound option in the control panel, as well as the "Playback devices" option, from the taskbar sound icon.&nbsp; When i test the rear speakers, the sound comes out of the front two speakers.&nbsp; I tripled
 checked all my wiring.&nbsp; Does anyone know what is going on, it would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Integrated camera doesn&#39;t work on my Windows 10 Lenovo laptop</h2>
                    A W10 update disaster resulted in a professional rebuild.&nbsp; Since then I have recently noticed that my intergrated camera does not work with Skype, or indeed anything&nbsp; else.&nbsp; W10 settings confirm it is On and that various apps including Skype have access
 to it.&nbsp; But Skype simply reports no device found.&nbsp; I have a Lenovo Yoga 510 laptop.

            Hi Geoff 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+i &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera &gt; Make sure that Allow apps to access your Camera is ON 
<br />Also down below Choose apps that can use your camera is ON for Skype 
<br />
<br />2. Turn off your Antivirus for few minutes and then test it as AV can block your camera. Turn on your AV after diagnostics is completed.
<br />
<br />3. To isolate the issue, can you make call using Web Skype (Edge / Chrome browser) to see if issue is with Skype client
<br />
<br />Web Skype - <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />4. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype. 
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a> 
<br />
<br />5. If above doesn't work - Share with me your DirectX Diagnostic report 
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type dxdiag and Enter &gt; Save All information (down button) to a Text file &gt; Upload text file to Onedrive and share the link here
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Please refer following suggestions:
<br />
<br />Run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't helps, try to re-register Camera app:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows +X and select Windows PowerShell (Admin).
<br />
<br />2. Type/paste following and press Enter key:
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.WindowsCamera | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />3. Close Windows PowerShell and see if this resolves the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, try these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows + X, select Device Manager. 
<br />
<br />2. Under Imaging devices, right click on your camera device and select Uninstall. Click OK. 
<br />
<br />3. Then click Action &gt; Scan for hardware changes. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Device Manager and reboot.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

    <title>Computer takes hours to startup. No-signal until then. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ben-miller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer takes hours to startup. No-signal until then.</h2>
                    <p>I've had this problem three times now, enough to know to suspect that it's likely going to happen every time I turn my computer off. The first time it happened my best guess was that Windows was busy installing a plethora of updates that I'd put off and
 was simply refusing to display anything until it finished. The second time proved that thought wrong and I tried several things to get it to restart to no avail. Now I'm sitting here waiting for the computer to emerge from hibernation while digging through
 the internet in search of answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what happens is that the computer turns on--fans whirring, components silently clicking, light blinking, monitors powered--and then nothing comes up on screen at all. The monitors themselves function correctly, showing their own startup displays when
 I reset them, but all they'll give me are no-signal messages. After sitting frustratedly for hours trying to get around the issue and find ways to do my work, the computer will magically pop on (hopefully that's what's going to happen soon). There's no message
 to suggest what was happening that whole time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried unplugging all my accessories and monitors and the computer to restart without any interferences. I've tried holding/tapping F8 with no luck. I can't get to any screens at all. The keyboard doesn't appear to be connecting either since the caps
 lock toggle doesn't do anything. The interior was dusted fairly recently. I cleared its temp files after the last startup and defragged at least one of my drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I badly need to figure out what's going wrong with it so I can get back on track.</p>

<p>Does it really take hours?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't hibernate - just normal shutdown does it still take hours?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more RAM you have the longer it will take a system to come out of hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gets to a point where it might not be worth hibernating if coming out of hibernation takes longer than a cold boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I quit hibernating years ago with XP after I got to 4GB RAM and never hibernate anymore - takes too long to start up.</p>

<p>Yes, hours. It generally consumes my entire workday. It probably takes even longer when I restart with various different setups to try to get it to move forward. Eventually I leave it to sit and it randomly comes on later in the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only happens when I shut down and restart the computer. Waking up the computer from sleep takes only a moment or two. Starting from the login screen takes only a short time as well. Only the initial startup is delayed.</p>

<p>When my computer finally reconnected again, it actually was displaying a Microsoft update stuck at 100%. The mouse was spinning endlessly and it still took awhile for it to finally startup. By that point I'd gone to sleep and only confirmed that it had finished
 when I woke up. Considering that I discovered the problem in the morning, that means it took the entire day to startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center">Configuring Windows updates</p>
<p style="text-align: center">100% complete</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Do not turn off your computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Curiously enough, this brings my guess back to where I started: there is some issue with the update procedure. I know for certain that two of the three slow restarts I've noticed were related to this. The first, if I recall, was an
 automatic restart triggered by Windows when I happened not to be around to tell it to wait. This time I restarted to find updates trying to install.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Right now I'm waiting for the weekend when I can afford to lose access to my computer again before I try rebooting. Performing a clean boot is one thing I want to try, as is running chkdsk (which requires restarting). I'd also like
 to disable Avira and Avast to make sure they aren't blocking the process. Last, I need to double check my startup applications to remove at least one thing from there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">It's also possible that I need to tap my keyboard like fifty times more than usual to get it to wake up. At the time it finally came on, I was idly drumming away on the modifier keys as I'd tried to do several times throughout the
 day. It's a pretty random hope but I should at least try it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">The very last thing I'm hoping to do in the near or distant future is upgrading to Windows 10 to make sure I have access to the latest support (7 isn't getting younger). I need to swap out my default C: drive before I do that though.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Anyway, restarting is a potentially time consuming thing to try. If clean booting doesn't work, I stand to lose more days of work waiting for things to turn on. There's always the potential that it won't turn on at all, too, which
 could lose me even longer. I'll try to update if/when I see results.</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the system‚Äôs data store and the download folder got desynchronized, resulting in your Windows Updates not working properly. Let's try clearing the
<strong>Software Distribution</strong> folder where all of the updates are stored. Doing so will force Windows Update to download fresh. There‚Äôs nothing vital here. Windows Update will recreate what it needs the next time you run it. Please note that doing
 this will also result in losing your Update history. Moreover, the next time you run Windows Update, it will result in a longer detection time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you'll need to stop the Windows Update related services by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>Start </strong>menu and select <strong>All Programs </strong>
&gt;<strong> Accessories</strong>.</li><li>You will now see a shortcut labeled <strong>Command Prompt</strong>. Right-click on it and select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command one after the other and hit <strong>Enter</strong>:</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net stop cryptSvc</span></strong><strong>net stop bits</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net stop msiserver</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, follow these steps to empty the Software Distribution folder:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to: <strong>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download</strong></li><li>Delete everything within the folder. Do <strong>NOT </strong>delete the folder itself.</li><li>Restart your computer and give Windows Update another try to see if the issue still exists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, let‚Äôs restart the&nbsp;</span>Windows Update related services by typing the following commands one after the other and hitting on
<strong>Enter </strong>in <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net start wuauserv</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net start cryptSvc</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net start bits</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span>net start msiserver</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
</span></strong><span>To close the </span><strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>, type
<span><strong>Exit</strong> and hit on <strong>Enter</strong>. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t find MSVCP71.dll Battlefield 2142 server software wont run.</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to get the Battlefield 2142 server software to run on my server for a few days now. I have had it working before, but I do not remember what operating system, or what install it was on. However, whenever I run the program it tells me that
 it can't locate component MSVCP71.dll. I have tried reinstalling, installing .NET Framework 1.1 through 3.5.&nbsp;I have tried installing microsoft visual studio 6. I have also obtained copies of the DLL and put them in the Windows/System, Windows/System32, and
 in the folder the program itself is in. None of these have fixed the problem. I have also tried regsvr32 on the dll to register it, and it always tells me it can't locate the file.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Device not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match&#58; How to save the files of a bad HDD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Windows 10.0.17763 Build 17763</p>
<p>External HDD reader (I guess 2008-2010 - similar to this, same brand, but slower and older: http://www.fantec.de/produkte/speicherprodukte/festplattengehaeuse/25-zoll-festplattengehaeuse/produkt/details/artikel/1697_fantec_er_35u3_6g/)</p>
<p>Seagate Barracuda HDD 1000GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>what happened:</p>
<p>I got the "device not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match" error message in the event viewer.</p>
<p>The HDD I use in the external HDD reader has some bad sectors for sure. It was my 2nd disk in another PC but I got error messages. I saved some data there, nothing crucial but at least important for myself: memories like pictures. I don't want to lose these
 files. I now try to save as much of them as possible, as my other backup device broke. But if there are corrupt files the windows explorer task is not responding and shuts down after some time and restarts so that the copy process is shut down each time as
 well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched this forum for the event viewer warning message and followed this guide:</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system</p>
<p>I run the SFC scan. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm viewing the CBS log but have no idea what it means. I don't know what I can do with this information and what it is good for. I don't know if it is helping me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I search for a possibility to copy all files. But if there is a bad sector on the HDD the copy process shut ignore this file instead of shutting down the whole explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>greetings...</p>

            Hi, Andi_123123
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your Hard Disk  with chkdsk.
<br />1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and S key at the same time, then type cmd in the search box. 
<br />2) Right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. 
<br />3) Type chkdsk /f /r, then press Enter on your keyboard.  
<br />4) Press Y on your keyboard. 
<br />5) Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time, then type mdsched.exe. 
<br />6) Click Restart now and check for problems (recommended). Your PC will restart immediately. 
<br />7) Wait for the scans to finish.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>Do you have your Actiontech v1000h configured to be operating in bridge mode? The v1000h is also a router built-in to this device, which means it is also doing NAT. It make perfect sense with the behavior of symmetric NAT if this device is also doing NAT. Consult your ISP whether this is an option for this device and if they can help you.</p>

<p>I have not contacted my ISP yet. When you called what did you ask from them? &nbsp;I did find a site telling me how to log in to the actiontec and set it to bridge mode. It seems you need a special login code to access the extra features of the modem. I set it
 to bridge mode and that gave me a open Nat but everytime I turn the xbox off it resets to a strict nat. I will check the actiontec and see if it restored to bridge mode being off.

<p>You are close now CrankierBoar :)</p>
<p>I just called them and asked them to put it in bridge mode for me, then I turned on DHCP and uPnP on my router.</p>
<p>If you are SURE that your modem is in bridge mode you can always disable uPnP and set your router in DMZ to verify that your modem is wide open :)</p>

<p>Yeah I just called Telus and the person I talked to told me that they have no idea how to do that and that they are only there to help me reset my password, wireless, or send a new box. &nbsp;Maybe I got a bad tech person. &nbsp;I found this article that I used last
 time to get into the advanced features of the Actiontec.&nbsp;<a href="http://telusinternet.blogspot.ca/2012/10/using-your-own-router-in-tandem-with.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://telusinternet.blogspot.ca/2012/10/using-your-own-router-in-tandem-with.html</a>&nbsp;

<p>So after following the guide on the previous post I was able to log into the actiontec and get to the correct settings to enable bridge mode. &nbsp;When i plugged the Ethernet cable back into the actiontec it seemed to phone home to telus servers and reset the
 device back into bridge mode off. &nbsp;Luckily I was still able to load back into the Actiontec and change it back to bridge mode. &nbsp;A new problem had shown its face for when I engaged bridge mode I would lose all of my internet connection until I turned it off.
 &nbsp;After messing around I decided to re-enable bridge mode and renew my DHCP on both the Actiontec and Dlink router. &nbsp;That got my internet working and NAT open. &nbsp;I have since turned the xbox off only once so far to see if it would resort back to a strict NAT
 but it has not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all the support in helping me with this issue. &nbsp;I still can't believe my isp was of so little help in knowing what their equipment is capable of doing. &nbsp;Just a heads up but if you follow the actions of the previous link you can no longer access
 the Actiontec webpage without having a hard line connection.</p>
<p>Just to some up what I have turned on/off on all my devices at the moment<br />
<br />

<p>Congrats Crankier :)</p>
<p>I think a lot of the troubles people are having are similar to what I, and yourself experienced.</p>
<p>It is strange though, most of us have had 360's working up to this point with open nat's, and suddenly with the new box we all have to get our ISP's to change settings on the modems.For those not into forums/it tech this must be a nightmare.</p>
<p>I would have thought that plug and play was easier with new technology!!! </p>
<p>Anyhoot, glad it worked out for you :)</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As per your description, I understand that you need drivers for GGE909 controller.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I need to understand few more things in order to help you on the same.</span></span></p>

</li></ol>
<p><span><span>Most of the external devices drivers are provided by the device manufacturer itself. So it's better to contact the device manufacturer to get the correct driver for his game controller. You may also try to update the drivers through drivers update.
 However I would suggest you few methods that may help you to fix the issue.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - 2 Minute Kill time</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have had Windows 10 installed from Windows 7 since the big rollout. I have an annoying problem that when I boot up windows will work perfectly for 2 minutes and then shut off completely, when it restarts windows is fine for ever more until after I have
 shutdown and have the need to boot w10 up again. This happens every time W10 is used (and at the same timescale).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have looked at other threads, and a good snoop around the net and this problem seems to tie in with updates. All of my updates are off. Also when this does restart there is no indication of any updates having being installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My system runs on a 1500W PSU, as I have two Nvidia Titan X cards and wanted enough power. I thought that there maybe some sort of power drain, but this just simply isn't the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Nyima,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally got round to trying your suggestion. Unfortunately W10 is still behaving the same way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also checked that I am up to date with any updates, which I am.&nbsp; Also previously I had W10 which had the same problem, I have since created a fresh install which is what I am using now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hello Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft&nbsp; Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change the location of the folders my pictures, my music, etc. Follow the below steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Go to the location C:\Users\ (user name).<br />
b. Now right click the folder whose location you want to change like my pictures, my music, etc.<br />
c. Now click on the location tab and change the location under the heading ‚Äúyou can change where files in this folder are stored to another place on this hard drive, another driver or another computer on the network‚Äù.<br />
d. Now click Apply and Ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Actually libraries (like pictures library) are where you go to manage your documents, music, pictures, and other files. You can browse your files the same way you would in a folder or you can view your files arranged by properties like date,
 type, and author.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In some ways, a library is similar to a folder. For example, when you open a library, you'll see one or more files. However, unlike a folder, a library gathers files that are stored in several locations. This is a subtle, but important, difference.<strong>Libraries
 don't actually store your items. They monitor folders that contain your items, and let you access and arrange the items in different ways.</strong> For instance, if you have document files in folders on your hard disk and on an external drive, you can access
 all of your document files at once using the Document library.</span></span></p>
