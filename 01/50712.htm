<p>Disgusted!!!! I got the xbox one last night with ghost....600 bucks. I'm in the navy and in school for the next 2 months and living in a hotel.....you know the hotel wifi requires a portal login so you have to click ok on the web page. I don't have a laptop
 just my phone. So I can't even use the xbox at all because I can't do that <b>[MOD REMOVED]&nbsp;</b>update.
<b>[MOD REMOVED]&nbsp;</b>u Microsoft for selling me a useless product!</p>

<p>Mind your language please - I think it's pretty apparent to anyone that the issue is your living arrangements at this time, and not the hardware. I understand you might be upset, but this is a family friendly forum, and no one should have to put up with
 a potty mouth!</p>
<p>That all said, I'm guessing at your problem because you've not really explained it, but you hopefully should be able to get around it.</p>
<p>The xbox one includes a web browser - you might be able to open Internet explorer on the console, and go through the prompts for the wifi portal logon.</p>
<p>Of course, with hotels having all sorts of varying policies on usage, firewall rules and what have you, and you may or may not be able to get into it regardless - I know whenever I travel VPN, Steam etc are all hit and miss.</p>

<p>No I think I explained pretty well, you see the xbox is a brick unless u can connect. No going to IE when you can't even get into the thing. I'm not looking for a solution because the solution would have been allow me to play the game I purchased on the
 system I purchased but that is not going to happen. So again I say exploitive you Microsoft. &nbsp;

<p>Here is how I connect my console to a hotel network:</p>
<p>Find your mobile phone's wireless MAC address (should be hidden away in the network settings or info)</p>
<p>Copy this address into the advanced network settings of the Xbox One</p>
<p>Using your phone, log into the hotel phone's wi-fi, once you are connected, try connecting on your Xbox One again.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed you should be able to trick the Hotel WiFi into thinking your console is actually the phone.</p>
<p>as soon as something starts to happen, turn the wifi off on your phone.If that doesn't work, try logging in on your phone, turning off the wifi then quickly turning on your xbox and connecting to the hotel WIFI.</p>
<p>Hopefully that works for you</p>

<p>I agree with darkstar and bozzybuffer. &nbsp;U can't use the browser unless you're already signed into your live account. Using phone Mac is hit or miss. &nbsp;With the advancements in technology you'd think Microsoft woulda addressed this ridiculous issue... &nbsp;goodbye

    <title>Minecraft Missing skin pack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jok194  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft Missing skin pack</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the minecraft doctor who skin pack volume 1 on Xbox 360 and downloaded it onto my Xbox and had been using it until I bought the Xbox one,</p>
<p>I was downloading my&nbsp;DLC content onto the minecraft Xbox one&nbsp;edition that I had purchased for minecraft 360 but when it came to the doctor skin pack it wanted me to pay for it again so I attempted to contact Microsoft with a copy of the receipt but I found
 that I was never sent one but had receipts from before that from the live store, so I checked my accounts download history on my '360 and the doctor who skin pack was there and I re-downloaded it but it still wanted me to purchase it again for the Xbox one
 so I went to Microsoft's commerce website to check all of my transactions but there were no transaction dates for before 2015 so the only proof of purchase I have is the skin pack in my account download history what should I do?</p>
<p>P.S. I was still charged for the skin-pack!</p>

    <title>Windows XP Display Effects for Fade Effect is not enabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP Display Effects for Fade Effect is not enabled</h2>
                    <p>I noticed on a couple of Windows XP computers that you can set the Windows XP Display Effects to "Use fade effect" (where the windows will fade when you move/minimize or maximize them with the check box that turns it on and off.</p>
<p>However, when the computer is restarted, the Fade Effect will change to a green box rather than the checkbox, and the fade effect will not be enabled. It's an easy fix to go back in after the computer is restarted to unbox/re-check that setting, however
 I cannot figure out what externally is changing the Fade Effect. Any ideas? Thanks guys.</p>

<p><span>Hi Dalip,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regarding the issue of emojis do not display in Skype for Business dialog is in the processing of investigation. The currently targeted of fix is for June monthly channel update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And here is a workaround for the issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. </span><span>Let the Skype for Business admin </span><span>open PowerShell then connect to Skype for Business service to run the command</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Create the following In-band policy and add to the Client Policy.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to create In-band policy:</span></p>
<p><span>$a = New-CsClientPolicyEntry -Name ‚ÄúDisableRicherEditCanSetReadOnly‚Äù -Value "true"</span></p>
<p><span>Set-CsClientPolicy -Identity ‚ÄúPolicy Name‚Äù -PolicyEntry @{Add=$a}</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Restart the Skype for Business Client.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Server 2012R2 Updates failing with error 800F0922</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This has been happening to all of my Windows Server 2012R2 Servers for a month or so now. It seems that the Monthly Security and Quality Rollups are the offenders, but sometimes others fail as well. The servers
 are VMware 6.0 VMs and normally updates are managed by Kace K1000. For the purposes of troubleshooting this issue however I have Kace updates disabled.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">No matter what way I try to install the updates, manually by downloading them from MS or through Windows Update the updates install, prompt me for reboot, and then the OS rolls them back when it boots back
 up. It then tries the update again and begins its cycle of failure all over. All in all the failure cycle takes about 30-40 minutes; it's been extraordinarily frustrating.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So here's what I've tried.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I've spent more or less the whole week working on this and have gotten nowhere. The 800F0922 error code is supposedly related to secure boot being erroneously enabled in UEFI but these are VMs built with a
 BIOS firmware. I've checked the UEFI on the VMware host machine because I thought maybe it was a setting coming from the hypervisor level, but secureboot is not enabled there either.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I've done the normal windows update troubleshooting tricks, rebuilt the C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution directory, tried with all services disabled in a clean boot environment, reregistered dlls, run sfc /scannow
 (no errors were found), run&nbsp;dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth, I also got creative and tried installing the BitLocker feature to see if that was of any help.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">All in all nothing I have done has gotten me anywhere. I'm in exactly the same spot I was in when I began looking into this. I haven't even been able to positively identify the issue as a Windows one or a VMware
 one.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If anyone has run into this before or has any advice I'd be extraordinarily grateful.</p>

<h2>            xbox one in US box but is a region 2 system</h2>
                    
<p>please help! what is my next step. I have a xbox one I purchased bace in 12/20/13. I just went to play a dvd for the first time and it says sorry this is a region 1(usa) disc and cant be played on a region 2(united kingdom) system. I have talked to gamestop
 where I bought it and Microsoft about this issue. I have receipt and box. SN# matches system, receipt and box label. The box label with barcode and Serial number also has it as EN/es US hdwr and under that for disturbution in en/es US. I talked with supervisor
 at Microsoft since gamestop was not in error. This is obviously a quality control issue from Microsoft. They say since past warranty, I can send in for exchange for 138.00. I paid 499.99 for it brand new from a gamestop in terre haute IN, besides its not a
 warranty issue. My xbox one system works perfectly. plays games fine. It just wont play dvds I would buy in USA where I live. This from a multi-billion dollar company. The supervisor said she was unable to do anything not even wave the exchange fee and if
 I exchange and pay more for&nbsp;the refurbished&nbsp;system, that should already be compatible in the US, that only it only has 90 day warranty.&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone&nbsp;knows who else I can&nbsp;contact &nbsp;email me<strong> [Mod Removed]
</strong>I understand its been two years, but I have never used dvd till 5 days ago. Its Wrong for a company like Microsoft not to make this right!</p>

<p>It may be possible that when you first set the console up the incorrect region was set on the console.</p>
<p>Please try the instructions below to check and and if required and hopefully be able to change the region set in the console.</p>
<p>1. On your console, sign in using your Xbox Live-enabled gamertag.</p>
<p>2. Go to Settings.</p>
<p>3. Select System.</p>
<p>4. Select Language &amp; location.</p>
<p>5. Select your new location from the list and then select Restart now</p>

<h2>            If I want to reinstall my laptop to Windows 10 how to I reactivated it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Dell XPS 13 that I purchased a bigger SSD m.2 drive for.&nbsp; The Samsung data migration software cant seem to see the m.2 drive on the USB even though Windows 10 can.&nbsp; So I am guessing I need to reinstall Windows 10 on the new harddrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case how can I reactivate Windows 10 after the install?&nbsp; This laptop was Windows 8.1 and I have no way of reinstalling Windows 8.1 again to go thru the free upgrade.</p>

</p><p>I installed a new hard drive and used the Win 10 ISO to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; After the install sure enough Windows was already activated.&nbsp; So I guess Windows 10 just looks at the hardware to decide if the system should be activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Multiple Users Files on HDD, Separate From SSD Boot Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wsnider28  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Users Files on HDD, Separate From SSD Boot Drive</h2>
                    <p>I have a new PC build with with Windows 10 and programs on a SSD, and a separate HDD for files. I know I can create folders on the HDD and change the "location" settings on the default user folders such as Documents and Downloads to point to the folders
 on the HDD. But if there are multiple users on the computer, they can all see each other's files. Even if you separate them into different folders on the HDD ("Joe &gt; Documents" &amp; "Joe &gt; Downloads" vs "Suzy &gt; Documents" &amp; "Suzy &gt; Downloads"), they can still
 navigate up to the HDD and see the other users' files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to set up that HDD such each user only sees their own files, with no way to see the others'?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            No, you can go into the Security Settings on that Folder on D:\ and Take over Ownership of it and then have only you and the default system users already there for that folder and all its subfolders and files to have access to it.

<p>You would also remove other Permissions from like "Users, Everyone and Administrators"&nbsp;or just removing them from the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you would make sure you added Full Control for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Restart PC after doing so for each user after they set theirs while logged on to their desktops/accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting tired. I may help you with setting security. Not sure yet, maybe have to wait until I get up in morning.</p>

<h2>            .msi file not running.</h2>
                    I am trying to run the OffCAT .msi installer because Excel keeps crashing after about a minute or two of use.&nbsp; However the file will not run.&nbsp; I tried downloading it in two separate browsers, but every time I click it to open it, I get the loading wheel
 next to the cursor and nothing happens.&nbsp; What is going on?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be due to file corruption. To try and fix it, please do the following.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hit Windows key + X and click "Command Prompt (Admin)".</li><li>Type: <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit Enter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>System File Checker will scan Windows system files for corruption and attempt to repair any found by replacing the files using the dllcache repository.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally though, the tool might fail in which case you'll get a message which reads: "<em>Windows resource protection found corrupted files but was unable to fix some of them</em>".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see that message, copy and then right click and paste the following command into the same command prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>DISM.exe/Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>Unlike SFC which replaces files locally, DISM downloads original system files from Microsoft's servers to replace the corrupted versions. So please make sure you maintain your Internet connection while it runs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no animation to watch in either case though I'm afraid and particularly with DISM, all you'll see most of the time is a plain black screen. But eventually, the figure 20% will appear followed about 15 minutes later by 100%. You'll also get a report
 of what was fixed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see any error messages, please post those here. </p>
<p>
</p><p />

                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
I can't open Windows Live Mail

<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Mail are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows Vista SP1</div>
<div><b>How long have you not been able to Sign in ? </b></div>
<div>More than a day</div>
<div><b>Enter the exact error that you are experiencing : </b></div>
<div>1) Your account has been blocked. 2) Please enter the correct password and captcha.
</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
My Kingsborough/CUNY .edu account has been blocked. I have attempted to log in well over 20 times, with the default password (MMDDYY), my CUNY password, and the password that I have changed to (via kbcc.cuny.edu). CUNY's educational services that require an
 e-mail and password to login work for me, yet Windows Live Mail does not. I have changed my password via CUNY's website three times now, and have attempted to log in every 12-24 hours, multiple times, yet I still cannot log in. I am unable to reset my password
 using Windows Live, because the college registered me without a security question or alternate e-mail. They do not have my credit card on file, and I have no contacts on that account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have contacted both Kingsborough and CUNY, who have both said that I must activate the account myself and choose my own password, which I have done. Beyond that, it is out of their hands.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note: If I have not made it clear, I have NEVER logged into this account. Even with the correct captcha (I've checked with audio) and password, I still get one of the errors listed above.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You always want to start with the tried and true "turn it off then back on again" method. Hold the power button on thr console for a few seconds to hard boot and while that is still off unplug your modem and router completely for 5 min. This should reset
 your connections. Let your internet and wifi come all the way back up before turning the console back on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That usually works in these situations for me but if you have already done that you may need to check your network settings on your PC there are better tutorials online for that than I can give. You look up your wifi settings and there should be a button
 that says reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all of that try having your console "forget" your network ID and then manually re-enter it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have AT&amp;T and this issue comes up a lot on my Xbox and tablets so I to some combo of all of the above all the time. I ultimately ended up running an ethernet connection to my Xbox and it fixed a lot of problems.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Is this a scam&#63; Call from India stating my Windows had been compromised,.</h2>
                    Had a call today(from India) saying Windows had been compromised and they needed to fix. Said he was from MS tech services. Tried to get me to give him access thru website ammyy.com, which I believe is a legitimate site. They already had my comp CLS number
 somehow. I did not proceed any further, but was able to get their phone number: 315-636-4810. What should I do?

Yes it is a SCAM!<br />
<br />
The number is either spoofed or forwarded to another number, maybe another country.<br />

No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any errors existed on your<br />
computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your money or worse to steal your identity.
<br />
<br />
Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently - Microsoft does not make unsolicited<br />
phone calls to help you fix your computer<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Un less you have a pre-paid support contract with Microsoft then Microsoft will never ever telephone you or email you about your PC problems. This is simply a Scam to get you to give access to your PC to enable these people to steal your password and other
 personal details such as banking passwords etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily you didn't fall for their Scam!</p>

<h2>            DISM tool&#39;s Cleanup-Image service for Windows 10 option unknown</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Iv'e encountered this problem on my HP Ultrabook laptop, for about a month now,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">where my desktop kept crashing (basically flashing between colored screen and black screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">and it would stop with the whole Windows taskbar not working</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">including Cortana and the search box. I researched for a very long time to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Then i decided to start an elevated cmd and attempt to use the SFC tool. On drive C</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">it said it couldn't start up, and on random drive X it couldn't fix the problem. Then after some</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">online research i found out the DISM tool, specifically the command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>the command prompt returned with an error 87 message, saying the option "Cleanup-Image"</p>
<p>
</p><p>is unknown. What does this mean? Is the Cleanup-Image service deleted? Is there ANY other</p>
<p>
</p><p>way to try and fix the errors stopping SFC from running or DISM from using Cleanup-Image</p>
<p>
</p><p>service?</p>
<p>

            Yes there is a conflict. The Outlook that comes with Office is for the Desktop. The Mail App only handles IMAP mail like Hotmail--now renamed to Outlook.com, Yahoo,

            My mail app can use exchange apparently (I configured it and it works) however the outlook 2013 is impossible to configure. Is this because I used the exchange account for mail?

            Sorry to disagree with you but I have Office 365 and have my outlook mail setup in the Windows 8.1 App-so it can be done. All my emails are set up with the Exchange Protocol. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to
 Help you.

            I am not sure whether Store version would allow mods as installation architecture in Store versions of apps are totally different. But try in this folder and see whether it allows or not.

<h2>            Text messaging from Windows 10 Desktop&#47;Laptop&#47;Tablets VIA Cortana to Windows Phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was looking online around the recent November Threshold 2 update and I been playing around with some of the new update features but I cannot seem to get the text to send from my Windows Phone (Lumia 640 XL 8.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going to Cortana and asking it to send a text to myself or to anyone else in my phonebook but it only says. "ill send that using your phone. it may take a minute depending on connectivity." I have waited for 2 hours now and sent it multiple times
 but nothing appears. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something wrong? or is there another setting I need to activate or does my phone need to wait for the Windows 10 Mobile upgrade before doing it?</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Jollux, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
We understand that, you have an issue with messaging with Cortana&nbsp;and I'd certainly help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I'd be glad to help you.<br />
&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please answer these queries, mentioned below, for a better understanding of your issue:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>‚Ä¢&nbsp;What is the type of Internet connectivity? Is it mobile data connection or Wi-Fi?<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Is this issue occurs on both Windows Tablet and phone?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue could occur due to the intermittent network connection on your phone, so change your internet connection from mobile data connection to Wi-Fi connection and check, if it works.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would also like to inform you that, Cortana requires following configurations, to make it work perfectly:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;Consistent Internet connection.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Region or location must be accurate and turned on.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;The language of Language, Keyboard and speech settings must be similar.</span></li><li><span>Cortana settings must be turned on.</span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to perform a Soft and Hard reset.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>&nbsp;Step 1:</strong><br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Soft reset.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may perform Soft reset and check, if it works.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The soft reset is the same thing as pulling your battery (on devices where that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then press and hold the volume down + power buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> You should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><strong>Hard Reset:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>If the issue still persists, the hard reset will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings, etc&nbsp;will be removed from the
 phone. If backup is turned on under Settings, you can restore your apps and settings after performing a hard reset (as long as you initialize the phone with the same Microsoft Account). Note that resetting your device will not remove any OS or firmware updates.
 You will remain on the same version of Windows Phone after the reset.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>If you can turn on your device you can reset your phone under Settings:
<strong><span>Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone</span></strong></span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<br />

            <p>For this feature to work you need to run Windows 10 build 10581 or higher&nbsp;on both devices, so phone and PC need to have at least this build. And off course Cortana should be enabled on both using the same Microsoft ID. :)</p>

</p><p>I can send messages. A few months ago it was working great -- text messages going out within a minute or so. Recently, nothing happens until I power the phone off and back on (or soft reset). Then within a few seconds after boot up, the message goes out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what's going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use other bluetooth items with the laptop (intermittently)...</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>‚Ä¢ Sign in to the Skype app.</span></p>
<p><span>‚Ä¢ Click any contact.</span></p>

<h2>            Location &#39;My documents&#39; and &#39;My pictures&#39; mixed up.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed a second user on my new Windows 8.1 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've copied the data of this user (my wife) from the previous PC upto <strong>
D:\Data\Hername&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to have her 'documents' pointing there</p>
<p>Also I have a subdirectory <strong>D:\Data\Hername\Pictures</strong></p>
<p>And I want to point het 'pictures' to that location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this by opening explorer 'This PC', finding 'Documents' and 'Pictures' over there and use right-click &gt; Properties &gt; tab Location &gt; type the location &gt; Ok (No I don't want to move).</p>
<p>So far so good, but in the way to get there I've must have made a simple mistake. I don't know what the mistake was but either I entered the new 'pictures'-location into the location of documents or I did it the other way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is now that these two directories ( "Pictures" and "documents" ) are treated by windows as if they are (pointing to) the same directory, If I change the location of either the other changes and if I change the other, the previous is adjusted
 equally.</p>
<p>Even more so, in explorer both are shown, not with 'documents' and 'pictures' but as 'Hername'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find a directive to D:\Data\Hername in Regedit, nor can I find a desktop.ini in these directories nor in users/hername/pictures nor users/hername/documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might show a bit of my problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f912c51-c603-4cef-ac93-1cffd38a4876" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Question is how to unhook these to references so that changing one does not change the other?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<p>As you might notice I'm dutch and using a dutch version of Windows</p>
<p>I hope I'm expressing myself clearly as English is not my native tongue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for looking into this problem.</p>

            Hi Alainpoiriervx, the F8 button functionality has been removed in Windows 10, it may still work on older laptops . . .
<br />
<br />Generally to enter the old F8 functionality, this is the process:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />
<br />To enter BIOS on a PC, it is different for each device . . .
<br />
<br />On the Manufacturers logo screen when your PC boots, you will see text like 'Press F2 to enter setup' but the button or process varies across different systems
<br />
<br />On a Dell it is F2
<br />On a HP it is F10
