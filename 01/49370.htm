<h2>            Sharing My &#40;yours if you have&#41; 3D Builder Model Design</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys! Just want to share a 3D model design i made today. I'm trying to see how far i can take&nbsp; 3D builder. I also have the "casting" for the designs on on the table edges and feet. Took me about an hour to make this since i wasn't sure where i was going
 with it but now i kinda understand the software it will be easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far there are two this i wish the software has, Snap to center and Manual input of ruler measurements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any questions. :-)</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update destroys boot loader in dual-boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> belltown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update destroys boot loader in dual-boot config&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop upgraded to the Anniversary update last night. The download took 7 hours! It wouldn't download at any more than 1Mb/s, despite that being only a fraction of my available bandwidth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the download completed, and it got to its first re-boot, Windows would no longer boot. The only message I saw on the screen on power-up was:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">error: unknown filesystem.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Entering rescue mode ...</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">grub rescue&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The grub rescue utility could list the partitions, but showed them all as 'unknown filesystem'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasted two hours of my life recovering my system, and don't want to go through that again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system was set up with a single drive, a 160GB SSD, with Windows 10 Home Edition installed in one partition, and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in a separate partition. When Ubuntu is installed, it installs the GRUB bootloader, which up till now has had no problem
 handling Windows and Ubuntu installed on the same drive; it gives me a boot menu that allows me to select which OS to boot (Ubuntu selected as the default). However, after the Anniversary update, all I got was the above 'unknown filesystem message'. I was
 finally able to restore the bootloader after trying several things, eventually using the
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
boot-repair</a> Ubuntu utility run from a live USB distribution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there now a problem with the way Windows update installs new upgrades when running on a dual-boot system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything that can be done to prevent this happening with future updates, particularly when I upgrade my other machine running Win 10 Pro?</p>

<p>I was able to recover my system using the boot-repair Ubuntu utility here: <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>I had a Ubuntu distro on a USB, which I booted from, running as a "live" (not-installed) system, then followed the "2nd option" instructions. I had to do it twice, possibly because I did something wrong the first time, but I was able to get my boot loader
 back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that linux is not "supported" (whatever that means) on Windows, but like you, and thousands of others I suspect, I've had no problems running a dual-boot Windows/Linux system prior to the Anniversary Update.

            <p>Surely a clear warning that the upgrade may/will destroy existing personal data is necessary. A simple check on boot loaders during upgrade process is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS does not own my hardware, nor do they have the right to assume they have exclusive access to it. &nbsp;What if Android trashed Windows OS' if they were connected by a USB - its not much different (and probably not that difficult to do if you were also evil
 minded). </p>
<p>
</p><p>As there are more than twice as many Linux kernel based OS e.g. Android in the world than Win10, its time for MS to realise they are part of a much larger symbiotic ecosystem, cater for it in their updates and apologise to those whose data they destroyed.</p>

            <p>After doing research for a couple of hours, this simple solution eventually worked for me (Fedora 24 on a Dell XPS 13 9350):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grub was still on my system, but was bypassed after the Windows update had changed the information in the master boot sector (or what that is called).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pressed F12 on startup to enter BIOS boot menu, and the entry for Fedora was still there. After starting Fedora, I opened a terminal and entered</p>
<p>
</p><p>sudo grub2-install /dev/sda</p>
<p>sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg</p>
<p>
</p><p>That fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Using the Ubuntu boot-repair tool was not an option, because it REQUIRES INTERNET to work, and the kernel of this tool currently lacks the drivers to detect the wireless adapter of the Dell XPS 13.</p>

            <p>Hi Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar dual boot system and I had a similar boot&nbsp; problem today 18th October, 2016 following a Windows 10 "upgrade". It should be noted that today's upgrade hasn't had release notes published yet!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recovered in a similar fashion to that mentioned, using boot repair and replacing EFI files in both Windows and Ubuntu installations, It was a close call though, this upgrade really wrecked the boot system and I had to manually "grub" around in the Ubuntu
 EFI files to find one that would start the on board Ubuntu OS. Worse, it also poked into my BIOS to reset it to Secure Boot which always really makes a mes of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Microsoft is desperate to keep other OS's off the desktop, but this really is very low behaviour, bordering on unfair competition. It took me a desperate hour to fix this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please guys, its my computer, I'll set it up how I want to, so I'll thanks you to keep your mitts off my BIOS and my boot configuration in future!</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers</p>

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>we don't expect Microsoft or Windows to support Ubuntu or any other OS set up in a dual boot configuration - but we do expect Microsoft not to interfere with such configurations!</p>

            <p>To prevent this from happening in the future, I was able to install Ubuntu on a separate drive. My laptop comes with two internal M.2 SSD slots. I'm using one of them to run Ubuntu. I was careful to ensure that Ubuntu's Grub boot-loader is installed on the
 Ubuntu drive, and not on the Windows drive (by default, it will install on the Windows drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this configuration, I use the BIOS menu to select the boot drive: Windows or Ubuntu. The Windows drive no longer contains the Grub boot-loader, nor any other modification to the Windows boot-loader/boot manager, etc. It should now look and act like a
 normal Windows drive, and hopefully will never again get destroyed by a future Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also decided to use Linux (Ubuntu for now), as my primary OS, given the problems I've been having with Windows 10 lately, particularly the way updates are handled. Unless I'm actually doing Windows development work and using Visual Studio, I'm finding
 that I have no reason to use Windows any more -- and I'm much happier!</p>

            <p>Windows hijacked my computer yesterday and did an update after I had updates turned off. Now I cannot dual boot and lost my linux partition. I was able to access through f12 and select the partition manually, but in the midst of trying to fix the boot loader
 my computer reset and now windows won't give the option through f12 anymore. Any tips on how to recover my linux partition and get Microsoft to stop hacking our systems that we have set up on computers we own? Windows 10 has been nothing but headaches and
 an attempt to exclude users from having systems set up how they want. As a student that must write software, losing linux has been extremely troubling.</p>

            <p>This works with UBUNTU 16.04 / 14.04 and Windows 10 on a x64 architecture laptop. I've had to do this a couple of times so I'm confident it can work, however, I'm not sure entirely WHY it works (I got it of one of the Ubuntu sites) and someone more expert
 than me in Ubuntu can probably do better and cut out redundant stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you need a dvd or a memory stick with a bootable version of ubuntu on board - you can download it within Windows and blow it to the media of choice - I use dvd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ensure your pc can boot from the media you gave selected, and ensure that that media is first choice for booting. This requires a BIOS approach. Also, ensure that secure boot is DISABLED in BIOS, or your system will never boot into the grub loader to allow
 a LINUX selection. You may want to check this first before going into my recovery routine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK here goes:</p>
<p>1) boot into your media linux, and select the "Try Linux without Installing" option</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) You need to get the Grub-Repair program from the apps store:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a) pull up a terminal</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b) type "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair"&nbsp; &lt;CR&gt; .... you will be asked for a password</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c) type "sudo apt-get update" &lt;CR&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d) type "sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair &amp;&amp; boot-repair" &lt;CR&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) The boot-repair program will start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)select the "Advanced" tab, and select "grub installation and repair" ... follow the instructions given (may be differences depending on the version of"grub-repair" downloaded</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) remove Ubuntu media, reboot to Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) open an administrator command terminal (not Powershell)</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) type "bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi" &lt;CR&gt;&nbsp; //you should get a confirmation that the change has been successful</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) exit Windows and restart holding whichever function key forces a boot into your BIOS resident OS boot list - on my HP Envy its F9 [note this is not a BIOS entry]. This may be a recovery menu of some description!</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) from the OS list, select Ubuntu. If this doesnt work, you may be able to manually search from within the recovery menu for a boot file - if you can look for grubx64.efi and see if you can boot from that. In my recent Windows disaster, I had to do this,
 but in less recent ones it hasn't been that hard as the OS selection came up and worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10) In Ubuntu, pull up a terminal. </p>
<p>
</p><p>11) Run the following</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a) type "sudo cp /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi bootmgfw2.efi" &lt;CR&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b) type "sudo cp /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c) type "sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/25_custom&nbsp; EDIT the line containing "bootmgfw.efi" to "bootmgfw2.efi"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d) look at /etc/default/grub for a file called "25_custom"... if it exists open it and make the same edit</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) type "sudo update-grub" &lt;CR&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>you should now be able to boot into a grub menu allowing you to select operating systems!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Modern Warfare Remastered Keeps Crashing</h2>
                    I just purchased cod4 remastered and it crashes every time a multiplayer game loads in. I have tried quitting and re-launching the game with no success and it doesn't fix it if I restart my console either.

    <title>Setting up Cortana with Exchange accounts. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrsilverfoxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up Cortana with Exchange accounts.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently setting up Cortana to try and use. Our setting is a business atmosphere, so currently we are just running tests and what not with Windows 10, but for setting up Cortana, it asks for a Microsoft account. I was wondering if there is any way
 to use an Exchange account in this instance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If we were to use Windows 10 for our employees, we know some that would already like to use Cortana, but they don't necessarily have&nbsp; a Microsoft account. I understand it is quick to create one, but is there a possibility, or a future possibility of being
 able to use the Exchange accounts with this set up instead?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Leggyladyus,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don't have any information regarding Norton Safety Minder interfering with Family Safety Filter. But then, it is adviced that you only use one parental-control programs on your computer, as it is possible that there might be a conflict between several
 parental-control programs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue happens on Norton Safety Minder, please contact their support team as they can better handle your concern.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            DVD problem after windows 10 install</h2>
                    <p>I installed W 10 on a Dell Inspiron. with W 7. &nbsp;I did a clean install. &nbsp;The DVD/CD drive `is shown as HL-DT-ST DVD +-RW GU4ON.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not play CD's or install programs from a DVD. &nbsp;I reinstalled the driver. &nbsp;I tried the windows troubleshooting. &nbsp;The device manager reports the drive is working. &nbsp;I can now play CD's, but cannot install programs. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Billy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, you must set the 'Windows DVD Player' as the 'default' player for the .VOB file extension, being the file type for DVD recordings.&nbsp; To do this you can open the 'System' configuration tools in 'Settings' and on the left click on 'Default apps'.&nbsp;
 The DVD Player&nbsp;option may not show, so click on 'Choose default application&nbsp;by file type'.&nbsp; In the long list presented scroll down to find the .VOB file&nbsp;type (using the wheel in your mouse is best for this).&nbsp; If the .VOB file type is associated with anything
 other than the Windows DVD Player it needs to be changed. Having said this, you may find the 'Windows DVD Player' is not available from the given list of options; which is what I found.&nbsp; So, I changed to the control panel interface for assigning&nbsp;the default
 player.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the keyboard hold down Windows Key and X to bring up the access menu and click on Control Panel.&nbsp; In Control Panel choose&nbsp;Default Program, and then choose&nbsp;Associate a file type with or protocol with a specific program.&nbsp; Again scroll&nbsp;to find the
 .VOB extension and when this is selected,&nbsp;&nbsp;click the&nbsp;Change Program button top right. Now you should be able to access the programs in the programs folder on the C: drive and within the 'Windows Apps' folder find the Windows DVD Player folder, which when opens
 reveals the .EXE file for the DVD Player App.&nbsp; Choose this, close back to the Desktop.&nbsp; Close to your Desktop and simply open the BD-DVD Drive, place in your DVD and it should 'Auto Play'.&nbsp; It may take a while to boot, but this has worked for me. You may have
 to right click the drive in File Explorer and choose Auto Play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer to the DVD help article. Ensure that you check the Q&amp;A as well</p>

<p>Joy gave a very clear and detailed answer that sent me on the right path. &nbsp; Unfortunately, I was unable to download Windows DVD player for free. &nbsp;I had committed the grave sin of doing a clean install because I was getting blue screen errors with windows
 7 and wanted to start over. &nbsp;This made me ineligible for DVD player for free! &nbsp;Typical Microsoft B.S. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not want to pay because I did not know if&nbsp;Windows DVD player would solve &nbsp;my problem and the reviews were mixed. &nbsp;I downloaded VCL player for free and it fixed my problem, although it is a 32 bit program. &nbsp; It automated the process that Joy described.
 &nbsp;I will go back to the site and donate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As retired business professor who has followed the PC &nbsp;industry since 1983, I can't image why Microsoft would charge for DVD player if you did a clean install to a machine with Windows 7 or 8.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
Here are some common questions you may have about the DVD app:
</p><p>
</p><p>1.<strong>&nbsp;Q: What Windows editions are eligible for the free Windows DVD Player app when upgrading to Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>A: Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional, and Ultimate, and Windows 8/8.1 Pro with Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.<strong>&nbsp;Q: What‚Äôs a quick way to know if I‚Äôll get the free app before upgrading to Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you have Windows Media Center, you‚Äôll get the free app. If you have Windows Enterprise edition, you will not get the free app. If you‚Äôre still unsure, you can check which edition of Windows you‚Äôre running by following the steps outlined here:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/which-operating-system</a> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also keep in mind that, you can still watch videos and movies by using the&nbsp;Movies and TV app which comes pre-installed in Windows 10 for which you do not need to pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply type <strong>Movies and TV </strong>to begin with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p>

<p>First you should tell us what "dont work" means to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting some kind of error message tell us exactly what it says.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has the USB port ever worked properly in the past and if so what do you think happened to it since the last time it worked properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do any other USB ports work okay?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the start button/orb and in the box enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>devmgmt.msc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Enter to open Device Manager and expand the USB section like this example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e7a4d01-b87e-40ac-ba65-3deadfd40a39?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e7a4d01-b87e-40ac-ba65-3deadfd40a39?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then use the instructions in this link to post a screen shot of what your Device Manager looks like:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot HP issues the system serial number should always be part of the information requested so it is then possible to look up the exact system configuration on the HP support site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then depending on the issue to diagnose some other information like this:</p>
<p>
Do this so we can see what you have:<br />
<br />
If the system is an HP what is the serial number?<br />
<br />
Describe your antivirus/antimalware environment.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For USB port information, expand the Components section, click USB, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then past he information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />

<p><em><strong>Hello, </strong></em>i have came across this<span> security proof</span> lately and followed the instructions it wanted me to do, So i entered my<span> email and password</span>
 and then it wanted me to have phone number, so i entered my phone number then it asked if i want it by<span> Text, Call or email.</span> So i chose the
<span>Text option</span> so i got a code i entered it. it let me sign in but every time i want to sign in to my Xbox 360 account it wants me to add a email and password so i do but this time it does not let me sign back in!,
<span>Text option</span> so i got a code i entered it. it let me sign in but every time i want to sign in to my Xbox 360 account it wants me to add a email and password so i do but this time it does not let me sign back in!,
 so i have asked some of my friends have they had this Security Proof update and they said yes but about 2-3 years ago, so i am extremely confused at the moment i wish i never even had to do this update because i had no problems before this has been on my Xbox,
 it is now very frustrating and i just will i did not have to do it and sign in like normal, it also said that my password on my Xbox account it wrong but how can it be? if i am posting here?? so if you can tell me how to not do the update or even delete it
 it would be much appreciated, i just want to get back my normal gaming because it seems like its only me who is countering issues, thank you, i might have missed out some information but i am sure i have not.</p>

 There is ample hard drive free space (90 Gb free with &lt; 70 Gb used).&nbsp; How can this be fixed?

<p><span><span>Hi rebick,</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We would like to get more information from you, to help troubleshoot your issue. Please answer the following questions
 as best you can.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>When was the last time it was working?</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer recently?</span></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>First I would suggest that you disconnect any external drive connected to the computer except the mouse and keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This error message might occur if there are some corrupt system files on the computer. Would suggest that you run a SFC
 scan which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Steps to perform SFC scan:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the Start button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt
 opening. You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'the system scan will begin'</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to
 continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not
 find any integrity violations"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>11. After the scan has completed, Close the command prompt window restart the computer and check.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The scan may take some time, so be patient. Windows will repair any corrupted or missing files that it finds. If information
 from the installation CD is needed to repair the problem, you may be prompted to insert your Windows Vista.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information refer the below link.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to repair the operating system and how to restore the operating system configuration to an earlier
 point in time in Windows Vista</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step does not fix the issue I would suggest that you create a new administrator user account on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Login to the new user account and check if you can create system restore point.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><span><span>Open User Accounts by clicking the
<span>Start</span> button, clicking <span>Control Panel</span>, clicking
<span>User Accounts and Family Safety</span>, and then clicking <span>
User Accounts</span>.</span></span></strong> </li><li>
<strong><span><span>Click
<span>Manage another account</span>.&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></strong>
</li><li>
<strong><span><span>Click
<span>Create a new account</span>.</span></span></strong> </li><li>

                    <p>In the previous version of Skype, my Outlook contacts appeared without difficulties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now the new version of Skype and I cannot access them any more.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to be able to access the contacts that I have in Outlook on my computer, the same as I use for Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not want to go through other systems or clouds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do new versions make life more difficult?<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to go back the previous version of Skype?</p>

            New Skype client (v8) has been lacking few features and functionalities which are expected to come in near future. 
<br />
<br />Reverting to previous version is not recommended by Skype as previous version will be unusable from 1-Sep-18. 
<br />
<br />You should send this feedback to Skype engineers by following below help for their consideration -

            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report

<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions. 
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 - Sign-In Options - Prevent Default Sign-In From - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;tl&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Sign-In Options - Prevent Default Sign-In From Changing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've used the password sign-in option for years until I recently started using the fingerprint option in hopes that it might be more convenient. However I've noticed that the default sign-in option always changes to the one last-used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am satisfied with the password option as I can enter my password or scan my finger a will), but where I am frustrated is when it switches to the fingerprint option, which only offers a text prompt.&nbsp; Frequently am I opening my computer and by muscle memory
 - immediately entering my password, not realizing that the fingerprint option is active, which then I either use the scanner or click through the menus over to the password option. For me, this cancels out any convenience gained from using the fingerprint
 sign-in option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to prevent the sign-in option from changing? So that the password sign-in will be default, regardless of how I last signed into my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.<br />
<br />
I can understand your frustration as it is a human tendency to go with the most used option instead of the last option used to login. Any user might face that issue as they might start typing the password unknowingly though finger print option is selected.<br />
<br />
The logon UI is designed such a way that it would be helpful for the users who uses only one type of logon always. You can always lock the computer and change the sign-in options to your preferred one so that it will be the option displayed next time you login.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the default storage location would be OneDrive. You can navigate and check if the default storage is indeed OneDrive, then modify it so that future saves would go to your desired storage destination. Simply follow the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Start</strong>, then click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System</strong>, then go to <strong>Storage </strong>in the left pane.</li><li>From there you should be able to select your desired storage location.</li></ol>
<p>
