                    <div>
<p>So earlier I made a post&nbsp;and got a answer from a ambassador that said a passkey worked to prevent people from signing into my account on their xbox. Well earlier I got a xbox notification that said I have been signed out. I knew it was my friend trying to
 sign in, but before he could do anything I signed back in. How come the passkey didn't work? Do I have to restart my xbox? Change my password?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Robman098,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like your friend has access to your password and email. He is able to change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you will need to take immediate action and change the details of your account. Things such as:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The Email you use to log in</li><li>Your password</li></ul>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp; for more protection, you should enable&nbsp;2-Step verification. This adds a layer of protection by requiring a secondary means of confirmation for login in such as a code sent by phone or email or the authenticator app. Feel free to contact&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 Support</a>&nbsp;and let them know about your situation, they will gladly&nbsp;help you secure&nbsp;your account!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>After you have done this, you can begin setting up a new passkey. Lastly, please no matter what, give out your account information to someone else!&nbsp;</p>

            If someone is signing into your account from a different device. The passkey option is not what you want. That's for the console itself. You want to set up additional security settings for the account itself. Like 2 step verification&nbsp;

</p><p>I have a problem on my laptop with&nbsp; SANDISK CRUZER&nbsp;USB.</p>
<p>Actually I have never had any problem on this device.</p>
<p>It happened not to recognize&nbsp;this device anymore, but my other brand USB Flash memory works OK.</p>
<p>On the device manager I found a message on the Smart card readers DRIVER.</p>
<p>It said " not working properly" </p>
<p>Any body has the same experience? </p>
<p>How to fix this problem?</p>

            <p>Hello Simon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description I understand that the Sandisk Cruzer USB drive not recognizing in Windows 7. This issue can be caused due to driver or hardware corruption.
<span>Letâ€™s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of the laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the exact error message you receive, when you try to connect the Sandisk Cruzer USB drive on your laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Have you tried to connect the Sandisk Cruzer USB drive on a different USB port?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Are able to see the Sandisk Cruzer USB drive in device manager?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Are able to use the Sandisk Cruzer USB drive on a different computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As all the hardware devices have drivers associated similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers do not get detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may run the Microsoft fixit &amp; check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above step does not help us to diagnose the issue, uninstall the drivers for USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller and restart the computer. Let Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow the steps to uninstall &amp; reinstall the USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller from device manager.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click on <strong>Start </strong>and in <strong>Start search box </strong>type in "<strong>Device Manager</strong>" (with quotes) and press<strong> enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. <strong>Device Manager</strong> Window will be open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Look for the <strong>device under USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller, right click</strong> on it and select
<strong>Uninstall.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp;Restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. On restart, Windows 7 should re-install the drivers automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: If there is yellow question marks on any device in device manger, please repeat the Steps from Step 4.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may access the link below and follow the steps to update drivers on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to download the USB drivers for your motherboard from the manufacturerâ€™s website, if you got software with your hard drive try installing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues<span>, weâ€™ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 desktop repeatedly loading on start up, computer unusable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewdickins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 desktop repeatedly loading on start up, computer unusable</h2>
                    <p>I've had windows 10 since release and experience no issues other that minor things a PC restart would fix until recently. Around about a month a go I logged onto my PC to find the desktop unusable as it was just continuously reloading itself every 1 to 5ish
 seconds and flashing the screen on and off again and again as it did. I looked through various forums but struggled to find many posts experiencing the same issue as me and the ones that did sound similar recommended things such as graphics driver update issues
 and trying to boot is safe mode to fix it but the issue continues when booted in safe mode and from what I can tell it seems to be an issue with windows itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only "fix" I've found to work is a system restore, but this more just seems to hold of the problem for maybe a few days or week and every time I do it it will come back again quicker than the last time and require another system restore. From here the
 only solution I can think is a windows reset, but if possible I would rather not have to resort to that as I have a lot of programs and my desktop set up in a very personalised way that would take me a long time to get back to how I want it, aswell as some
 paid for software that I would struggle to retrieve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has any one else had this issue and found a fix that wouldn't cause me to lose all my programs and setup I currently have or am I going to have to grin and bare it and get started on a list of everything I need to reinstall again?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Andrew, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help to fix the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To assist you better, I would like to know what is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Letâ€™s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If a computer is infected by a virus, lots of resources will be taken up to greatly slow down computer performance. I suggest you to run virus scan (<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>) and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to boot the system in <span>Clean boot</span> state and check if the issue still persist.
<span>Clean boot</span> process will help you determine which third party program/app that is causing this issue. It could be some other application or programs, which runs on the computer at the background, leading to this issue. Please visit the below link
 on how to perform <strong>Clean boot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>

<h2>            XBOX LIVE Slow download speed</h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone noticed when downloading the speed has slowed down to 1/4 speed?</p>
<p>It took over 1 hour to download a 1.3GB file, it would usually take 15-20 mins.</p>
<p>This has started to occur &nbsp;only recently for me, anyone else got this?</p>

<p>Hey Anglo!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you are having slow speeds, but there is no download speed cap for Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>When you are attempting to download this content, do you stay on the download screen or do you navigate away to do other things?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to start a download and turn off the console with the download option on, so the xbox can download while it's off.&nbsp; This made my downloads move faster (at least for me).</p>
<p>Also, please, visit <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.speedtest.net/</a> and do a speed test for your ISP. I'd also test the Ping test while you're there.</p>
<p>If your ISP is fine then it is Microsoft or your console which is the problem.</p>
        </p>

<p>There is no problem with LIVE that I can see.&nbsp; I've just downloaded a 700MB demo in under 5 minutes.&nbsp; What is your download speed?&nbsp; Can you do the speed test suggested by colllecionador?&nbsp; Thanks<br />
<br />
There are&nbsp;no&nbsp;speed limits on Xbox LIVE. But speeds can be effected depending on what you are downloading, and how many other people are downloading the same thing.&nbsp; Also speeds are dependant on capabilities of your ISP.</p>

<p>It took 30 secs to download a 5MB game update recently, how bad is that?</p>

<p>That speed test came up with 15mbps and my xbox is 4 years old.</p>
<p>So do you think it could be the old xbox on it's last legs?</p>

<p>The age of your console won't make any difference to the download speed.&nbsp; Are you wired or wireless?&nbsp; If you're wireless, how far away is your console from the router?&nbsp; What's its signal strength?&nbsp; Have you tried power cycling your modem/router?&nbsp; Contacted
 your ISP?<br />

<p>I was having the same problem until I logged in to my router and turned QoS (Quality of Service) off. My download was stuck at 1% for about 20 minutes and after I turned it off my 2gb download finished in about 10 minutes. QoS is supposed to prioritize traffic
 on your network so it may limit your download speed so something else on your network can use the bandwidth, but I guess in this case it was slowing my download down. Look up your model of router on google to figure out how to access your setup page and give
 it a try. Let me know if your results were the same.</p>

    <title>Trying to disable the Insert key with a Registry edit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill blinn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to disable the Insert key with a Registry edit</h2>
                    <p>This should be a relatively simple Registry edit, but I can't get it to work. I've disabled other keys, so the appropriate Registry entry exists. All I should need to do is edit it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scan code for the Insert key is 52 hex.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had previously created a REG_BINARY key called Scancode Map here:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout</p>
<p>
</p><p>The existing entry is: </p>
<p>00000000 00000000 03000000 00003A00 00004600 00000000</p>
<p>This specifies 2 keys to remap (the number is always 1 more the number of keys that will be remapped)</p>
<p>00003A00 maps CapsLock to nothing.</p>
<p>00004600 maps ScrollLock to nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rewrote the key like this:</p>
<p>00000000 00000000 0<strong>4</strong>000000 00003A00 00004600 <strong>00005200</strong> 00000000</p>
<p>
</p><p>That seems like it should map Insert to nothing, but Insert still functions following a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something that should be completely obvious? This is a Microsoft Sculpt keyboard if it makes any difference, but a scan code should be a scan code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is posted to Devices and Drivers, which seemed to be the closest match.</p>

<p>I have some additional information. It turns out that the Registry edit did disable a key, but not the one I want to disable. The 0 key on the numeric key pad also has scan code 52 (hex)/82 (decimal). That's the key that was disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using an application that reports scan codes for key, I see that "Ext" is marked "Yes" for the key I want to disable. Unfortunately, I have no idea what this is trying to tell me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Green highlight: 0 key on the separate keypad.</p>
<p>Yellow highlight: Insert key on the keyboard.</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the information that you provided. For us to narrow down your concern with
<span>disabling the Insert key with a Registry edit, have you tried creating a backup before editing the registry? If yes, we suggest that you restore it back; then, try it again with the correct entry. To do this, see this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>, and follow the steps/instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate it if you could get back to us and provide us your feedback.</p>

<p>The reply answers a question I didn't ask and misses the one I did. Yes, I had a backup of they key and re-enabled the keypad 0 key as soon as I discovered that the change I had made disabled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have asked is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both the keypad 0 key and the keyboard Insert key have the same scan code (hex 52).</li><li>One of the keys is shown as "Ext"="yes" and another is shown as "Ext"="no". I do not know what this means I would like to know.</li><li>Assuming "Ext" means something, how is this addressed in the Registry entry to disable the key? I know that&nbsp;<span>00005200&nbsp;</span>does not work as expected, and I suspect that the final two numbers need to be something other than 00 to reflect
 the "Ext" value. <span style="font-weight: bold">000052??&nbsp;</span>However, there are 255 remaining values and I'm not about to just blindly try everything from 01 to FF.</li></ul>
<p>So my overarching question is this: What is the right value to identify the keyboard's Insert key. This is a keyboard manufactured by Microsoft and I have to believe that Microsoft somewhere has this information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            removing duplicate installation of of Windows 10 software</h2>
                    I thought that I had a bad hard drive, so I installed another copy of Windows 10 on another drive. Now the "bad" drive is not being "bad." How do I get rid of the old installation?

<h2>            Can&#39;t login to Xbox Live, error 0x80190001</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Phantom Dust through the Windows Store but can't play it because I can't sign in to my Microsoft account; it gives me&nbsp;error 0x80190001</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this is related to the fact that I recently rebuilt my PC due to hard drive failure, doing a fresh install of Windows 10 and then copying my user directory from a backup copy. However I think something is wrong with the permissions; when I try
 to install Skype, I get error code 0x80070005, access denied, but I've manually set my user directory and appdata folder to full control for myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_store-winpc/cant-login-to-store-xbox-error-code-0x80190001/ee97323b-c85c-4d90-8930-7430e524ebdb but my firewall already allows Microsoft Store, Phantom Dust, and the Xbox services.
 I also ran wsreset; no change.</p>

<p>Hi Yasir, I tried all of the options in that link (except method 2 which wasn't applicable), and it resolved my inability to install Skype, however I am still unable to sign in to Xbox games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter and it kept saying that Windows update components must be repaired, and that it had fixed the problem, but it continued to indicate that I had the problem. After I ran the troubleshooter I was able to download another
 update, but this did not solve the problem.<br />
<br />
2. The Windows App Troubleshooter said that there were hanging or crashing apps and suggested resetting apps via the Apps &amp; Features settings; I reset Phantom Dust, Windows Store, and three Xbox apps. No change in problem.<br />
<br />
3. I tried running DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth and sfc /scannow (method 3 in the link). No change; no indication that they made changes.<br />
<br />
4. I ensured my date and time were synchronized (method 4 in the link)<br />
<br />
5. I used the Media Creation Tool (Method 1) to reinstall Windows 10 and keep my files, and then re-updated my computer. After this the Windows Update Troubleshooter no longer said that Windows update components must be repaired, and I am now able to run Skype.
 However I was still not able to sign in to Microsoft for Phantom Dust, with the same error.<br />
<br />
6. I uninstalled Phantom Dust via Apps &amp; Features and reinstalled it via the Store. It reinstalled so quickly that I was convinced it did not need to re-download the entire game (9.5 GB according to Apps &amp; Features). Error persisted. I uninstalled Phantom Dust
 and confirmed that it was indeed still present in Program Files/WindowsApps/Microsoft.MSEsper[...] . I reinstalled it and made sure to choose to use a microsoft account for the game during installation. Error persisted. I then uninstalled it via Get-AppxPackage
 *MSEsper* | Remove-AppxPackage , noted that it was still present in the same location, and reinstalled it. Error persisted.<br />
<br />
7. I uninstalled Phantom Dust and tried to open Program Files/WindowsApps, but got permission denied, and clicking the UAC Continue (to get permission) gave You have been denied permission; you will need to use the security tab. In the Advanced Security Settings,
 it said that the permission entry for Users was corrupt, see screenshot. The other entries were not corrupt.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8c6e03d-6ef3-4fc1-ab63-d462bb92e19e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8c6e03d-6ef3-4fc1-ab63-d462bb92e19e?upload=true" /></a>8.
 Based on the above issue, in accordance with https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files-winpc/access-control-entry-is-corrupt/4e3d5500-5c7d-4839-be4f-c269705561ca I ran DISM, SFC (nothing found), Windows App Troubleshooter (nothing
 found), and wsreset again. No change.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
9. Deciding to leave WindowsApps alone, I tried installing another Xbox Live game instead, Fable Fortune, to see if the problem was related to Phantom Dust. However I was not able to sign in to Fable Fortune either, with the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through these steps I fixed one Windows Store issue but I am still not able to use Xbox Live games due to error&nbsp;0x80190001&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I solved this issue with these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I used another computer to install and sign in to Phantom Dust, then exited</p>
<p>2. On my computer, in Windows Store, I logged out</p>
<p>3. In Store, I chose Sign in with a different account, (rather than picking my account which was listed), and then entered my account info</p>
<p>4. I re-installed Phantom Dust, and instead of choosing "Only sign in for this app" (as I had before), I chose to sign in for all apps (the recommended action).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now able to play Phantom Dust on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Yasir</p>

            <p>Also, refunds usually show up as a negative balance.

            Georgio - Sorry to get back to you so late, but I didn't see your answer.&nbsp; I never received an email notification.&nbsp; I am still having my problem, with Wake on Ring -- when my PC is in standby, Wake on Ring sometimes doesn't work, and my PC FAILS to wake
 to receive faxes through the modem.<br />
<br />
The first part of your suggestion above I know well - "Allow this device to bring the computer out of standby".&nbsp; It was the first thing I checked months ago.<br />
<br />
But please tell me more about your second suggestion - about the registry entry.&nbsp; before I make any changes, what does it do and how does it work?&nbsp; What are the different possibilities?<br />
<br />
Also, I seem NOT to have that precise key.<br />
<br />
FYI, in my settings, the option "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" is UNchecked.&nbsp; Also, it is GREYED OUT, so I could not check even if I wanted to.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Georgio - I have found some of the registry keys you describe, but I need your help.<br />
<br />
The registry subkey you describe exists for my Ethernet NIC card, but there is no
<span><strong>PnPCapabilities</strong>
</span>in the registry keys for my Conexant modem.&nbsp; It's only the Conexant modem that has a problem with Waking.<br />
<br />
The registry key for the Conexant modem is <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E96D-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
and it has a lot of subkeys.&nbsp; Two that catch my eye are:<br />
"EnableACPI - REG_SZ - ON" and<br />
"EnableSleep - REG_SZ - ON".&nbsp; <br />
What do they do?&nbsp; Should I turn one or both of them off?<br />
<br />
There is another subkey "WOR - REG_BINARY - [long binary string with 0's and f's]"<br />
<br />
Any clues here?&nbsp; The modem is still VERY erratic for Wake on Ring when the PC is in standby.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            When my WinXPPro SP3 machine is in sleep/standby/suspend mode (S1 or S3), the fax modem wakes the machine some of the time but not all of the time.&nbsp; I want it to wake the PC every time, with 100% reliability.&nbsp; (When the PC is up and running, the modem
 and the machine receive faxes beautifully.)<br />
<br />
What do you suggest?<br />
<br />
Modem:&nbsp; Conexant D850 PCI V.92 Modem with recent driver update to version 7.67.0.50 (7/3/2007) (but this problem is the same now as before with the 2004 driver version)<br />
PC:&nbsp; Dell Optiplex 755<br />
Processor:&nbsp; Intel Core 2 Duo E4600 @ 2400 MHz<br />
RAM:&nbsp; 2GB, of which 1.4GB is usually free<br />
BIOS:&nbsp; originally A14, now A15<br />
OS:&nbsp; WinXPPro SP3 with all updates<br />
AV:&nbsp; Avast Home Free<br />
Anti-spyware:&nbsp; SpywareBlaster Free, Spybot S&amp;D Free, AdAware Anniversary Free and now MalWare Bytes -- all are the free versions that require manual updates and scans<br />
Fax software:&nbsp; MS Fax Console that comes with WinXPPro SP3 (fxssvc.exe)<br />
Printer/Fax Printer:&nbsp; HP OfficeJet Pro 8500 Wireless AIO (model A909g)<br />
Screensaver:&nbsp; XP logo after 9 minutes; do NOT show welcome screen on resume<br />
Power Settings:&nbsp; Home/Office Desk; Turn Off Monitor after 10 mins; Turn Off Hard Disks Never; System Standby after 20 mins; System Hibernates Never; Do NOT prompt for password when computer resumes from standby<br />
Home network Ethernet connection:&nbsp; Intel(R) 82566DM-2 Gigabit Network Connection card with all Wake on LAN settings ON.<br />
Browser:&nbsp; Firefox latest but use IE occasionally when necessary<br />
Email:&nbsp; MS Outlook Express 6 to POP3/SMTP email service<br />
Misc:&nbsp; I also run LogMeInFree version 4 on all my home computers -- I've been experimenting with turning it off to see if that would help the WOR problem, but there's no effect one way or the other.<br />
<br />
I've tried everything, including upgrading BIOS (now to A15), re-checking all the Wake options in BIOS, trying two different sets of drivers for the modem card, running system file checker (sfc) a number of times, trying both S1 and S3 for sleep, uninstalling
 and reinstalling the windows fax service (fxssvc.exe), re-checking the Power Management tabs in Properties for the modem to make sure it is set to wake the PC, trying various combinations in Power Management for the whole PC, trying the powercfg settings described
 below, and maybe a few other things I've forgotten.<br />
<br />
But, alas, my Wake on Ring is still 50% UNreliable when the PC is in Sleep mode, and I've tried it again with both S1 and S3 sleep.<br />
<br />
Also - Even after running certain DOS commands (see below), my Wake on Ring is STILL unreliable and intermittent.<br />
<br />
The commands I have been running are:<br />
<br />
powercfg /devicequery wake_armed&nbsp;&nbsp; -- to confirm my Conexant modem card was listed, which it is, and to get its precise name,then:<br />
<br />
powercfg /g on /option wakeonring<br />
powercfg /deviceenablewake "Conexant D850 PCI V.92 Modem"<br />
powercfg /deviceenablewake "Intel(R) 82566DM-2 Gigabit Network Connection"<br />
<br />
There's no pattern at all as to when WOR will work and when it won't.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea why WOR doesn't work half the time?&nbsp; Is there a particular i386 file I should try to reinstall?<br />
<br />
As to the Registry, per a post elsewhere by Georgio:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I have found some of the registry keys Georgio described for my Ethernet NIC, but not for the fax modem having the WOR problem:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; There are no <span><strong>PnPCapabilities</strong>
</span>in the registry keys for my Conexant fax modem.&nbsp; (It's only the Conexant modem that has a problem with Waking.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The registry key for the Conexant modem is <br />
&nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E96D-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
&nbsp; and it has a lot of subkeys.&nbsp; Two that catch my eye are:<br />
&nbsp; "EnableACPI - REG_SZ - ON" and<br />
&nbsp; "EnableSleep - REG_SZ - ON".&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&nbsp; What do they do?&nbsp; Should I turn one or both of them off?<br />
<br />
&nbsp; There is another subkey "WOR - REG_BINARY - [long binary string with 0's and f's]"<br />
<br />
Any clues here?&nbsp; The modem is still VERY erratic for Wake on Ring when the PC is in standby.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            If it still doesn't work right after all you've done, I don't think it's possible to get 100% reliability with WOR.<br />
<br />
I'd buy a separate fax machine for that.

            Yes, stop spamming every forum with this question &nbsp;The function you are trying to use does not work the way you need it to. &nbsp;It is not broken, it simply was not designed to do what you are trying to make it do - additionally, this is a function few people
 need to use anymore. &nbsp;It is unlikely a solution to your issue will be found. &nbsp;I second Steve's&nbsp;recommendation, get a real fax machine. &nbsp;Asking the question 15 times is not going to make it any better.

            <p>Hi Lynley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your effort towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if the Dap Downloader is present in the Programs &amp; Features after the system reboot.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps to check if the Dap Downloader is present in the Programs and Features:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>X</strong> keys from the Keyboard.</li><li>Select <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the list.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li><li>Check if the Dap Downloader is present. </li></ol>
<p>If the Dap Downloader is present in the Programs and Features then, I would recommend you to perform a full system scan from the Windows defender and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists then follow the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to&nbsp;disable&nbsp;third party security software (if any installed), and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disable Antivirus:</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp;Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<h2>            Error message when Windows 10 Home tries to wake from sleep</h2>
                    <p>I put my laptop to sleep overnight. It will work fine and awaken for a period of time but then it won't boot and I get the below message. This has happened at least 3 or 4 times. The computer is a Toshiba S75Dt with an AMD Quad Core A10 at 2.5 GHz, Windows
 10 Home, originally 1TB HDD but now 250 GB SSD (problem occurred with the HDD also), 12 GB DDR3 RAM. Anyone have any idea what's going on and how to fix it??</p>

I'm told my system is up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used an installation USB and first tried self repair to fix system won't boot. Message was that self-repair couldn't fix the problem. Then tried to fix the boot sectors manually using CMD and various bootrec commands. Tried SFC. No success. I've reinstalled
 the system twice with clean install and this last time using a recent backup. Same problem keeps happening. I will try just shutting down overnight instead of sleep to see whether or not the problem recurs. I don't usually shut down my computers but this particular
 laptop is in my bedroom and the lights are disturbing. Thanks for trying to help.</p>

<p>Did you perform the clean install using an updated Windows 10 ISO file? If not, we suggest creating an updated Windows 10 installation media using the Media Creation Tool. You can get the tool from this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">link</span></strong></a> and then follow the steps under
<strong>Using the tool to create installation media to install Windows 10 on a different PC</strong>. If the issue persists even after using an updated installation media, we recommend using the
<strong>Fresh</strong> <strong>start</strong>. Lets you perform a clean reinstallation and update of Windows while keeping your personal data and most Windows settings intact. Fresh start will remove most of your apps from your device. For more information
 regarding <strong>Fresh</strong> <strong>start</strong>, please refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4012986/windows-defender-track-your-device-performance-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I did a clean installation using Media Creation Tool. I'm not going to go further at this time. The computer no longer ever sleeps. If I leave it on continuously I just have the screen shut off or I just shut down the computer overnight. Too much trouble
 reinstalling all my apps. I'm sure this problem will go away with one of the future updates.<br />

    <title>projection mode - flashing screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arbitrage_553  say:</h3>
<h2>            projection mode - flashing screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a very annoying issue for a while: the screen of my laptop flashes once, and I hear the 'device connected' sound. After a few seconds (sometimes 1, but it can be 4-5), it flashes again with the 'device disconnected' sound. It is completely random:
 sometimes it happens once, and nothing for a day, but sometimes it is repeated 6-7 times in a minute.
</p>
<p>I tried many things to solve this:</p>
<p>- I restarted my PC in safe mode, and disabled 'Problem Reports and Solution Control Panel' and 'Windows Error Reporting Service'</p>
<p>- I tried to refresh the graphics driver, and other drivers</p>
<p>- I checked if I have anything uncompatible, but I don't have <span>Norton AV, iCloud, nor IDT Audio</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is something I recently recognised: after I hear the 'device connected' sound, if I push the mouse to the right, the cursor dissapears and goes forward to another desktop, which I haven't connected (it takes a few more seconds to pull it back).
 So I went to Settings after the first flash, and I saw someting like in projection mode:</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92c9c050-6f54-4638-8d3d-da26e565efb1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92c9c050-6f54-4638-8d3d-da26e565efb1" height="142" width="469" /></a></p>
<p>After the 'device disconnected' sound, and the flash again, it went back to normal, and I saw screen 1 only.</p>
<p>I cannot even imagine why this happens. I hope you can help!</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your answer. </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have a laptop, so occasionally I do connect a printer, but obviously it is not always pluged in. I have been using a Logitech wireless mouse since the very beginning. I disconnected the USB part of it, and used the touchpad for a few hours, but it didn't
 help. This issue is still random.</li><li>I clean my device sometimes, including the USB ports, with an air duster.</li><li>The laptop is using wireless internet.</li><li>I don't have an external monitor, however, rarely I project to a Smart TV, but the last projection was about 2 months ago.</li><li>I didn't make big changes. I think it may help that my antivirus software is not Windows Defender, but Panda Security.</li></ul>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the information provided. The issue could be due to a recent update on the driver. Since youâ€™ve already tried to update the device driver and it still does not resolve the issue, we suggest rolling back the device driver to a previous version.
 To perform the said task, you may refer to this support article: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to temporarily prevent a driver update from reinstalling
 in Windows 10</a></strong>. Please check on the section which says <strong>Rolling back a device driver</strong>, follow the steps and let us know how it goes. Please also bear in mind that this support article is applicable to Windows Version 1607 and Version
 1511. If youâ€™re running a higher version of Windows 10, please let us know in order for us to provide a more appropriate troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weâ€™ll be waiting for any updates on this soon.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't mention it, but this was also a troubleshooting step which I tried: the driver restore. I rolled back to a previous version of the graphics driver, and it did not help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answering the question, I have Windows 10 Pro 1709.</p>

<p>Thank you for the information. Since youâ€™ve already tried to rollback to a previous version of the driver, we suggest checking the settings if the device is set to Tablet mode. To do so, please follow these steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Access device settings by typing <strong>Settings</strong> using Cortanaâ€™s search bar.</li><li>On settings, choose <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Tablet mode</strong> on the options.</li><li>Please make sure that under When I sign in, the option is set to Use desktop mode.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep us posted regarding the concern and if further assistance is necessary.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this helps, but I tried to go to Event log, and there were events connected to a 'WHEA-Logger' event 17. It is in the warning category, and has been quite frequent (15756 events since 17th Dec).</p>

<p>Thank you for the update and the additional information. The WHEA-Logger Evet ID: 17 usually refers to a corrected hardware error. Which means that there is a possibility that this is the root cause of the issue. To continue troubleshooting, we suggest addressing
 the issue on WHEA-Logger first then check if that will resolve the issue. To resolve the error, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/whea-logger-event-id-17-issue/5afd422c-2196-4eb5-be83-ea7db8997648">thread</a></strong> which has a reply marked as answer in regards to resolving the issue with WHEA-Logger
 Event ID: 17.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 compatibility issues</h2>
                    Not able to play NFS 2, road rash on win 8 &amp; there are lot of other programs which I am not able to open. I wonder why backward compatibility is not taken care. I will be moving to linux/chrome. The only advantage in windows is that lot of programs are
 available. &nbsp;Now that, lot of programs became useless, there is no point in using windows.&nbsp;

            <p>If you have a legit copy of XP then several options are available to you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can delete and format the Windows 8 partition and go with XP.&nbsp; You can run a Virtual machine inside of Windows 8 and run XP as a VM.&nbsp; You can dual boot XP and Windows 8.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>This covers the whole gambit of virtual machines in "Home" versions if you want to have a look at it.&nbsp; Of course you will need a licensed copy of XP to install and&nbsp; run in any of them (except XP Mode).</p>

<h2>            Volume control has red &#34;X&#34; on it and I have no sound</h2>
                    My sound has stopped. In the lower right hand corner is the volume button but has a big x on it , when highlighted it says&nbsp; " No Audio Output Device is installed" where did it go? However when my son plays a game on the internet there is sound for the
 game and the x on the volume goes away, but when I try to play music there's nothing and my computer freezes up. when I shut off the computer and turn it back on&nbsp; the volume icon is back with an x on it. Any idea's what's going on and how to fix it? Thanks,
 Cheryl

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Fixing a customer problem: â€œNo Audio Device is Installedâ€ when launching sndvol on Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2009/01/06/fixing-a-customer-problem-no-audio-device-is-installed-when-launching-sndvol-on-windows-vista.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Also update or re-install the driver.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition
<br />
Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and<br />
RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to<br />
see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take<br />
several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower Right click<br />

<h2>            First party fighting games.</h2>
                    
<p><span>When the original XBOX was created,Microsoft had a first party fighting game called Kakuto Kojin,the game failed miserably but it's more then time for another first party franchise to be created;but an entirely different franchise
 that is good enough to compete with the new Mortal Kombat in terms of story and gameplay.Also</span></p>
<p><span>I think it would be a really good idea if they somehow created a second first party fighter that was only playable with the Kinect,and had the same quality as the controller based first party fighter.</span></p>
<p><span>Nobody can say that these ideas are bad,because we really need exclusives,and almost everyone on XBOX LIVE would love to have exclusive fighting franchises.</span></p>

<p>I know it's tough to make a great fighter,but to not ever try again,is pretty lame don't you think?,there are certain things that every fighter today needs...counters so the fighting stays balanced,no infinate combos,always need a secret character that you
 can fight against,good story for each character,different costumes for each character,stage fatalities,and fatalities for characters if the game is going to be a violent one,good controls,tutorial mode,no very easy mode,just easy mode to beyond very hard mode
 spectator mode when waiting in a lobby,tournament mode,and a good number of characters.If Microsoft follows these simple rules when making a first party fighting game,it will most definately be a hit.</p>

<p>Unless they somehow reeled in the Street Fighter fanbase I don't think it would be very lucrative. The fighting game genre is very niche as is. Every one that is popular now is at the 5th or 6th (In the case of SF 50th) entry so they already have an established
 fanbase. Not to mention fighting game fans are quick to hate on another game they don't play without giving it a solid try first.

<p>[/quote]Every fighter? That sounds more like Mortal Kombat than any other fighter. Also, just adding counters doesn't mean the fighting is balanced. You say it's simple rules and a definite hit, you're wrong. You're listing stuff from other fighters, nobody
 is waiting for a cheap ripoff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>@DigiLuigi Every fighting game from an outside view can look like a cheap knockoff. Soulcalibur V for instance has implemented freeze frame over-the-top moves mostly prominent within 2D fighting games. While they both are used to do massive damage they operate
 differently due to different fighting game mechanics. Street Fighter Ultras have invincibility frames all the way through, while Soulcalibur V can be stuffed during the start up frames of the Critical Edge. That right there drastically changes how one game
 can be played from another.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Honestly it's all about how the way developers allow things to connect and play off one another that gives a fighting game it's own personality. If all you do is mash it out then there is very little differences. The most noticeable differences I can think
 of from a button mashers perspective is whether or not a character can move into the foreground or background and if projectiles fly from there hand/feet/eyes/mouth/chest.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>With all that being said I would love to see more mature themed fighting games. It's part of the reason why I want a new Killer Instincts and Bloody Roar made. Fatalities and blood wouldn't make a game a MK clone.</p>

<p>Bring back Bushido Blade. One good hit and you're dead. One non fatal hit and lose use of that limb. I know most people are too invested in the crappy trend of mega super combo nonsense that all fighting games seem to have but bringing back something so
 brutal and pure might just be what the genre needs. I know I'd buy it.</p>

<p>The problem with a Kinect fighter would be that the moves would be limited to what the player could actually execute. That, or some kind of trigger move would need to be performed to initiate complex or "special" moves. That would really rip the player out
 of any sense of connection to the game &amp; ruin whatever realism may have existed. Personally, I'm not into fighters, but I know a&nbsp;few fighting game players (one of them won a state Tekken competition). One of the biggest things for them is the one-on-one competition.
 How would that really be implimented with Kinect? I guess they'd have to stand in front of the TV (space provided) and literally beat the crap out of each other. Honestly, for all practical purposes, I think Kinect fighters are a bad idea.</p>

<p>I couldn't copy the syntax and cmds from the command prompt page, so I tried to copy the 'windir.xml '</p>
<p>&nbsp;but that didn't work out so well either. </p>
<p>&nbsp;CMD #3: I did get this return:&nbsp; 'requested service is already started'.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I checked the win\sftwrdist location and Lo and Behold, there it was.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; I'm ubmitting this reply 'B4" restarting my comp. Hope it works, but if not, THANKS Much for the help.

<p>Did you try the Create Media Tool?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The crucial step is deleting the partition with windows 10 pro after booting to the installation media and before installing windows 10 home. That is a "clean install." Expand all the directions on the win 10 download page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean install will remove all your files and programs, so make copies of all personal files beforehand and store those on external media. All added programs will have to be reinstalled.</p>

<p>Use the media tool to create the ISO as suggested.&nbsp; The thing is that the resulting ISO contains BOTH Home and Pro.&nbsp; At the start of the install, you must make a choice.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT - by default you'll be offered PRO and I suspect that that's what's catching you out.<br />
