<h2>            error 1068&#58; the dependency service or group failed to start</h2>
                    <p>I am using a HP Z600 Workstation running Win7 Pro. I am using a WLAN USB Adaptor to connect to our office network for internet and printing. Due to a HDD crash a few months ago the HDD was replaced and everything re-installed. Running without a problem for
 the last 2-3months my Wlan adaptor stopped working - I merely thought it had seen its day and purchased a new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It Installed correctly and the light flashed a few times but No Wireless Netowrks are available, under Network &amp; Sharing I went to Change Adapter Settings - The Lan and WLan are present but Wlan is Grey and Disabled, Double clicking or Right Clicking and
 choosing Enable does not work, It shows Enabling and then Enabled but it stays grey and&nbsp;shows Disabled. Diagnosing the Device/problem only states that there might be problem with the driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Device Manager I have tried the following without success:</p>
<p>1. Updating Driver - Windows has determined the driver software is up to date</p>
<p>2. Roll Back Driver - No difference.</p>
<p>3. Disabling and Enabling</p>
<p>4. Uninstalling the Device - restarting and re-installing without success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Wlan Adapter is a Tenda 300Mbps Wireless N USB Model W322U, I installed the drivers supplied without connection software. I have uninstalled again, reinstalled with connection software. Without success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Searching the net, I came across numerous of the same cases and tried the following:</p>
<p>Under Services I checked that the WLAN&nbsp; Autoconfig works and set to Automatic&nbsp;but when I want to start it I get the Error 1068: The dependency service or group failed to start - I then checked the Depedencies Under the Wlan Autoconfig and all of them are
 running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried a System Restore to the day before the problem started also without success.</p>
<p>I tried - &nbsp;Type in the following commands in cmd prompt(with admin privileges):<br />
<br />
net localgroup administrators localservice /add<br />
net localgroup administrators networkservice /add</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In CMD - I ran sfc/scannow and got the following:</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was anable to to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.log - I cannot open the log file.</p>
<p>How can I try to fix this without re-installing Win7 again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can anybody give me advise? I am desperate!</p>

            <p>Hi
Eddiepret,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums the place where you can get solutions for Windows which has issues. As the issue
 is with connecting to the wireless network, try these methods and check:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Check if the WLAN AutoConfig service dependencies are started and set to automatic:</span></p>
<p><span>¬∑ Extensible Authentication Protocol (Started, Automatic)</span></p>
<p><span>¬∑ CNG Key Isolation (Started Automatic)</span></p>
<p><span>¬∑ NativeWiFi Filter (might not exist)</span></p>
<p><span>¬∑ NDIS usermode I/O Protocol (might not exist)</span></p>
<p><span>¬∑ Remote Procedure Call (RPC) (Started, Automatic)</span></p>
<p><span>¬∑ DCOM Server Process Launcher (Started, Automatic)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>First, let‚Äôs check for the dependency services of ‚ÄúWLAN Auto Config‚Äù and make sure that all the dependency services are started.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>services.msc</strong> in the Start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate the ‚ÄúWLAN Auto Config‚Äù service.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right-click the service and select ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click the ‚ÄúDependencies‚Äù tab.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Make a note of the dependency services of ‚ÄúWLAN Auto Config Manager‚Äù and make sure that these services are started and the startup type is set to ‚ÄúAutomatic‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>To start a service, right-click the particular service and select ‚ÄúStart‚Äù or ‚ÄúRestart‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>To set the startup type of a particular service,</span></p>
<p><span>a. Right-click the service and select ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Under
<strong>General</strong> tab, make sure the <strong>Startup type</strong> is set to
<strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>The WLAN AutoConfig service cannot start, I suggest you copy the following files on another Windows 7 machine which WLAN AutoConfig service can start normally and import them
 to the problematic one.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Locate the wlansvc.dll file under the folder C:\Windows\System32. Remove the old one and paste the new one.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click the Start Button, type "cmd" (without quotation marks), in the search result list, right click on Cmd.exe and select Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Note: If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>d) In the popup window, type the following command and press Enter:</span></p>
<p><span>e) regsvr32 wlansvc.dll</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before
 you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Navigate the following registry key on another Windows 7 machine and export it. Then, please copy and import it on the problematic machine.</span></p>
<p><b><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\Wlansvc</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 touchpad stops being responsive after an hour of use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kanishka_sinha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 touchpad stops being responsive after an hour of use</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 4 with a bit of a strange issue.<br />
<br />
After using it for about an hour, the touchpad becomes unresponsive. It moves the cursor sometimes if I move my finger over the touchpad a few times, other times it gets stuck.<br />
<br />
The fix is that I go to All Settings/Devices/Bluetooth and other devices and then I click on 'Surface cover' and 'remove device'. Then if I detach the surface cover and reattach it, after a second the touchpad starts working fine again for about an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is something to do with the driver but all software seems up to date and all the diagnostics say there is nothing wrong. I have in the past uninstalled Windows and Office and reinstalled it, but the problem persisted. I have also purchased a
 new keyboard, but I have the same issue.<br />
<br />
I can still function because I know the fix. But it's really frustrating to keep going through the rigmarole of 'removing device' and then reattaching it every half hour to every hour.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know what could fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your help in advance.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help Vicky,</p>

</p><ul>
<li>I can't think of any recent changes made prior to the issue. It's been there since I bought the machine as far as I can remember. It was there pretty much from Day 1.</li><li>I have a 32bit Windows 10 OS</li><li>I have shut down and restarted my Surface many times. I have even uninstalled Windows and Office and reinstalled to see if it helps. But the problem reappears. I have done a force shut down as well (not specifically for this issue). But that hasn't helped.</li></ul>

<h2>            I accidentally disabled my display adapter &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    <div><span>Hi,</span></div>
<div>I have recently bought a new Toshiba laptop from Qusmio serie.</div>
<div>I have two Display Adapters connected to my PC:</div>
<div>1) Intel HD Graphics Family.</div>
<div>2) Nvidia Geforce GT-540M.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I accidentally disabled my main display adapter (Intel) through Device Manager (Start &gt; Run &gt; "devmgmt.msc"). Yes.. I know I'm an idiot :/</div>
<div>Anyway, since this moment, my screen has stopped showing anything - only empty black screen. Also external screens I had tried to connect hasn't worked.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I run Windows 7 Home Premium 64 Bit&nbsp;<b>in Hebrew.</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There must be a way I can re-enable my display adapter. I am begging for an answer - I am really desperate!</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Xbox 360 Discs and DVDs won&#39;t play on my Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>My Xbox One has not been able to play DVDs since August, I thought nothing of it since I have an Xbox 360 still which is what we use to watch DVDs on. However, recently, I&nbsp;discovered that my Xbox One will not let me install or play Xbox 360 games even though I have been able to previously install the game and play it on it before. I had previously removed said game before due to not having enough storage space on my Hard Drive.</p><p><br /></p><p>Those in Tech Support that I&nbsp;spoke with suggested it is possible that the Preview Program was causing issues and that I'd need to&nbsp;factory reset everything on the device, which I did with the same results. I'll put the disc in and nothing happens at all even though I&nbsp;can install/play xbox one titles and even play blu-ray movies on the device but still can't install/play xbox 360 games or watch dvds. I've even sent a 'report a problem' to the preview program to see if it can be fixed which I&nbsp;have my doubts. Any suggestion

<h2>            Application Restrictions don&#39;t allow unblocked applications to run.</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Other Windows Live Family Safety issues
<p><br />
</p>
<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Family Safety are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I have App Restrictions turned on to block all applications except those that I allow. It was working somewhat, but now it's not working at all. I tried uninstalling and re-installing, and it still doesn't work. I can edit the allowed list online and it saves
 just fine, but I still can't run the app on the kids account. If I click the request access button, when the blocked warning pops up, and enter the Live ID and password and click the "Allow" button it still doesn't allow access. I've even tried rebooting to
 see if that updates the allow list. Still no go. The programs that I'm trying to allow don't depend on any other program or DLL. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
I just tried turning off App Restrictions and it's still blocking them!<br />
<br />
Okay. I created a new user and added it to Family Safety. I applied app restrictions to it, and they aren't working. I can run anything a normal account can, when it should only allow three programs. I locked down the internet and that works. It only allows
 sites in the allow list.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

            I'm not sure what you mean by refresh the filters. If you mean to refresh the filter's web page, I tried that. Also, it's been more than 12 hours since I setup the second user account and set it's restrictions. Web filtering and everything else works,
 just not App Restrictions.<br />
<br />
Ooops. I clicked on your link and read it. I tried refreshing and it says it has the latest changes.<br />

            Ok. I did steps 1-4 and then made sure that the Windows Live directory had been deleted from the hard drive. I then decided to login to the Kids accounts and see if the uninstall was successful. The new test account worked fine, however the old kids account
 won't load any programs. It doesn't say that they're blocked, but nothing loads! Somehow Family Safety screwed the kids account. I haven't reinstalled Family Safety yet to test it, but I have a feeling that it's not going to work properly. I think I should
 backup my kids data and delete that account before reinstalling Family Safety. I think it's done something to that account that has permanently screwed things up.<br />
<br />
I backed up the data and deleted both the kids account and the test account. I made sure their User directories had been deleted, and created a new kids account with a different user name. I reinstalled Windows Live Essentials and rebooted the computer. I then
 added the new kids user account to Family Safety. I went online and setup the restrictions and logged into the new kids account. I opened the Family Settings panel and refreshed it. Then, I tried running things that should've been blocked, and they ran. I
 logged off and wrote this from the parent account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

            <span>Hi reighnie</span>,<br />
<br />
Are&nbsp;there any&nbsp;third party programs installed in your computer that is similar to Family Safety that can restrict program/application access? Have you disabled all third party services in Startup at msconfig. Please make sure to disable all third party programs
 and disable non-Microsoft services leaving WLMesh to run. For steps on how to do this, kindly follow the steps I've provided below:<br />
<br />
<span>1. Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>, type
<strong><span>msconfig</span></strong> into the search&nbsp;box and press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>. The System Configuration window opens.<br />
<span>2. </span>Click the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab in the System Configuration window.<br />
</span><span><span>3.</span></span><span> Uncheck the box next
 to <span>any non-Microsoft programs found there</span>.<br />
<span>4.</span> Click <strong><span>Apply</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.<br />
</span><span><span>5.</span></span><span> Restart your computer.</span>&nbsp;
<p><span><br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have a Windows 7 64 bit computer. After updating my Explorer 8 browser to Explorer 9 yesterday, I noticed my Google toolbar in Firefox browser became disabled as a consequence of the IE browser update. I then performed a system restore. This enabled the Google
 toolbar in Firefox. However, after starting the computer, I now get the following message: "could not load file or assembly sortkey.nlp or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified."<br />
<br />
Please advice. Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What you need to do here first of all is to change the way you receive updates. With Automatic Updates enabled, the operating system will reinstall the &nbsp;prompt which is KB3035583 after you uninstall it which will be a step we'll take in a minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So proceed as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click the Action Center icon on the taskbar and go to "Windows Update".</li><li>In the left hand menu, click "Change settings".</li><li>Change it from Automatic Updates to "<em>Download updates but let me choose whether to install them</em>".</li><li>Click "Save Changes" and then click "Control Panel Home".&nbsp;</li><li>Go to "Programs and Features" and click the link to "View installed updates".</li><li>Copy/paste KB3035583 into the Search field top right and when it appears below, right click it and select "Uninstall".This is a large installation so uninstalling it can take several minutes.<br />
</li><li>Reboot next and then go back to Windows Update again.</li><li>Since you now have different WU settings, click the link if there's any which are awaiting your approval which will take you to the menu where you can decide what to install.</li><li>If you see KB3035583 in the list, right click it and select "<strong>Hide update</strong>". The box you normally have to checkmark to select an update will turn grey and when you exit WU, those files will be sent to the repository called
 "Restore hidden updates".You can restore any updates which have been hidden in there at any time by clicking the link, making your selection and then selecting "Restore".</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The next step is to make a registry change which will prevent Windows 10 from downloading and installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hit Windows key + R to launch the Run command, type:&nbsp;<strong>regedit&nbsp;</strong>and click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE --&gt; SOFTWARE --&gt; Microsoft --&gt; Windows --&gt; &nbsp; CurrentVersion --&gt; WindowsUpdate --&gt; Auto Update --&gt; OSUpgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Click the OSUpgrade key (which looks like a folder) and then in the right hand pane you should be able to see four values called respectively:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>AllowOSUpgrade</p>
<p>KickoffDownload</p>
<p>KickoffSource</p>
<p>OSUpgradeInteractive</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some or all of these will have a value of 1. You need to change those to a&nbsp;<strong>0</strong>&nbsp;like you see in the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad437e83-9ad6-4dda-992b-8023976f29f1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>To change a registry value, right click it and go to&nbsp;<strong>Modify</strong>. In the&nbsp;<strong>Value field</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom, change the figure 1 into a&nbsp;<strong>0</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Click OK and Windows will add the 0x00000000 (0) itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If it's already a 0 then you don't have to touch it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition, you need to create a value. To do that, right click a blank part of the right hand pane and choose New --&gt; DWORD with the name&nbsp;<strong>DisableOSUpgrade</strong>.&nbsp; Windows will add REG_ to the beginning of DWORD after you create
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you inadvertently lose the highlight when you create the new value, right click it and select Rename.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Next, right click your new value and go to Modify. Change the 0 into a<strong>&nbsp;1</strong>&nbsp;in the Value field. Click OK to confirm and exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Reboot and then go to Windows Updates. You will now be able to install 8.1 updates without being nagged by Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

    <title>Windows 10 wifi dropping out and printer connectivity issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ekl123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 wifi dropping out and printer connectivity issues</h2>
                    <p>A helpful technician deleted my program files and I was told that I could not have windows 8 for the re-install, only windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very unhappy about this because Windows 10 is not stable. I have the same wifi dropping out problems as many of the other users. The only thing that works is to stop and re-start the DHCP server. However, although this allows me to get onto the internet
 initially, I continually lose the connection after a short period of idol time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I cannot connect to printers via wifi on a brand new Windows 10 computer. I tried with an HP-Envy for 7 hours over three days with the HP technician. We got nowhere. I then purchased a Canon Pixma TS6000 and still could not connect the computer
 with the printer. The printer showed that it was connected to the internet and I printed out all of the configuration information. Still, my 2-month old Windows 10 computer could not recognise the printer, nor the IP address, despite having loaded the drivers
 from the installation CD.&nbsp; I tried various options, including turning off the firewall, reducing security to make sure nothing was blocked, etc. I tried with another computer running Windows 10 and had the same problem. So, two printers and two computers both
 having the same problem suggests that it is something in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now given up on wifi and&nbsp; purchased a 5 m printer cable, but feel like I am going back into the dark ages with Window 10. I can't tell you how much time has been wasted since changing from Windows 8 to 10. I really don't feel that customers should
 be subjected to an operating system that is so problematic, especially when we have no choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If your PC or laptop originally came with Windows 8.1 installed, there are several ways and conditions that you can go back to it. Feel free to check out
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027936/windows-go-back-to-windows-7-or-windows-81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong> for more information and steps on how to go back to a previous Windows version. In your case,
 restoring your PC to factory option is the best way to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the problem with your printer, we suggest <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">updating your drivers to the latest version</a></strong> as a first
 troubleshooting step. This will check your drivers for any updates that may not have come with the installation disk from your printers. Try this out and see how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye to your response.</p>

            <p>It took some digging, but this is how I kept the On Screen Keyboard (OSK) from popping up on my Dad's laptop with Windows 8.X:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel\Ease of Access\Ease of Access Center\Use the computer without a mouse or keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a check box to have the screen come on at log in.&nbsp; Just uncheck it.</p>

<h2>            Various BSODs related to Ntoskrnl.exe at startup</h2>
                    
<p>I am getting various BSODs (0x7e, 0x1e, 0x3b, 0x1a, etc.) at startup in Windows 7 64 bits. Sometimes it's at the Windows logo loading screen (the logo gets blurred and then there's a bsod) and other times it's just after the desktop has been loaded (sometimes
 it gets blurred too). I usually am able to use my computer without problems after 1 reboot.</p>
<p>I did a clean install and ran memtest+ and Windows memory tools a couple of passes but no errors were found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are 2 of the minidump files :</p>
<p>http://cid-881d8f7b6596855f.office.live.com/browse.aspx/Public?uc=2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are my computer specifications :</p>
<p>ASUS P5LD2 (latest chipset drivers and bios version)</p>

    <title>I want to use Window Movie Maker 6.0 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john e. sasser  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want to use Window Movie Maker 6.0</h2>
                    <div>I tried downloading K-lite but that didn‚Äôt work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have Windows Movie Maker 6.0 and ‚Äúit‚Äù has no sound.&nbsp;&nbsp; It‚Äôs as if the sound in WMM is turned off.&nbsp;&nbsp; This may help understand my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I imported a video clip into WMM and then saved it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got on
 Facebook and uploaded it and it worked...with sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I sent you a video clip you would be able to hear it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you sent me a clip, it would open in WMM, I would not be able to hear it; it would have no sound.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My main purpose for using WMM is so I can e-mail a clip (usually less than 3 minutes in duration) to my family and friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have Power Director 7 for making Home Movies&nbsp;but it won‚Äôt let me e-mail anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I use WMM for short clips to e-mail.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now comes Problem 2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I‚Äôve reloaded WMM 6.0, I‚Äôm unable to ‚ÄúE-Mail‚Äù from WMM.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can work on the clip and save it and get into my regular e-mail, Window Live Mail&nbsp;(Hotmail) and mail it as an attachment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So I have 2 problems...1) no sound and the e-mail doesn‚Äôt work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Additional information.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use to have Windows Movie Maker 6.0.6002.18005.&nbsp;&nbsp; It came with my last computer which had Vista Home Premium.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got this computer, which has Windows 7, &nbsp;I didn‚Äôt like the Movie Maker that came with it so I got on the
 internet and downloaded the version I had on Vista (6.0.6005.18005) and I‚Äôve been using it for about 2 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently I picked up a virus and I had to do a ‚ÄúRecovery‚Äù.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I went to download my old version of WMM, and put it back on this computer, it
 is no longer available on the internet.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If I could just get another copy of WMM 6.0.6005.18005 all my problems would be solved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know if there is this version of WMM out there and where?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Another Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got on Microsoft's web site for downloading software and downloaded the latest version of Windows Movie Maker but it won't open...it says it's not compatible with my computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>P.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</div>

<p>Confused by your comment that you 'paid the money' as iTunes is free from Apple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your next step is to connect the iPad to the PC with the charging cable, with iTunes running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Itunes should recognise the iPad and allow you to connect to it. &nbsp;Not sure where you go from there as I have never had a locked iPad. &nbsp;Presumably iTunes will offer up some solution. &nbsp;If not check with the apple fora at apple.com.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Deleted App Icon Won&#39;t Go Away - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> horsepigeon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Deleted App Icon Won&#39;t Go Away</h2>
                    So I deleted the Alexa app from Windows 10 by right-clicking on the app icon and hitting Uninstall.&nbsp; The app icon appeared on my start menu twice for some reason and only one of them disappeared when I deleted the app.&nbsp; Now the other Alexa app icon is
 still there and doesn't work (obviously) because the app was uninstalled.&nbsp; How can I delete this dead app icon from my start menu?

            Go into Safe Mode to delete the icon.

<br />Start &gt; Type Msconfig &gt; Press Enter

<br />Select Safe Boot
<br />Press Apply, Ok

<br />Once the system loads in Safe Mode &gt; Right click on the Icon &gt; Select Delete

<br />Uncheck Safe Boot
<br />Click Apply, Ok
<br />Reboot
<br />Windows will boot normally.
