<p>[quote]At least 10 non-sequel Kinect games will be announced at trade show E3 next month, Eurogamer can reveal.
</p>
<p>One source told us these games "won't be obvious". Another source said Microsoft is expected to "serve the hardcore" at E3 with its Kinect announcements[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm glad there's some new Kinect games on the way, mine has been a little neglected compared to the use it got a couple of months back with the arrival of some quality games (MK sits pretty at the top) and a PS3.</p>

<p>As much as I dislike the term "hardcore" I don't see how hardcore can be compatible with Kinect. It is imprecise and laggy which is the complete opposite of what is required for hardcore games. At best they will probably be hybrid games with stuff like headtracking
 which all seems rather pointless to me. I do not want to shell out yet more money for an overpriced peripheral, instead I want more games for my ordinary controller that is what I brought the Xbox for after all.</p>

<p>See, this is where I disagree strongly because I think the use of both a controller and Kinect is exactly the way to go asit's something that really enhances games. Head tracking in Forza 4 is a big step forward and makes a huge difference and it will be
 the same in first person shooters when a developer finally gets around to it. The other beauty of Kinect is that if you don't want it, you don't have to buy it - there's plenty of traditionally played console titles around.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't particularly like the term, "Hardcore" either so I agree there - but I guess it's something we will have to get used to for a while at least.</p>

<p>What the hell? These forums are awful it just posted a blank post and signed me out. The gist
</p>
<p>of my last post is that from the article it seems boring and a real waste of MS's resources Rare making Kinect Sports 2 is a joke and confirms that their studio might as well be dead.</p>

<p>Hmmm i'm yet to be convinced of the value of headtracking and £100 is a lot for the priviledge. While I acknowledge that no-one is forcing me to get Kinect that is not up for dispute, what is, however, is the argument that this focus on Kinect is to the
 detriment of &nbsp;"core" titles. Take Rare for example, they were working on Kameo 2 (a sequel to one of my and my gfs favourite early 360 titles) and PD2 only for them to be cancelled in favour of Kinect. The fact that they seem to have completely abandoned their
 traditional IPs is a real shame too. I don't have much hope for anything exciting from E3 and if a Halo remake is the best MS have to offer it will be a crap show for me at least.

<p>===================</p>
<p>Thats what i have said before but no one seems to know what i was on about. Trying to turn your head while keeping your eyes fixed on the screen is so unnatural and quite uncomfortable.</p>

            If all you have is the .VOB file try renaming it to <br />
.MPG and Windows Media Player should play it.<br />
<br />
As for playing a DVD...<br />
<br />
FWIW...Win XP cannot natively recognize Commercial<br />
Video DVDs...it requires a DVD Decoder.<br />
<br />
If you could previously play Commercial Video DVDs...<br />
doing a System Restore to a time before this started<br />
might be your fix.<br />
<br />
Or you could purchase a DVD Decoder at the following link:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

            It's easy to get a DVD player you can buy an external dvd player for less than 30 dollars on amazon.  Most people don't use them any more that's why they've been omitted from most designs.  Apple's laptop design also lacks a dvd player in some models.  I'm sorry you are having buyers remorse, but It happens to everyone.   <br /><br />I'll give you a few links so you can have a dvd player.<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rioddas-External-Portable-Rewriter-Superdrive/dp/B07H183PZQ/ref=zg_bs_1292113011_7?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=PPAE77KD9EGJNHHYJAMA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Rioddas-External-Portabl...</a><br /><br /><a href="https://www.amazon.com/1895-Animo-External-Optical-Compatible/dp/B07M6NV52Z/ref=zg_bs_1292113011_9?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=PPAE77KD9EGJNHHYJAMA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/1895-Animo-External-Opti...</a>

            Hi Peter
<br />
<br />Microsoft stopped bundled native DVD Playback since Windows 8 because of a couple factors. 
<br />
<br />- They licensed the built in codec for DVD Playback from Phillips and stopped paying the royalty license fees. 
<br />
<br />- More notebooks stopped including DVD drives and to cut cost, Microsoft decided not to include DVD playback since they would not want to pay for something that might not be available.
<br />
<br />-- There are third party players such has the free and excellent VLC Player. 
<br />
<br />Download official VLC media player for Windows - VideoLAN

<p>Thanks for your reply, but I don't know about you but I want a DVD player in my computer.</p>
<p>Its just another big CEO big shot scheme to screw the public into spending more money so that they sit back and make more money off the working people. I should not have to buy a DVD player. It should come with the computer. I know Mac still includes them.
 I do a lot of DVD editing and I find it handy to have this option available to me.</p>

            Well everyone(corporate fat cats) are doing away with DVD players, and eventually everything will be streamed or digital, I'm sorry this doesn't help you, but as it's looking disc media will go the way of VHS eventually.<br /><br />Roughly 1/4 or more of laptop now don't have a disc media drive and most things, if not all things are available digitally.  I don't need disc media; I have about 20 terabytes of space scatter across multiple portable/regular hard drives. You are special in a sense because most everything and everyone has vacated from dvd to blu ray and streaming.  For someone like yourself taking a dvd drive out of a computer is equivalent to taking a limb off, for someone like me and most other users we'd never notice it was gone that's what usb ports/usb flash drives are for. <br /><br />100% of all current mac book pro don't have dvd drives<br />Take a look for yourself.<br /><br />I hope you find what you want out there,<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Yomy Thomas

<p>Hi Adetoun,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>What is the USB device you are using? Does it have it's own power supply?</p>
<p>Are you plugging the USB device into a powered USB hub?</p>
<p>Have you changed any hardware&nbsp;recently? How long ago did this start happening?</p>
<p>I suggest performing a clean boot to see if a startup program is causing a conflict:</p>

<p>The developers ate not going to do it for us, then let's do it by ourselves.</p>
<p>You can still download the REAL Skype, which is the version before this ridiculous update.</p>
<p>Unable the app store from automatically updating your apps, remove Skype then install the older apk.</p>
<p>You can find it in apkmirror.com. Have fun</p>

            <p>Windows cannot disable the interface itself, all it could do is essentially disconnect itself from the output from the USB devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when you disable the interface in the BIOS it still works to allow entry into the BIOS settings otherwise you couldn't get in to turn it back on. The one exception would on some older motherboards with PS2 ports you would need to connect an old keyboard
 but whatever else Windows cannot turn the controllers off at this level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try alternative ports, on a desktop the two under the LAN port seem to be best for boot time devices although I have no technical reason why.</p>

    <title>App icons mixed up - Simple solution if only a few icons are impacted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sf321  say:</h3>
<h2>            App icons mixed up - Simple solution if only a few icons are impacted</h2>
                    <p>The icon for one of my apps recently switched to that of a different app.</p>
<p>As a result, whenever I had both the app with the wrong icon and the app from which it "stole" the icon open, the taskbar showed 2 instances with the same icon.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also, files that open with the respective app showed the same wrong icon.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That's a hassle if you are used to select files or switch between apps based on the icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless the affected app link is on your desktop or a user folder, type the name of the affected app in the Start / Search box, and choose "Right-click → More → Open File Location" to
 find the start menu link.</p>
<p>Once you opened that file location, right-click on the link there, once again using "Right-click → More → Open File Location" to find the original *.exe file.</p>
<p>{Going 2 levels deep should suffice to find the original app file.}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turned out that only the link under</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\</span><span>Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\</span><span>Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
(for all users, typically C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs)</p>
<p>or for user-specific start menu items:
</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>%APPDATA%\</span><span>Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>%APPDATA%\</span><span>Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></p>
<p>(usually c:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs)</p>
<p>had the wrong icon.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The original *.exe file that the affected link pointed to still showed the correct icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>{Note: In case the icon for the original file is mixed up, rebuilding the icon cache might be the only option - see below.}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to correct the icon for the link, I had to re-create it in the<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\</span><span>Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\</span><span>Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></p>
<p>location, which is write-protected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You will need to switch to an Admin account to delete or better rename the link to sth. like "*_wrong", then go to the location of the original *.exe file, and e.g. Ctrl-Shift-drag it with your mouse to the
</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\</span><span>Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\</span><span>Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></p>
<p>folder to create a new link, which then should show the correct icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the name of the link in the Start Menu is often more descriptive than the name of the original *.exe file, and when you create the new link it will typically show just the name
 of the *.exe file, sometimes including the .exe extension.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>In order to fully restore the original link name you will need to rename it, also as an Admin. Hence, it is helpful if you just renamed the mixed up link so that you can easily copy/paste
 the portion of the original link over the new link.<span>&nbsp; </span>Don’t forget to delete the "*_wrong" link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your link with the wrong icon was in a user-specific folder such as the
</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>%APPDATA%\</span><span>Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>%APPDATA%\</span><span>Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></p>
<p>or another folder (incl. Desktop) under
</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>%USERPROFILE%</span></p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>%USERPROFILE%</span></p>
<p>you will not need to switch to an Admin account to make the above changes to the link folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have more than a handful of icons mixed up, see e.g. the "</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-desktop/icons-mixed-up/6b29ae3b-f64c-4f81-a67f-72bda3ab3137"><span>Icons
 mixed up</span></a><span>" thread indicating how to rebuild your icon cache:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117229-icon-cache-rebuild.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117229-icon-cache-rebuild.html</span></a><span>, or the description in the "</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/files/mixed-icons-in-windows-explorer/e9f3f84b-d5df-41d8-9ba4-0f91e61df8e4"><span>Mixed
 Icons in Windows Explorer</span></a><span>" thread.<span>&nbsp; </span>That should fix the issue in most cases (I personally have not tested it, though).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this lengthy description will help shed light on some of the situations with messed up icons, and will help you fix it.</p>
<p>Once you figure out how to diagnose and fix the above, following the steps is actually less daunting than the length of the detailed description above makes it appear.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello Ram345,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Recycle bin does not backup or store any of the files from your computer. The files and folders would exist in the recycle bin only when you delete
 them from your computer. There is no setting that allows the files to be in the Recycle bin.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you verify if the files exist on your computer including My documents and empty recycle bin.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Make sure that you backup files on your computer before you empty recycle bin. You can refer the below article that will give you information
 on ‘How to backup data’:</span></span></p>

</p><p>This BUG has been brought to&nbsp;<span>Windows 10 for a long time , probably&nbsp; since Version 1607, and still remains unfixed untill now (Version 1709, Build 16299.15)</span></p>
<p><span>In early windows 10 version such as 1511, this function works fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here comes the most </span>weird thing. I'm pretty sure about my OS is fine. I've reinstall my windows 10 system and the sharing function is just fine on other network adapters such as ethernet or wi-fi adapter, even
 a 3rd party VPN client adapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The function just can't work on windows build in vpn client (WAN Miniport adapter) .</span></p>
<p>I hope Microsoft engineer can fix this bug soon . I have been waiting a long time for this and posted an question before this one&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>It is not about VPN connecting problem. It connects smoothly. </p>
<p>It is about I can't enable&nbsp;<span>Internet Connection Sharing function on your any kind windows build-in VPN adapters, weather it is configured to PPTP, L2TP or ikev2.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It's nothing about the VPN provider, actually It is me who set up the VPN server.</span></p>

</p><p><span>All I know is this function doesn't work since&nbsp;</span><span>Version 1607(maybe earlier version</span><span>), but still works fine on

<p>Hi Dxt00,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some more research on my end I've found that, it appears, that Split Tunneling has been turned off in the later versions of Windows 10 by default due to some security concerns. It can/must now be enabled by executing a simple PowerShell command, more
 complete information and instructions can be found at the links below;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If you're referring to an&nbsp;incoming regular phone call&nbsp;while on&nbsp;a Skype call, the Skype call should put on hold. Tapping the

            Hi Mohammed.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the Touchpad driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you also have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then enter Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  go to Mice &gt; Touchpad and then Driver tab.  Choose Roll Back or if not present choose Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />See the troubleshooting steps here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4027866/windows-fix-touchpad-problems-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402786...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad to go over the Settings.  Then choose Additional Settings which opens the Mouse properties box.  The Touchpad software installs a tab onto it - usually the last one - that should have more settings to check, including gesture features of that touchpad and a checkbox to Disable Touchpad when USB pointing device is atached.  This prevents palm drag from causing the cursor to jump
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi again Mohammad -
<br />
<br />Yes for HP get the latest touchpad drive for your Serial number on sticker on PC from this link:  <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a>.  This will refine it more than just the full model number, although you can use that too.  
<br />
<br />Then continue with the rest of the steps.  The latest driver usually fixes things and makes more needed settings available.

    <title>Wireless Printers Don&#39;t Stay Connected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curmudgeon10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Printers Don&#39;t Stay Connected</h2>
                    <p>My HP Desktop runs Windows 10 64 bit and has had the same hardware configuration for three years.&nbsp; I use an ASUS RT AC68R router and have about ten wireless devices connected to it, although it is rare to have more than two in use at one time.&nbsp; WiFi connections
 throughout the house are excellent.&nbsp; Up until the Windows Update that auto installed on or about 12 January, I had no problems with my wireless printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond that date, both my HP 110 Envy and Brother QL-710W Label Printer drop WiFi at the same time.&nbsp; I cannot say with precision when it is, but in the latest case, I reestablished the connection about five days ago.&nbsp; Just now when I sat down in the office,
 I noticed both had dropped off line.&nbsp; The other times this has happened, it was the same basic story: after a few days, the connection was dropped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reestablishing the WiFi connection is not a big issue: both connect up right away once one goes through the steps.&nbsp; The Brother Label Printer procedure is a PITA, however, because it requires several steps, including connecting the printer to the PC with
 a cable first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this is a Windows problem, and not a problem with my hardware, or its configuration since all my system elements have been stable for many, many months --- the only changes to the system have been through Windows updates and upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I troubleshoot something like this?&nbsp; (Please don't ask me to "check cables" or run the Troubleshooters).</p>
<p>

<p>I figured it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have controller plugged into a console&nbsp;with a cable and make sure the controller is controlling the console while it is plugged in (before when I unplugged the controller at this point it wouldn't sync). Push and hold the power button
 on the console till it (and the controller) turn off. I then wait a few minutes then I turn on the colsone with the controller power button. Let the console boot up then unplug the controller and it "should" work.</p>

<p>I have the same issue so I did some research and IPv6 is slowly being rolled out by Verizon but I couldn't find out what areas have it so I called Verizon and the tech I spoke to had no Idea what IPv6 was lol he checked with a co-worker who said it's not
 in my area and they&nbsp;had no timeframe for the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not too put off by the lack of knowledge because&nbsp;I had Comcast not too long ago and their network is really bad (and so was the support) in my area while Verizon's speed and reliability are top notch so I will quietly and patiently wait and hope I get
 someone who knows what IPv6 is the next time I call. :)</p>

As for the booting since DDOS attacks (posh talk for host booting) is highly illegal I'd suggest having words with the local police. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; It may be that not many people are actually playing the game.&nbsp; You should check the developer forums to see who is and is not playing the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the player list in the lobby, you would need to contact the game developer about it as that would be an in game issue.</p>

    <title>Will an Xbox 360 mic work with an Xbox One console&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxd1g1talr0sexx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will an Xbox 360 mic work with an Xbox One console&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Um, hi. I have a question. I got an Xbox One S console this weekend. Since we've just moved into a new house, I accidentally munted the chat chord to the mic it came with. I still have my mic from my Xbox 360 console. I've been away from Xbox for ages due to my busy schedule. It looks like the mic input thingy to the controller looks the same as the Xbox 360 controller (small circle whole). As the title, will it work? Any help would be fab ^.^ :]</p>
