<h2>            Windows 7 Internet explorer Glitches</h2>
                    
<p>I am running windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit. <br />
<br />
this is more an informational thread, to somehow let microsoft in on some glitches in windows 7.<br />
<br />
the main issue,&nbsp;and only one at the moment, the address bar on the internet explorer flashes at times, and while address is greyed out, it flickers and has a white square in it sometimes two, and never saw three.
<br />
<br />
also, the taskbar used to glitch up under 64 bit, icons disapeared, and time would also but not at the same time. but that problem subsided after i reinstalled 7 32 bit<br />
<br />
besides that the operating system is very well made, stable, and interesting... so far!</p>

Things like that are more likely to be a glitch in you video card driver <br />
than in Windows.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; also, the taskbar used to glitch up under 64 bit, icons disapeared, and <br />

            yea, my video driver crashed, a couple times. i ended up uninstalling then reinstalling original windows 7 driver, i have not updated it and seems running ok at the moment, although the aero is lagging a bit now.<br />
<br />
my video card and driver version.<br />
Intel(R) Graphics Media Accelerator 500<br />
ver. 8.14.10.2003<br />

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Shirasagi4,</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do you recall making any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span>Disable the security software; follow the steps mentioned in the
 link below</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Disable anti-virus software</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are using non Microsoft security software, you may want to check the documentation that came along with the program to accomplish this.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> Enable the security software back once everything is done.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>M<span>ethod 2:</span></strong></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Put
 the computer in clean boot and then check to see if the issue persists</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Follow&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Step 1</strong> in the link below,<br />
</span></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows
 Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.<br />
<br />
After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Important:</span></strong></span><span><span> - Remember to put the computer back to normal
 startup follow <strong>step 7</strong> in the link.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><span><span>Run Check disk to fix any bad sectors on
 the hard drive.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Check your hard disk for errors</span></strong></span><span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Check-your-hard-disk-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Check-your-hard-disk-for-errors</span></span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>CHKDSK would try to recover bad sectors on the hard disk, during this
 process there are chances of DATA loss from that particular sector.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried doing the fixes that you recommended. Now, when I attempt to move the file onto the flash drive,</p>
<p>I get a message saying that Windows Explorer has stopped working, at which point Windows Explorer restarts</p>
<p>itself, obviously before any files have had the chance to move.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Constantly Drops iPhone Connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kingwrecker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Constantly Drops iPhone Connection</h2>
                    <p>I'm to the point of frustration over load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased an HP Envy laptop with Windows 10. It is my first windows computer I have ever personally owned, and I bought it specifically to run some CAD programs that are not Mac compatible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 WILL NOT, I repeat, WILL NOT stay connected to my iPhone 8 plus. I have tried everything, read every fix, updated every program and driver, used a brand new USB cord, all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, it will ALWAYS fail when trying to transfer pictures and videos from my phone to my computer. The Microsoft photos app will have a notification pop up that says "Something Went Wrong" and quit. This is, of course, when it decides to locate
 my phone in the first place. It's then a 5-10 minute ordeal of unplugging my phone and plugging it back in to get it to find it again, all to repeat the same process with the same end results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried EVERY photo transfer app, and they all do the same thing every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased the 2019 version of Adobe Premiere Elements, which includes the Photo Organizer, a program which I can directly load pictures from my phone. Of course, it will detect my phone, start the transfer, then fail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated every driver, uninstalled and reinstalled every program and all of my software is up to date. I have read every article and forum I can find on the topic, and tried every fix recommended. and NOTHING has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS RIDICULOUS. This is not an Apple problem. I can plug my phone in to my 2011 iMac and it loads right up. This is not a cord problem as some forums suggest. I purchased a brand new cord directly from Apple to try and rectify the problem. This is a
 Windows problem. I have been a Mac user my whole life, and now I understand why. I need this computer for work or it'd be right to Market Place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've added photos of the prompt fails I get from both Adobe Elements and the Windows Photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can someone please help?</p>
<p>

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to resolve your problem with iPhone to Windows connectivity instability. 
<br />
<br />You mentioned that you updated all of the drivers. Did you follow the methods outlined in this tutorial provided by Apple, Inc. for reinstalling the USB drivers that iPhones need to use to connect to Windows? 
<br />
<br />If you wouldn't mind, after noting the disclaimer, please follow the link and look over the steps Apple has outlined to be sure that this is the way you reinstalled the USB drivers needed for Apple. If you haven't already used the method outline please go ahead and complete it. 
<br />

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products).

<br />
<br />If you've already done the process outlined in the link by Apple, please let me know so that I can do further research on the issue.

            Hi KW.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you tried iCloud or OneDrive?
<br /><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3256907/microsoft-windows/how-to-use-onedrive-in-windows-10-to-sync-and-share-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3256907/m...</a>

<br />Lots of complaints about this USB import issue for Android, iPhone, and cameras.  If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />For USB drive not detected issue, first try steps here:  <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-recognized-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mspoweruser.com/solved-usb-device-not-r...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay, see if the Device is listed.  From it's dropdown menu change it to what you want it to do when plugged in.  Restart PC.  
<br />
<br /> Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />Run the System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>.  If the SFC cannot repair broken files in 3 attempts, check the image file integrity using DISM from Step 10 of this checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Often this is due to Windows 10 Account corruption which is epidemic.  Try creating a new Local Admin account, sign into it, test if the problem persists.  If not move your files over, check all programs run from it or reinstall them as needed, then when ready delete the old account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>

<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<strong>How to stop decreasing the File size and pixels on imported pictures</strong></div>
<hr />
<div>
<div>Hi, My acer laptop with window 7 home premium is lowering automatically the pixels and file size to the pictures imported from my android 6.0.1. It doesn't matter if it I use the Facebook messenger or e-mail to import the pictures.
 It goes from 4.5 MB to a few KB. It doesn't show either on the picture'properties any details about the camera used like tipe, ISO, white balance, etc.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In my phone the pictures looks great even with zooming every detail is there, but in the laptop it looks awful and blurry.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I got a canon camera and I imported the pictures through my phone by wi fi and then to the laptop and it's the same, on my phone the canon camera'picture are great with the original size and showing camera details and pixels but once in the laptop they are
 changed.&nbsp;<br />
Is there any way to fix that?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, Yaimara.</div>

            Instead of using the Import function, I recommend you use a USB cable to connect the phone to the PC, then use the Windows File Explorer to copy the files to your PC.

<h3> samramdeo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bullying by Microsoft.</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft this is a continuation of my question</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You disabled all 3 of my computers&nbsp; the same day thru several&nbsp; BSOD and Win&nbsp; Update for an OS you do not support anymore. As much as 120 updates at one time.&nbsp; I am unable to access most MS websites and&nbsp; cannot install any version of&nbsp; Win OS even with Media
 Creation Tool because Installation failed.</p>
<p>I purchased genuine keys for 8,1 and 10 but it failed with Media Tool. Because I installed win 10 home previously I am unable to install 10 Pro.</p>
<p>The OS is disabled after BSOD and updates and i have to reload from my DVD and restore my files.</p>
<p>I want all this nonsense to stop and MS to stop bullying me. I purchased genuine keys for 8.1 and 10 pro and Offiice 365. As I said I am disabled and 66 and suffer from depression and anxiety and do not need this hassle from you.e</p>
<p>Please remove all blocks you placed on my machines and help me to install 8.1 Pro 10 Pro and Office 365 for which I have genuine keys.</p>

<p>This is (always has been) a peer-to-peer volunteer-based public international web forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installation support is *usually* free.&nbsp; *THIS* is not how you get it.&nbsp; Try:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/products/windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/products/windows</a></p>
<p>&nbsp; ... may have to go thru the virtual assistant first, schedule a call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truthfully, this sounds more like some sort of pretty simplistic installation issue if you have the product keys and installation media (bootable Windows 8.1/10 media - preferrably USB stick for speed/compatibility.)</p>

<p>Your answer is evident: what you are attempting to do is beyond your current skill level, leaving you with either finding someone to assist you (in person) and teach you the skills you are lacking OR finding someone with the skills you are lacking to just
 do this for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This assumes that what you have presented here (or at least what anyone can decipher from it) is correct and you have legitimate product keys for Windows 8.1 and/or Windows 10 and these are available for use on the system(s) you are wanting to install them
 onto.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It boils down to:</p>
<p>- Create bootable installation media.</p>
<p>- Update the system BIOS (per manufacturers instructions) to the latest.</p>
<p>- Change the BIOS setting to boot from said media first.</p>
<p>- Boot from said media to initiate the installation.&nbsp; (You may/may not need device drivers to inject manually during this part.)</p>
<p>- Once the installation completes, install proper updated device drivers you obtain from the various manufacturers.</p>
<p>- Update Windows with all current security (and other, if desired) patches available.</p>
<p>- Install other applications.</p>
<p>- Setup your backups and do a first test run to make sure it works.</p>
<p>- Copy your data to it and/or connect to your external media where your data is kept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One can falter anywhere in those steps and it is fairly unclear where your issue lies at this point.&nbsp; You'd need to give much more detail (step-by-step) if you are convinced this must be done DIY (especially not face-to-face, but
 goes for both methods really) for whatever reason for anyone to assist you *and* you'd have to be ready and willing to post answers to questions asked if you expect people giving of their free time and expertise to assist you with minimal 'bad attitude'.</p>

<div style="text-align: left">Your technician sounds 'questionanable' at best and like they are just avoiding the job for some reason at worst.</div>
<p>
</p><p>Addressing what may be your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>Why is it then I get no more&nbsp; BSOD and disabling of my OS when I DISABLE WINDOWS UPDATE."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sounds like a poor installation to begin with, incomplete, perhaps without proper maintenance and updated device drivers and BIOS - or really old equipment attempting to run a newer OS without support from the hardware
 manufacturer(s) for that OS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"</span><span>WHY DO I RECEIVE UPDATES AND BSOD ABOUT 6 TIMES A DAY AND UP TO 120 AT ONCE WHICH DISABLE MY OS FOR AN OS THAT YOU DO NOT SUPPORT ANYMORE."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This sounds like you have thrown another operating system in the mix here.&nbsp; Assuming you are speaking of "Microsoft" when you state, "... that you do not support anymore ...", those OSes would be Windows XP or Windows
 Vista (assuming a 17 year span there) --&gt; so which of those are you bringing into this conversation?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also, re-iterating, no one you have spoken to represents Microsoft.&nbsp; This *is* a peer-to-peer volunteer-based forum.</span></p>

<p><span>Windows 8.1 is supported (security updates) thru January 2023.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the aforementioned "120" in reference to updates, that sounds like a clean installation of Windows 7 and the first round of updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So - where to go from here?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) What is ONE of your computer makes and model that you wish to rebuild/make stable?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>All further questions center on the computer from (1) - so...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>2) What operating system (OS) was sold with / installed ORIGINALLY on the system?&nbsp; (There may be a product key sticker, what operating system does it say?&nbsp; Is the sticker legible?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Do you have any data you want to save stored on that system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Do you have the installation media for the system, the media that matches the originally installed OS that is?&nbsp; Must match version/edition/license type in some cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) You have mentioned Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 prior.&nbsp; How did you obtain each of those (be specific - if you purchased them, from where and what type of license - retail or OEM)?&nbsp; Do you have installation media for each?&nbsp; Do you have product keys for
 each?</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Shenan</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in possession of a Dell Inspiron 5559 with Win 8 Pro installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I simply was stating I am too old for these computer problems and want to do what i can to solve this with your help because i am not knowledgeable enough and my technician cannot help me because he said MS changed their rules with software installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 8 Pro only installed on my Dell Inspiron 5559 laptop. The laptop is just&nbsp; just over 2 years old and my problems are with this OS. I have purchased keys for Win 8.1 Pro and Win 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I want to fix my Dell Inspiron 5559.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) There is no sticker but I have the original Dell Windows 8 Pro DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Yes I do have data I want saved from that system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) I am in possession of a windows 8 Pro Dell installation DVD</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) I purchased these licences from a seller who represented himself as a Microsoft reseller on Ebay. I used Media&nbsp; Creation Tool to download software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) I have an 8GB USB but i do not know what a thumb drive is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) I do not have an external HD . I never heard of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) I have not accessed the BIOS on a computer but i can follow instructions and I believe I can do this by&nbsp; pressing F2 or F12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) I have installed an OS before but without any glitches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10) I am on a disability income and just went through a bitter divorce that left me penniless, My Technician</p>
<p>knows about my financial situation and how dumb i am so he is very lenient with prices. and believe me he sees me often. I am doing this to learn and to sane money.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to clarify a few information first for us to better understand your lock screen concern. Are you referring to this page:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb3f0eaa-3f8f-4864-8c76-ebaafc2de869?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb3f0eaa-3f8f-4864-8c76-ebaafc2de869?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If so, can you please explain to us what you want to do to this part of lock screen? Do you want to remove it and go directly to the login screen? Can you please explain to us what you mean by "go straight to the 'blue window'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest!</p>
<p>That is the page I am referring to.</p>
<p>I would like to remove it (and other pictures which appear), and go directly to the login screen.</p>
<p>Also, I wonder if the computer could go straight to the home page, which on my computer has the blue window motif on the right and the shortcuts on the left. That would mean eliminating the password process. But that is a secondary concern.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your assistance!</p>

<p>The lockscreen page is part of the design of Windows 10. Every time you lock the computer, wake the computer from sleep, or boot up the computer, the lockscreen page will always show up. If you want the computer to boot up straight to the desktop screen,
 you can set the computer with no passwords. Please take note that you can only set the computer with no password when using a local account. If you're using your Microsoft account as your login, you will always need a password. Please take note also that setting
 up the computer with no password will make your computer less secure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, kindly reply to this thread.</p>

<p>Hello Lilly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you accidentally tag your issue on Windows 8? I did a research about the make and model of your laptop and its supposed to come with Windows 10 pre-installed. This information is essential to properly address your concern. You can check this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Which Windows operating system am I running?">
<strong>article</strong></a> to help you verify which Windows operating system you're using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A misconfigured device driver can cause a USB port to malfunction. For now, I suggest running the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17614/automatically-diagnose-and-fix-windows-usb-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Automatically diagnose and fix Windows USB problems">USB troubleshooter</a></strong>. This tool will
 scan your laptop for any issues with your drivers and fix them for you. The troubleshooter applies to Windows 7 to the latest version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Calling out Gamertags or "naming and shaming" is a violation of forum conduct. If you want to report them properly, file a complaint against each tag from your xbox 360, block communciations, &nbsp;and Private Message a moderator if need be, but this post, as
 is,&nbsp;is clearly the wrong way to do so.</p>

            <p>Just a heads up - sending a PM to support agents about messages or observations of ToU violations on the console will result in us asking you to file a complaint against these individuals on the dashboard. It's the quickest way to get your complaint heard, as all complaints are reviewed by the Xbox LIVE Policy and Enforcement team within 24 hours. Generally - PM'ing us just delays that process. Thanks!<br /><br />For more information on this, please visit our sticky post regarding filing complaints, here: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/26/t/19139.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/26/t/19139.aspx</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm having this same issue. &nbsp;Whenever I try to access my account I get a message like this:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Uh oh... that shouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>It appears you've found a glitch in the system.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>My Gold sub recently ran out and my credit card has changed since the last time I renewed my sub. &nbsp;Whenever I log on to my GT on my 360 it kicks me offline and gives me a message that my account is suspended until I update my payment info, but instead of
 doing that I'd like to just deactivate my Gold sub and go to a Silver (why can't I just do this on the console, or better yet why didn't it automatically switch me over when it couldn't charge my card?). &nbsp;I guess I'll have to contact support.</p>

<p>It is Always better to create new thread for your own issue, but you can try <a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://billing.microsoft.com</a> to see if you can update the payment options there.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The same solution applies you you as well. Please contact Xbox Support for this issue, they are the only ones able to fix issues when you can't access the payment options yourself.</p>

<h2>            Desktop Right-Click Popup Menu gone</h2>
                    <p>After installing Insider Preview Build 10547, I have lost the ability to Right-click a blank portion on the desktop and to open a popup menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens if you right-click the desktop and click View ( or Appearance, my Windows 10 is not English )&nbsp;on the popup menu that opens, and then uncheck Show&nbsp;desktop items. After that you lose right-click popup menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can right-click on the Taskbar. You can right-click on the start button. You can right-click any icons on the system tray. But you cannot right-click a blank portion on the desktop. This wasn't so in the previous builds, I believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I cannot revert the changes because the right-click popup menu is gone. And I do not know any other place where I can click Show Desktop Items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I have another desktop with Windows 10 Build 10240. Here I unchecked Show desktop items. But I can still right-click the desktop and popup menu pops up. The following screenshot is from Windows 10 Build 10240.</p>

 to do it manually, but how do I know which files I need to transfer to my new pc and what can I overlook. Someone please guide me. Thank-you

            <p>Are you now in Windows 8.1 and are the Speakers now working correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What make and model Laptop do you have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>See if you can identify the correct Windows 10 Sound Driver that you require.&nbsp; It might be possible to download it from your OEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try right-clicking on the actual Driver Setup.exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This will help you identify the correct driver you require.</p>

            Done that already like 50 times but still as you said tried it and no fix. After that I used Sound troubleshooter as posted above and this time it did show that the problem has been fixed, restart to take effects. Restarted and hope for something good
 but nothing happened T_T<br />

<p><span>Hi THYchild,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The cause for the error
<strong>This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1)</strong> is because the device has no drivers installed on the computer, or the drivers are configured incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, I’d recommend you to access the following Microsoft article and click
<strong>Diagnose and repair problems with devices </strong>and follow the on-screen instructions to automatically diagnose and repair problems with hardware devices not detected or not working on your computer:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above article also contains solutions to some common problems with universal serial bus (USB) devices. Read through the article and check if
 you can fix the issue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also delete the
<strong>USB Upper Filter &amp; Lower Filter</strong> Entry and check if that helps. </span>
</p>
<p><span><br />
Before we go any further, please first backup the Registry. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Important</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added

            <p>Hi Kaustubha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this procedure to work, the DVDs you have must be full versions of Windows 8, as you cannot
<strong>upgrade </strong>Windows 8 x32 to Windows 8 x64. This also means that if you want to install a 64 bit OS, you'll need to do a clean install. Copy the files you wish to keep to a external disk or flash drive, and clean install the OS. You'll need to
 reinstall all you programs later.</p>
<p>

            <p>You will first need to migrate to Windows 8 Pro 64 bit, then upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit throughout the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Resources: <a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/how-to-obtain-64-bit-installer-and-create-install-media-for-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to obtain 64 bit Windows 8 installation files.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is my computer 64 bit capable?</strong></p>
<p>Before you can start the process to migrate to 64 bit Windows, you need to find out if your system is 64 bit capable. If you are already running a 32 bit version of Windows 8 on you system, you can find out by doing the following:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X on your keyboard</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb3.png%3fw%3d396%26amp%3bh%3d383" height="383" width="396" /></a></p>
<p>Click <strong>System</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb4.png%3fw%3d414%26amp%3bh%3d169" height="169" width="414" /></a></p>
<p>Look under <em>System</em> &gt; <strong>System type:</strong></p>
<p>There it will list whether the processor is <strong>x64 based processor</strong> or not. In my case I have 64 bit capable processor. Once you have confirmed this, you can move on to the next step.
</p>
<p>For Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 users</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb5.png%3fw%3d419%26amp%3bh%3d398" height="398" width="419" /></a></p>
<p>You can determine if your processor is 64 bit capable by using a <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
free tool called CPU-Z</a>. You can download it here. Once you have it installed, double click it and it will scan your system. Click the CPU tab and look in the
<em>Instructions </em>field, look for the instruction set called <strong>AMD64</strong> or
<strong>EM64T</strong>. If you see them, then your processor is 64 bit capable.</p>
<p>If you are running a 32 bit version of Windows, whether Windows 8 or Windows 7, you need to consider carefully the steps to migrate from it to 64 bit Windows 8. Regardless of the ubiquity of 64 bit computing, key factors such as hardware and application
 compatibility remain a issue, especially for legacy systems. </p>
<p>Does your system meet all the requirements? Having just a 64 bit capable processor is not the main go ahead for 64 bit Windows. What about other hardware such as your video card, audio device, printer and any other critical device or application you are
 using? Also, if you have less than 4 GBs of RAM, I strongly suggest you stick with 32 bit Windows 8 or consider maxing out the installed RAM before you consider upgrading and when I say maxing out, I mean 4 GBs or more.
</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to create an inventory of both your hardware and software programs. After doing that, go to the manufacturers website and check if there are any 64 bit drivers available. The manufacturer might not have native 64 bit Windows 8 drivers,
 but they just might have 64 bit Windows 7 and Vista drivers which should work. The reason why is Windows 8, Windows 7 and Vista all share the same driver model. Application compatibility remains critical, for instance, if you are running applications designed
 for Windows XP or apps that are not fully 32 bit, you might want to reconsider your decision. Applications that are 32 bit but might contain 16 bit code will not work with 64 bit Windows. So, you need to carefully think this true. If it ain’t broke, don’t
 try fixing it might just apply in this case. </p>
<p><strong>Backup, Backup, Backup</strong></p>
<p>Once you have gathered all the necessary prerequisites such as driver updates and have certified all your applications are compatible, you need to backup your personal data. There is no upgrade path from 32 bit versions of Windows to Windows 8 64 bit. Yes,
 that means you will have to reinstall all your drivers (64 bit native drivers) and applications. Some additional configuration might be required on your part.
</p>
<p>The best way to handle some of the migration chores is by using the built in Windows Easy Transfer utility (specifically) for Windows 7 users. If you are running Windows Vista or Windows XP, make sure you
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download the free Windows Easy Transfer utility</a>, install it and create a backup of your personal files and settings. Lets take a look at doing that.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fimage_thumb4.png%3fw%3d437%26amp%3bh%3d345%26amp%3bh%3d345" height="345" width="437" /></a>

</p>
<p>You have a few options to choose from, the best one would be an external hard disk which is excellent for storing large amounts of information. If you don’t have an external hard disk, you can save your backup to a network share if one is available.

<p>Once your files are backed up, its time to start the migration.</p>
<p>If you attempt to start the installation of a 64 bit version of Windows from within a 32 bit version of Windows, you will receive the following error message.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb6.png%3fw%3d444%26amp%3bh%3d142" height="142" width="444" /></a></p>
<p>Which is understandable, since you are running a 32 bit version of Windows. To begin the installation, we will need to restart the computer and boot from the disc or USB thumbdrive which contains the installation files. So, click the close button.
</p>
<p>Restart your computer then load your BIOS and set it to boot from your DVD drive or USB thumb drive. You might need to consult your computer manual for instructions how to do this. See the following article for additional instructions.</p>
<p><strong>To learn how to change your BIOS options to boot from the DVD drive, the following tutorial:</strong></p>

</p><div>
<p>Hey folks, its been a long time since I have published a new article, been quite busy since the start of fall, so I have not gotten back into the groove of things just yet. With the release of Windows 8.1 which promises to improve the overall experience
 of Windows 8, I say why not start off with how to get it. </p>
<p>First things first, I suggest you check Windows Update for the latest updates, make sure your system is fully updated before attempting to install Windows 8.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f10%2fimage_thumb.png%3fw%3d453%26amp%3bh%3d176" height="176" width="453" /></a></p>
<p>Open Windows Update and click Check for Updates</p>
<p>Once your system is fully updated, we are ready to install Windows 8.1. You might want to do things like disable your Antivirus temporarily, disable startup items. Unplug any unnecessary devices.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/store-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f10%2fstore-3_thumb.png%3fw%3d360%26amp%3bh%3d246" height="246" width="360" /></a></p>
<p>On the Start Screen, click the Store icon</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/store-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f10%2fstore-1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d453%26amp%3bh%3d257" height="257" width="453" /></a></p>
<p>As soon as you open the Windows Store, you will see the Update Windows tile. Click on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/store-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f10%2fstore-2_thumb.png%3fw%3d455%26amp%3bh%3d258" height="258" width="455" /></a></p>
<p>The Windows 8.1 update page will give information about whats new in Windows 8.1.
</p>

<p>Click Download to start downloading Windows 8. You can keep working while the update is downloading.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/store-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f10%2fstore-4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d410%26amp%3bh%3d271" height="271" width="410" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while Windows 8.1 installs. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/image1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f10%2fimage_thumb1.png%3fw%3d458%26amp%3bh%3d367" height="367" width="458" /></a></p>

    <title>Unable to Access Conversation History from Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rh12297  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Access Conversation History from Skype</h2>
                    <p><span>I am using Skype for desktop (version 7.40.0.104) on a Windows 7 desktop PC and ALL of my contacts are now displayed as Offline although they are actually connected to Skype and OnLine.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Previously any new release of Skype is automatically installed.
</span></p>
<p><span>Currently this does not seem to be the case and hence my Skype remains at version 7.40.0.104.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At this juncture I decided to install a new version of Skype on a spare Windows 7 laptop (my secondary machine to test software releases).
</span></p>
<p><span>My contacts are now displayed as Online. However I am now no longer have access to my Skype conversation history although I did copy the entire folder containing my conversation history from the desktop PC (that runs the
 old version). </span></p>
<p><span>In the past conversation history was stored on one's local hard drive as main.db, located in appdata/Roaming/Skype/skypeusername</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Is everything now stored on the cloud? Is there a way I can upload/import my old Skype conversation history to the new version of Skype?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Please help.</span>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9217612e-afc2-4935-90b7-288043f0f66a" title="rh12297">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The New Skype utilizes cloud storage hence, only the messages for the last 30 days are displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your old chat history can still be accessed using the Classic Skype(7.40)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of the moment, there is no option to import these messages to the new Skype and our developers have not confirmed whether this will be an option on our future updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that you reinstall the Classic Skype to retrieve the old messages and to check if you will still have issues seeing online status on your contact list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>

            What version and build of Windows do you have?
<br />
<br />I was just reviewing the recent Windows Update KB articles. I'm sure I saw a problem like that. Knowing what version and build you have would narrow down my search
<br />

<br />************* Edition, Version &amp; Build Numbers **********************
<br />..........******************************************************
<br />.
<br />Although MS does not tell you, when you are asking for help, we really do need to know specific the Windows (or Office) Edition, Version AND Build numbers you are running. 
<br />
<br />Contrary to MS's wishful thinking, we are all NOT running the "most recent" version (actually Version AND BUILD!) .  Individual recurring, (obviously unfixed) Windows update errors cause people to be running older versions and builds. We commonly see people running versions of Windows that have fallen out of support because they are 18 months old due to unfixed update errors during that span of time. 
<br />.
<br />*******
<br />*******   PLEASE PROVIDE FULL Windows and Office Edition, Version AND Build Numbers
<br />*******
<br />.
<br />Report Windows Edition, Version and Build number
<br />This “copy and Paste” process will get the full Window Build and Version number information we need:
<br />.
<br />.  *  In start menu, search for POWERSHELL
<br />.  *  Click on it to open a PowerShell window
<br />.  *  Copy the following lines, between the lines of ***, not including them
<br />.
<br />********************
<br />
<br />$name=(Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).caption
<br />$bit=(Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).OSArchitecture
<br />
<br />$vert = " Version:"
<br />$ver=(Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion").ReleaseId
<br />
<br />$buildt = " Build:"
<br />$build= (Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion").BuildLabEx -match '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' |  % { $matches.Values }
<br />
<br />$installd = Get-ComputerInfo -Property WindowsInstallDateFromRegistry
<br />
<br />Write-Host $name, $bit, $vert, $ver, $buildt, $build, $installd
<br />
<br /> ********************
<br />Note: the install Date will take a minute to capture the required info
<br />
<br />.  *  Paste them in the PowerShell Window
<br />.  *  Then hit enter.  
<br />.  *  It will return something like this:
<br />
<br />Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-bit  Version: 1709  Build: 16299.431 @{WindowsInstallDateFromRegistry=18-01-01 2:29:11 AM}

<h2>            Windows white screen on startup</h2>
                    <p>tl;dr performed a Windows reset, it got stuck for a day, forced a reboot and now it boots immediately to a white screen and nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi!</p>
<p>The PC in question is an HP Pavilion Elite HPE-000 Series that came with Windows 7. I upgraded it to Windows 10 several months ago. It has slowed down considerably lately so I wanted to perform a Windows reset to restore it to factory condition. The reset
 process, however, got stuck at some point. I let it work overnight, but the next day it was still in the same place. Seeing no other possible course of action, I forced a reboot by holding down the power button. However, upon reboot, the monitor immediately
 turns to a white screen and the PC is completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            If this system was manufactured before August 2013, it is likely not compatible with Windows 10. Also, if its running Windows 10 1709, it is likely to perform worst. 
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:

<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.

            Thanks for the reply. However, there is a problem with booting the PC from a bootable install media. In order to configure my computer to boot from an external device, I need to access BIOS and in order to access BIOS I need to press F1 while the splash
 screen with the manufacturer's logo is displayed.<br />
As I've stated in my question, no such screen is ever displayed. As soon as the computer is turned on, the screen turns white and stays white and completely
<strong>unresponsive</strong>.<br />
I attempted to enter BIOS blind by just pressing the BIOS button at startup anyway, but the screen remains white and unresponsive, no matter what.<br />
Is there anything else that can be done?
