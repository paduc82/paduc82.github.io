<h2>            How to ENABLE Win XP Log On welcome screen&#63;</h2>
                    Win XP Home Edition SP3.<br />
<br />
The Log On welcome screen doesn't show at start up; - PC proceedes straight on to Win XP screen.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I've activated users "Name" (Administrator) without password + Guest;&nbsp; - they appear when I Log off/Log on.<br />
<br />
I would like the Log On screen to show AT START UP to give me the choice of selecting "Name" (Administrator) OR Guest.<br />
<br />
In Control Panel -&gt; User Accounts I've tried all available alternatives for&nbsp; On/Off Use Welcome Screen, On/Off Use Fast Switch of Users.<br />
Have also tried Power Tools Tweak UI.<br />
<br />
(Most/all hints I can find deal with how to AVOID the welcome screen to appear.)

<h2>            Why is Linux not listed under the list of operating system when opting for Windows Insider Preview program&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: <span>
Windows 10 evaluation</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to try out (evaluate) Windows 10, I found that it is possible by downloading Windows 10 Enterprise 90 days trial.<br />
I am to register before getting downloading link and I am bothered by one question at registration page. It asks me "What operating system are you running currently?" and there is a drop-down list to choose from and only Microsoft operating systems are listed,
 but I am using Linux, therefore I am unable to provide a true information regarding that question, that led to questions why there is no Linux listed? how am I gonna download it? I could just lie and click whatsoever OS while it provides quick solution it's
 not ethical (at least until someone from Microsoft tells me that it's OK to give misleading information)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I get to the point to ask whether Linux will be listed there? or I am allowed to provide incorrect and misleading information (since unable to provide correct one - that I run Linux)? Or there might be another way to evaluate Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to answer.</p>
<p>

            Hi  Dnyanraj
<br />
<br />Sorry, the Windows licences that website is selling are Volume Licence keys, they may initially activate, but will soon de-activate afterwards. Those licences are for use in a Company environment and are not meant to be sold to a private uer
<br />
<br />Honestly, you would be wasting your money buying one of those Windows 10 licences . . .

<br />eware of Product Keys Sold Separately 
<br />With the exception of Product Key Cards (PKC’s) distributed with COA’s, Microsoft does not distribute products keys as standalone products. If you see a listing on an auction site, online classified ad, or other online page advertising product keys for sale, it’s a good indication that the keys are likely stolen or counterfeit. If you were to purchase and use a stolen or counterfeit product key to activate Windows installed on your PC, the key may not work for activation, may already be in use on another PC, or it might be blocked from use later by Microsoft when the key is reported stolen.

<h2>            Participants in Skype for Business meeting in a &#34;Conversation&#34; area&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our organization just completed our very first Skype for Business Video Conference Meeting. When accessing the meeting through&nbsp;the messenger "join" in the calendar we were directed to the meeting set-up. However, when the participants clicked on the link
 in that same meeting ALL were prompted to download the Web APP and sign in as a guest even if they were Skype for Business Users. Then, they were brought into a "conversation&nbsp;video call" and not the same video call that I was in... I know that attendees are
 able to sign in as a guest so that is not that question. My question is, has anyone ever experienced one meeting essentially&nbsp;split into two meetings and all of the participants being in a "conversation" area?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, does anyone know how to get more than five +yourself to be seen at one time? I researched a little and only have come up with "<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">The limits applied to an Office 365 organization can differ depending on how long the organization
 has been enrolled in the service. When a limit is changed in the Microsoft data centers, it can take some time to apply the change to all existing customers."</span>&nbsp;Has anyone purchased more seats before? I need at least 14 people all to be seen at once and
 I don't&nbsp;care how small their little boxes are. Maybe this is a bandwidth issue....?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unseen&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, if people have installed Skype for Business on their computer, they will go to Skype for Business after click “Join Meeting”. In this situation, please check if the invitation is sent to their Office 365 mailbox correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, since I haven't seen the issue “separate meeting” before, could you please provide an example and a screenshot of the separate meeting? Please send the screenshot to me via Private Message. You can access Private Message via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, may I know if participants can communicate with others in another “separate meeting” you mentioned?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>4. If the wrong audio device is listed as the default audio device, click the correct device, click
<strong>Set Default</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the audio device might require you to restart your computer.</p>

<h2>            Full DirectX 9.0c End-User Runtime &#40;November 2010&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
How come Microsoft/MS hasn't posted its full DirectX 9.0c End-User Runtime (November 2010) on the Internet? I don't want its dxsetup.exe to download parts online on my crappy Internet connection. :(<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance. :)

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have purchased a Contec08 blood pressure monitor. It came with a sync CD + software.</p>
<p>However, it will not be recognised by the computer. It begins by saying 'Installing drivers, etc. But then comes up an error message "Drivers not installed"</p>
<p>I have checked the internet and the only version of the software is v.1.0, which is what came with the unit.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am running Win7 Pro (64 bit) on an AMD i5 4 core processor, 4Gb RAM.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for any help</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            High CPU usage after windows 10 creators upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Around couple of weeks back I upgraded my SB i7 16GB performance base to windows 10 creators edition. With recent set of updates I am encountering an issue where CPU randomly jumps to 100% usage. It gets so slow that I couldn't locate the culprit task in
 the process explorer. Only way to resolve is to reboot the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else encountered this post windows 10 creator's upgrade? or is that a know issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Yolvi thanks for the response. There is not anything different that I am doing pre-windows 10 creators update. I do not use any third party antivirus as well. Basically I use it for software development, and use software's like Visual Studio, IIS, SQL
 serve etc. Other apps open at the time when this happens are adobe acrobat PDF reader, windows notes etc. I use edge and chrome browsers continuously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This usually happens after heavy continuous usage for 5-6 hrs. Usually system freezes and I am barely able to use touchpad or touchscreen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting steps tried-</p>
<p>(I) ran sfc/ scannow and found no issues as such.</p>
<p>(II) Tried looking for the application and system logs in the event viewer but not really nothing I can pinch on as there are always different errors.</p>
<p>(III) Windows is up to date with latest drivers and patches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on what else I can try? Is this a known issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Abhi</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge that you are experiencing with the high CPU usage on your computer can occur due to several reasons. Since you've already tried running the System File Checker tool and the other steps that you have mentioned, kindly try to do a clean boot
 on your computer. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This would help us isolate the issue more. To do so, kindly follow the steps in this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly get back to us once you're done with the clean boot.</p>

<p>I'm striking the same issue. According to Task Manager the culprit is Microsoft Edge.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each open Edge browser process (in the background, doing nothing, on a static page) is consuming 25-50% of CPU on a Surface Pro 4 (2 Cores). &nbsp;This continues for hours. With enough tabs open the machine is almost unusable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as all Edge browser windows are closed, CPU returns to around 10% or less. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find this deeply ironic - in my case the "program that is&nbsp;incompatible" turns out to be Microsoft's Edge ...</p>

<p>Son coches DLC exclusivos,que se conseguian al reservar el juego en una tienda.Estaban el Alfa Giulietta 2011,el BMW M1 Coupe 2011,el Honda CR-Z 2011,el Mini Clubman 2011,y el Subaru Impreza WRX STi 2011.Yo lo reserve en el Game,y el DLC de regalo por reversarlo
 en el Game,era el Subaru WRX STi 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>La unica manera de conseguir alguno de ellos,era reservandolo en alguna de las tiendas,aunque siempre se puede conseguir,si alguien tiene alguno de los codigos DLC y te lo regala,cosa un poco improbable,o comprando uno de los codigos DLC a alguien que los
 venda.Esto es mas facil,pero algunos que he visto por ahi piden unos 20 euros por ellos,asi que.... Hay mucho jeta y oportunista suelto por ahi.</p>

<p>No lo creo.Eso no ha pasado en ninguna de las anteriores entregas de Forza Motorsport. Los coches que dan al reservar el juego,al igual que los "unicornios" (coches que dan como premio),son coches exclusivos,y no los suelen poner a la venta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Los unicos que se pueden comprar,suelen ser,algunos coches(no todos) de la edicion limitada,ya sea por separado,o adquiriendo el status de VIP,como en el Forza 3.Eso si,mas caro que habiendo comprado la edicion limitada.De hecho,ya pusieron el Pack American
 Muscle Car que venia en la edicion limitada, por 560 MSP,y el BMW M5 gratis para todos,desde el primer dia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Y sinceramente,teniendo en cuenta que en el Forza 3,el pase VIP y uno de los paquetes que venian en la edicion limitada,la pusieron el mismo dia,y a partir de ahi solo pusieron los paquetes de coches nuevos,como Summer,Exotic y demas,y no pusieron ninguno
 mas de la edicion limitada,aparte de que no venia ninguno de los coches esclusivos de la edicion limitada,ni ninguno de los coches exclusivos por reserva,en ninguno de esos paquetes,y que ya han empezado a sacar los paquetes de coches nuevos. Los coches de
 la edicion limitada que han puesto ya a la venta,seran los unico que pongan a la venta,y como mucho,el pase VIP y sus 5 coches.</p>

 started doing this. &nbsp;How do I get back to watching high res video on my tv?

<p>And i seem good to go since using cmd (launched by f10 in the installer) and diskpart, all drives are recognized</p>

<p>Turns out the issue is that the installer did not detect the flash drive as an installation disk, and booting from that same drive, then replacing it with an external drive containing a Windows 10 installer worked well and the installation worked fine and
 after all drivers were installed, I no longer had anything to worry about and my tablet is functioning normally</p>

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try unplugging the external hard drive and plugging it into another port.  Restart PC first.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Disk Management, scroll down to find the External Hard drive.   Right click on it to either change the drive letter or assign one.  
<br />
<br />If that isn't enough find the hard drive in Device Manager, right click to Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall the driver.  
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Is there a way to set Windows Live Movie Maker so it will stop going back to beginning of the project after every edit</h2>
                    <p>I am adding captions to a video. Every time I add a caption, the&nbsp; cursor and scroll bar go back to the start of the project on the timeline. Then I have to scroll down to where I was working to add the next caption. Have to do that every time, it's very
 annoying and time consuming.</p>

 it might be corrupted. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>1. Click the <b>Start menu</b>.<br />
2. Click <b>Control Panel</b>.<br />
3. Click <b>Programs</b>.<br />

6. Click <b>Uninstall/Change</b>.<br />
7. Click <b>Repair all Windows Essentials programs</b>.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>If the issue persists, please provide the following information:</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<span>Does the issue happen on any project that you edit?</span></div>
</li><li>

<h2>            How can I change the icon for an external hard drive that is shown in My Computer</h2>
                    When I double click on the My Computer icon on the desktop my external Seagate hard drive does not show the correct icon. It shows a blank page with the right top corner turned over with a replica of a small screen overlaid.&nbsp; I would really like to show
 an icon that looks like the real thing as shown in the icons folder.

            <p>Hi PhilipRoebuck, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1) Do you get any error message when you try to open the external hard drive?</div>
<div>2) Where there any changes made to the computer prior the issue?</div>
<div>3) Is the issue confined to a particular icon?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the following methods:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Icons change incorrectly in Windows</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2396571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2396571</a></div>
<div><strong>Important</strong> Before you run this the Fix It, save your data, and close the application. After you run the Fix It, your computer will restart after 10 minutes.
<div><strong>Important</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft

            <p>You need to tell us what you are trying to do--Boot to the usb drive* or trying to install windows 10? &nbsp;To install windows 10 using the iso file on a disc or thumb drive--boot
<strong>into </strong>windows 8.1 and run Setup.exe on the thumb drive. You should not boot to the usb drive at all because you will have to buy a license for win 10 if you do a clean install. Upgrading requires booting to windows 8.1 and starting the installation
 within windows 8.1. That verifies that you have the qualifying windows to get the free upgrade. Windows 8.1 must be installed and running to perform the upgrade properly. Read this and follow the links on this page for more info--</p>

<p>
</p><p>*To boot to the usb drive that has a bootable thumb drive in it, you do not change the boot order in the bios as in previous windows versions. You have to use Recovery in Settings, Update &amp; Security and select the option to boot to external media. Or follow
 the computer maker's instructions to access the Boot Menu.</p>

    <title>Screen too bright even after resetting help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen too bright even after resetting help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, okay i'm dying...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found the manual controls to lower my desktop's brightness (you know the physical buttons on the monitor). &nbsp;</p>
<p>But even at the lowest setting the screen is too *%@&amp;ing bright for late night use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone that can offer a solution would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thoughts on what a solution would look like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. reduce screen brightness below what the physical buttons let me achieve</p>
<p>2. change the color scheme so instead of white being bleach white it is becomes off-white (easier on the eyes)</p>
<p>3. download some type of app that circumvents the control limitations of my PC (my friend has an app that lets him toggle on a cyan filter making his screen much less bright)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Solutions beyond this are always appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Mat</p>

            <p>Hi Mat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you started experiencing this issue recently? If yes, then, did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>What is the exact <strong><em>make and model no. </em></strong>of your computer?</li></ol>
<p>The issue that you have mentioned, might arise if the there is an issue with the monitor (hardware), if the display drivers are corrupted or else, if the power plan needs to be reset.&nbsp;I would certainly help you to make some changes in the Windows settings
 in order to check with screen brightness. However, if they do not help in reducing the brightness, then you might need to contact your system manufacturer for a hardware checkup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turn off the automatic brightness adjustment</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong>The below provided setting might not be available on some PCs.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap <span><strong>Settings</strong></span>, and then tap
<span><strong>Change PC settings</strong></span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, click
<span><strong>Settings</strong></span>, and then click <span><strong>Change PC settings</strong></span>.)</span>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span><strong>PC and devices</strong></span>, then tap or click <span>
<strong>Display</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If the <span><strong>Adjust my screen brightness automatically</strong></span> slider is on, tap or click the slider to turn it off.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span><strong>Apply</strong></span>. </p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Reduce display brightness (might not be available on some PCs)</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <span><strong>Settings</strong></span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click
<span><strong>Settings</strong></span>.)</span> </li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span><strong>Brightness</strong></span> or <span><strong>Screen</strong></span> (depending on the features of your PC) and make the change you want.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span>Choose a power plan that saves power. </span><span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> has two such default plans—Balanced and Power saver. To learn more about power plans and how to change them, go to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/power-plans-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I would suggest you to refer to the steps provided in the following link for further assistance.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/get-best-display-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get the best display on your monitor</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, I would suggest you to try the above provided steps to diagnose and troubleshoot the issue. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

<p>I tried reloading.&nbsp; Nothing seems to have changed.&nbsp; I did notice, by the way, that there were plenty of directories and files on my hard drive in various places with file and directory names that included the characters "skype"&nbsp; even after I had removed
 Skype using Fedora's "remove software" utility.&nbsp; Apparently removing Skype doesn't remove all related files.<br />
<br />
As to the symptoms - my wife's status seems to be correct, i.e. when she is on-line there is a green dot in the lower right of the icon by her name in my contact list.<br />
<br />
But there is no such green dot by the icon for Echo / Sound Test service nor for Skype Translator.&nbsp; Should I conclude that those services are not on-line?&nbsp; I know that the Echo /Sound Test service is on-line.&nbsp; In fact I've used it several times in the last
 week, but the log shows my last usage as October 13th.&nbsp; Go figure.<br />
<br />
In yet another twist on this situation, I have a contact who also has no green dot implying that he is off-line but if I select him to chat with the top of the chat states that he is "Online with Skype mobile, only from Verizon Wireless"&nbsp; So Skype tells me
 that he is both off-line and on-line at the same time.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 issue when switching from 2 displays to 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mj kahn &#40;mj&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 issue when switching from 2 displays to 1</h2>
                    <p>I'm relatively new to Windows 10. I usually run with a second display, but occasionally use just my laptop's display. When I switch from dual-display to single, Windows 10 suddenly manages my windows very differently. Specifically, I can work with only one
 window at a time because Windows forces it to be maximized. Sometimes I can get a second window to display, but then I can't overlap the two windows - if I resize one to make it wider, the other window automatically resizes to make room for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen articles that say, "Right-click on an empty spot on the taskbar and click on 'Cascade Windows,'" but when I'm in this mode, "Cascade Windows" doesn't appear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to be able to work with my windows the same way I do when I have two monitors! Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi MJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different window management tricks that you can try depending on how you want to arrange your windows. It seems like the current window arrangement you're on is side by side windows.&nbsp;When you right-click on the taskbar, what options are you getting?
 Are you not seeing the following menu? Please send a screenshot of what you're getting on your end.</p>
<p>

<p>Aileen, thank you very much for your very prompt reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting even more interesting. I just unplugged my second monitor, and lo and behold, the laptop display is behaving exactly as I'd like it to! But I swear, when I was at home and went from 2 monitors to 1, the laptop display was behaving the way
 I described in my first post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'll have to go back home to get that screenshot. That'll be tonight or tomorrow morning. I'll post the screenshot here. (Watch - it'll behave itself from home too!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for your reply!</p>

<p>
</p><p>For now, we can color this question "resolved," although in some mysterious way. If the problem happens again, I'll be back....</p>
