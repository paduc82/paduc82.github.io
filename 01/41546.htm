                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been having strange issues recently. Since october I have had 3 BSODs when using Windows Media Center Live TV, I thought it was related somehow to the tunner, but today I also got BSOD when not using live TV (although I was testing a differnet,
 external tunner when it crashed and I was in WMC, not live TV)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tested RAM with memtest86 2 days ago, not for too long but there were 0 errors anyway.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I uploaded 3 latest minidumps that i have on skydrive:</div>

            Thanks for your answer. I have ran the memtest like I wrote and considering everything I am very sure it is not a corrupt memory. This problem only happens in windows media center. I have installed pinnacle tv center instead, running it in background to
 see if i get any issue and none at all.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am using xmp profiles in bios and did some auto tune in Asus AI Suite 3, otherwise not overclocked. Everything else even heavy games run without a single problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I will however try the driver verified you recommended, run WMC and wait for freeze and see what happens. Thanks.</div>

            I have followed the guide to Driver verifier, however after the restart i got BSOD when windows was loading: driver_verifier_iomanager_violation. The only thing I couldn't do according to guide was disabling concurrency stress test as that option isn't
 available.&nbsp;

This was Related to azvusb.sys Virtual USB Hub from AzureWave Technologies.&nbsp; Yours is dated 2009 and cant possibly work in win 8.1<br />
<br />
I would remove it (at least to test) and if you need to keep it you must update it to current<br />
<br />
You should turn verifier off by typing verifier /reset<br />
<br />
Other old drivers needing updating<br />

            I will see what I can do, thank you. By the way could you please specify, whether azvusb.sys caused all bsods in dump files or only the latest one at 17:43. If it is the latest one I think it was this other external TV tuner. Is this driver there in previous
 dumps? Thanks again for your help.
<div><br />
<div>I have searched for this driver yesterday already and if it wasn't this external USB tuner then I have no idea what it could be, as I have never used anything from AzureWave. Maybe getting rid of all the drivers connected to this would help?</div>

<div><br />
<div>these 3 are all connected to logitech drivers, I have installed all the drivers from logitech website so perhaps this may have somethign to do with WMWare Workstation and virtual drivers for virtual pc?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ph3xIB64.sys this seems to be some windows driver, no idea what it might be related to.&nbsp;</div>

No idea what version the driver is.&nbsp; It is dated 2009.&nbsp; One thing you MAY want to try is reinstalling the older drivers in "compatibility mode"<br />
<br />
<div><b>To Run in compatibility mode do the following:</b><br />
<br />

            Thank you for your help. After updating all the motherboard drivers as well as bios and gpu drivers BSODs disappeared and it hasn't happened since.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>
<div><font>I have had some other issues though:</font></div>
<div><span>once PC didn't boot or even post, fans were running, no error sounds, monitors black, kb and mouse inactive. I disconnected 1 monitor, connected other to mobo directly, removed gpu, reset cmos, removed 1 ram, then I disconnected
 the monitor from pc and suddenly keyboard and mouse were lit. So I put mobo back, connected both monitors and everything worked... I suspect it might be my old psu dying or not handeling the new GPU (R9 270x that I got a week ago, PSU is Seasonic SS-500ET,
 T3 500W OEM (bought in September 2010).</span></div>
<div><font><br />
</font></div>
<div><font>Later that day this happened out of nowhere, when starting iTunes:</font></div>
<div><font>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbaG4f2rfc</font></div>
<div><font>screen went mad, PC didn't freeze though, everything kept working. No error log in event viewer. I restarted and all good again.</font></div>
<div><font><br />
</font></div>
<div><font>Probably replacing psu is the safest bet.</font></div>

            Hi Old Beat Up,
<br />
<br />In Windows 10 if you ever need to search for anything, you can simply click your Start Button and begin typing - that will automatically bring up the search box . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />If you do want the search box back:
<br />
<br />Right click your Taskbar and uncheck 'Lock the Taskbar'
<br />
<br />Then right click the Taskbar and choose 'Taskbar Settings'
<br />
<br />On that settings page turn off 'Use small Taskbar Buttons'
<br />
<br />Close the Settings App
<br />
<br />Right click your Taskbar and choose Search - 'Show Search Box'
<br />
<br />That will bring the search box back . . .

<h2>            Xbox Games not showing Cover Art</h2>
                    So on my Xbox 360 some games aren’t showing the cover and I was wondering how do I get it to show? The games in question are: Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2 (Original), Halo Combat Evolved and some others.&nbsp;

Odribaoled</a><span>, clearing your system cache should help you in this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It could also definitely be something to do with your network connectivity. If you test your network connection and you see some errors, I suggest taking a look at the

<h2>            Themes services running but not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>since a few weeks, I'm having problems in windows 7 ultimate with transparency&nbsp;(aero).</p>
<p>One day it works fine, the next day it's not working, the next day it works... that's bizarre.</p>
<p>I found on the web that restarting the Theme service could fix my problem... it is already started so I stopped the service and started it.</p>
<p>yes it's true, things go back to normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is that the problem comes back again and again. Not every day but it's still there too often.</p>
<p>Maybe another service started after&nbsp;the themes is&nbsp;causing the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to start the Themes last so the problem could be fixed.</p>
<p>or install a patch that would fix this problem?</p>
                </div>

<h3> cdtw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Button, Apps and Task Bar reset</h2>
                    <p>So just to get some things out of the way, I have installed Win 10 three times, once was a upgrade from 7, the next was a reset keeping my files, the last was a complete reset. Each of which led to the same result. *Note each installation ran fine until
 the first com&nbsp;updates* and all went to pot from there. I have tried opening powershell as admin and&nbsp;copying/pasting code and hitting enter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problems:</p>
<p>Boot time and application start times are crazy long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Button does not respond except &nbsp;right clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Edge icon on the task bar does not display but it is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The task bar and Cortana seem to reset intermittently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates will not install, I currently have • Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3074678) - Error 0x8e5e03fa and •
</p>
<p>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3081438) - Error 0x8e5e03fa listed as failed.</p>
<p>I can not click on anything that Cortana lists during searches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following notification listed but cant click on them: Windows.immersivecontrolpanel_cw and AMD.CCC.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot </strong>and check if it helps.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>

<h2>            Unable to Remove Properties&#47;Personal Info of Photos as file remains open in COM surrogate.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone. I'm an avid photographer, taking digital pix with my Canon every day. Some are used for various projects. Prior to posting them on my website or other social media, I like removing certain informations, like properties and personal info.
 Since I have recently been forced to upgrade to Windows 10, from Windows 8.1, when I attempt to perform the mundane action of clicking on properties for a picture file, clicking then on details, then selecting remove properties and personal info, am informed
 the following:&nbsp; THE ACTION CANNOT BE COMPLETED BECAUSE THE FILE IS OPEN IN COM SURROGATE. CLOSE THE FILE AND TRY AGAIN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;HOW DO I DO THAT ???????&nbsp; THANK YOU !</p>

            <p>As a workaround, set folder view to Details and turn off the Preview pane, during the time you modify the file meta data. COM surrogate is responsible for generating thumbnail previews. (<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090212-00/?p=19173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ref</a>).&nbsp;Or
 you may end dllhost.exe in Task Manager.</p>

<p>I tried the things you suggested but there were a number of issues...There was no repair available (per Windows Recovery), EasyBCD did not affect&nbsp; the boot menu at all (It did allow me to add Ubuntu).
</p>
<p>After a long effort researching the issue, a post from Jamie on Superuser suggested that I go to Command Prompt (Admin) and enter
<em><strong>&lt;bcdboot C:\Windows&gt;</strong></em>.&nbsp;<strong> IT WORKED!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help has been invaluable for previous issues, so I thought I would pass this along just in case you would find this to be of interest. Thanks again for all your help in the past.</p>

            <p>This is what I suggest...<br />
Go to Control Panel-&gt;Hardware and Sound-&gt;Sound<br />
Recording tab<br />
Right-click your Microphone-&gt;Properties<br />
Listen tab<br />
-Make sure "Listen to this device" IS checked<br />
Apply<br />
Reboot<br />
Go to Control Panel-&gt;Hardware and Sound-&gt;Sound</p>
<p>Recording tab<br />
Right-click your Microphone-&gt;Properties<br />
Listen tab</p>
<p>-Now uncheck "Listen to this device"</p>
<p>Apply<br />
Reboot<br />
Sometimes this will kick it in the butt so to speak...<br />
<br />
If this doesn't work, any info regarding affected applications might be useful. You might also have to check settings of any&nbsp;OEM utilities like Dell Audio (If this applies to you) for configuration settings.<br />
</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps!&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the reply, but as I anticipated, the kick in the butt procedure didn't change anything.&nbsp; I didn't think it would because I also have a Dell Windows tablet, and the Listen to Device check box works on it.&nbsp; There is also nothing in Dell Audio
 related to this.&nbsp; I guess that is just the way the Conexant sound works on this machine, and there is nothing I can do about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Red X on Wifi Icon&#58; Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corinmanning  say:</h3>
<h2>            Red X on Wifi Icon&#58; Windows 10</h2>
                    After recently installing some new programs on my HP Envy laptop, I noticed that a red X appeared over my wifi icon in the corner of my screen. Even though this is there, I can still be connected to any of my wifi networks once I click on the wifi icon.
 I don't know if the problem has to do with what I have installed, but I think it is. One program I installed was utorrent, but I have since deleted it because I did not need it anymore. The other program I installed was the Blizzard Application for gaming
 and from there I downloaded Overwatch. I don't think Blizzard was the problem, but I don't know how utorrent could have effected my computer that way if it did. I looked at some forums and discussions but I could not find any answers to help me with Windows
 10. I know I am still connected and can use the internet, but this really bothers me. If you have anything that can hep or need more information regarding my problem, let me know. Thanks in advance!

            Hi Corin,<br />
<br />
<br />
One possible reason why you're getting a red X on the Wi-Fi icon is that some of the settings related to Network Connections have been changed when you installed the new programs. There are certain steps that we can do to troubleshoot this issue. Let's follow
 the methods provided by Ted Nancy on February 13, 2010 on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/network-icon-show-red-x-even-though-wireless/2cf5b096-cd1d-4d57-ab43-fd0539a24787?page=3">
link </a>and see if this will resolve your concern. The article refers to Windows 7 but it's also applicable to Windows 10.
<br />

    <title>All USB ports stop recognizing any mice. How to fix&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sidchu  say:</h3>
<h2>            All USB ports stop recognizing any mice.  How to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was playing a game while my mouse suddenly stops moving.&nbsp; I first checked to see if it was the mouse that was defected.&nbsp; I took 2 other working mouses to test every single USB port I have on my laptop and none of them work.&nbsp; But, USB flashdrives work just
 fine.&nbsp; I've done quite a lot of googling to fine some fixes.&nbsp; I've tried system restore, resetting the BIOS, and uninstalling all USB root hubs.&nbsp; I went to device manager right away after finding my mouse not working and also noticed that the device told me
 that my computer does not have a compatible driver for this mouse.&nbsp; This made no sense since it's been working fine for the past 4 years.&nbsp; Furthermore, it showed this same error for all the mice I connected to every USB port.&nbsp; My mouse is a Logitech M125,
 and supposedly it doesn't have any drivers necessary (says Logitech website) and didn't find the drivers anywhere else.&nbsp; Also, when opening device manager, there appears to be another problem that probably popped up along with the mouse problem.&nbsp; RAMDiskVE
 tells me an error code 31 which says my computer doesn't have sufficient drivers to operate this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am completely lost on how to fix this issue and not even sure what the root of the problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer is Dell Inspiron 3520 running Windows 8.1 and my computer tells me I am up to date with windows updates.&nbsp;

OK. Open a new message, then right-click on the toolbar and select <em>Customize toolbar</em>. Add the
<em>Insert signature </em>command to the list. Can you now use that command to insert any signature into a forwarded message?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to know what I can do to display my photo sources?&nbsp;I clicked to have hidden some photo programs thinking that would help to display the nature&nbsp;picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't realize they wouldn't display on the screen anymore, &amp; I would like to rediscover them.
 &nbsp;Please elaborate on what steps I should take and/or what settings I should change?&nbsp; (Where are the settings to display the photo sources?)&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            File types replaced by .MATRIX file</h2>
                    I've been using Win 10. Suddenly I see all my file types (.mp3/.docx/.ppt/.mp4/.jpeg) replaced by .MATRIX file. Now all the files are decrypted and I can't open any of them. All my valuable docs are at stake. Any suggestions how to recover the original

<p>The instructions you are following would only apply if your computer came with the "UltraNav" program installed at the factory (by the company that built the laptop).&nbsp; That's not something Microsoft builds or supplies, so you won't find it on most computers

<p>There's a few reasons it may not show:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; The company that built your computer did not include these abilities in your model.<br />

            <p>Hi Emma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your further clarification on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the updated information, it concludes that the issue is not likely to be with Windows unlike your original post where the install information was not provided. Hence, compatibility mode and troubleshooter will not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I would suggest you to contact the concerned support of the game. They would more likely be able to assist you with the issues within the game.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="https://help.ea.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">EA Help Center</a></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to post in case you get any other issues with Windows in future, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>
