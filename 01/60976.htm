<h2>            I cant get Pandoras Box to run on windows 7</h2>
                    I have tried everything to make Pandoras Box work with windows 7.&nbsp; The game released a patch but it seems to no longer be available anywhere I've looked. I've also tried running it different compatibility modes and that doesn't work either. After I install
 the game I get an error message saying this program has known compatibility issues. It then says to check onlone for solutions (which doesn't work) run program (also doesn't work) and cancel... does anyone know how to run this program I love this game!!!<br />

            I have found the patch download available here:<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/games/pandorasbox/downloads.htm<br />
<br />
If patch pandora10a doesn't fix the problem then older games can usually be run using D-Fend Reloaded. This is the easiest explanation on using D-Fend reloaded I have ever found:<br />

            Locate the set up exe file and set the compatability to winxp before you install the game, I also set the game exe to winxp compatability after installing, Game seems to be running ok<br />

<p>It's unusual not to have set a password originally. Did you have your device set to start windows without the need to input a password.?</p>
<p>Is the account used a local account or a MS account.?</p>
<p>I think it will be impossible to get past the password prompt while trying to roll back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say it lost everything from the previous build what are you referring to. Is it programs/apps or your personal files. I would suggest using Start &gt; Power &gt; Restart a few times and see if thing go back to normal in version 1709.</p>

<p>Did you try to restart a few times.</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail is no longer supported for Windows 10. When you download emails to Windows Live Mail the emails are saved in a set of database files that is used for Live Mail.</p>
<p>The emails are still available if you login to your ntlworld.com email account via a browser. The update should keep your files that are saved to the default folders, Documents, Photos, Videos etc. The desktop could be considered as disposable as it should
 only contain shortcuts. Are you saying you files are missing from the default folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure you are still signed-in using your account name. When you select Start is it your user name shown on the menu.</p>
<p>If you select C:\users do you see any similar user manes in the user folders. Also check the windows.old folder.</p>

<p>No, that folder is one used during the windows roll back process that is asking you for a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open it in File Explorer and expand the sub folders are there any files shown in a users folder.</p>

    <title>Unable to set Microsoft Edge as default web browser - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathanfisch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to set Microsoft Edge as default web browser</h2>
                    <p>I was having trouble with clicking on hyperlinks to websites&nbsp;in Microsoft Office 2013 after installing Windows 10, and uninstalling Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome (I like Microsoft Edge over those). I received the following error: "Your organization's
 policies are preventing us from completing this action for you. For more info, please contact your help desk." I have a personal computer but am using a school Microsoft account so I took it to the school help desk. They installed Firefox, set Firefox as the
 default, set Edge as the default, uninstalled Firefox and&nbsp;hyperlinks started working. The next day I had the same problems again with hyperlinks so I tried the same troubleshooting but now Edge does not even show up as an option to be a default web browser.
 I tried installing Internet Explorer as you can see from the screenshot below, still no Edge. I tried chatting with Microsoft and they were absolutely no help: they didn't understand the problem. I also tried resetting the defaults which does make Edge appear
 as the default but hyperlinks still don't work. I think the real problem is that the way Windows "sees" Edge is as something other than a program: it does not show up in any program list, you cannot uninstall it so even though you can get it to be the default
 (except now I can't even do that), it's not really (at least not in the "eyes" of Microsoft Office 2013). Seems like a problem with Microsoft Office 2013 unless someone knows of a way to fix it. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi, Piotr 
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1) launch powershell 
<br />2) Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If the above does not work, execute these commands: Re-register the Store App 
<br />
<br />Open Start screen and press Windows + R keys on the keyboard. 
<br />
<br />Run the following in a Command Window (CMD) to re-register the Store App: 
<br />powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.XML 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            I got the same error code <b>Oxc0000185</b>&nbsp; and none of my programs would load either. Instead of loading I got a window box that said "Requested data not placed into memory.....i/o error status of 0xc0000185".<br />
<br />
<u>I ran HP's internal "Hardware Diagnostics UEFI 4.3.1.0" program - got that to load by pushing F2 when booting up the machine- and ran a "Hard Disc Test"</u> which was an option on the menu given. It said it would run for about 2 hrs and after only 32 seconds
 it stopped and threw up the message <b>"Short DST: FAILED</b>".<span>
<br />
<b>Failure ID # M09HAJ-0006PH-WPWWWJ-60W403</b>.</span><br />
If you bought HP's lowest of the low budget model desktop from Best Buy (it's called the HP Pavillion 500 P2-1334 which you won't find ANYWHERE on the 2 photocopied pieces of information that they included with the computer) like I did only TWO MONTHS AGO,
 and which DOESN'T come with a Windows 8 recovery disc, then.......Go to hp's support website and contact them using "Live Support to Chat Live With An HP Technician" and what you'll get to do is....chat live with NOBODY...but you will get to fill out an information
 form which they swear you'll hear back from them via email within 24 HOURS. Ha! ....sure hope you won't need your comp. before then....<br />
<br />

                    <p>I just got a laptop with Windows 7 on it but it's different than the way Windows 7 looked on my PC.&nbsp; I've got most of it straightened out the way I want it but I can't get rid of the way the Taskbar stacks Windows Explorer.&nbsp; Here's a photo that shows what
 I mean:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e869bbc-7783-4714-99e2-43f269ede8c4" />&nbsp; That second symbol from the left is two different Windows Explorer windows and I want them in the taskbar separately.&nbsp;
 Can anyone tell me how to make Windows 7 stop stacking open windows so that I can see them all in the taskbar?</p>

If so, right click on the readyboost drive, and select the readyboost tab, then remove readyboost from the drive.&nbsp;
<br />
Does the error message stop?

    <title>HFV Cleaner Pro Hidden Files &#40;File Explorer&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shazraja  say:</h3>
<h2>            HFV Cleaner Pro Hidden Files &#40;File Explorer&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello I just got a new laptop and I installed Windows 10 on it a few days back but somehow my usb had gotten a shortcut virus! Then I removed it using HFV Cleaner Pro. After I used it on C:\ drive fearing that the virus may have gotten on my computer and
 by accident I clicked unhide files, after that it showed all the hidden files. I tried to Hide them but when I pressed Hide files it Hide all the files completely nothing to be seen.&nbsp;it felt like I&nbsp;deleted all my files.. but after that my file explorer shortcut
 in the task bar disappeared and so did my control panel one and whenever I find a way to open file explorer the icon in taskbar doesn't show and everything is hidden except the files on my Data drive
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking of resetting my pc without effecting my files but I'm worried it might uninstall Windows 10..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hello Mr. Patel,</p>
<p>I have the same problem as ShazRaja. I was able to hide unhide my files by restoring them from hfv pro. Then I did the steps you advised. There were no errors. Once I had restored from HFV pro, desktop.ini which is usually a hidden system file, keeps appearing
 on my desktop. what can I do now? I am using win 10. I want to go back to how my pc used to be. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Karen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If <b><span style="font-weight: bold">all Administrator accounts</span></b> have been removed or changed to
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Standard User,</span></b> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>there is a safety net built into Windows 7 for this situation. Perform the following.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe Mode. </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>
<p><span><span>Start your computer in safe mode: </span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
</span></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>When the log on screen appears in safe mode you will see an account named
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Administrator</span></b>. This is the <b><span style="font-weight: bold">built-in administrator account</span></b>.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>There is no password associated with this account, by default. You should be able to simply select that account and log on.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Once the safe mode desktop appears, you can go into Control Panel/User Accounts and change your existing standard account to an administrator account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>1. Open Control Panel / User Accounts.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>2. Select Manage another account.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>3. Select your Standard account.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>4. Select Change account type.<br />
5. Select the Administrator option.<br />
6. Click the Change account type button and select the Administrator option.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Exit Control Panel and reboot the computer. Log on with your normal account, which will now have administrator privileges.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
Let us know the results.</p>

            Hello <span>LovelyK14,<br />
<br />
In assistance to your issue, we need some clarification for better understanding.<br />
[quote user=LovelyK14]I sent an email and I need to recall it.[/quote]<br />
Are you referring to retracting your sent emails? If yes, please be informed that w<span>hen an e-mail was sent from Windows Live Hotmail, our servers automatically transmit it to your recipient's e-mail
 address. We currently do not have a feature that can retract sent messages even if the recipient does not yet open them.<br />
</span><span><br />
Your message is extremely important to us and what I can do for you at the moment is to take note of your inquiry and submit it to our Windows Live Hotmail Product Development Team as a feature request. They consider all customer comments and inquiries in the
 future releases of Windows Live Hotmail.<br />
</span><br />
Thanks!<br />

<h2>            Copy multiple files in command prompt</h2>
                    I want to create a batch file that copies multiple files I specified from a directory and use a command once. but when I tried 'copy file1 + file2 + file3 destDir',it copies only the first file. I do not copy all the files or files whose names share a
 pattern. So the wildcard * and ? do not apply here. What should I do to copy multiple files?

            You probably want to use a command like the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; /f&nbsp; %i&nbsp; in (list.txt) do copy /B %i&nbsp; destDir<br />
Where "list.txt" is a file that contains the list of files that you want to copy and "destDir" is the directory you want to copy them to.&nbsp; If you put this line into a ".bat" file, you may need to replace each "%" character with "%%".<br />
<br />
Or, if it is a short list of files, you could do something like:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; %i&nbsp; in (file1, file2, file3) do copy /B %i destDir<br />

<p>It's actually for troubleshooting purposes only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safe Mode with Networking starts <span>Windows</span> in safe mode and includes the network drivers and services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If your system is a name brand such as Dell, HP, Compaq you go to their sites and check<br />
with their support and they also have forums there. If it is a custom made system then you<br />
do to the motherboard maker's site such as MSI, ASUS, Gigabyte, ASRock, and so on. Those<br />
will also have forums.<br />
<br />
Most video card makers also have forums.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            Hello
<br />
<br />A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />I was looking for the list of drivers and their compatibility for Windows 10 from the Intel provider site and this driver is not compatible with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Below I share the link.
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/48011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/48011</a>
<br />
<br />I would like to know if you have already tried to update your drivers. If not, I suggest you update it. Follow the steps in this article: Update the drivers in Windows 10.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/402844...</a>
<br />&nbsp;
<br />I hope it will be very helpful and let me know so I can continue to support you.

            You should take actions related to Display Driver
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer

            Hey Admin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a used Surface Laptop and have been testing it.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Below is the related records in different sessions in the report. Could you please seriously help me check this issue?</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The ‚ÄòSystem Power Report‚Äô generates a report of what is actually draining the system battery. Screen brightness, duration of time the screen remains active, the color contrast (mainly if you have an OLED panel), currently running processes and background
 processes are few things that contribute to system‚Äôs battery drain.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That being said, in a given session the process being named ‚ÄòUnknown‚Äô shows to drain a lot of power from your system. This is because, each individual device has a specific module applied across each of the components of your system. The power estimation
 is made by running those modules against the estimation engine and then it is finally checked with the battery driver to see how much energy is consumed. Depending on each session, the process consuming the battery and the components used in the system, this
 accuracy will vary from 80% to 30%, this is the reason you may sometimes see sessions with a high number of ‚ÄòUnknown‚Äô. However, this is still displayed with the relative accuracy. This just means that the system was not able to accurately measure some of the
 attributes draining the battery, but still collectively provided a relative report of these attributes under one name.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To get accurate results, it is a requirement to use systems which have integrated metering chips.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

<p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I understand correctly then the UNKNOWN is the difference between the actual battery drained data from the battery and the estimate drain from Windows?</p>

<p>Thank you :-).</p>
<p>Usually a CRC error indicates a fault on the disc. &nbsp;These can sometimes be corrected, but not always. &nbsp;Check the disc for fingerprints &amp; scratches, and give it a clean if necessary. &nbsp;There are tools which can recover seriously damaged discs, but they don't
 always work unfortunately.</p>
<p>If cleaning the disc doesn't help, searching for that specific error on that specific game may offer more help. &nbsp;I have come across these errors myself, but each one can be very different.</p>
<p>From what I have read, installing this on Windows 10 can be a challenge, but I did find a few posts on it, like this one:

<p>Hello Gabriel!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the previously posted troubleshooting steps did not help in resolution of the issue, then I would try something that we call a soft reset.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>It's
 a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
