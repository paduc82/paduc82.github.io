<h2>            Unable to access &#40;read and write&#41; USB flash drive in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have tried multiple solutions to troubleshoot or even just to distinguish what the problem is but nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) I tried to copy and paste a file from my desktop to the flash drive but saw this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae605bd7-23b2-4b17-939e-80cc6d7a867b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae605bd7-23b2-4b17-939e-80cc6d7a867b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) Everyone including myself have permission to do everything in this drive but still will not let me. I am an administrator in this computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ba0989a-8b08-43e5-984c-06050b9619c8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ba0989a-8b08-43e5-984c-06050b9619c8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) It will also not let me write on it or open any file inside the usb drive. I already reformatted this drive to NTFS partition. It was Fat32 prior. It all just gives me access denied error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where else can I check to see if some settings are not configured correctly? I would just like to be able to transfer and write files to and from this computer. But any flash drive I insert don't seem to be working (giving me access denied errors). I would
 appreciate your help in this matter. Thank you.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem may not be with the flash drive... It may have to do with the permission\ownership settings of the computer and the files you are trying to copy to the flash drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you might try is to click the "Advanced" button at the bottom of your 2nd image... Check the "Owner" of the drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not your account, change it to your account or possibly "Everyone"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... Sometimes the permission settings on external drives that are configured on one computer may cause problems when attempting to use them on another machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also try formatting it with a bootable version of one of the free Disk Management\Partitioning programs available...</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. I already looked into one of your suggestions before posting here. I am the owner of the folder and its sub folders etc. When I changed it to everyone, nothing was changed. File explorer is still giving me an access denied error
 whenever I do anything with the folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For one of the flash drives that I have, I was able to use it to an older version of windows which is windows 7, but when I try to open it here. It does not work at all (can't open, read, and write). But in that workstation (with windows 7 installed), there
 was no problem reading and/or writing a file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it has something to do with windows 10. But not quite sure where can I do changes and how to fix this. Or it is possible that you're right that the permission settings can change when used from another computer but why does it still not work even
 when I format it in a windows 10 pc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a specific Disk Management\Partition program that you can suggest for formatting a flash drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help! I appreciate your time responding!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like Partition Wizard... Version 9.1 is the last version that is available as a free bootable download and is very hard to find... Version 10 requires you to purchase it to create\download the bootable media...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are others, but I am not sure as to whether they need to be installed to create the media or if it is downloadable separately...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as your permissions... Since you mention that your Win 7 is on a workstation\server, that may be part of the problem... You might try changing the permissions on the Win 7 machine, then try the Win 10 machine..</p>
<p>
</p><p>That should have nothing to do with a blank drive though...</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the partition wizard. I was able to install the free version for windows 10 - version 10.3. So, I just have to format the flash drive using this application, from what I've understood. Or is there anything else I should do? Please clarify. So formatting
 the flash drive did not help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the permissions in windows 7, and it is the same for windows 7 and windows 10, which is everyone. It is the same flash drive. Not sure why it will change permissions if it is used in a different computer - but worth the shot. Windows 10 has been
 acting weird every other update and it gets worse. Tried what you suggested, and it still does not do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought formatting the hard drive will change the permissions to default. But I guess it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there's another way to troubleshoot this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might change permissions if the owner is not the same...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you by chance sign in to Windows 10 with a Microsoft Account ?</p>
<p>That can sometimes cause problems...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You shouldn't need to do anything when formatting other than simply formatting, although it might be better to delete the volume before formatting and start fresh..</p>

</p><p>I sign in using our network domain account. It did cause me problems logging in with Microsoft Account in my own PC, which was a headache.</p>

</p><p>If it were not for the fact that you have multiple drives doing this, I might think you had a bad flash drive... I have had that issue before... Although if that were the case I would think formatting would fail as well..</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is already a local account made in my computer. I made one when I am setting up my computer. So I did what you suggested but it didn't work as well. The local account is also an administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already used multiple computers to test. So it looks like it's only happening in my pc. I tried to hook it up to another windows 10 pc and it worked. I'm pretty sure it has the same configuration because I setup both computers. But I'm not quite sure what
 seems to be the problem. Do you know if there is any settings that I might have changed that can be the reason why this is happening?</p>

<h2>            Xbox One - TV from Sky App Not Working</h2>
                    
<p><strong>I have been trying everyday, since the September update for the Xbox One, to open and use the TV from Sky app. What I get when I open the app is this: "Cannot connect to TV from Sky" "There's a problem connecting to TV from Sky. Try again in a few
 minutes". I have tried restarting the console, uninstalling/reinstalling the app, checking the HDMI cord...I have no idea what else to do. I do have SkyGo Extra. I can view Sky perfectly on my laptop. I feel like the update messed something up, but that is
 just a guess. Please help!</strong></p>

<h2>            Contacts Not Showing Facebook Link</h2>
                    I have the new Nokia 950. It was running horribly but now a lot better since the new patch but I've discovered another problem. &nbsp;I have contacts in my People hub that are my friends on Facebook. &nbsp;Some of the contacts show the Facebook page and status updates
 and some do not. &nbsp;My husband, for example, is one that it will not sync to. &nbsp;If I go into 'Link Profile', it does not bring up his name (like he has no account or we are not friends) and I know for a fact he is my friend on FB (of course). &nbsp;I have checked
 this and I have gone into the FB app and manually synced events and accounts in the FB Settings and it still won't show him in 'Link Profile'. &nbsp;Does anyone know why it would be doing this?

<h2>            Windows Store &#38; Apps Not Working After Installing Kaspersky &#38; Malwarebytes</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro 64 bit</p>
<p>Version 1703</p>
<p>OS Build 15063.74</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the Windows store app, it tells me I am not connected to the Internet - which I am. I get the following error codes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Code: 0x80072EE7</p>
<p>CV: jrkvIWMztUyqTaXj</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, the two apps that I have installed from the store, Instagram and Todoist, can no longer connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this stopped working on the day that I installed Kaspersky Internet Security and Malwarebytes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched around a bit and tried various things (no proxy server, ran&nbsp;cssemerg70008.diagcab, ran&nbsp;reinstall-preinstalledApps.ps1 with Kaspersky disabled, etc.). Nothing is working so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I don't want to have to do is to reinstall Windows just to get the store back!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            You need to go to Kaspersky and get their uninstalling software and completely uninstall. Just disabling does not get rid of the code that Windows 10 does not like.&nbsp; Use Windows Defender as it is made for Windows 10.<br />

<p>I removed Kaspersky for other reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this does not solve the problem with Windows Store, as it does not restore network settings it might have changed or files that it might have quarantined/deleted.</p>
<p>

<p>What I noticed was that after I used the tool to remove Kaspersky Anti-Virus, then rebooted, then store still didn't work, then saw your message, checked at file level and saw that Kaspersky Secure Connection was still there. So I used the tool to remove
 that as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooted. Store still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender is running now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have not updated this post because I was traveling. Now I'm home and hoping to get this resolved.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled Kaspersky. Rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran the Kaspersky removal tool. Rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran the Kaspersky removal tool again. Rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran the Kaspersky removal tool again. Nothing found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran the Windows Powershell Script reinstall-preinstallApps.ps1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran cssemerg70008.diagcab</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no luck.&nbsp; Still "The Microsoft Store needs to be online. It looks like you're not."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Code: 0x80072EE7</p>
<p>CV: uFwOEdbffEqp1YPI</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender is turned on. When I check Firewall and Network Protection I see:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private (discoverable) network</p>
<p>Firewall is on</p>
<p>Network is not connected</p>
<p>
</p><p>Public (non-discoverable) network</p>
<p>Firewall is on</p>
<p>Network is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check "allow an app through the firewall", Microsoft Store is checked for both public and private networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried "Restore firewalls to default".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sounds like some of the music you have has incomplete metadata / ID3 tags which is what tells the device reading the music, the track's information (Title / Album / Creator etc)
</p>
<p>You can edit this data on your windows PC by right clicking the MP3 file and click Properties. Switch to "Detail" tab and then you can eidt the MP3 information. To get all tracks from a single album to be grouped together, just ensure you give them all exactly
 the same album name! </p>

            Hi Avi.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI, UEFI is enabled, CSM disabled, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, if necessary disable Secure and Fast Boot until after install:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Make sure to follow the setup steps to complete your install.  Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

</span></span></span><span>How are you installing the game?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>First, I would suggest you to check the compatibility of the game with Windows 7 by visiting the following link.</span></strong><span><br />

<p><span>If it is compatible, uninstall the game completely and reinstall it to check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are downloading the game, check with the Game publisher about the issue.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;When you say to’ fix other programs’, what exactly are you referring to?</p>
<p>Try the&nbsp;methods listed&nbsp;below and&nbsp;check if you can run the program.</p>
<p>Method1: To run the Program Compatibility troubleshooter</p>
<p>a) Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Programs, click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.</p>
<p>b) Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</p>
<p><br />
c)<strong>If you cannot install a program</strong>, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The troubleshooter is not designed
 to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.</p>
<p>Access the link below for more information on the steps below.</p>

<p>Method2: Try and play the game performing clean boot and check if that helps, by following the link:</p>

<p>Chrome has got nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>From the screen shot posted I can see no blurring.</p>
<p>You don't mention what monitors and whether you are using extended display and default display settings</p>
<p>A lot can depend on the monitor, as I found when I purchase two new 24" monitors to replace the two 20" monitors I purchased about 5 years ago - the display/clarity is significantly better than my old ones (my eyesight is worsening with age)</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are right Chrome has nothing to do with it, it was an example to illustrate. However the difference is slight. Basally all Office is not "sharp", it is not as clear as other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken 2 snapshots one from my laptop and one from my monitors. I know there is a small difference in size but the sharpness is very different.</p>
<p>I have 2 new monitors and i am using extended display&nbsp;on Dell D3100 USB3.0. Also it is not just for outlook it looks like a lot of Microsort products don't have this sharpness.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device's display/graphics adapter facilitates the Project feature of Windows 10. Based on the information shared above, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The port that you're using to extend the display of your laptop.</li><li>If you've tried connecting one of your monitors directly on your laptop using High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), Digital Visual Interface (DVI) or Video Graphics Array (VGA) ports.</li><li>If you've experienced your concern on other programs installed on your device aside from Office applications.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>

<p>From the pics uploaded its not clear which snapshot refers to which monitor.</p>
<p>A I said when I obtained two new monitors there was a significant improvement over the previous monitors, and they were the same makers, simply the later ones were 24" as apposed to 20" and the later one was a current model (The previous ones were about
 5+ years old)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with the same background on both monitors the new one was far more precise/clear than the old</p>

<h2>            Why are there so many svchost.exe processes&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was looking at Task Manager under processes for all users and I noticed there were around 14 processes with the name svchost.exe.&nbsp; First of all is it normal to have this many instances of this process.&nbsp; They span from taking around 1,800k of memory to
 95,000k+.&nbsp; I know that some instances of this process are vital, but I was just wanting to make sure that these were all legit because I have read that this process is sometimes targeted by malware.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as
<br />
the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

<h2>            Windows Explorer stops working when ejecting USB drive</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello All,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm having a problem with windows explorer. When ejecting a USB device, windows explorer stops working and it has to restart. It also stops working when trying to get to the properties of the USB device. I looked at "Event Viewer" and there is an error log
 that says this:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Faulting application name: Explorer.EXE, version: 6.1.7601.17567, time stamp: 0x4d672ee4&nbsp;<br />
Faulting module&nbsp;name: SHLWAPI.dll, version: 6.1.7601.17514, time stamp: 0x4ce7c9ab&nbsp;<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000005&nbsp;<br />
Fault offset: 0x000000000000ae81&nbsp;<br />
Faulting process id: 0xa3c&nbsp;<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01cd974c8a303440&nbsp;<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Windows\Explorer.EXE&nbsp;<br />
Faulting module path: C:\Windows\system32\SHLWAPI.dll&nbsp;<br />
Report Id: 0d06c054-0346-11e2-ad84-00248c7a3b78&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now I had this problem on my home computer and tried replacing the SHLWAPI.dll file with one that I got from the internet, but this bugged my computer and had to re-install windows. Now that computer works fine. I'd like to get a solution to this that retains
 all my files and programs since re-installing all my programs and backing up my files at my&nbsp;school computer&nbsp;will be a big hassle.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks,&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 One Note 2016 Recording</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one know if there is a way to eliminate the pen writing sounds on Onenote 2016 when recording?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I finish a recording - and play the recording back I can hear the sound of my pen tapping on the surface as I write, is there a way to reduce the noise, or eliminate it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello Niveita, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Surface Pen also functions as your typical mouse. You may hear a clicking sound when you tap on the screen using the pen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to disable the Windows Explorer Click Sound and see if it makes any difference. To do that, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Sound </strong>in the search box. Click on <strong>Sound</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Sound </strong>tab. </li><li>Scroll until you see <strong>Start Navigation.</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Start Navigation.</strong></li><li>From the Sounds drop down select <strong>None.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>OK.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can try to lower down the volume on OneNote 2016 when you're recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If still you're unable to turn off the pen writing sounds on Onenote 2016 when recording, we suggest that you
<span>send a suggestion to help us improve your Microsoft Surface experience. </span>
<span>Sending a suggestion can be as easy as finding feedback similar to yours and upvoting it. However, if there isn’t feedback like yours, then go ahead and create some new feedback for us. You can even attach some screenshots or recreate a problem to help
 us see what you’re experiencing.</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here’s what you’ll find on the Home page:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>All feedback</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>view showing feedback from other customers and the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>My Feedback</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>view to see feedback you’ve created or upvoted.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span>A search box, with the default text<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Give us feedback to make Windows better</strong>.

    <title>windows 8 o&#47;s reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vancouvermike56  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 8 o&#47;s reinstall</h2>
                    I upgraded from vista to win 8 on October 27, 2012 over the internet. I don't have the original e-mail with my receipt, but I do have a copy of the email with my product keys for win pro 8 and media center. I need to know how I can get a copy of that email
 so i can do a restore after i format the hard drive or install a new one. I understand to do this i need to reinstall vista, download win 8 and media center, and the download the 8.1 update which i'm currently running. I can't seem to find anywhere on the
 site to request a copy of my email or a download link. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I've done formats and reinstalls of my o/s many times before because i had the recovery disks i created when the system was new. However, with the update version
 you can't create recovery disks. I did create the iso on a flashdrive for win 8.1, but i think i still need the original download link or email from microsoft.<br />
<br />
thank you.<br />

            Go to the Upgrade assistance. when asked enter activation key for Windows 8.0, finish download and this time you might want the ISO to burn.&nbsp; Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

<h3> farmgirl92  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to add audio files from iTunes to Windows Media Player library </h2>
                    
<p>Downloaded my first i-tunes song but can't get it 'into' my windows media song library. How do I get it there?</p>
<p>I have an existing library of songs on my windows media played but just had to have a song I hears and bought it from i-tunes. Sadly, I can't seen to get it to copy/move etc. from my i-tunes files onto my windows media files. How do&nbsp;I do this? I realize
 that most people are going in the opposite direction and can find lots of help to get my songs from windows to i-tunes but I am rather comfortable with windows media player and relatively behind the times as I neither have an i-pod nor plan to get one.</p>
<p>Any help you may offer would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
