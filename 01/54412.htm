            <p>Thanks for the update on that, devilchef1.</p><p><br /></p><p>We'd recommend trying a soft factory reset of the console to see if this will resolve the issue. The <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset Console to factory defaults</a> guide can help you get started with this process. When following these steps, we'd recommend choosing the option to: "Reset and keep my games and apps" so that you do not have to reinstall your games and apps on the console. </p><p><br /></p><p>However, if you would like to discuss any refund options for this game purchase, then we'd recommend reaching out to the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Support Chat Team</a> since they would have the proper tools to look into your account directly. </p>

<h2>            Create Installation Media for Window 8.1 on a Mac</h2>
                    <p>Built a new PC, trying to place installation media onto a usb. In the meantime, my only computer is my macbook. My macbook will not allow me to use Microsofts "mediacreationtool.exe" which is available through the "Create Media" button on this web page:&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media

<p>
</p><p>You can’t open the application “mediacreationtool (3).exe” because Microsoft Windows applications are not supported on OS X</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to create the installation media?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#34;System Restore is not able to protect your computer&#34;</h2>
                    My computer recently got infected by malware that corrupted the Windows system files. &nbsp;I received a blue screen of death, and was unable to boot into safe mode. &nbsp;I was able to access my files on my disc using Parted Magic, so I replaced the corrupted System32
 files with some old, functional ones. &nbsp;I am now able to boot into windows, but when I log onto a user account, I have no start menu or icons, but the desktop background and screen saver are there. &nbsp;I booted into safe mode with Command Prompt to attempt a system
 restore. &nbsp;When I type the restore command into the prompt, I receive a message saying "System Restore is not able to protect your computer. &nbsp;Please restart your computer, and then run System Restore again." &nbsp;After rebooting, I receive the same message. &nbsp;Does
 anyone know how to fix this?

<h3> zg0dzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bad connection on one console but not the other</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason my Elite (its newer and used very little) has a bad connection &nbsp;to XBL (It takes longer, some times doesn't work at all, to connect my parties. But my Pro (older and used a lot) has a better connection (I have no issues with joining parties
 and there the same parties I try to join on my elite). I use a wireless adapter to connect to XBL (I use the same wireless adapter for both consoles, I don't use both at once, I only need my elite when I need to use a disk(my pro's disk tray is broken))</p>

<p>Is there a reason for this? I tried to put the adapter in other USB ports but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also I can't just get a new console because I can't use my DLC stuff on other consoles and I can't just redownload them, I need to PAY for them again. &gt;:(&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last thing why are the Xbox Forums so hard to find? lol maybe something needs to be done about that, or did I miss something?</p>

<p>anyway thank you for reading and hope you have an answer. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>-GODS</p>

<p>Is your Elite console in the same area as your other one? If it is too far away from the wireless router, you will experience problems. Also, go in to your internet settings on your Elite, and make sure that they are the same as on your other console. There
 could be something there that is just slightly different which could cause you a problem too.

<p>Sounds like it could be a NAT problem. Have you tried the connection test on both consoles? Do the consoles get used at the same time? it can be quite difficult to have a open NAT on both consoles. I have 2 consoles, but i only use one at a time. My solution
 is to have the exact same networking detail for both consoles.</p>

            The tools menu is what he is talking about. Go to the tools, click options then video settings. There you should see what camera is being used and should see yourself if your video is working

    <title>Programs crash when opening or saving files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Programs crash when opening or saving files</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I've recently been experiencing a very frustrating problem. Whenever I try to open a file or save a file in any program, that program crashes. For example, if I'm trying to save a document in Microsoft Word, the program crashes. The same thing happens if I
 try to open a document. This happens in other programs, as well.<br />
<br />
After researching the problem, I felt that it would be best to do a clean startup, so I did so through the MSCONFIG command. I followed the instructions, and even after the non-Microsoft programs were disabled, I still had the problem. It also persists in Safe
 Mode, as well.<br />
<br />
I have run several anti-virus programs, including Microsoft Security Essentials and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, but neither were able to find any problems.<br />
<br />
I've also run the hard disk diagnosis and repair tool, and that hasn't worked, either. I feel like I've tried everything. Does anyone have a suggestion for me?<br />
<br />
My computer is an HP G72-200t notebook, and I'm running Windows 7 Professional. Let me know if any other information is needed. Thanks in advance!<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate the steps that you have tried to resolve the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you get any error messages? </p>
<p>2. Have you installed any software or hardware prior to the issue? </p>
<p>3. Have you connected any external devices connected to the computer? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may perform the steps provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also unplug all the external devices except keyboard and mouse. </p>

            I'll respond to your questions, first.<br />
<br />
1. Error messages appear when I try to save or open files in a program. For example, in Microsoft Word, if I attempt to open a document, an error message appears saying that "Microsoft Word has stopped working." I get similar error messages in other programs,
 as well.<br />
<br />
2. No<br />
<br />
3. No<br />
<br />
I ran the scan, and it said that some problems were found, but not all were able to be repaired. I tried to access the logs for the event in c:\windows\logs\CBS\ but it said that access was denied. I'm rather puzzled, because my account is the administrator
 account.<br />
<br />
As for the event error, I see several errors. One that might be pertinent to this inquiry is related to the problems with Microsoft Word:<br />
<br />
Faulting application name: WINWORD.EXE, version: 14.0.4762.1000, time stamp: 0x4bae25b7<br />
Faulting module name: msvcrt.dll, version: 7.0.7601.17744, time stamp: 0x4eeaf722<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000005<br />
Fault offset: 0x0000aa14<br />
Faulting process id: 0xcd4<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01ce5c37a85576ea<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\WINWORD.EXE<br />
Faulting module path: C:\Windows\syswow64\msvcrt.dll<br />
Report Id: e7cb09ff-c82a-11e2-bc1a-c80aa98ada62<br />
<br />
Let me know if there are other error messages you wish me to report.<br />

<h2>            dual-boot Windows XP and Windows 7 </h2>
                    1. I currently run XP and looking forward to Install Windows 7 and have Duel Windows in one PC. The question is: Do I must
<strong>Partition </strong>one of my hard disks before installing? Maybe It's ok to simply install new windows to a different disk than old win?<br />
<br />
2. my XP is 32 bit. Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor says I can install 64bit of Windows 7. Should there any problem at having 32bit XP in duel with Win7 64?<br />

                </div>

            1. Windows 7 must be installed on a different primary&nbsp;partition. The different&nbsp;partition may be on the same or a different disk.<br />
<br />
If you do not have unused space on the XP&nbsp;disk any repartitioning of&nbsp;that disk must be done before installing.<br />
<br />
If you are installing on another disk the partitions on that disk can be&nbsp;deleted and recreated during the install. Save any data on the partitions first.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. There will be no problem. Windows 7 will set up a dual boot configuration.<br />
<br />
<br />
You will need a full install&nbsp;edition of Windows 7. The licence for an upgrade edition does not permit the upgraded Windows version to continue in use.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to method below and let us know if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Windows Fax and Scan and click on Tools then Fax Accounts, there is an option to add any listed Accounts. After you have done that you could&nbsp;make it available to&nbsp;another Accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The location setting you mention could be a Location tab that is available via a right-click and selecting Properties on some of the User folders.</p>

            <p>The amount of memory allocated to the integrated graphics from system memory is controlled by the CPU/chipset based on the total available RAM. It has to be defined before the operating actually loads as changing the memory boundaries on a running system
 will cause problems with the O/S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases you may find limited choices within the BIOS screens but otherwise increasing physical RAM is the only way you can increase the amount of memory allocated to the graphics.</p>

<h2>            How can I completley uninstall a printer driver so I can start afresh with a new one</h2>
                    How can I completely uninstall a printer driver? I want to do this because installing my printer a HP D2460 jeskjet has failed numerous times. I have tried to install the latest driver but I think windows is continuing to try to install the printer using
 older software.<br />

<h2>            Error installing printer &#40;Vista&#41; on networked Win7 computer. 0x800f0214</h2>
                    
<p>Hi:<br />
I am having a problem sharing a printer.&nbsp; I am using a Dell AIO 946 printer on a HP computer running Windows 7.&nbsp; The drivers are the latest available from Dell.&nbsp; The printer is installed (using network install) and prints from the HP.&nbsp; I would like to connect
 to the printer from a HP laptop running Vista.&nbsp; When installing the printer I get an error 0x800f0214 saying that the SERVER does not have the proper driver installed and is looking for a .INF file which I do not know where to locate.&nbsp; The printer is visible
 from the laptop (wireless connection) but it will not install.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi bmelson,</p>
<p><br />
For the printer to get recognized by windows you will need to install the required drivers on the computer.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that you download and install the printer drivers depending on the type of operating system installed on the computer.<br />
<br />
Refer the below link to download the printer drivers and make sure you download the drivers depending on the version of Windows installed on the computer.<br />
<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;ServiceTag=&amp;SystemID=PRN_ALL_A946&amp;os=WLH&amp;osl=en&amp;catid=&amp;impid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;ServiceTag=&amp;SystemID=PRN_ALL_A946&amp;os=WLH&amp;osl=en&amp;catid=&amp;impid</a>=<br />
While installing the drivers you will be prompt to setup the printer follow the instructions and check if it works.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the above step fails I would suggest that you check if the printer is shared.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open<strong> Network and Sharing Center</strong> by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking<strong> Control Panel</strong>, clicking<strong> Network and Internet</strong>, and then clicking
<strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>. <br />
2.&nbsp;Click the <strong>arrow</strong> button&nbsp;next to <strong>Printer</strong> <strong>
sharing</strong> to expand the section, click <strong>Turn on printer sharing</strong>, and then click
<strong>Apply</strong>. Your printer is now shared on the network. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3.&nbsp;If you are using a computer connected to a workgroup, click the arrow button&nbsp;next to Password protected sharing to expand this section, and then check to see if
<strong>password-protected sharing</strong> is turned on or off. If it is turned on, only people with a user account and password for this computer will be able to access your printer. Turn this off if you want anyone on the network to be able to access the
 printer you are sharing. To change this setting, select the option you prefer, and then click
<strong>Apply</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Share a printer</strong><br />

<p>Now you will need to add the network printer.<br />
Before you begin, make sure you know the name of the printer that you want to add. Sometimes the name is displayed on the printer itself. If the name is not on the printer, contact the printer owner or your network administrator to find out the printer's name
 before following the steps below.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Printers by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>
Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, and then clicking
<strong>Printers</strong>. <br />
2.&nbsp;Click <strong>Add a printer</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;In the <strong>Add Printer Wizard</strong>, select <strong>Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;In the list of available printers, select the one you want to use, and then click Next. If your computer is connected to a network, only printers listed in Active Directory for your domain are displayed in the list.<br />
5.&nbsp;If prompted, install the printer driver on your computer. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
6.&nbsp;Complete the additional steps in the wizard, and then click <strong>Finish</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Add or remove a printer</strong><br />

<br />
If the above steps fail then I would suggest that you contact the printer manufacturer for more information.<br />

            Thanks so much for your detailed response.&nbsp; However, if you look more carefully at my post, you'll find that the printer is indeed installed, shared&nbsp;and printing properly on the HP desktop computer running Windows 7.&nbsp; The problem and the error are coming
 when trying to add&nbsp;this networked&nbsp;printer&nbsp;on the laptop computer running Vista.&nbsp; The add a new printer wizard finds/sees the printer on the Windows 7 computer but will not connect giving the above mentioned error.&nbsp; Have you any other suggestions?<br />

<p>Hi bmelson</p>
<p><br />
I would suggest that you check if the service related to the printer is running on the computer.</p>
<p>A print spooler is service that temporarily stores print jobs on the computer hard disk or in memory until the printer is ready to print them. If you are been waiting an unusually long time for a document to print, or if you see an error message about the
 print spooler, spooler subsystem, or spooler resources, you might need to change and then restart the Print Spooler service on your computer.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Administrative</strong> <strong>Tools</strong> by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>
System and Maintenance</strong>, and then clicking <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>.
<br />
2. Double-click <strong>Services</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3. Right-click the <strong>Print Spooler service</strong>, and then click <strong>
Properties</strong>.<br />
4. On the <strong>General</strong> tab, next to <strong>Startup type</strong>, make sure that
<strong>Automatic</strong> is <strong>selected</strong>.<br />
5. If the service is not already running, under <strong>Service</strong> status, click
<strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p><br />
If the above step fails then try to run the Fixit tool available in the below link and check if it works.<br />

<br />
If the above step fails then I would suggest that you remove the printer and install it again, make sure that you select add port while adding the printer.</p>

            Again, thanks for the detailed response.&nbsp; And again, the problem is listed quite clearly in my original post and it has not been addressed.&nbsp; The error when trying to add a printer is: 0x800f0214 saying that the SERVER does not have the proper driver installed.&nbsp;
 Do you have any information about this error in particular?<br />

            Barry, <br />
<br />
I was having the same problem&nbsp;as you and here is what I finally did to correct mine:<br />
<br />
Go to the computer&nbsp;running Windows 7 and select Devices and Printes - then select the printer properties for the printer that you are trying to share with vista.<br />
<br />
Once the properties are selected click the sharing tab on then select the additional drivers button lower lh corner.<br />
<br />
If you do not have X86 drivers installed place a check next to X86 and install the appropriate drivers for the Vista Computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once all this has been done go back to vista computer&nbsp;and install the shared printer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This worked for me and I kept getting the same message so maybe it will work for you.

            Thanks so much for the response.&nbsp; It is not my computer so I will have to try the next time I am around that printer and network.&nbsp; I certainly appreciate the effort and will try to get back here after trying your suggestion to let you know if it worked
 for me as well.<br />

            I am having this same problem. I have HP 2015P printer connected to Win 7x64 computer. (Used to work fine when connected to Vista-x32 os). Am&nbsp;trying to print from the&nbsp;Vista now on the network. I can see the printer as shared by Win7x64 but will not open&nbsp;saying
 that the server does not have the correct printer driver installed.&nbsp;I have been reading threads for the last 4 hours and finally went to HP site and downloaded Universal PCL6 (for&nbsp;Vista-x32 os)&nbsp;driver to the Win 7x64 PC. When I got to the Additional Drivers
 part&nbsp; and tried to add x86 and referred to the file where I had downloaded the 32 bit drivers, I got the error 0x800f0214 saying that&nbsp;I needed an inf file that wasn't there. Is the download an incorrect driver or corrupt or what??? Any heop would be GREATLY
 appreciated.

<h2>            Driver install fails... but I&#39;m not trying to install a driver&#33; - Restart on shutdown</h2>
                    
<p>In my event log the following error appears multiple times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing printer driver EPSON Stylus 1400 Series failed, error code 0x0 HRESULT</p>
<p>0x80070705. See the event user datat for context information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is I have never at any point attempted or wanted to install that printer to this machine.&nbsp; I do have that printer on my desktop and there it can stay, it's only turned on when I print graphics, which I'll never do from this Netbook.&nbsp; So since I
 never initiated the printer driver install, how do I stop it?</p>
<p>I believe it may be part of why my Win 7 Home Netbook keeps rebooting on shutdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>I have also found that I am getting an additional error which I at first missed but turns out to be another consistent error I get when my Netbook reboots after hitting shutdown:</p>
<p>The following boot-start or system-start driver(s) failed to load:</p>
<p>cdrom</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again I'm not trying to install a cdrom driver, though I do have an external cdrom for the Netbook which has been working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

Windows Installer was already set to manual.&nbsp; I also see nothing, other than print spooler, also manual, that relates to printers in my services.<br />

<p><span>Does the printer show in Control Panel/Printers and Faxes? I know you stated the printer is installed on your desktop and you do not want it installed on the netbook. Are the computers connected to
 a home group? <span>&nbsp;</span>Do you see hardware attempting to install at startup? Do you see the error at any other time other than in the Events log?<span>&nbsp;</span>Does the error show up in the log just recently? What prompted you to check

<p>Hi Dena,</p>
<p>No the printer does not show up in my printers and faxes.&nbsp; That was the first place I checked, thinking I could simply remove it and do away with the problem, but as I said it is not there.</p>
<p>Yes the two computers are connected via a homegroup, however they are not set to share printers.</p>
<p>No I do not see any hardware attempt to install when I start up my machine.</p>
<p>The error only shows in the events log, along with the failed cdrom install error.&nbsp; I began to check there to find any errors that might be causing my Netbook to restart immediately on shutdown.&nbsp; The Netbook was purchased on 2 Nov and the restart on shutdown
 issue began that Thursday night, so to say the error showed up recently is relative.</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
