<h2>            i got a Xbox live card for gold, but its not registering me as gold status&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a live code from a card to play online again, but for some reason when i put the code in, it showed it was for gold membership, but after more investigation i only have some features like online gaming. I can play online and join parties, but i can't join things like fireteams on Destiny, or even get the free games of that month for that matter. I'm really upset about this, so i was hoping someone could fix this on my account.</p><p>If you need my email info it's <strong>[MOD Removed - Please see <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/news__events/announcements/f/6/t/515277.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here!">Forum Guidelines</a>]</strong>, and the code number was&nbsp;<strong>[MOD Removed - Please see <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/news__events/announcements/f/6/t/515277.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here!">Forum Guidelines</a>]&nbsp;</strong>Please contact me as soon as possible, thanks.</p

            <p>Never post codes on the forums. These are public so anyone can take them. It sounds like you're using gold trial and not a full gold subscription. Trials do not change your account status to gold and only give you some aspects of online multiplayer. You would need a full gold subscription in order to take part in all of the benefits of gold........................</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Cumulative Update Keeps Trying To Install - Can&#39;t Block It</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,<br />
</p>
Lenovo ThinkPad T430
<p>Windows 10 Pro N x64</p>
Version 1607 (OS Build 14393.2068)<br />
<p>
</p><p>I've got a problem with my Windows 10 install. It keeps trying to update, and failing. Update assistant says -
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>"Microsoft can't install important security updates on your PC until you install the most current version of Windows 10."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It will download, "install" and then restart, but then version doesn't change and the assistant will appear once again.<br />
</p>
<p>I've checked, and Lenovo do not list my machine as being supported by the latest update (presumably what my machine is trying to update to). However, the 1607 release (which I'm currently running) is not listed as supported either! Oops.<br />
<br />
I've tried to block the update using the "show or hide updates" tool, but I can only see small updates for things like "Intel" and trackpad drivers etc. No "Windows 10 cumulative update" or anything. I've blocked everything there several times, and the problem
 is still there.<br />
<br />
I've followed all the guides I can find about deffering updates, to no avail. It still keeps trying to update. Every time I come back to my computer after a few hours standby, it has restarted and goes back to the login screen.<br />
<br />
I want to lock my version at 1607 (but still get security updates) as I don't want to risk incompatability. But I'll take the risk and update if it will get rid of the annoying update assistant. What can I do?</p>
<p><br />
Many thanks for your help!<br />
<br />
Oliver</p>

            Have you tried using Media creation tool?
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:

<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

Should I use "upgrade PC now" or "create installation media"? Will the latter option cause me to lose my data?</p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion. <br />
<br />
I did try this, and it let me hide the update "2018-02 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607".<br />
<br />
However, after a day or so, the problem returned. The restart and failed install still happens every time I leave my PC. I either need to block, or successfully install this update, or this will be happening to my PC forever :/</p>

<p>It comes up as a "driver error".<br />
<br />
Hmmm. On reflection though, I've never had any issues with my PC being dual-booted before. I doubt that's the issue, as it auto-boots into Windows anyway.
<br />
<br />
I'll try the steps listed on that page, and report back.</p>

<p>What surface is your xbox on. It might just be vibrations, try putting a couple of magazine under the pads at the bottom of the console. If this doesn't help it might be the motor of the drive. The drive should idol shortly after starting the console if
 your not using the drive. Make sure the fan ducts don't have dust in them and there is plenty of space for air to circulate and is not the system trying to keep cool. Hope this is some help.

<p>Thanks for the response. &nbsp;It's sitting in a very solid entertainment center and the console is very stable as well. &nbsp;It's possibly dusty, so I'll check that out. &nbsp;I'm just so gun shy with this console as it's build quality is questionable.</p>

<p>Did you ever figure out what was going on? Or did you have to get it repaired? I'm curious cause mine has started to do this just out of the blue the other day, I have had it since day one and usually all I could hear was a little fan noise. I know it's
 the disk drive cause it was making the noise and when I was watching netflix so I went over to it and popped the disk out just to see and the noise stopped. I thought maybe it was just keeping it spinning so it could do that instant back into the game thing
 but I had shut the game off completely so that isn't it either.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>regarding the problem you are experiencing I would suggest you to make sure there are no corrupt data in the game's files. For this purpose first you should delete your game and all the DLC related to it. After this you should clear your system cache:<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Guide button on your controller.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Go to settings and select System Settings.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Select Storage or Memory.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Highlight any storage device, and then press Y on your controller. (It doesn't matter which storage device you select; the cache will be cleared for all storage devices.)</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; Select Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; When prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select Yes<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>In the end install your game again and play normally.</p>

            i am having the same exact issues with State of Decay 2 on the microsoft store, it downloads for maybe like 30 seconds or so then stops and does not continue. and like it being said as above it decreases in speed until it stops entirely and doesnt recover.
 ive tried all possible things regarding microsoft store with resets , troubleshoots and all that jazz but absolutely nothing works, im at the point im gonna contact customer support for a refund because their store is incompetent as **** and will not download
 something i just paid $50 for

            Microsoft Store is a broken service and they don't want to see that. I have no issues downloading from steam, uplay, watching youtube videos, general downloads and even downloading from origin. My only problem is with that joke called Microsoft Store.
 I'm trying to download state of decay 2 since yesterday with no luck so far. The download begins at normal speed, then it slows down until it completly stops and fails. Already did a lot of "official" troubleshooting, but nothing solved my problem. The only
 thing this support seems to know a lot is to give the same generic useless and outdated answers over and over and over again.

<p>its because they probably hire people off of the street that dont know what theyre doing and they just read default troubleshooting sh*t and dont actually answer or problem solve anything.</p>
<p>when i have the spare time im calling support and demanding for a refund on a product i cant even download due to the incompetence of a program, i tried to download this on 2 different computers and both did the same exact thing, download like 20mbs then
 stops, which has me convinced its the microsoft store or the download server, but they refuse to acknowledge problems caused by them</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the exact same problem with State of Decay 2. Try to download the game from the Microsoft Store, the app begins to hang, and then it slowly begins to drain my PC's CPU of all its resources. What the hell?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As others have mentioned, State of Decay 2 is the only app which I can't seem to download. I've downloaded other games/apps with zero issues, so it's clearly this particular game/download server which isn't working correctly. I've also tried all the suggested
 troubleshooting methods with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted Microsoft support and their "help" was downright embarrassing. They even had the audacity to email me the next day saying "you should be able to download the game now". Idiots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a disgrace that so many of us can't access a game which we either bought outright or should be able to play using Game Pass, especially this long after launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's silence on the matter is quite frankly disgusting! PLEASE GIVE US A FIX, ASAP!</p>

            <p>Thanks and sorry by the delay but i work on my kids pc only the week-end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what i have done &nbsp;is a little different &nbsp;as there is no setup file with the apple drivers in W10 ( or i did not find).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the drivers are installed with itunes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the overall idea of compatibility was good : &nbsp;I &nbsp;modified the compatibility mode of the exe AppleMobileDeviceService.exe that i found in /Programmes/Common Files/Apple/Mobile Device Support. and i run it in Windows 8 compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when i plug in the nano , the , i still can browse the files in the xplorer ; and when I open Itunes I do not get any messages anymore ..... which is a good sign ... the drawback is that I do not see the nano in Tunes .</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that may be another problem because I do not see my Iphone either . and it was the case also before i made the change .</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I am going to make some tests with other Apple devices and see whats going on changing the compatiblity mode of this exe. I'll kepp update the post.</p>

<h2>            phishing messages on xbl</h2>
                    
<p>apparently there is a group calling itself the "xbox support club" that is sending messages to users claiming that&nbsp;suspicious activity on accounts is being monitored and in order to prevent unauthorized access the email and password for the account is needed
 to secure the account. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>obviously, we need to discourage users from falling for such a scam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>xbox employees will never ask for password information for any reason. please don't fall for this!</p>

    <title>Login screen keeps flashing and sends me back to login after I enter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> digitalman2112  say:</h3>
<h2>            Login screen keeps flashing and sends me back to login after I enter password</h2>
                    This just started happening recently. If I'm away from my PC for a period of time and it's locked, when I come back, the login screen flashes as if a key is being pressed down. If I hit "Escape" it stops but then after I enter my password and login, it
 goes to my desktop for a few seconds and then takes me back to the login screen again where it's flashing away. I end up having to restart windows and can then get in normally until I lock the PC for a period of time again. When this first started happening
 I thought it might be the keyboard so I unplugged my usb connections and plugged back in and sometimes that would let me log in again without rebooting. I have a Razer DeathStalker keyboard and am running the Synapse 2.0 software but it never did this before.
 I think their might have been a software update for it recently that I downloaded soon before this started happening. Anyone else ever have an issue like this?

            <p><span>Hi Dan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these methods to troubleshoot the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to test the issue using a different keyboard. This would help us determine if the issue is with hardware or software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Let us check if any third party program or service is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to restart the computer in
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/dual-booting-boot-manager-boot-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>safe mode</span></b></a><span>
 with networking and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn’t occur in Safe mode, you may try to restart the computer in
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>clean boot</span></b></a><span> mode to check if any third party
 application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<b>How to reset the computer
 to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</b>” to return the computer to a Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to
<span>disable and re-enable the USB controllers. The following steps will uninstall all the USB controllers and then re-install them:
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on
<b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Run</b>. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “<b>devmgmt.msc”
</b>without<b> </b>quotes, and then click <b>OK</b>. Device Manager opens. </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>. <br />
<b>Note:</b> You might have to scroll down the list to find this item. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click the first USB controller under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>, and then click <b>Uninstall</b> to remove it.
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Repeat step 4 for each USB controller that is listed under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan
 for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. Let us know if you need further assistance and we’ll be happy to help.</span></p>

<h2>            Firefox &#34;blocked by administrator&#59; Edge, Chrome, Opera, IE not blocked</h2>
                    I run W10 (upgrade from 8.0) on a Lenovo G700 laptop. This morning, I reinstalled Firefox, but I get a "blocked by administrator" message. Chrome, Opera, Edge and IE all work normally. I can bring Firefox up with "Run as Administrator," but that won't
 work when I click on a link in an email. How do I fix this? (I have a vague memory that I dealt with it before, but I can't remember any of the steps.)

<h2>            dual display not work with interactive whiteboard</h2>
                    I am a teacher using my pavillion entertainment pc with vista to connect to an interactive whiteboard in the classroom. This has stopped working for no apparent reason and the whiteboard does not recognise the laptop. I have used personalisation- connect
 to external display, but with no success. I am sure it has something to do with resolution but do not know how to fix it and get back to how it was. Why did it just change one day itself?

<p><span><span><span>This might be an issue with the display drivers. You update the display drivers and check if the issue persists.</span></span></span></p>

</p><p>With my Window 10, when I click on Microsoft Photos, nothing happens.&nbsp; Usually, when I clicked, I had instant access to all my albums.&nbsp; That bug started about 10 days ago; at the same time, all my Microsoft games became in English version, even my emails!
 (My choosen language was French).</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) After the troubleshooter being ran, I restarted my computer. No change : Microsoft photos still not available by clicking on it;&nbsp; all the games are still in english (Daily challenges, Games, Star Club, etc) even if my chosen language is french.</p>

</p><p>2) I passed the SFC scan as instructed. Surprisingly, informations given by SFC at screen were in french. Anyway, at the end of the process, I received this message in french «Le programme de protection des ressources Windows n'a trouvé aucune violation
 d'intégrité», which is «The Windows Protection Ressources Program found no integrity violation».&nbsp; This scan lasted around 15 minutes. After that, I restarted my computer even if not instructed to do so by the SFC scan. No change : Microsoft photos unavailable
 with click and Games still in english.3) I need further assistance, please.<br />

            <p>Bonjour again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a matter of fact, I tried both solutions of AM but nothing works. So, last evening, I uninstalled Microsoft Solitaire Collection and reinstalled it from the Store. I did'nt loose my data from Daily games, but I lost all my points from Star Club Games
 (I had over 1100 points). And, believe it or not, reinstallation brings me back to my own language, FRENCH.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>There's a big bug on that Solitaire Collection</strong>. I hope that Microsoft will find a solution soon : Windows 10 is amazing but that unstable platform is very irritating. I'm sure that, late or not, that platform will return to english for unknown
 reason.</p>

This can help with some (but not all) programs: <br />
1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
<br />
2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next windows click "Start the Program" to install it.
<br />
3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in windows 7.

<h2>            Windows Live Mail and Outlook Mail</h2>
                    <strong>Technical Level</strong> : Basic <br />
<br />
<strong>Summary</strong><br />
<p>The&nbsp;latest version of Outlook.com is called Outlook Mail,&nbsp;sometimes referred to as 'Outlook on the web'. This version is built on the Office 365 platform, which should bring some performance improvements, and there are several interface enhancements. Some
 details of the preview version have been given in this blog post: <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2015/05/21/new-ways-to-get-more-done-in-outlook-com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
New ways to get more done in Outlook.com</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">However, the new version no longer supports the DeltaSync protocol which is the default configuration&nbsp;in Windows Live Mail for Microsoft email accounts (those @outlook, @hotmail, @live, @msn, @windowslive and any other free account
 with a mailbox at <a href="http://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mail.live.com</a>). This means that other methods will be needed to synchronize mail folders and messages with the Outlook Mail servers.&nbsp;This article explains how to&nbsp;achieve this&nbsp;by using IMAP instead of the default HTTP configuration.</p>

<strong>Details</strong><br />
<p class="contentStandard">Most Outlook.com accounts have already been upgraded to the new version. The indications of this for the user are:</p>

<br />
On the <em>All</em> tab, use the <em>Show and Hide </em>buttons to indicate which folders you want to see in the folder pane.
<br />
<br />
There may be a number of contacts folders - <em>Hide</em> them, because they don't contain anything meaningful in the mail window. It's also wise to
<em>Hide</em> any other folders, like <em>Outbox</em>, that&nbsp;weren't there before.&nbsp;There should be only one folder for each of sent items, junk email and deleted items.

Click <em>OK</em>.<br />

            <p>Excellent instructions (a big thank you to Firedog), but I would like to add something for all of us who are not computer geniuses: &nbsp;These&nbsp;steps must be executed in Windows Live Mail, not in Outlook (Outlook has different tabs anyway).&nbsp; I found this out
 the hard way.&nbsp; To open Windows Live Mail: Click on the Start menu and type "mail" in the "Search programs and files." Then click on Windows Live Mail and follow Firedog's directions exactly.&nbsp;

            I have a Hotmail, MSN, and Outlook email account. I got the Hotmail and MSN to sync to the Windows Live Mail, but could NOT get the Outlook email to sync, getting the same error as everyone else. I have been searching for DAYS for a solution, and I finally
 found this one. This is the ONLY one I could get to work. I have saved this whole thread as a .PDF so I can refer to it later if need be. So,

<p>Although, I'll probably not follow what appears to be worthwhile work around, since

<p>I only used the 'mail link' option. </p>
<p>Now my work around is to just C&amp;P the website URL, the link, to a "new" message at Hotmail and then send it.<br />

            This is the same error code i get so it should be related. However there is no fix for it yet, hopefully so i don't have to get rid of using this email account. Had it for 15 years or so

<h2>            Irritated</h2>
                    <p>Hello there.... I was simply wondering if there was any way to be able to... oh I dunno... make my Xbox realize it has a god damned connection, and always has. I was just wanting to... you know... PLAY&nbsp;THE&nbsp;GAMES&nbsp;I&nbsp;BOUGHT. Then again, I could jut have been making a mistake, however every time I reset the modem, it doesn't work, and the whole Xbox support system and disabling security&nbsp;is a mind boggling&nbsp;pain in the ass for a mere&nbsp;mortal like me.</p><p><br /></p><p>-Yours in Confusion</p>
