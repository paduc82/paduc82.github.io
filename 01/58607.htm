<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Just sometime back I started to hear some screeching noise from my internal speaker while playing videos/Audio with decent bass level.&nbsp; The laptop is a Dell Inspiron, Conexant Amartaudio HD. Driver details
 shows as Conexant&nbsp;</span>8.54.40.0, think its the latest version in India</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Whereas I tried listing to the same video/audio through my headphones its quite normal.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I wonder could it be due to faulty sound card (hardware) or due to any update error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Kindly suggest me what is the problem and what could be the solution.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Am currently downloading&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Version
 8.54.40.0,A00 to check. Hope its solves the issue.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Ashy,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Communities. This issue occurs if the drivers are not supported by the hardware.</p>
<p>In some cases, you can work around the problem by disabling optional speaker effects that are known as enhancements. If disabling speaker effects solves the problem, you might need to update your audio driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to run the<strong> Audio troubleshooter</strong> on your Windows 8.1 computer, it will check for common problems with your volume settings, sound card or driver and the speakers:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Check out this link:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab3&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab3&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the latest drivers from device manager and install the latest from computer manufacturer website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Update the audio drivers and check if it works:To do so, refer to the link below:</p>
<p><strong>Download and install Drivers:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab4&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab4&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to try installing the drivers in compatibility mode.
</p>
<p>To check the compatibility click on <strong>Windows compatibility center</strong> in the link mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to install a driver in compatibility mode:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Right click on the setup file of the driver and select Properties</p>
<p>b. Select Compatibility Tab</p>
<p>c. Place a check mark next to Run this program in Compatibility mode and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list</p>
<p>d. Let the driver to install and then check the functionality.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Hope that works!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further assistance post back, we will be glad to assist you.</p>

<h2>            My gamertag was banned but then someone else got it</h2>
                    

<div>
<p>OK, I'll try not to be frustrated as I type this.<br />
After calling customer service at 1-800-4MYXBOX, I was given a Service Request number: 1157301790 and was advised to bring my complaint to the forum here.<br />
<br />
A few years ago, I had the name ZOMBIEholocaust on xbox live. all spelled out normally, with no spaces.&nbsp;<br />
I was happy with this name, but eventually someone complained &nbsp;about it, I guess, and it got banned.<br />
Well, today I was able to send a friend request to ZombieHolocaust, someone who has been on xbox LIVE for 3 years (unknown how long this has been their name, though).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My question is this:&nbsp;<b>Why was my named deleted/banned, yet they are able to just take it over and keep playing with it??</b><br />
<br />
I was not charged to change my name, but i was certainly forced to do so.</p>
<p>My current gamertag is A Dainty Teacup (i feel its fun/funny to murder folks on CoD games with a name like this)<br />
<br />
<b>So, can I either have my name back, or be credited the 800 Microsoft points that I spent to change my name from MARSvoltage (another old name of mine) to ZOMBIEholocaust (which was unjustly banned and then allowed for someone else)</b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for your attention, any response is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your account was banned for the gamertag, then you would have been forced to change it to a different tag. No microsoft points used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will not be credited microsoft points that you didn't use, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a gamertag is banned from use, It is banned from use by all players. So either there is a mistake in your story somewhere, or you're not telling us the entire truth as to why you were banned.</p>

<p>Read the COC to understand why you cant reference the holocaust in your name or profile. &nbsp;You simply can't bring up topics of a sensitive manner hence you were given a Forced name change to make it go away. &nbsp;If someone has a variation, or through some vodo
 the same name feel free to report that name so it can recieve the same proper fnc. &nbsp;Support told you to come here to make you go away, since fnc's are perminate and not up for debate. &nbsp;</p>

<p>his name is spelled exactly the same. there are no misspellings or numbers. the only difference is the capitalization.</p>
<p>my name was ZOMBIEholocaust</p>
<p>his name is ZombieHolocaust</p>
<p>i just mainly wanted to see if i could get my name back. there arent any details left out of my story, Dutch, and if you're going to steer the conversation in that direction I would appreciate it if you just didn't participate.</p>
<p>holocaust means a great or complete devastation or destruction, and only refers to the despicable events of the 1940's when preceded by the word 'the'.</p>
<p>ive seen xbox achievements with more insulting titles than my name ZOMBIEholocaust. i still want my name back. i dont need a refund or anything, just give me the name i spent points original to obtain, that's all.</p>

<p>My name was banned but I wasn't given a free change they just turned it to "lovelycalf1928." and when I called to complain they just talked about the terms and agreements and thanked me for the money basically. &nbsp;I paid for the name of my choice and they
 didn't like it and assigned me one. In a nutshell Microsoft just stole 10$ from me legally. Real nice MS its like you don't want customers.</p>

            <p>Hi Noorulfayaz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the error message that you receive after running bootrec commands, it seems like the issue is with an external device connected to the computer. Did you tried disconnecting external devices? If not, I would suggest you to disconnect all the external
 devices other than mouse and keyboard. Then try restarting the computer and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try Method 2 in the last post and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this information helps. Reply to the post with updated status of the issue to assist you further.</span></p>

</p><p>External devices means any devices connected externally on the computer, like printers, external hard disks, pendrives etc. The devices inside the computer are known as internal devices, you do not have to remove any internal devices.</p>

<p>
</p><p>At Skype, we take security very seriously. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There was an issue with an older version of the Skype for Windows desktop installer&nbsp;specifically version 7.40 and lower.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue was in the program that installs the Skype software&nbsp;but not in the Skype software itself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users that have already installed this version of Skype for Windows desktop are not affected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have removed this older version of Skype for Windows desktop from our website
<a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.skype.com</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>The installer for the current version of Skype for Windows desktop (v8) does NOT have this issue, and it has been available since October, 2017.</p>

            I'll stick with classic version as long as I can. After that I'll try to find messenger that allows multiple conversations at the same time. I'll miss it (probably not as much as MSN), but nothing lasts forever.<br />

<p>This new version of Skype, is completely useless when trying to use it with SAMs broadcaster. The classic skype had a box to check or uncheck to automatically adjust Microphone setting. Which if it was checked, would mess with the mic Settings in other programs
 that require a mic, LIKE SAMs Broadcaster. I use skype while I use Sams for an online radio, taking calls for requests and Dedications, and when I use new skype It is messing with the Mic Volume in SAMs. You said we can still get the classic version of Skype,
 but I have been to the webpage and I do not see a link to Download the 7.41 version of Skype. I truly wish they had not changed Skype, it was perfect the way it was. Please how can I get classic skype back, this new Skype is messing with My on air abilities!!!!!</p>

<p>The current release of the Skype for Windows 10 App (12.x) does not have that toggle. It is available in the preview version (14.x). You can join the preview program in the settings of the 12.x App. That should allow you to download the latest 14.x pre-release.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Reinstall Windows 7 from Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenjohnson_990  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstall Windows 7 from Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I use Samsung Recovery Solution 5 to save complete system image backups to an external hard drive because something about my external hard drive is not compatible with the windows 7 backup system. I've used it and restored with it plenty of times so I know
 it works well for my.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, once I've upgraded to Windows 10 will I be able to continue to use Samsung Recovery Solution 5 since I go into it at the same time I would enter the computer's BIOS? Will I be able to reinstall a saved image of Windows 7 onto my computer
 changing it from Windows 10 to Windows 7 if ever I wanted to? If I made another image backup of my computer with Windows 10, would I be able to reinstall Windows 10 after switching back to Windows 7 if I wanted to?</p>

 Gallery to Vista. &nbsp;I assume that means I am no longer getting updates either. &nbsp;I can print from Windows Live Photo Gallery when the printer is plugged into my desktop with Windows XP. Right now I am trying to do a Dell diagnostic on my Dell printer. &nbsp; It doesn't
 seem to be working either, as it's been running for over two hours.</span>

            Sorry, it was Windows Live Photo Gallery. &nbsp;I didn't know there was a difference. &nbsp;After spending all morning on a Dell page, downloading software for the printer after I plugged it into my laptop, and running the Microsoft Fixit several times, and the
 Dell diagnostic tool which told me to reset my printer to the factory settings and restart my computer, my computer would not start. &nbsp;I got a window that said it was searching for a repair and if it worked my &nbsp;computer would start correctly. &nbsp;It finally did
 and asked me to try printing again. &nbsp;It did not work. &nbsp;But then I went to my printers on the start menu, and found that there were two printers installed under the same name, and my prints were going to the printer that was offline. &nbsp;When I deleted that printer,
 SUCESS!!!! &nbsp;My Windows Live Photo Gallery is finally printing my photos and documents that are saved as photos.&nbsp;

    <title>Disc goes to 100&#37; busy for extended periods. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blue mosaix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disc goes to 100&#37; busy for extended periods.</h2>
                    <p>I'm running 8.1 pro on a laptop with 8gb memory. I have a 120gb SSD as c: and a 1tb disc as d:<br />
<br />
About a week ago there were some windows updates installed. Shortly after my d: started going 100% busy for extended periods (up to half an hour) as shown on task manager and the system slows considerably. Strangely, during this period task manager also shows
 zero read speed and zero write speed, as if there is no actual activity.<br />
<br />
This happens (but isn't limited to) after reboots. I've tried stopping various processes (virus checker, dropbox etc) but this makes no difference. My c: SSD operates perfectly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this is not my C: drive so this is not a paging problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in anticipation. </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your description,&nbsp;I understand that the&nbsp;issue is happening only with the D: drive which might be related with sector corruption. So in the primary phase we will perform System and Disk Scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also mentioned that you recently installed Windows Update. There is a chance that it&nbsp;might be related with Windows Update patches and pending security Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Ensure that all the Windows Updates are installed on your computer as the issue may be occurring due to some missing security updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps to install available Windows Updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press <strong>Windows + C</strong>, type
<strong>Windows Update</strong> in the Search box, then click <strong>Windows Update</strong> in the results pane.</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>Check for Updates</strong>. After the scan is complete, click
<strong>Review optional updates</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Click the check box next to the updates, then click&nbsp;<strong>Install updates</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>If prompted, review the license agreement, then click
<strong>I Accept</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Follow the onscreen instructions to download and install the updates.
</span><span>If prompted, reboot your computer.</span></li></ol>
<p>As of now, I recommend you to go through following method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Run
<strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> to detect and resolve any file system structural corruption. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press Windows + C, Select search.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type cmd. Command Prompt would come up under search result.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on Command Prompt, run it as an administrator.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Command Prompt would open. Type, “<strong>chkdsk /f /r</strong>” (without quotes) and push enter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Restart the computer to Run Check Disk.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When the Disk Check would be completed with repair, your computer should automatically start. Please make a note of the result after check disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span>
<em>While performing <strong>chkdsk</strong> on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when
<strong>chkdsk</strong> tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue continues, please reply with the details of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

<p>Hi Chester Dave T,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</p>
<p>Try running the Printer troubleshooter and check if the printers are working fine without any issues.</p>
<p>Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the Start, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Use a printer.</p>
<p>Check the link: <strong>Open the Printer troubleshooter: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter</strong></a></p>
<p>If you are still unable to print, you may try restarting the Print Spooler service and check.</p>
<p>A print spooler is software that temporarily stores print jobs on the computer hard disk or in memory until the printer is ready to print them.</p>
<p>If you've been waiting an unusually long time for a document to print, or if you see an error message about the print spooler, you might need to restart the print spooler on your computer.</p>
<p>To restart the Print Spooler service</p>
<p>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Administrative Tools by clicking the Start, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type administrative tools, and then click Administrative Tools.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click Services. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the Print Spooler service, and then click Properties.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, next to Startup type, make sure that Automatic is selected.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>Follow the steps from the link below: <strong>Why can't I print?: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-print" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-print</strong></a></p>

            Hi! <br />
<br />
After #3 of above instructions from Swathi, check on all the items listed under the dependencies tab. Locate each one of them under the services list, do start and make them all "automatic".
<br />
That should get you going.

            I am having the print spooler problems and I have yet to find anyone or any suggestions to get the spooler running. I have tried the troubleshooter and it tells me the spooler isn't running and attempts to start it but it will not remain started.
<div><br />
<div>I am open to ALL suggestions. I have deleted files in the spool/drivers, I have run the scannow and corrupt files were found and fixed and miscellaneous other things. I have had a printer working on this system running Windows 7 but for some unknown reason
 something changed and now I can't install any printer at all. I can't get the spooler started at all.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I go into Services and start the spooler I get the following error:</div>

<h3> l benedict  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need to merge two microsoft accounts or transfer info from one account to another.</h2>
                    <p>I bought a windows 8 computer for college a couple years ago. I didn't have a microsoft&nbsp;account at the time, so I created one when setting up the computer. I used the email address for my iCloud email account. My college recently switched email services
 from Groupwise to Microsoft Office 365. Now I have two microsoft&nbsp;accounts. I use the college one for email and the other one for my computer and for&nbsp;OneDrive. I would like to just have the college one only. Is there a way to merge the two accounts? Or can
 I just transfer the computer account information and OneDrive&nbsp;files from my&nbsp;regular account to my school account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>There's no merge ability, so you pretty much have to just pick one you want to use, and ignore the other one (stop using it, or even shut it down completely).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To transfer your OneDrive files to the other account, just download them all to your computer.&nbsp; First, make sure they're available offline by clicking the OneDrive folder icon at the left side of your Explorer window, and choosing "Make available offline".&nbsp;
 If that option isn't available, the files are already downloaded for offline access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, got to PC Settings / Accounts.&nbsp; You'll see your email address at the top. Disconnect it, then connect it to your new email address.</p>

<h2>            How do you remove a contact in the drop-down list&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do you remove a contact when, if forwarding a message, the icon flashes in the "To" space to type the email address, when pressing the first letter of a recipient, it displays a list of previous names/addresses used. This can add up to a considerable
 list! It is useful most times, but, how could I shorten the list by removing unwanted contacts in that drop-down list? I have succesfully deleted them from my address book/contacts, (and they are deleted) but, even after re-starting the computer, their names
 still appear in the drop-down list as before. Any solutions??</p>

    <title>Clean install of Windows 10 after upgrade from Windows 7 pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bw9999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clean install of Windows 10 after upgrade from Windows 7 pro</h2>
                    <p>I have successfully upgraded from Windows 7 professional to windows 10 Professional, but it didnt like my antivirus package so i tried to reinstall it, but doing this corrupted the Windows 10 installation, and i keep getting the repair windows 10 prompt
 over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am trying to do a fresh clean Windows 10 install from the downloaded ISO that Microsoft provides, but when i start the install process its asking me for the product licences key, when I type in my Windows 7 Pro license key from the label stuck on top
 of my dell system unit it says 'invalid key'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could i suppose reinstall Windows 7 pro, then reapply the windows 10 upgrade over the top of it, but I would prefer to do a clean fresh install from the Windows 10 pro ISO instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me why my existing Dell Windows 7 Pro license key dosnt work with the fresh install of windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I going to suffer this problem after the 12 months free deadline of windows 10 if i encounter a problem later on and need to reinstall again? Because im assuming the upgrade from windows 7 wont work after the 12 months is up?</p>

            Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device. You won’t need a product key for re-activations on the same hardware. If you make a meaningful change to your
 hardware, you may need to contact customer support to help with activation. You’ll also be able to create your own installation media, like a USB drive or DVD, and use that to upgrade your device or reinstall after you’ve upgraded, more detail at

<h2>            Greyed out option to change size of text, apps and other items</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just purchased a Asus Transformer Pro 3 with Windows 10 home. The laptop has a resolution of 2880 by 1920. When I try to connect it to my HD monitor of resolution 1920 x 1080, I find that the windows, text and fonts are are massive and unpleasant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried adjusting the size of texts and fonts in the Display Setting, I found that the option was unavailable and greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see below for illustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you advise on the method of connecting my laptop to my monitor such that image aspect ratio is maintained?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, you could try changing the resolution with the below advices:

<br />
<br />If you want to connect an external monitor, your product seems to have HDMI connector, if I'm not wrong, so you can use that with HDMI cable:

            Hi lekanodukoya,
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop
<br />
<br />Choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />Below Resolution, in Scale and Layout, is Scale set to 100%, if not, set it to 100%
<br />
<br />If that is not the issue, it may be your graphics card:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager - Accessible by right clicking your Start Button 
<br />Expand the Display Devices section 
<br />Right click your graphics card and choose properties 
<br />On the driver tab, choose 'Roll Back Driver' 
<br />If the Roll back option is grayed out, right click the device and choose Uninstall 
<br />Confirm deletion of the driver files 
<br />
<br />Either way, restart your PC . . .

<p>I have an HDMI cable attached to the windows 10 computer. The cable is connected to the Television. In the display setting I had monitor 02 as the the monitor for the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I change the Multiple Displays setting to "duplicate these displays" or "extend these displays", the TV is included and so the grayed out settings appear again and I can adjust the computer monitor resolution.
</p>
<p>So I conclude that to have active settings for the computer, the HDMI cable would have to be disconnected or I have to have the display settings set to INCLUDE the device connected. I have left it on "duplicate these displays" rather than "extend these displays
 so that I don't have a massive image to process in paint shop pro when I do a screen capture.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leaving it on "extend these displays" would be for when i watch a video, Netflix session or a movie playing on the computer but displayed on the larger TV screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly adding a second screen to a windows 10 system effects the display apps' appearance.</p>

<h2>            3 or so GBs - delete some 10 GBs from computer - left with between 2 and 3 GBs&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi a really difficult question and I understand those who have tried and can't but how can I take 10 GBs off my computer when I have nearly 4 GB and end up with about 3 GBs. By my calculation that means I must have been working with - memory.&nbsp; I was doing
 this to place Windows 10 downloads on computer. I have removed the one download it permitted but still have only about 3 GBs on the computer - as I say after deleting more than 10 GBs.

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!<br /><br />The first thing to check is the recycle bin. Make sure that everything has been cleared from the recycle bin and permanently deleted. <br /><br />When you initially delete an item it doesn't actually free up space until it is again deleted in the recycle bin. <br /><br />Let me know if that works, or if you have already done that.

<p>Hi Peter <br />
<br />
May I ask, do you have 32GB (29.1GB usable) of storage on your system, or do you have a larger hard drive?
<br />
<br />
If you have a larger hard drive: <br />
<br />
Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />
Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a><br />
<br />
Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove or indeed what the underlying problem may be . . .
</p>
<p>

            Hi, thanks for that. I have found the problem. I had to go deeper into the computer to delete things that0were not coming up on my normal search. And because I have downloaded a Windows10 update there are files are will be deleted in due course which should
 give me some more space. Thanks again.

    <title>Run a VHD file in Virtual PC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Run a VHD file in Virtual PC</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have recently got a Windows 7 PC to replace a Windows XP machine. However, so that I still have access to anything on the old PC which I may need again, I have made a .vhd file of the old computer's hard disk.<br />
<br />
I cannot seem to open this vhd file, as I cannot find way to create a new Virtual PC with which to use this virtual hard disk.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Richard

            Windows 7 can read the VHD(Virtual Hard Disk) Files without VPC(Virtual PC). &nbsp;You can make the VHD file be seen as a hard drive on the new PC. Here is how to do it.
<div><br />
<div>Attach VHD file:</div>
<div>1. Right click on "My Computer" and hit "Manage".</div>
<div>2. Go to "Disk Management" under "Storage" on the left side.</div>
<div>3. Click on the "Action" menu on the top and Click "Attach VHD".</div>
<div>4. Browse the VHD file that you would like to open, you can also make the drive Read only just in case you accidentally change something. &nbsp;Then Hit "OK".</div>
<div>5. You should see your VHD in "My Computer"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Detach VHD file:</div>
<div>1. Go to Disk Management as described in steps 1-2 I explained earlier. &nbsp;</div>
<div>2. On the bottom half of the window, find the VHD you would like to detach.&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Right click on the "Disk #" and click "Detach VHD"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good Luck. God Bless. :)</div>

            Hi Richard,<br />
<br />
OK, First, I assume you've downloaded and installed Microsoft Virtual PC?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx</a><br />
<br />
If you have, look in your start menu and you'll have a Windows Virtual PC option, go into that menu and click on Windows Virtual PC.<br />
<br />
Now, there is technically no GUI for Virtual PC, it's integrated into Windows 7 so it just looks like a Windows Explorer menu, but it's not.<br />
<br />
If you look towards the top of the Window, there is a Create Virtual Machine button, click that and it will guide you through creating a new virtual machine.<br />
<br />
When it gets to the part of asking you about your hard drive (3rd screen I think), opt to select a VHD file and choose the VHD file you created.&nbsp; Complete the wizard and start the machine.<br />
<br />
That's it - <br />
<br />
Let me know if you still stuggle.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jon<br />
