<h2>            Controller Rumble Makes Humming Noise</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Day One Edition Xbox One and the controller makes a noticeable humming noise when the rumble is activated. Is that normal? It sounds like motor noise. I never had this in my Xbox 360 controllers.</p>

<p>Mine has started doing the same.. I also have the day one edition. It sounds like something is spinning inside when I fire a gun or when the control vibrates on battlefield 4. I hope it's because of the batteries or I'm going to be pissed.</p>

<p>My controller started to do the same thing, sounds kinda like an electric rc car. Mine is not a day one though, i have only had it since mid december and i use a play and charge, so i do not believe batteries are involved, if it continues microsoft better
 solve it... I never had this with the 360 either, however i removed the rumble motors to save weight and make it a bit more comfortable to use and i find the old controller to be a bit bigger and better, the bumpers on XBO are really poorly made, requires
 to much force to be pressed as it hinges on a bad spot.</p>

<p>Mine is the same. But you don't really hear it when your in an intense battle with your surround sound turned up. I mean if you are trying to sneak play your Xbox then that's your own issue. You can always send it in for a replacement. I mean what do expect
 it has all this crap crammed into a small package. Most people enjoy the extra added feel to them being in there. I think there is a total of four isn't there.</p>

<p>The only real issue with the control pad I came across happens in Ryse when you charge up a Javelin to throw, or in Halo Spartan Assault when a turret overheats. It's hard to explain but it's like the vibration motor is spazzing out.
</p>
I don't think there's a problem with the control pad. Think it's just how it's built, but it can be kind of immersion breaking.

<p>If I would have had two controllers I would have sent one back, however, I live in Sweden and there is no official support for the XBO because is has not been released yet, if the issue is still there after the release I might send it back for a fix.
</p>
<p>Is there different "versions" or updated versions of the 360 controller? If so then they might sell one for the ONE with a few bug fixes later.</p>

<p>Yes, they did update the 360 controller with a different D-pad that I loved that also was not incorporated in to the Xbox One controller. However, I haven't had any issues with the D-pad yet I just liked the feature(s) and fit-and-finish of the improved
 360 controller better.</p>

            <p>Hi Raghunandan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be difficult for us to provide the exact path for the environment variables because each software installed on the computer adds a entry in the environment variable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform&nbsp;system restore back to a point before you did that.</p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">Disclaimer: Application /programs that were installed after the last restore point will

            I'm trying to install the update because I had read on these forums that it could assist in my troubles in playing Counterstrike: Global Offensive, as it becomes unplayable at times. I was hoping the patch would fix my issues, but it will not install.
 I cannot seem to install the update in compatibility mode either. I would just like to know what I can do to fix the issue of a laggy mouse in games, and if a wired mouse would solve the problem. Thank you Kalpana.

<h2>            My right scroll bar turned black after tinkering with some settings and it won&#39;t go back to grey&#63;</h2>
                    I was getting to know my laptop's buttons and what not, and I clicked Ctrl+Alt+Delete (by the way I have Windows 8) and I was looking at the button that said "High Contrast" and it was off. So I clicked it, it then switched to "On", and I noticed that
 things switched from white/grey to black &amp; etc. So I decided to take it off and I wanted things back to normal. But when I turned it off, my scroll bar on the right side of the window, stayed black. It didn't turn back to white/grey like it normally was. In
 some windows it's white/grey, but in most, it's just black and I can't see where the scroll is on the scroll bar. So I don't know where I'm at on any given webpage. Is there a way I can fix this? I just want my scroll bar to be back to normal.<br />
By the way: I have Google Chrome.<br />
Thanks! <br />

    <title>Lenovo Ideapad stopped detecting tablet mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrcook128  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo Ideapad stopped detecting tablet mode</h2>
                    <p>After downloading a recent Windows update (KB 3197954), my Lenovo ideapad Flex4 has stopped automatically switching to tablet mode. I had this problem once before and downloaded a Yoga Mode Control driver, which did the trick at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this latest problem, I deleted the driver and reinstalled -- to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to uninstall the Windows update, but 90% of the way through, a message pops up that it cannot complete the uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to restore to before the update -- again, a message pops up that it cannot restore to that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reset Windows 10. You guessed it -- cannot reset Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else is there? As an aside, it would be great if MS would stop actively trying to break my computer.</p>

            <p>Thank you for responding. Unfortunately, I was not able to resolve the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The system file checker returned no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When performing a clean boot, the problem persisted and I was still unable to uninstall the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When performing the Windows Update Troubleshooter, it detected a potential WU database error, which it apparently cannot fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm not sure if this database error is my smoking gun, but if it is, is there something to be done about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Recurring Notification every Restart - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Recurring Notification every Restart</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have this notification that keeps reappearing every restart.</p>
<p>Not just doing a restart. Turning off and on the PC causes it too. Simply, every time I turn my PC's power on.</p>
<p>It's the same set of notification that keeps recurring over and over again every time I turn on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Info:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro Build 17763</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps Done:</p>
<p>1. Reinstall the related apps. - After reinstalling, when my PC goes to a power cycle like turning it off and after some time turning it back on, the notification brings back all recurring notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Notifications are recurring?</p>
<p>1. I keep getting this "Restart now" notification about an Audio Bus. After a restart, it is still there.</p>
<p>2. WD Discovery. A notification about the successful update of my Windows Home Cloud System. It keeps reappearing&nbsp;despite closing it every time.</p>
<p>3. Focus Assist. An annoying notification that keeps reappearing informing me about preventing any notification while I play video games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any fix for this?</p>

<p>Hi Jennifer,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the reply. However, I am also very well&nbsp;aware of how that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/328071e4-f8e7-4253-a8bb-5377a636e6d2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/328071e4-f8e7-4253-a8bb-5377a636e6d2?upload=true" /></a>I
 believe that's not where the problem lies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you notice, some apps are already disabled and I am managing the start up very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this was not happening before the latest major update.</p>

<p>I've updated my Windows 8 pro pc to the new version 8.1 by the Microsoft store, and I've update all the system drivers for the full compatibility with the new SO too.&nbsp;(graphic card, sound card, chipset, Sata...BIOS)</p>

<h2>            Help for MINIDUMP analysis</h2>
                    <p>Dear users at the Microsoft community,</p>
<p>I am a newly "converted" windows user and I am here looking for help regarding a (potential) faulty driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently experienced on my newly built PC the following error resulting in BSOD&gt; ATTEMPTED_EXECUTE_OF_NONEXECUTE_MEMORY.</p>
<p>After searching on the web I followed the instructions the verify my drivers, leading to immediate crash on startup. I then booted in safemode and obtained the following MINIDUMP (link to dropbox containing a zip of the four files):&nbsp;https://www.dropbox.com/s/fsvd3uvnrs613bw/110215-3750-02.zip?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then uploaded it to OSRonline obtaining the following, which I can't unfortunately understand (long text incoming):</p>
<pre>ATTEMPTED_EXECUTE_OF_NOEXECUTE_MEMORY (fc)
An attempt was made to execute non-executable memory.  The guilty driver
is on the stack trace (and is typically the current instruction pointer).
When possible, the guilty driver's name (Unicode string) is printed on
the bugcheck screen and saved in KiBugCheckDriver.
Arguments:
Arg1: ffffd0002a36e4c0, Virtual address for the attempted execute.
Arg2: 8000000231b0c963, PTE contents.
Arg3: ffffd0002a36e310, (reserved)
Arg4: 0000000000000002, (reserved)

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Alternatively pin WLMM to the start menu.&nbsp; The projects are listed and can be deleted individually".
 I would like to try this approach because I am not comfortable with editing the Registry. However, I can not find MLMM in my Windows 10. Do I have to download it from webs? If I download MLMM from the web, will MLMM be automatically added to the start menu?
 Do the project files (.wimp) listed under Movie Maker occupy computer space? Any help will be highly appreciated.</span></p>

                    I recently installed my Creative SB Live! Value WDM driver, and the sound works fine, but the microphone doesn't. It doesn't show up in the Volume Mixer, although when I go into the sound settings under recording, it is set as the default device. This
 is not a problem with the microphone itself, because the same driver worked in build 7000. Please help, I really want my mic to work.

    <title>Windows Support &#47; Teamviewer Scam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> attachmentsinkansas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Support &#47; Teamviewer Scam</h2>
                    <p>I received a telephone call from a person claiming to be Microsoft Support. He "confirmed" his legitimacy by giving me my computer's serial number. He had my computer ID, my name, and cell phone number - so I proceeded with his system config direction, critical
 errors, etc.</p>
<p>Very quick and very knowledgeable and then he pounced on my 10,000 critical errors and claimed my computer would crash at any minute and that all would be lost?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution was to open a TeamViewer session with him which I declined upon further investigation. He said, "fine" and promised to call me in an hour, which he did more than once.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I immediately conducted a MalwareBytes scan, CCleaner, and have Avast installed + Microsoft firewall. Scan turned up no problems. My questions: how did he get my name, cell number, and computer serial number? I did not open TeamViewer or provide any personal
 information; should I be concerned about a keylogger? Or anything else after the precautions that I have taken? Thank you.</p>

    <title>Pausing of Windows Updates - Which updates does it actually pause&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calvin.009  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pausing of Windows Updates - Which updates does it actually pause&#63;</h2>
                    Dear community,<br />
<br />
On my PCs running Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise I can pause Windows updates for approx. 35 days.<br />
I make frequent use of this option. Until a while ago, under the 'pause/defer updates' switch there was a note saying: "Important security updates will still be installed".<br />
<br />
However, lately this note is not displayed anymore and I cannot find any information on what the 'pause updates' setting actually does. Does it just pause feature updates? Or also quality /driver / security updates?<br />
<br />
Could anyone kindly provide me with this information?<br />
<br />
Thank you.

    <title>Can&#39;t create a recovery drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john mno  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t create a recovery drive</h2>
                    I realize there have been other posts on this problem, but I have read them and still find the information extremely unhelpful. I have a Lenovo T430U that came with W8 preinstalled. I installed the W 8.1 update in Sept and still managed to create a USB
 recovery drive in December. &nbsp;I have made no major changes to my system since then, though I did go through a period of frequent blue screens in Jan. until I uninstalled Avast antivirus and went to Window Defender, which stopped the blue screens. &nbsp;I recently
 decided to re-do the recovery drive and got the message, "We can't create a recovery drive on this pc. Some required files are misssing. Use Windows install disk or media". &nbsp;Disk Manager shows that my hard drive DOES contain a recovery partition that is described
 as "healthy". &nbsp;Can you help me solve this frustrating problem??

    <title>Surface Pro 2017 External Monitor Black Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skthen_k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2017 External Monitor Black Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran into some issues with my MS Surface Pro 2017 and could not seem find a solution for this problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just earlier today the a few horizontal lines on the external monitor flickers and it happened on and off.</p>
<p>Unplugging and re-plugging the display port cable makes it work fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not long after, the external monitor screen went black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setup:</p>
<p>Surface Pro -&gt; Display port to HDMI converter -&gt; HDMI cable -&gt; Monitor</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test:</p>
<p>Use another laptop with a Display Port -&gt; Display port to HDMI converter -&gt; HDMI cable -&gt; Monitor ... Test was successful as I can see the output on the external monitor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following but to no success:</p>
<p>1. Unplug and plug converter</p>
<p>2. Power cycle monitor</p>
<p>3. Restart surface pro</p>
<p>4. Ran Windows update and it installed latest surface pro firmware<br />
5. Ran "Search automatically for updated driver software" for the display adapter in Device Manager</p>
<p>6. Manual install each version of Intel HD Graphics 620 driver from latest to 5 versions back. Driver obtain from Intel website. Each install was followed by a restart.</p>
<p>7. Tried solution posted here:&nbsp;https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/6uxfl7/fix_fix_for_external_display_monitors/</p>
<p>8. Tried changing display settings e.g. Extend screen, Duplicate display and etc.</p>
<p>9. Tried changing resolution.</p>
<p>10. Tried changing screen refresh rate of monitor</p>
<p>11. Swap HDMI cable</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weird thing is, the surface pro seems to detect the display and it can even show the name of the display.</p>
<p>Its just that the monitor is only showing a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts, comments, solutions are welcomed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>skthen_k</p>

<p><strong><em>Its just that the monitor is only showing a black screen.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When that happens to me the monitor shows "HDMI No Signal".&nbsp; Previously I was able to make it retry (without abusing my connectors) by pressing Win+Ctrl+Shift+B or by changing the Display configuration (e.g. by pressing Win+P, CursorUp, Enter&nbsp; etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
 lately HDMI does not work at all.&nbsp; I have had to switch to VGA; e.g. put an HDMI-VGA converter on the path and used a VGA cable to the monitor's VGA port.&nbsp; As with your case, I don't think it is the hardware because the same HDMI connection works fine for
 my Surface 2 RT.&nbsp; The only difference would be the HDMI-HDMI adapters the two Surface devices need.&nbsp; (The RT has a micro-HDMI&nbsp;jack and the Pro has a mini-HDMI one.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW not only does&nbsp;W10 detect the display it will try to use it.&nbsp; E.g. you can switch to Second Screen Only and then tell it that everything is fine with Win+P, End, Enter and then with an appropriate pause Tab, Enter.&nbsp; Then you get to use your black screen.&nbsp;
 Make sure that you have Narrator running though (Win+Ctrl+Enter) but also make sure that your default audio port is not associated with the problem HDMI video device or you won't be able to hear it helping.</p>

<h2>            Creating recovery drive lost all the data.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Recovery Drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I &nbsp;tried to create a recovery drive using the recovery option in windows 10 control panel. It accidentally created the recovery drive in my external hard drive which was connected to my PC at that time even though I clicked cancel in the creation wizard.
 My external drive was 1TB and had almost 850 GB of data and now it only shows 31 GB. Is my data lost? There were some really important documents. Is my data loss or are they invisible? How can I recover them? I did not format the drive. Please help me.</p>

            <p>There is nothing you can do. A recovery drive is a bootable dvd or thumb drive but if you make the mistake of allowing it to use your external hard drive--which is not bootable--it wipes the hard drive and all is lost. Cold comfort-- I did the same thing
 mistaking recovery for system image. Consider it a lesson learned. You will have to redo all your backups and system image and delete all the recovery files from the external drive or just reformat it in Disk Management.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a warning when making the recovery drive that goes by fast about all files will be deleted.</p>

<h2>            Problems with my Canoscan 8800f and Windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I tried to ask this question before, but it seems to have disappeared.</p>
<p>I'm currently living in Japan. Recently I bought a Sony Vaio VGC-Js54FB with Japanese language Windows 7 64 bit installed. After updating everything, I installed PhotoShop CS2 and my Canoscan 8800f scanner.</p>
<p>Everything worked fine for the first few uses. But as time went on, the scanner software took longer and longer to start up. A couple of days ago, I got an error message claiming that "manuscript not positioned correctly; protective sheet hasn't been removed;
 lock switch is engaged" none of which were true.</p>
<p>I downloaded the trial version of VueScan and it worked. So I downloaded and installed the most recent drivers and UI software from Canon.</p>
<p>Instead of testing it immediately like a fool, I waited until the next day. Attempting to access Canon's software got me a "Missing twain source" notification. Attempting it through VueScan got me "There is no scanner attached"</p>
<p>I've unplugged, plugged in in the hopes Windows would try to reinstall the drivers itself, but no go.</p>
<p>I use the scanner a lot for my website, so I'd like to get this problem sorted out as soon as possible. So any help leading to a solution would be much appreciated.</p>
