<h2>            My Skype will no longer ring on my computer.</h2>
                    All other sound applications work.&nbsp; I receive the visual note that I am receiving a call, but no sound.&nbsp; Sound test works fine.&nbsp; When I connect with callers from the visual prompt, we hear them fine &amp; they can hear us.&nbsp; I tried reloading the skype software
 but that did not seem to help.&nbsp; Any ideas?

    <title>Recovering files in found.000 folder to its original location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aajo13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovering files in found.000 folder to its original location</h2>
                    Hello friends, I'm here asking for a quick advice or solution to my problem,
<br />
<br />
and to be as helpful as possible.<br />
<br />
<strong>How it happened:</strong><br />
<br />
<p>I've been using a USB &nbsp;Enclosure for my Laptop HDD, since my laptop broke. Last week I removed the USB cable abruptly because</p>
<p>it didn't let me remove the hardware safely because "in use by some program" I ensured there wasn't any window open and I</p>
<p>just did it. Later when I returned home I found that all partitions were unreadable and when clicking on anyone, it tells me to:</p>
<p>"Format in order to use this disc" something like that using Windows7, hence my surprise. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>The problem:</strong><br />
<br />
<p>I ran <strong>CHKDSK</strong> command from the Windows 7 startup repair tool on every of my partitions, I actually used<strong> /f /r</strong> and it made corrections<br />
</p>
<p>and fixes to my partitions, but when I was doing it into my last partition (the big one) during the 4 of 5 step (file processing stage),</p>
<p>my pc reseted itself (not new to me). I logged on win and I was able to see my partitions and files, BUT, on my big partition (where I</p>
<p>had Windows7 installed on my laptop) I couldn't see the <strong>Users</strong> folder, it's where I have all my projects, documents, User files, etc.</p>
<p>I uncheck "hide protected system files" and to show hidden files, I saw the <strong>
found.000</strong> folder there, inside contains folders like</p>
<p><strong>dir0000.chk</strong>,<strong> dir0001.chk</strong>, and 40 more of them. Inside of each dir folder are all my files from the
<strong>Users</strong> folder of Win7, what a big </p>
<p>relief to me, but are mixed-up and disordered.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>My Question:</strong></p>
<p>Is there any way or command to make my recovered files return to the original path/location? Including to its folder with their respective names?&nbsp;<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>I ran the <strong>CHKDSK</strong> once more to complete the operation on my partition from other PC using XP and it finished all stages, processing all files, but it</p>
<p>didn't create the original folders and move my files to them. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any answer is appreciated as I need to get my files in the original location. I don't want to think doing it manually because I believe there must be a way,
</p>
<p>and if not, I will go the manual way. Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Alberto.&nbsp; </p>

            Chkdsk has been around for a long, long time and during all these years it produced found.000 folders that nobody (as far as I know) can use it any way. Makes you wonder . . .
<div><br />
<div>Try this:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Back up your existing files to an external medium. <b>This is important!</b>.</li><li>Launch Windows Explorer.</li><li>Right-click one of the folders that has files missing.</li><li>Left-click the line "Restore previous version".</li></ol>
<div>You should now get a fully populated folder. If any of its files are older than the ones you backed up in Step 1, replace them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is an excellent opportunity to review your backup philosophy - unless you prefer to wait until you suffer a major disaster (e.g. a hard disk crash).</div>

    <title>Skype Vers. 8 causing Laptop to overheat - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Vers. 8 causing Laptop to overheat</h2>
                    <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have an HP Envy X360 Convertible 15-cn0007na, with Intel i7-8550U CPU @1.80GHz, 16GB RAM, 64bit and Windows 10 Home ed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The laptop was bought in September 2018 and had right from the start a problem with the CPU overworking causing it to overheat and the fans to remain on constantly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It was discovered that the problem was caused by <strong>Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation</strong> and was due to SKYPE version 8.33.0.50.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Tried reinstalling <strong>Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation</strong>, but the problem will go away only for a few minutes and return shortly after.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried reinstalling SKYPE several times, but it did not solve the issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, once SKYPE is uninstalled the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I therefore installed an earlier version of SKYPE (7.40.0.104) as recommended by another HP Envy user that had experienced the same issue, and that resolved the problem, enabling SKYPE to work without causing my laptop to overheat.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the last few days, SKYPE kicked me out of the older version, forcing me to update back to the new version.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Which I did, and now my laptop is back to overheating and the fans running constantly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The CPU usage is at 31%, with <strong>Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation
</strong>using up to 29% of the 31%.</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried reinstalling the old version, but it keeps forcing the update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have been forced to uninstall SKYPE to avoid damaging my laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>I will appreciate if you could find a solution to this issue caused by your new version of SKYPE or if you can provide me with an option to use an older version of SKYPE that does not cause such issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks</span></p>

    <title>Installing updates on Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing updates on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 10 Update - how to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm somewhat new to Windows 10 and can't figure out how to download updates. Whenever I search in the settings panel for 'update' it shows me a 'Look for updates' button. But when I click this, I just get the Windows Update settings screen. Here I can see
 what updates are available, but I can't choose/select any of these and there is no download button anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 did mention an automatic update feature/setting, but there's no such thing in the settings panel either. Only an option to choose at what moment it can restart, which I do NOT want Windows to do by itself, never.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really Microsoft, why do you always have to make things so complicated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks, I did get that far. But like I explained in my previous post, I can't find any way to actually download these updates once any are found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that every newer version of Windows is all about modernized visuals, not improvements.</p>

            <p>I don't know if my problem comes into this category. Whenever I try to make an account and login with it using 'Microsoft Account' it shows the same message viz. 'User Profile cannot be loaded'. I had to use safe mode using F8 to create a local account and
 then logged in the local account in normal mode( it always allows my Microsoft account access in safe mode), deleted my MS account and now using the local account but missing all the fun of windows 10 (Upgraded from W07 (64 bit) to W10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:-1) Even now when I try to create any MS account (Administrator or standard) it cannot be loaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) My Windows phone ( 8.1 Denim) is using the same MS account am trying to access my PC with.</p>

            <p>We found a solution/workaround, this problem is the result of the Default user profile in Windows 8.1 that is not compatible with Windows 10. We had it on a couple of computers, but not all. It could be the result of a non up-to-date Windows 8.1 installation.
 Renaming the hidden Default folder under C:\Users\ and copying the Default profile from a working Windows 10 computer solved the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Renaming the folder and running sfc /scannow to recreate the default folder did not work!</p>

            <p>I was in this situation as well.&nbsp; After much troubleshooting, I decided to reset my newly migrated Windows 10 tablet, with the clean drive option.&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have much data to backup.&nbsp; The consolation was that the reset process worked pretty seamlessly.&nbsp; Although it took some time for me to re-install my apps but the effort was worth it as it also resolved other&nbsp;system performance&nbsp;issues on my PC due
 to this clean re-installation.&nbsp; It breathed new life&nbsp;into my tablet PC!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to take this option then make sure you backup your data and be prepared to re-install your applications.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I logged in with the administrator profile that was working and copied a Default profile from another working Windows 10 machine as suggested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default profile in c:\users is hidden (at least it was on my machines). &nbsp;So you'll need to check Hidden Items under the view menu in File Explorer, rename the Default profile folder in the destination machine, then copy the Default folder from the working
 machine. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a new profile or try to log in with one that was giving the error message. &nbsp;After following these steps, Windows created the new profile and all appears to be working.</p>

            All the other suggestions didn't work, but copying the default folder from an other windows computer worked flawless. And I had also an older windows which wasn't updated too much. Perhaps there is a problem there.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I am having the same problems. I get "We couldn't connect to Microsoft family right now, so your family on this device might not be up to date."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to add one account to family member (my nephew's), but that account does not fully work. Search the web and windows&nbsp;does not work, the windows menu is incomplete (does not have all items, tiles are missing, and some do not work), searches do not
 work, searches in explorer do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried adding another family account to verify if it was&nbsp;just my nephew's account that was not working,&nbsp;but when I tried to log in with the new account, I get the&nbsp;profile error "The user profile Service service failed the sign-in. User profile cannot be
 loaded". And yes, it repeats service twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have not seen any solution to this problem. Some people suggested to activate the native administrator account, but that did not work -could not log in either -; someone else said to switch to computer account, nothing, run a diagnostic tool, and
 it did not find anything wrong. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nobody seems to have a solution to this problem. Before I go back to 8.1, I would like to try a solution that may work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I do not think the type of computer has anything to do with the errors, here is what I have:</p>
<p>This is a laptop running W10 64b, Intel i7-4700MQ, 16G memory, Not joined to a domain, just the default workgroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks for the information.&nbsp; When I asked about printing documents, I meant to ask if you could print using another program, such as Microsoft Word or whatever word processor you might have.&nbsp; Nevertheless, your statement that you can't print anything, even
 documents, from Photo Viewer is instructive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've seen, Windows Photo Viewer apparently uses its own printer setup, apart from the way "normal" applications print.&nbsp; I don't have a definitive answer for you, but these suggestions may help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Open some photo in WPV, click "Print" and then click the "Options" link in the lower right corner.&nbsp; Click "Printer properties" and examine the settings in each of the tabs to make sure that everything "makes sense."&nbsp; I can't tell you exactly how things
 should be set because different printers have different options.&nbsp; I've seen one person fix a WPV printing problem by "turning on color printing" in these settings and another by correcting the paper size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; If step 1 didn't help, disconnect the printer from the computer, go to Devices and Printers, right-click the printer and select "Remove device."&nbsp; Now reconnect the printer and it should re-install.&nbsp; Sometimes, this fixes the WPV problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; If both 1 &amp; 2 fail, the only other suggestion I have is to download (free) IrfanView and make it your default program for opening photos and print from it.&nbsp; IrfanView is far more versatile than Photo Viewer and is able to open, resize, print, and do
 much more with a wide variety of image file formats (click the "What is IrfanView" link on the IrfanView home page for details).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make any program the default for opening a particular file format (e.g., jpg), right-click on such a file, select "Open with &gt; choose default program", select the desired program from the list, and check the box at the lower left to always use that program.&nbsp;

<h2>            Xbox 360 emulator for Windows store</h2>
                    Hi, I've been thinking for some time why Microsoft doesn't publish an official xbox 360 emulator (not necessarily free) on the windows store and by that adding all the Xbox 360 compatible games or at least the Microsoft exclusive platform games.

<br />
1) Is within the hardware requirements for the game.&nbsp; You need to check with the LucasArt's web site and make sure that your computer has the hardware that will run the game.<br />
<br />
2) Always check for game file "updates" / "patches" that might be provided.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, check the game's FAQ section on the publisher's we site.<br />

    <title>Notification sound every 3 minutes but no notification - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miillk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notification sound every 3 minutes but no notification</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue where I hear the sound like I'm getting a notification but nothing pops up. Occasionally,
<em>very&nbsp;</em>occasionally, I will get one saying I'm offline or something of that sort, but it always disappears before I'm able to even examine what it says. The reason this is such an issue is if I'm playing a game (which is what I use the pc for), I'll
 hear the sound like every 3 minutes and it lags really bad before I hear it.</p>

<p>Hello dobransky,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use tablet mode with multiple displays you will need to change your display project mode (Win+P) to "PC screen only". You can change it back to "Extend" when you turn off tablet mode.</p>

 However, when I moved my Bluetooth adapter to another USB port and reconnected my headset, the speaker stopped working. It wasn't broken, because it still worked on my PS3, but it didn't play any sound from my computer. I would go to Control Panel &gt; Sound,
 and I would right-click the headset and click "test", it would show up on my screen as if it was playing, but no sound was coming through the speaker. The microphone was still working, and I didn't really use the speaker, so I really didn't care. However,
 I recently connected a controller to my PC as a gamepad, and I installed the wrong drivers while my adapter was still connected. I uninstalled these drivers and later installed the right ones, but Bluetooth had stopped wor

            <p>I would not recommend Windows Updates for drivers. I have found some such updates to cause problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, do you need driver updates? If your hardware is working satisfactorily, the answer is no.</p>
<p>Second, if you do need driver updates, get them from the PC/mianboard&nbsp;manufacturer's website.</p>

<h2>            Help to completely remove One Note from windows 10</h2>
                    I did the mistake to click One note out of curiosity but I soon realized I needed a license for that software,so I close it but now every time I start windows 10,I have the OneNote icon at startup on the bottom right. I cannot turn it off the autostartup
 since I can't access the program option (since the product key request is the first thing it prompt so I can't do anything else). There isn't a "uninstaller" for the thing,so I am stuck with this icon at startup...help me to remove this terrible product forever
 please :(

            <p>Salve @Marcus...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>quando OneNote mi diede problemi, mi suggerirono di disinstallarlo e re-installarlo di nuovo.</p>
<p>Risolsi così:</p>
<p>'------</p>
<p>1) desto su Start --&gt; PowerShell (Amministratore)</p>
<p>2) digitare</p>
<p>
<p>per eliminare OneNote</p>
<p>3) quindi installarlo di nuovo dallo Store</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>Spero possa esserti utile.<br />
Cordialmente.<br />
Mario<br />

            <p>L'icona si chiama "Send To OneNote Tool", magari è per questo che disinstallando OneNote quel componente rimane.</p>
<p>Inoltre non voglio nasconderlo alla vista,voglio che quando avvio windows quel componente non parta, ergo voglio rimuoverlo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Qualche altra idea?</p>

            <p>Hello Shawn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I did what you suggested and there isn't a accessories folder. If it was mistakenly deleted do you know how to get it back?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you have another user account on your computer, try logging into it and see if it is there.&nbsp; If it is, you can copy it to a temporary place (such as C:\Temp or C:\Users\Public\Documents) and then copy it into your Start menu in the "broken" account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't have another account, or it doesn't show there either, try making a new account.&nbsp; You can delete it when you're done, but the new account should have this folder for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tip:&nbsp; To quickly open your Start menu as a folder so you can copy in folders or shortcuts, press
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin7.jpg" />+R to open the Run box, and run the command

</li><li>Logout and into your 'broken' account.&nbsp; Go to the same Public Documents folder.&nbsp; Use the shell:programs command to open your Start menu again, and drag-drop the accessories folder into the Start Menu Programs folder to put it there.</li></ol>
