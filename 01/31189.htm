    <title>Excel&#58; How can I write a formula to check whether a particular - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twitcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel&#58; How can I write a formula to check whether a particular value is present in a range of cells, without having the cell containing the formula polluted by error codes in one case &#40;failure&#41; or the other &#40;success&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I can write =MATCH(value, range, 0). This will give me the index into the range if the value is present, and #N/A if it is not. But if I am trying to make my spreadsheet look presentable, I don't want #N/A values to be visible. The solution is not to weed
 out manually the cases where the value is not present. That is a solution to a programming error. In my application the possibilities that the value may be present or absent in the range are equally valid.</p>
<p>I can put the above formula into a cell that is hidden from view (let's call it Z99) and in another publicly visible cell write =IF(ERROR.TYPE(Z99)=7,"",Z99). This will give me a null string if the value was absent and #N/A if it was present. It seems like
 Excel thinks that there is only one right answer for any situation where an error code might be encountered, and the reaction to the allegedly wrong answer is for Excel to throw an exception that cannot be caught, leaving an error code in the cell where the
 formula resides.</p>
<p>Is it really such a crime against nature to ask politely whether a value is present in a table?</p>
<p>Is there some worksheet function that allows me to bypass this problem? Or is ir a case of "you need to write some Visual Basic code"? I really think that the latter approach is overkill for such a simple problem, and I confess that I have successfully resisted
 all suggestions that I should learn Visual Basic so far. I would be much more likely to write something in Python if it were for my own use, but the purpose of the exercise is to produce an application with the formula cells locked away in protected worksheets
 for the benefit of non-technical users who would not have Python on their systems.</p>

<p>Thanks for the pointer. In five minutes I found a posting that gave me the clue to the answer, at http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/excelform/thread/43db842d-fcb8-4b89-a946-f751d08b0ee1, although in my case ISNA was more to the point than
 ISNUMBER. Problem solved. Thanks again.</p>

            <p><span>Hi JaydenKwan,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>Blue Screen errors or Blue Screen of death are STOP errors that can hinder the normal functioning of an Operating System</span><span>. You receive a blue screen error on the computer. It can be difficult when something that is important to you does
 not work as expected. It is pretty simple and we are here to help you fix the issue. We will work as a team and get this sorted out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please answer the questions-</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>After the restart are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you try checking for virus?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you remove the external hardware?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you installed any new hardware or software on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would have you disconnect all external devices connected to the computer, except the mouse and the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The common external devices are-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>External Hard drives</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Flash drives</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Printers </span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Speakers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now, check if the issue persists. If you are unable to boot then I would have you restart the computer and try booting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would have you refer the article-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Stop error message in Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2: "Stop error code 0x0000007E</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/979538#top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/979538#top</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 3-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would have you refer the article-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In addition to the article I would have you install the latest chipset drivers for the computer from the manufacturer’s website. You may ask the manufacturer for assistance as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: Installing the chipset drivers are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure you get the computer back to Normal Mode after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Performing a System Restore will undo any changes made on your computer earlier. You may also lose unsaved information as well. Proceed at your own risk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Chkdsk scan will try to identify and repair bad sectors found on the hard drive. Any data present on these sectors might be lost in the process. The computer can also go into a no boot state. Proceed at your own risk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make sure you back up the data on the computer before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be happy to help. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail Notification is the Default Beep and I can&#39;t change it</h2>
                    <div>I have Windows 10 Pro Version 1703 Build 15063.632.<br />
I have opened the Sounds Settings and set both Desktop Mail Notification and New Mail Notification to GOTMAIL.WAV.<br />
When I get new mail in Windows Mail is always just plays the Default Beep.<br />
I even replaced the Default Beep with a Text to Wav file that says "Default Beep" to prove it.</div>
<div>Why is Windows Mail using the Default Beep and not the&nbsp;Desktop Mail Notification or New Mail Notification?</div>
<div>I used to use Outlook 2010 and it played the GOTMAIL.WAV file every time I received new mail.<br />
I have disabled sound in Outlook and closed it and rebooted.</div>
<div>I still get Default Beep when I get new mail in Windows Mail.</div>

<p>Hi Carl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There could either be a corrupted or a missing data file that's why the notification sound isn't changing the way you wanted it to be. To better isolate this issue, we suggest that you create a new user profile with admin privileges and check if the issue
 is fixed. A corrupted user profile doesn't function normally. In such cases creating a new one will help us to identify if the issue is specific to a corrupted user profile. You can refer to this article for the steps on how to:

<p>Hi Jaune,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed out of my domain user ID and signed into my computer as Administrator of the computer and added an email to Mail and turned on sound notification and added the sound in Windows\Media to "GOTMAIL.WAV" and switched the email notification sound to
 it and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having another issue with this computer that I tried to fix last month by doing a W10 Refresh, but it did not fix the problem and gave me more problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original problem that I still have is a very long delay after adding and naming a new folder.</p>
<p>It takes minutes!</p>
<p>I have to press the F5 key to be able to enter the new folder or it will say "New Folder does not exist"</p>
<p>I have the same refresh delay creating shortcuts with drag and drop, renaming files, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep waiting for a convenient time when I won't need to use my computer for an hour so I can do a clean install of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the tip.</p>

 wasn't working so I was wanting to know if there was a setting that the Xbox had that would make the microphone turn back on again. When I got a live representative I asked about this and he put me on hold for about 5 minutes and came back on the line again
 and asked me to disconnect the headset from the Xbox. Next thing I know I heard a click and he hung up on me. I waited for about 10 minutes to see if he would call me back but I never received a call back so I went back online again to support and entered
 to get back in the queue again to have a live person call me back. I received a call back about 90 minutes later and it was the same guy that had helped me before. When I asked if he was the same person that helped me with m

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sending that video.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is an older set.&nbsp; We purchased it about 2 years ago and up until now, it has worked perfectly.&nbsp; Just need to know how to get the microphone working again.&nbsp; My daughter was just sitting there playing when
 it went out.&nbsp; Wondering if we need to do updates with it and if so, how do we do it?&nbsp; Do you know?</p>

            I ran into this same issue a few years back. I had to send mine back to Astro due to an internal issue. If you think it might be an update issue you could download the Astro Command Center which should be prompted when you plug your base station into any
 computer, if not here's the website&nbsp;<a href="https://www.astrogaming.com/customer-service/firmware-and-software/software.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.astrogaming.com/customer-service/firmware-and-software/software.html</a>&nbsp;you might have to go in and manually find the
 firmware updates which are here,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.astrogaming.com/firmware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.astrogaming.com/firmware/</a>. If neither of those seem to work I would contact Astro directly, their customer service has always been awesome for me, plus they will
 know way more about their product then a Microsoft Rep.

            Astro does supply firmware updates which you can get from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.astrogaming.com/firmware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.astrogaming.com/firmware/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am assuming those are Gen 2 A50's which have the AG1 cable that connects to the controller. You can try
 a hard reset by holding down the power button and the game side of the game/voice balance for 15 seconds on the headset. Hopefully that will work. Sorry if it took me a bit to respond, for some reason my notifications aren't working tonight.&nbsp;

You can only change your account region once every 3 months so make sure you are 100% sure about doing so.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

                    <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am facing a strange problem. I have a small application that sends email to the specified user. When the email is sent, one at a time after an interval of few minutes(1 min or more), the emails are sent successfully. But if the emails are sent quickly
 one after the other, within seconds, it throws an error. There is no specific pattern for this error. Because sometimes connection cannot be made, while sometimes, it is done successfully.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is an MVC application and it is hosted on an AWS server. I am facing this same issue for
<b>two </b>separate applications hosted on different AWS servers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use the following code to send the mail:</div>

    <title>no display during boot sequence - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabriel dascalu  say:</h3>
<h2>            no display during boot sequence</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have windows 8.1 with all the updates installed on a desktop.</div>
<div>Configuration: crosshair V formula-Z, amd 8350, amd HD 6970, 8gb ram, 60gb ssd and other stuff.</div>
<div>The problem i am facing is this: when i start the machine, i see no splash screen on the display. After a small time windows login screen shows and i can perform my work and whatnot. I have lost access to bios completely. The motherboard has a feature
 that boots the system straight into bios, but the same thing happens. Weird thing is, if i press DEL at startup, i can see (judging by the power load) that the system has entered uefi bios but i have no display and therefor cannot perform any action within
 it. Another relevant information - in display configuration (take note - not in AMD catalyst) i have 2 generic non-pnp displays. One is the monitor (a Benq FP 222Wa) and the other one is also a non-pnp display with 1024x768 resolution. If i try to disable
 it/uninstall driver for it, on the next reboot it shows up again.</div>
<div>So, can someone please advice me on how to regain display during POST to have access to the uefi bios?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks and best regards,</div>
<div>Gabriel</div>

I would suggest disconnect all external devices connected to computer except mouse and keyboard. Check if it helps.</p>
<p>

If the issue persists, you may check if RAM and other internal parts are inserted properly in the slots. You may check with the manufacturer for performing the same.</p>

            Hi Geethu,
<div><br />
<div>I was able to boot to BIOS before but on an older motherboard (asus crosshair IV formula). Basically i made a motherboard upgrade and after all components had been installed i couldn't get into bios any longer.</div>
<div>So i took each component out, and plugged them back one by one to see where the did the problem lie.</div>
<div>I have some spare parts so i could check all of them.&nbsp;</div>
<div>It would seem that the video card is behaving strangely (but i cannot tell what could be wrong).</div>
<div>If i plug in an older amd HD4770 all is back to normal. Once i plug the amd HD6970, bios is unreachable, but everything else works perfectly (i've played very demanding games in order to see if the card might be faulty).</div>
<div>Also the issue with the 'ghost' monitor is present only when i plug in the HD6970.</div>

    <title>Using Windows 7 Professional with Photoshop CS2 and the HPB9180 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> consultingarcht  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Windows 7 Professional with Photoshop CS2 and the HPB9180 Pro printer</h2>
                    
<p>After using XP Professional for years my dead desktop computer needs to be replaced.&nbsp; A replacement desktop will be loaded with Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Photoshop CS2. (which is no longer supported by Adobe).&nbsp; My excellent HP B9180 printer has been discontinued (except for the inks, of course).&nbsp; The HP (XP compatible) software and plug-in for CS2 has been a perfect match -- BUT HP stopped upgrading
 software with Adobe for the succeeding editions of Photoshop.</p>
<p>Can anyone enlighten me about how to make Windows 7 Professional work with both CS2 and the B9180?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to make Windows 7 work like Windows XP?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will 64 bit technology be able to act like 32 bit technology for an XP emulation?</p>
<p>At his point it's all a mystery for me.&nbsp; Yes, I could use this (XP) laptop in lieu of a desktop replacement -- but that would be as a last and less satisfactory resort.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>SR</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi SR,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><strong><span><br />
The printer HP B9180 Pro printer is listed as compatible with windows 7 under the compatibility center. You may refer to the below link for details -</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Hardware&amp;s=HP%20B9180%20Pro%20printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Hardware&amp;s=HP%20B9180%20Pro%20printer</span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to check the below provided and get the driver and details for the printer. The printer is available
 and can be used with windows 7 as per the details provided in the below link -</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=4063&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=1142684#N691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=4063&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=1142684#N691</span></span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><strong><span><br />
Also Photoshop CS2 does not appear to be directly compatible with windows 7. My suggestion would be to try installing the Photoshop CS2 in windows 7 compatibility mode and check if this helps. Some people have been able to install Photoshop CS2 in compatibility
 mode on <br />
Windows 7. You may try installing the program on Windows 7 using Windows XP SP3 as compatible operating system.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If a program written for an earlier version of</span><span><span>Windows</span></span></span><span><span>
 doesn't run correctly; use the Program Compatibility Wizard to change the compatibility settings for the program. To change settings for a program manually, use the individual program's Compatibility tab.<br />
<br />
You may refer to the below mentioned link for assistance on compatibility mode-<br />
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><strong><span><br />
Also as a workaround you may use the Photoshop CS2 program in windows 7 under</span></strong><span><span> Windows XP mode with Virtual PC. Refer to the below provided links for details –</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/videos/using-windows-xp-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/videos/using-windows-xp-mode</span></a></span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You may also try contacting adobe support for further assistance on Photoshop at the below provided links -</span></span></p>
<span>
<p><strong><span>Step 4:</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying. Yes I can log into the microsoft account but is just another account not my main one. What I want to do is convert my local account into a microsoft account like I used to do before. I had to convert it back to a local account since
 I had to give it in for repair and I didn't want to give them my microsoft password. Regarding the screen, it has cracked and needed to be replaced.</p>

            <p>Hi Antony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is better if upload screenshots of the process;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I enter my email and password this comes up and I press "Set a Pin"</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60339443-ca44-4ad7-8253-6b33cf1b181e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60339443-ca44-4ad7-8253-6b33cf1b181e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I press retry here</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce3a5a5f-ed94-4383-823e-0cbb6250c530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce3a5a5f-ed94-4383-823e-0cbb6250c530" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here I press next and sometimes a notification pops up to verify my identity which take me back to the "sign in with a microsoft account instead" screen</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c0d48df-3a48-4df1-9754-b7449124f048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c0d48df-3a48-4df1-9754-b7449124f048" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I find my microsoft account in the Other users section instead of my local account being turned into my microsoft account</p>

<h2>            Apps starting at startup, even though they&#39;ve been disabled in Task Manager</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me or point me in the right direction here.</p>
<p>Quick Background, I like to think that I have very in depth experience with computers so please don't hesitate to be technical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing this issue on both of my computers running Windows 10, though different builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, there are some programs that launch when logging into Windows that shouldn't do, as they've been disabled from doing so in Task Manager. I've also checked that they're disabled using the Startup utility built into CCleaner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my PC, iTunes will always launch on startup. Disabled in Task Manager.</p>
<p>On my Laptop, when logging in on my work profile, Steam and Origin will both startup. Again, Disabled in Task Manager. I've also reinstalled both apps on my Laptop and they still do this. I have also unchecked the usual "Run at Startup" options within each
 respective program. Worse, they launch in the foreground taking over my screen. As I am sure you can agree, the last thing I want to load when I'm on my work profile is Steam and Origin, so naturally I have them disabled. This issue is even more annoying due
 to them taking over the screen!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is a custom PC running RTM Creators Update build 15063 with all the latest updates.</p>
<p>My laptop, Asus Taichi, is running on Build 16241, but experienced the issue on RTM Creators Update too.</p>
<p>On my laptop I only experience this with my work user profile, not my personal one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone got any suggestions on where I should look and what I should try to do?</p>
<p><br />
<br />

<p>Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
It seems that some programs may have triggered those apps to launch at startup though you've already disabled them in the Task Manager. To help us identify which program causes it, we suggest that you disable other startup programs one by one and check if your
 iTunes, Steam, and Origin apps still launch at startup. You may start with those programs that relate to launching media files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case disabling those other programs doesn't help, please let us know so we can further check on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to hear from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hello There,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled everything available in my StartUp programs via Task Manager. The programs still continue to run at startup. I've also removed them from StartUp programs in the utility Ccleaner, but they still continue to run at startup.</p>
<p>Can you advise please?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to check in both Msconfig... Services, and Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Administrative Tools\Services, and Disable them there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also check Task Scheduler to see if there is a scheduled task that is launching them, and if so, Disable it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can determine the process in Taskmanager Processes Tab, it will help identify the proper item to look for in Services...</p>

                    <p>2 weeks ago from me writing this post I, suddenly, was not able to load into any online game. I called my ISP a week later and they said they would send somone out. A week after that (today) they came out and fixed the issue with everything, but my Xbox
 One. I made sure that my upload speed and mtu was fine and my NAT type was open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MTU : 1480</p>
<p>Upload: 14-20</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested for network stats 5 times and got the same everytime except once were i got 0 for both upload and MTU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tested multiplayer connection 6 times. 3 gave "it's all good" and 3 gave "Can't Complete Test".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted both my xbox and my router multiple time each and I dont know what to do. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hello Branden,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. Were you able to run these tests when your ISP was there? Sounds like there are still issues with you connection as half the tests were good and half bad. If the internet connection was good all should
 be good. You can try and clear alt mac address. Go to settings&gt;network&gt;network settings&gt;adv. settings&gt;alt mac address clear and restart. Once that is done then try it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            if you have not done restart router also. best if both router and modem done at same time , as to the modem needs to start firt. so unplug both wait 30-1minute then plug modem first 10 seconds later then router. to see if its your isp still not up to parr
 you can plug cat5 directly into your console if the problem stil persist its possible isp still have a connection problem like port ect....

            <p>If you made a bootable dvd or usb drive boot into that and try to repair the pc using system restore, recovery or auto fix errors preventing windows from booting.</p>
<p>You can also do an implace upgrade that could fix anything above if they did not work.</p>
<p>when you opt in for the insider program the pc would have to restart and it should have given you a message to that.</p>
<p>Are you or did you have any 3rd party antivirus or firewalls installed.</p>
<p>There is a way to recover microsoft account by email or phone if that is the only issue.</p>

<p>The error code (0xc0000005) translates to STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION,&nbsp;which can occur for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; I'm sure you noticed this if you&nbsp;did any searching before&nbsp;you wrote your post. Causes include failing/defective memory (RAM), virus/malware infection,
 or damaged&nbsp;software (including the operating system).</p>
<p>The steps below assume that you have provided all the information we can possibly get.&nbsp; It may be helpful to know which Windows XP service pack level you had, as well as the program(s) listed in the title bar of the error messages.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; Systray.exe
 - Application Error</p>
<p>Did you recently install new memory or other hardware?&nbsp; If so, removing the new equipment and/or going back to your old memory may fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run a couple of different memory test programs.&nbsp; I've personally used Memtest86+ and Microsoft's Windows Memory Diagnostic (info and download
<a href="http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>).&nbsp; These tools boot from a floppy diskette or iso (CD), and run a variety of tests on your computer's memory.&nbsp; If any problems are found, you should probably replace the affected memory module.</p>
<p>If neither of these resolves the problem, it's probably due to a software problem somewhere.&nbsp; Windows files may have been corrupted (accidentally or intentionally), you might have a virus/trojan/worm/spyware, or some other program could have a bug or conflict.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would just perform a fresh reinstall of Windows, restore my data from a backup (you do back up your system, don't you?), and think about what happened before the problem started.&nbsp; Get some antivirus protection if you don't already have it-
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials</a> is free and seems to work well. Nothing is bulletproof, however, so be sure you don't put your computer at risk from stuff like websites or software&nbsp;from the "wrong side
 of the tracks".</p>
<p>If your computer came with a System Restore CD, you can use that to&nbsp;reinstall Windows and any preinstalled software.&nbsp; You would still need to restore documents or other data from backups. You might be able to do a "repair installation"&nbsp;of Windows, or boot
 from a "live cd"&nbsp;so you can get to your documents.&nbsp; In my experience, however, the time and effort required far exceed the value of any documents I don't have backed up.</p>

    <title>Issue with Sonic Adventure DX DLC Add-On - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annuitydew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with Sonic Adventure DX DLC Add-On</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Game or add-on you are having issues with: Sonic Adventure + Director's Cut DLC</strong><br />
<strong>Date you bought the content: September 19th, 2012</strong><br />
<strong>Purchased with points or credit card: Credit card</strong><br />
<strong>Specific issue you are having: Read below</strong><br />
<strong>Any error code or message you are receiving: It's the message I'm NOT receiving! :P</strong></p>
<p>Did a quick search of the forum and saw no post for this so figured I'd inquire.</p>
<p>A while back when the permanent price cut happened for Sonic Adventure on XBLA, I bought it for 400 MP along with the Director's Cut DLC for 200 MP. Today I finally got around to earning all 130 emblems, and when I did I got the last two achievements for
 the base game bringing my gamerscore to 200/250. Only 50 GS left for the DLC.</p>
<p>Well, one of the DLC achievements is supposed to unlock when you go into the Trial menu and see Metal Sonic unlocked (part of the DLC after you get all 130 emblems). The achievement is called "Metal Sonic" and it's 15 GS. Tried deleting and reinstalling
 the game and DLC to no avail.</p>
<p>Next step was to go online and do a bit of research; the most helpful thread I found was this one -----&gt;&nbsp;http://www.xbox360achievements.org/forum/showthread.php?t=301128</p>
<p>It's full of frustrated people like me! :P Apparently it boils down to a different version of the game that has slightly smaller file size (1.49GB) with the working achievements, and was put up last time the game went on sale (around this time last year),
 but I fear that with the permanent price drop I'm stuck with this 1.5GB copy of the game that is refusing to pony up the last 50 GS I'm trying to earn. &gt;:O</p>
<p>Hoping for a fix or some guidance on this one. Thanks a bunch!</p>

<p>I have this game and had the same problem. It will unlock if you get an A Ranking on all stages with all chracters. It was really hard to do this, and I dont dont think I could have done it if I wasnt a hardcore Sonic fan.</p>

<p>Blade...that's just not true. XD Also you don't have the achievement so I really think you're confusing DX with 2. In SADX there's a C emblem, B emblem, and A emblem for every level.</p>
<p>City Hunter, yeah, I don't expect anything from Sega, haha. Thanks for the advice.</p>

<p>This is an issue with the file size, it has to be 1.50gb in the games and apps folder however it always downloads as 1.60gb which is the old file size. They did fix this but then put the old version of the game back on the marketplace and because of this
 the DLC achievements cannot be unlocked. Don't ever expect this to get fixed or for anyone at SEGA or Microsoft to care because they don't this has been going on for a year now and any complaints get the same generic responses.</p>

<h2>            UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION while playing games</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I've been continuously getting this BSOD (UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION) after upgrading from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 when I try to play any game. It does not occur when i'm surfing on the internet or when it's idle. It is really frustrating because
 while playing a game and this error pops up i have to start all over again. I really liked windows 10 before this issue so i really hope there is some solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've checked and done:</p>
<p>1. Updated Windows and all drivers to latest version.</p>
<p>2. Scanned for viruses, malware, Trojans or any other harmful files.</p>
<p>3. Checked my HDD health which is at 100% good health.</p>
<p>4. My friend created a dump file which did not do any good.</p>
<p>5. Checked if my BIOS settings were messed up, but nothing wrong was found in there also its the latest BIOS version</p>
<p>6. Thought if the system is overheating, so i installed more system fans for better airflow</p>
<p><br />
Please help me solve this problem as i get very little time to play games with friends and have fun time. And sorry for the bad grammar.</p>

            Hi Jude, BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning
 startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
This could also be caused by malware.&nbsp; <span>
While in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Safe Mode</span> with networking (click repeatedly on F8 during the boot process) and try to run anti-malware programs.&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp; install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.pandasoft.com</span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at <a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</a> and let it run all the options because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span><br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you use Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.<br />
<br />
Please check with the Event Viewer utility and the BlueScreenView utility to see if there are any error codes and<br />
if so we need the numbers and other details such as drivers/files involved. There may not be any bluescreen<br />
info however the basice troubleshooting is the same.<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those reboots.<br />
<a href="http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />
<a href="http://www.winvistatips.com/disable-automatic-restart-t84.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winvistatips.com/disable-automatic-restart-t84.html</span></a><br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info that would
<br />
help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error information such as STOP
<br />
codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />
<span><span><br />
</span></span><br />
This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />
<br />
BlueScreenView scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of death' crashes, and displays the
<br />
information about all crashes in one table - Free<br />

<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery Options if your
<br />
system has that installed by the maker.<br />
<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party keyboard and<br />
mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />

Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that you are trying to upgrade to Windows 10 and you are getting this error code .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm is there is any Error message also ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to&nbsp;follow the methods provided below and check if&nbsp;it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: M<span>anually reset the Windows Updates Components and then reinitiate the Windows Update process.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Resetting Windows Update Components&nbsp;will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the below steps to reset the Windows Updates Components:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</span></p>
<p><span>3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the&nbsp;following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></p>
<p><span>4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.</span></p>
