<h2>            Sculpt Mouse Side button programmin</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This may have already been answered, if so please direct me to the proper place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally posted this here <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/68527b9f-0b0b-45ed-8af2-be43dc1db282/microsoft-sculpt-mouse-how-to-remap-key?forum=whatforum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/68527b9f-0b0b-45ed-8af2-be43dc1db282/microsoft-sculpt-mouse-how-to-remap-key?forum=whatforum</a> and they suggested I try here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The side button on the sculpt mouse and it's functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More specifically the click action...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you can change, modify the swipe action of the buttion and enable or disable the corresponding vibraton however there is no action modification for the click action of the button itself, up to and including disabling this action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a few posts indicating the same and frustration associated with it.&nbsp; It impacts my work mostly in Visio when click-drag different things around.&nbsp; If you click the button while attempting to drag-drop something it opens the windows start menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Also the window+key functions don't work with the mouse windows button, such as windows+p, windows+r, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>allowing the customer to program and/or disable the button would be VERY helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>

    <title>Still waiting for my pre-order from MS Store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tw0str0kesm0ke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Still waiting for my pre-order from MS Store</h2>
                    
<p>This is regarding a Pre-Order for Halo 4 through the Microsoft Store on 17-July</p>
<p>I‚Äôm completely appalled with the support that I was provided with multiple attempts via online chat and over the phone to resolve why my Halo 4 pre-order has not yet shipped. I‚Äôve had multiple attempts to resolve this with the MS Store customer service department.
 A couple of them sounded really sincere in their intent to follow-up with escalation and promised me call backs that failed to happen. The chat sessions were a useless waste of time and bandwidth.</p>
<p>I finally managed to force an agent to transfer me to a supervisor after refusing to allow the call to close. The supervisor confirmed the order looked complete, that my charge to the credit card was valid, but needed to escalate to determine why it has
 not shipped. I was also informed that all other requests were not on record and that this will be first escalation. I confirmed again today that my order remains in ‚Äúsubmitted‚Äù status and still no shipment confirmation in my email. I still have no email from
 the escalation team.</p>
<p>I have to remind myself that we‚Äôre really just getting excited about a game here. It‚Äôs not a life and death situation. I am in fact a very tolerant person and recognize very well that sometimes things happen. I would have left this alone if the matter was
 solved quickly. What I don‚Äôt tolerate is being lied to with promises of rapid resolution, promises of the issue being escalated, promises for a call back and fail to do so, and lastly, to find out that all the prior calls were never put to record. I‚Äôm now
 nearly two weeks without any movement since the release date. I am no longer just looking for the product that I ordered and paid for, but looking for compensation for their lies, for my time in my many attempts to resolve the issue, and for the money that
 I was charged to my card for a product that was not delivered.</p>
<p>Ironically, they sent me a request to respond to a survey on the quality of the support I received. I‚Äôm sure you know how well that was received and how I responded. Not that it matters really. It‚Äôs not like anyone looks at the outliers when reporting how
 great things are to their management.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll provide an update on the resolution when I get one. In the meantime, if you find yourself in this situation. Don‚Äôt trust anyone in the call center and insist on holding the line open until you have a supervisor on the line and remember to get and record
 the Incident ID for all your calls.</p>
<p>All in all‚Ä¶ completely unacceptable on all counts and an embarrassment for Microsoft. Regardless of the outcome, I will NEVER shop at the Microsoft Store for anything!</p>
<p>Moderator: If you think you can help, contact me for the Order ID and the last Incident ID.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. This issue may be due to the Ukraine not being a region where Xbox Live is supported. We have an article entitled
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/live/countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live Countries and Regions</a> which has a list of all supported countries and regions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As part of our regular review of our exporting practices, we are making adjustments to our service offerings in some regions to ensure we are compliant with government mandates. As a result, some services are no longer available in all regions. For more
 information on our exporting practices, visit <a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/exporting/default.aspx&amp;data=02%7c01%7cAndrew.Crews%40microsoft.com%7cd04f9bd4256e470c2f5808d62ade1afd%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1%7c0%7c636743530759221313&amp;sdata=eSZpXPbI5Fbg333Mo57fQv9Z01gwyFbzCBF5vIiYVns%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello fellow gamer,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It works for the Xbox one and the 360, for the regions. As per Leonzo if the country is not on the list it is not supported.</p>

<h2>            How Do I Block Ports with Exceptions for Specific Applications&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems with a lot of cpu usage and network traffic and would like to know how to create a firewall block rule for specific ports that allow traffic for any program or group of programs that I specify. Ideally the end result would allow me to
 block all outgoing traffic on port 443 or 80, etc. for every program except for Google Chrome and anything else I choose to allow access in the future. That way I can figure out which program is the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having really slow performance lately with a lot of programs using ports 80 and 443. When I start my computer with those blocked it is much better. I already know how to permit specific IP addresses, but that is not good enough. I want to do
 this based on application.</p>

<h2>            Fresh Windows 10 installation keeps getting corrupted</h2>
                    <p>Last night I freshly installed Windows 10 again installed nothing but updates. After rebooting I ran SFC scan and it did not find any problem. Then I checked for updates again and after installing 2nd set of update it found some problems again and could
 not repair. I tried to use system restore but it failed. CBS log is attached below. This is my last shot before giving up on Windows 10. Thanks and please help.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Software conflict is one of the possible factors that can cause corruption in your Windows 10 installation.
<br />
<br />
Given the troubleshooting steps that you've tried (running SFC), we would like to know what the exact error message you are getting is. Can you also send us a screenshot of the CBS.log file since we do not have access to the link you've provided?<br />
<br />
We'll keep an eye out for your response.

            Scanning resolution is controlled in part by the Printer/Scanner driver and the hardware.  If the hardware has not changed then the driver has.
<br />
<br />Check to see if there is a newer driver. If the driver was recently updated, try rolling it back.
<br />
<br />These articles are about video drivers, but the general process would be the same for the scanner/printer driver
<br />
<br />UNINSTALL VIDEO DRIVER 
<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/find-missing-drivers-hidden-components-device-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/find-missing-dr...</a> 
<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/ways-open-device-manager-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/ways-open-devic...</a> 
<br />‚Ä¢	This is a recent, VERY common problem being asked on the site. The current unverified best guess is to try resetting the Video driver: either roll it back, or uninstall it and let win re-install, or windows upgrade it or manually download upgrade from video system builder site
<br />- In start menu search for Control Panel‚Äô (icon view) 
<br />- Right click on Device Manager 
<br />- Select Run as Admin 
<br />- Expand Display Adapters
<br />- double click on the device whose driver you need to uninstall to display the Driver Properties dialog
<br />- You have buttons for 3 options: 
<br />- if it is active and you think the problem is a recent update, you can try the ‚ÄúRoll Back Driver button‚Äù 
<br />- or you can try the Uninstall button 
<br />- or you can try the Update Driver to let Windows do the update (often doing a driver update ‚Äúmanually‚Äù is better) 
<br />- restart Windows 
<br />
<br />
<br />If it is not an Intel:registered: HD Graphics driver, make note of the name (in case the fix above did not work). Go to the web site for the video card maker and see if they have a newer driver for the specific video card.  Also ask the same question there to see if they can come up with a better answer.

<br />Reduced display functionality with older ATI (AMD) Radeon video cards after update (not FCU specific)
<br />An update package (not RS3 specific) incorrectly targeted ~1.9M devices and resulted in reduced display functionality with older ATI (AMD) Radeon HD 2000 - 4000 series video cards. The update package is expired, so no new exposure is expected, however we have received ~3,000 support cases and observed significant forum and social activity. We are actively working on an Answers Q&amp;A post which will include mitigation instructions.

For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs.

<h2>            Why can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t we choose language and location independently&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Why are the language and location options so restrictive?</p>
<p>I live in Switzerland, so my options are restricted to the national languages. Which means that for most games, I am doomed to getting them in local translation/dub, which is generally dreadful. On the Store, I have to read bing-translated drivel for all
 but the AAA titles. I'd much rather to enjoy my media in the original.</p>
<p>Apart from that, what about english-speaking expats? They can only set the language to English if they set the location to USA or such. In which case I am 100% sure the Xbox OS will give them no end of trouble because the physical location does not match
 the one in the Settings.</p>
<p>What about Spanish? Do you know how many spanish speakers we have in Switzerland? And Portuguese? Perhaps they would enjoy using the system in their language...</p>
<p>Anyhow, I just can't see a reason for this ultra-restrictive approach. I can't imagine there's a technical constraint that makes it impossible to freely associate language and location according to need or wish.&nbsp; At the least, English could be made available
 as a choice in all locations.</p>

<p>The ability to freely choose from all supported languages has been requested a long time ago. I'm not sure if MS has even replied anything to it. There are a ton of votes for the request on the feedback site. It sucks how they region lock something like
 languages. I want my stuff to be in English. Not in Finnish. This is a giant step back and I can't think of anything else that actually region locks languages.</p>

<p>I guess I should have searched the forums first. Thanks for the info.</p>
<p>Maybe MS is just trying to remove the notion of choice. Like their Upgrade to Win10 popup that you can't dismiss, and that automatically checks itself in Windows Update. But that's beside the point.</p>

<p>That is the one with now over 7k votes. No clue why MS hasn't done something about it already. If everyone else can do it, a major software company should be able to change this as well.</p>

<p>The reasons are region locking and localization. Do a google search with "video game" and add&nbsp;either or both of those terms and you'll find a lot of different articles on the subject.</p>
<p>Some arguments make sense, others do not. But there are&nbsp;plenty of&nbsp;issues that arise when it comes to differences in international laws.</p>
<p>Just a few examples of possible issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copyright laws may or may not apply depending on the country.</p>
<p>Censorship laws&nbsp;vary between different countries.</p>
<p>A distributor may not have the rights to certain IPs outside of their region.</p>
<p>Some game content is actually altered or even omitted, depending upon what country or region the game is released, in order to make certain content less offensive for that region. Fallout 3 is an example. When it released in Japan, the reference to mini-nukes
 and the nuking of Megaton was removed due to Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki.</p>
<p>The amount of international red tape that is in the way is&nbsp;the most reasonable explanation why&nbsp;the thread that is linked to&nbsp;and it's 7k votes isn't being responded to... and&nbsp;there's a good possibility it won't&nbsp;be.</p>

<p>If that were the case, why is only the XBOX One doing this? XBOX 360 Never did this, Playstation
</p>
<p>3/4 never locked this. Any Smartphone can be set to any language, and there is a ton of games on those. My guess is they are covering themselves with regards to Kinect Voice Recognition. Once millions of people with several different accents are trying to
 get that to work, they've opened up a potential can of worms where people will complain that their hardware is not working as it's supposed to. Still I have my (Dutch) XBOX One permanently set to English/UK, and use the Smartglass app on my iPhone for purchases...
 Would have preferred to not have to use this workaround. </p>

</span></p>
<p><span><span>How sure&nbsp;are you&nbsp;that&nbsp;Xbox 360 didn't? I can't recall any game on the 360 ever having the ability to subtitle in all known languages. I can't speak for PS consoles, but I'd like
 to hear of any game made for them that can subtitle all languages. Did you play the Japanese version of Fallout 3 to see if they did or didn't remove the 'mini-nuke' content? (Not really being sarcastic BTW... just going by what info I've found).<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I believe Kinect has a list of supported locales and they may even have a disclaimer that not all languages are supported. Either of those would be covering themselves well enough.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Another quick search yielded me another answer... MS has left it up to the publishers to deal with regional support.
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I don't know that much about smart phones. I do know that the laws may differ, depending on what kind of device it is. Smartphones may play games, but they definitely are not consoles...
 and I don't see any phones playing Fallout 3 anytime soon.<br />

<p>^We don't really focus that much on just the games here, though. The thing is, we can't even use the console's own OS in a language we want to as we are only given an option to choose from the languages Microsoft pre-selected for the locale. Oh, and the
 store is an absolute horror as well since it seems like they really are using Bing to translate everything from English. The OS and the store have nothing to do with publishers, copyright laws etc. It's just Microsoft failing to provide a basic option that
 is there for pretty much every other device that let's you choose a language. Maybe it is because of the Kinect, idk, but if it is it just goes to show how big of a failure that thing is if you can't even have your system's language changed without breaking
 that thing.</p>
<p>By the way: at least on 360 several games actually have a wide selection of languages available on disc. They simply don't have the option to choose the language in the settings. Workaround? Switch your console's locale. Suddenly that horrible Finnish translation
 of Halo 4 is back to being in English :) I do believe the same does apply for One games as well as my friend had Minecraft in English for as long as her One was set to UK but since now changing locale messes up your marketplace (something that didn't happen
 on 360) she had to change back to Finnish. It's horrible. I'm just glad Finnish isn't that widely supported by developers and so far only a few games have translated content. If it becomes more common then good bye Xbox.</p>

<p>I would just be guessing, but I'd say the answer may be alluded to in your statement that says you have to choose among the languages MS provides for each locale.</p>
<p>To me, this seems to be a way to localize or regionalize gaming content. Certain games release in certain regions with the aforementioned altered content. The regional limitation of languages would make sense in this aspect.</p>
<p>Using Fallout 3 for an example again. If I download the game in the US, I would obviously have English, in addition to a few other regional selections that are most commonly used here. I wouldn't have Japanese as a choice and therefore I wouldn't download
 the Japanese version and then wonder why it doesn't have the mini-nuke content.</p>
<p>Another possible reason would be that the game&nbsp;devs would need to provide subtitles for all the languages&nbsp;that are&nbsp;supported. If there were no way to localize content... they'd either have to provide subtitles for every language supported by MS or have a
 lot of people very upset because they purchased a game in their region and there weren't subtitles for that region's language.</p>

<p>The real answer is small minded business people, who still think everyone buys everything locally, instead of realizing the global market, and taking advantage of that.</p>
<p>But you have to make do with what you have, at the end of the day it could be worse.</p>

<p>I'm sorry Blue, but that really would just apply to games being in the local language. Not the OS or the Marketplace with no options to choose from. I have to agree with Enen. They really didn't think globally. It's a shame since people can easily move across
 the planet these days yet they might not even know the basics of the local language before doing so.</p>
<p>And at least get people to translate the stuff in the Marketplace instead of Bing lol</p>

            Settings appears to have been changed to remove this option.&nbsp; When I click on settings, the only option I have is touchpad sensitivity.&nbsp; It's very frustrating because I type a lot, and I keep accidentally deleting text or the mouse jumps to another location
 suddenly.&nbsp; &nbsp;And it happens all the time.&nbsp; Very disruptive.

            <p>I was able to install AoE3, but when I tried to run it, it just hanged there&nbsp;doing nothing (I just saw its&nbsp;process started in Task Manager but I saw no window or reaction from the app).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What helped me was adding age3.exe to exclusion list for DEP (provided that you have DEP on) - maybe you can try it to run the installer?</p>

<h2>            I am unable to install Windows Update KB2639308. Error 80070002 and 80004005</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to get the Hotfix update KB2639308, but every time I try through Windows Update it gives me error 80004005, and when I delete the files in the SoftwareDistribution/Downloads folder and try again, I get 80070002 as the error code. Trying
 again after that gets me the older error code again. I have tried a number of online fixes for both of these error codes, as well as running windows automatic fix it program, but only deleting the temporary files led to any kind of change. I have also tried
 downloading the update directly from the windows support site, and avoiding windows update, but this failed as well. There were no similar error reports on this forum, or on any other I could find online.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Thank you for your help.<br />
<br />
I may have forgotten to mention this, but I am running a Windows 7, 64-bit system.<br />
<br />
Answers for your questions:<br />
1) It is only the KB2639308 update that is causing the problem. After its first failure, I installed other updates successfully while I was trying the problem update again.<br />
2) I am using Panda Antivirus Pro 2012<br />
3) The only recent software I have installed is a steam game, and steam does not run on startup, nor was it running at any point during my troubleshooting process.<br />
4) I had discovered the links in method 1 through google, and had tried both the automatic fix and the manual trouble shooting from both of them with no result. I had already tried shutting off my antivirus, but I had not tried shutting the firewall yet. Panda
 seems almost impossible to close entirely, though.<br />
<br />
I have now tried all of methods 2 and 3, but method 4 will not work because Panda has two startup items (startup tab in msconfig) that will not, no matter which option I chose, allow themselves to be disabled. I tried selecting diagnostic startup as well, but
 this simply reverts to selective startup as Panda will not allow itself to be closed on startup. Every time I hit Apply the two boxes become checked again.<br />
<br />
Also, I have tried to use method 3 a second time, as the first time I used it I tried installing the update from the manual download version, and wanted to try it through windows update, but when I attempt the ren command for either software distribution or
 catroot2, I get an error message saying "A duplicate file name exists, or the file cannot be found"<br />
<br />
Is there any other information that would help?<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we are unable to disable the antivirus, then we may need to uninstall it- at least temporarily for testing purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can we attempt an uninstall of the Panda Antivirus as a replacement for the disabling steps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may need to involve the support for that software in this as well.</p>

            XP mode is only for Windows 7.
<br />If you want to get it to work on Windows 8 you have to go through some extra steps to do that.
<br />See the link provided on how to complete that.
<br />Hope this helps.

    <title>Custom GamerPic not uploading - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l the red hood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom GamerPic not uploading</h2>
                    <p>So since the 16th of August I have been on the phone with Xbox Support a number of times. Why? All over a custom gamerpic. No matter what my profile will not allow me to upload a custom gamerpic. We have tried all of the "Official" troubleshooting steps and still no results. No matter how long I wait no changes to my account profile picture. I know it's just a picture but still I want to change it. Never had any issues with Xbox Live prior to this. I have been a gold member for 11 years. It should not take more than a month to change a gamerpic. I have tried the app, my laptop, cellphone, and USB stick to change the picture and still no results. Can anyone out there help?&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRE1eRS1.img" />These are the codes from when I contacted them recently.&nbsp;</figure>

    <title>Wrong Video Length on VOB video from mini-dv - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wrong Video Length on VOB video from mini-dv</h2>
                    Hi--I just barely got this computer with Windows 7, and I copied a home video from a mini-dv onto my computer.&nbsp; The video is a VOB file, and it plays fine, but in the "details" pane, it shows the wrong video length (9 seconds)--it appears to only show
 the length of the first chapter.&nbsp; Because of this, when I try to work with it in Windows Live Movie Maker, it only plays the first 9 seconds of my video, so I can't edit it at all.&nbsp; If I move the little scrollbar to the end of my video, I get little peaks
 at the rest of my video, but I still can't edit it.&nbsp; I can tell there is some kind of error here--this also happens when I download video straight from my mini-dv onto Movie Maker.&nbsp; Searching online, I can find that a lot of other people have this problem,
 but I haven't found any answers yet.&nbsp; HELP!!!!!!&nbsp;Thanks.&nbsp; :)

<p><span>Hi skdennis,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The video file would have not copied successfully, retry by copying the file once again or check in some other
 computer to see if the same problem persists. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A possible reason for wrong video length showing in Windows media player or some other player is the video
 file is corrupt or not copied successfully or a power cut-down happened during the copying process at the end causing the video file to show wrong video length. Please check if these .VOB file length shows correctly in other video player that plays this type
 of file. Play the file using different player and check the video time length.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards</span></p>

<h2>            Unable to install &#34;Age of Empires III War Chiefs&#34; on Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Age of Empires III War Chifes will not install</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a new Windows 8 computer 64 bits. When I wanted to install my favorite game Age of Empires III the expedition War Chiefs will not install meanwhile the Asian Dynasties and the regular Age of&nbsp;Empires is installed and works fine.</p>
<p>I have searched the web and couldn't find the answer, when I try to install I get 1268 error. I tried any solution offered on the web. I will be happy if someone will be&nbsp;able to guide me throw it.
</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>I had problems installing this game as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The error occured to me was that the program was not installed for all users.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I found a solution by:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Going to Computer&gt; C: and putting the option to show hidden items.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. After it a hidden folder named ProgramData will appear.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Then you should go ProgramData&gt;Microsoft&gt;Windows&gt;StartupMenu&gt;Programs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. When you are in this folder you simply create another folder named Microsoft Games.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. Inside this new folder you create another one named Age of Empires III</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. Now just try installing again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This worked for me on Windows 8, I hope it helps somebody.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

    <title>Separating out 2 program items on Windows 10 Taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noel macaulay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Separating out 2 program items on Windows 10 Taskbar</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to separate out 2 identical program buttons/items on a Windows 10 taskbar, but can't figure out how to do it.&nbsp; I typically keep 2 Outlook 2010 buttons open on my taskbar, one for my "Inbox" and one for "Sent".&nbsp; I would like to have some separation
 between them (i.e. another program button between them), for ease on keeping them separate.&nbsp; However, when I drag and try to move one, both move at the same time and to the same location.&nbsp; I have not been able to find out a way to do so.&nbsp; The best I have been
 able to do is to make the buttons or taskbar items "large", so as to add to the ease in clicking on them.&nbsp; Any thoughts?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
                </div>

<br />
<br />Right click your Taskbar, choose Taskbar Settings

<br />Scroll down that settings page and set 'Combine Taskbar Buttons' to Never

<p>&nbsp;Thanks - I tried it earlier.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it does not work.&nbsp; When multiple windows of the same program are open (e.g. 2 Word documents, or 2 Outlook screens (Inbox and Sent, for example), dragging one drags the other, and to the same location.&nbsp; What
 I am looking for is a scenario where, for example,&nbsp; I can have&nbsp; Outlook (Inbox) button/taskbar item, followed by a Word document, followed by whatever, followed by Outlook (Sent), etc.&nbsp;

            To the best of my knowledge you can't do what you want. 
<br />
<br />Windows will either group them all under one button on the taskbar, or show all of the sessions for the same program side by side.

    <title>XBOX One Turns off when playing games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hefinthegreat  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX One Turns off when playing games</h2>
                    
<p>Im facing an funny issue, my new XBOX One works fine when I am downloading games, downloading apps, watching youtube videos , streaming videos from my PC..the only problem comes when im playing any games..I have downloaded Volgarr The Viking , Max Brotherhood
 , Crimson Dragon and Chariot while playing them the Xbox Just turns off ..</p>
<p>Situation 1 :<br />
While playing Volgarr The Viking - It turns off when im at the first stage and played for a few mins.</p>
<p>Situation 2 :<br />
While playing Max:The Curse of Brotherhood - It turns off right after the beginning story where Max's brother is abducted by something after Max reads the curse.</p>
<p>Situation 3 : <br />
While playing Crimson Dragon - It turns off immediately after the initial credits which displays the logos off the developers and sponsors/</p>
<p>Situation 4:</p>
<p>While playing Chariot - It turns off when I reach the First Exit at the first stage.</p>
<p><strong>What ive tried?</strong></p>
<p>1) Checking the connections to the power supply, plugged it directly to the power source without a power surge, changed the power cable which runs from the power source to the power supply unit.</p>
<p>2) Tried the Hard Reset thing which I found on many forums.</p>
<p>3) Tried Factory Reset. (Downloaded Games Again which happened without any problems but after they are downloaded the Xbox One shuts down at the same points as the above situations)</p>
<p><strong>What I see on the power supply when its off?</strong></p>
<p>I see the orange light lit when its turned off, the console does not turn on from the Controller Button but then I have to tap the Xbox One Button on the Console to turn it back on.</p>
<p><strong>What I think it may be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Power Supply</strong></p>
<p>I think it could be a problem with the power supply which cuts off when the console tries to do something heavy or takes some more load, like starting a game, finishing or saving etc..but I dont know if that really is the problem. Because all the other things
 work fine like browsing videos(I watched almost a 30 mins Video on Youtube and it did not go off) , I downloaded those games which are above 1 GB and they did download properly..</p>
<p><strong>Heating Issue</strong></p>
<p>I also read that the Xbox tends to shut down when it gets heated but they all say it shows some Error Code. But this Xbox just turns off and it is not heated..as Ive tried turning on the xbox , signing in and immediately tried loading Crimson Dragon and
 it turns off at the same point as explained in the situations above.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Console Problem</strong></p>
<p>I really hope it is not a console problem as I do not want to send it back and wait for the replacement unit, I dont like the way the XBOX Support is in INDIA they are not at all helpful, the Chat guys tell us to call them and the phone support guys just
 try to follow the troubleshooting steps that does not fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im going to try getting my friends power supply unit from his XBOX one and try using it with my console and see if the problem still exists, if it does then I think it would be the problem im worried about and that is the defect in the console ;( which would
 really be a nightmare..</p>
<p>Have you guys faced similar issues and what did you guys do to fix it? Please share and also let me know if there is anything else I must try..</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>
<p>I finally tried my friend's XBOX One Power Supply Unit with my console and it works just fine.. No more shut downs, so the issue was with my power supply unit.</p>
<p>Now comes the most irritating part.</p>
<p>I called the XBOX One India Support and explained to them the whole issue..after few irritating minutes of useless troubleshooting which the agent was doing..he accepted that the problem is with the Power Supply and puts me on hold..then gets back to me
 and tells me that the Power Supply Unit is out of stock and they cannot send a replacement unit..</p>
<p>Im now trying to find a vendor who can sell me the power supply unit as I do not believe that Microsoft will have it available anytime soon and I do not want to use my XBOX One as a Paper weight till then..</p>
<p>Seriously Microsoft don't you guys know that Power Supply Units, Controllers and other such common accessories are mostly the ones that need replacement shouldn't you have these over stocked in a country where the XBOX One Sales are so high???</p>
<p>According to one news channel it said that on the day one there were 200 units were delivered by Amazon.in to MUMBAI Alone..let aside the other big cities in India.</p>
