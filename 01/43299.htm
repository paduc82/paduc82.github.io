            What, exactly do you see when you enter the recovery key?  Is it THIS situation? <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/sln285155/how-to-unlock-bitlocker-when-it-stops-accepting-recovery-keys?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/s...</a>

<br />You may need to use a recovery image and wipe and reinstall Windows if you can't clear this error <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacereco...</a> - we can't guess at what caused the issue, sorry.

<p>Similar situation with the link you shared (https://www.dell.com/support/article/id/en/idbiz1/sln285155/how-to-unlock-bitlocker-when-it-stops-accepting-recovery-keys?lang=en).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use command prompt, however it requested me to input the recover key (a white box under it) to get going.</p>
<p>Where can I get the recovery key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>From the previous case that happened to me, I've downloaded the 'recovery image' which I did and I can use my surface after a while (which is like a month ago). I still saved the recover image in USB and I tried to plugged in the same USB and follow the
 same instruction, it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It keeps show me the windows logo, diagnosing the problem, then ask me to restart again or advanced options due to the restart wasn't done well, then I choose the 'advanced options' and goes to the page where I choose the language and keyboard type, then
 the part where I can choose the solution either using drive or other troubleshoot. If any press any button/solution given, the phase repeated from the windows logo til the page of showing 'troubleshoot' or 'use a device'.</p>
<p>Any solution for this?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            The recovery key should be stored in <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/RecoveryKey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/RecoveryKey</a> 
<br />
<br />try that with the instructions from the Dell site
<br />
<br />As for using the recovery image, here are the steps you should follow to insure it boots from USB, etc. 
<br />
<br />Step 1:	Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in.
<br />Step 2: 	Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.
<br />Step 3:	Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.
<br />Step 4: 	When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.
<br />Step 5:	When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.
<br />Step 6: 	Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.
<br />	If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.
<br />Step 7: 	Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.
<br />Step 8:	Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.
<br />Step 9: 	Choose either Just remove my files or Fully clean the drive.
<br />	The option to clean the drive is more secure but takes much longer. For example, if you are recycling your Surface, you should clean the drive. If you are keeping your Surface, you just need to remove your files.
<br />Step 10:	Select Reset.
<br />	Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take several minutes).

<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this won't happen again, but you should consider regularly backing up files and data stored locally.

<h2>            windows 10 reset won&#39;t boot to windows after reset</h2>
                    <p>hi. I have reset my old laptop so It could run faster, but after I reset the computer it wouldn't boot to windows, it would instead boot to a black screen saying "there is no operating system". I'm a dumb 12 year old and I know not much about computers so
 I thought that resetting a computer would remove all unnecessary files. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Buster.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If Reset failed then you'll need to create the bootable media to do this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Buster, try running the Reset again . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

            I ran the last 29 memory dumps (10 to 23 Aug 2012)<br />
<br />
Let's start with the Sony Extension Firmware Parser driver.&nbsp; It dates from 2007 and is a known cause of BSOD's on Sony Win7 systems.&nbsp; Please visit the Sony website and download/install a later, Win7 compatible version.<br />
<br />
Your Norton Internet Security drivers date from 2009.&nbsp; Please uninstall it immediately, and install one of these free antivirus solutions while testing:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.carrona.org/freeav.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.carrona.org/freeav.html</a>&nbsp; Ensure that the Windows firewall is turned on AFTER uninstalling Norton.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You also have McAfee installed - please uninstall it also (just for testing).<br />
<br />
ATI video drivers date from 2009 and must be updated.<br />
<br />
Your Conexant SoftK56 Modem Drivers date from 2008.&nbsp; Please update them as they're not likely to be Win7 compatible.<br />
<br />
Both your wired and wireless networking drivers predate the Win7 release, so I'd strongly suggest updating them also.&nbsp; Wireless drivers are blamed in several of the memory dumps<br />
<br />
Your Media Card Reader drivers are from 2009, I'd suggest updating them also.<br />
<br />
Daemon Tools (and Alcohol % software) are known to cause BSOD's on some Win7 systems (mostly due to the sptd.sys driver, although I have seen dtsoftbus01.sys blamed on several occasions).<br />
Please un-install the program, <u><b>then</b></u> use the following free tool to ensure that the troublesome sptd.sys driver is removed from your system (pick the 32 or 64 bit system depending on your system's configuration):

            Hi Kim.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this in Windows 10 Mail app?  What might have happened is if you're both using the same Windows 10 account, you've co-mingled your email accounts in the Windows 10 Mail app, which is only meant to be used by the person who owns that Windows 10 account.  
<br />
<br />To separate this, go into Windows 10 Mail app, choose Settings (gear icon) at bottom of Inbox, then Manage Accounts, find your account to highlight, then Delete it.  
<br />
<br />Now go into Windows Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users to create your own Account - either a Microsoft account with an existing email address of yours or a new one, or a Local Account as shown here:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Sign into your new Account, set up Windows 10 Mail with your mail accounts as shown in this tutorial:  <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            OK thanks for clarifying, Lee.  
<br />
<br />Are you using the Windows 10 Mail app?  Find Mail app in the All Apps list in Start Menu, check where I said in my original post to see if only your accounts  are listed there, and remove any account from the other person that is present on each of your PC's. 
<br />
<br />If not then please tell me how you are accessing your email exactly?  If not the Windows 10 Mail app are you using a browser to sign into Outlook Mail, or is this the Outlook Mail app?  Open your mail to see which.

            Each one of you should have a separate account on any PC you ever share.  This will keep your mail separated.  
<br />
<br />So figure out who has the present account on each PC at Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info. 
<br />
<br />Then check if there is another account already at Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other People.
<br />
<br />If not in the same place create a new account for the other person.  Sign into that account and set up the Windows 10 Mail app with your own personal accounts only:  <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your mail is set up, sign out and into the other account and remove your Mail accounts from Windows 10 Mail by highlighting each and choosing Delete - because they are now set up separately on the other account.
<br />
<br />You should no longer have your mail co-mingled and if you do it is going to need to be sorted out by your Mail provider.  
<br />
<br />This is how to approach the problem.  If not then we'll try another way.

    <title>Very Disappointed With Xbox One Controller Quality - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Very Disappointed With Xbox One Controller Quality</h2>
                    
<p>So I bought my Xbox One exactly two weeks ago, and my controller that came with the console is already falling apart. &nbsp;Yesterday I noticed a clicking noise coming from my left analog stick. &nbsp;It occurs when the stick is pushed in and rotated. &nbsp;It feels like
 it is grinding against something inside the controller and sometimes becomes unresponsive in game. &nbsp;The whole left side of my controller seems to be creaking when pressure is applied to it, while the right side is fine. &nbsp;Also my left bumper appears to be unresponsive
 at times. &nbsp;This happens sparsely, but is definitely noticeable. &nbsp;So naturally after noticing these issues, I started examining my controller closer. &nbsp;It looks like the front and back plates of the xbox one controller is just glued together with some sort of
 epoxy because I noticed some white gunk started to come out of the cracks where the back and front plates of the controller meet. &nbsp;Has anyone else noticed the epoxy as well or can confirm this for me? &nbsp;Is it Microsoft that gypped me for this "$60" controller?
 Or the gamestop store from which it was purchased? &nbsp;Any sort of insight would be appreciated, as I am extremely frustrated that I spent 500 dollars on this console when the controller hasn't even lasted two weeks for me. &nbsp;At first, I liked the grip on the
 analog stick as they seemed as if they would be durable, but now I realized that the whole structure of the controller is about as sturdy as an N64 controller. &nbsp;And we all know how many freaking n64 controllers everyone has been through.</p>

<p>Thanks...I guess</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would recommend you start a service claim to replace your controller. &nbsp;Mine are fine, I have a Day one and another- they both feel great and have had no problems.</p>
<p>You can start your request here at the Xbox online Service page: <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/en-US/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>My controller feels solid and it is a Day One Edition. &nbsp;I've heard that people are saying the controllers are poor, but unfortunately there are going to be bad apples in the bunch. &nbsp;Register your console and get your controller replaced.</p>

<p>Have a look at my blog where I've embedded a video of the issue also (<a href="http://planet-veato.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/is-there-problem-with-xbox-one.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">planet-veato.blogspot.co.uk/.../is-there-problem-with-xbox-one.html</a>).
 There is an issue with the controllers and on two I've had the same problem with the left analog stick. It could be that my two replacements also have the issue but I haven't played much FIFA since having them replaced.</p>

<p>The Xbox One controllers are the worst design, very poorly manufactured with cheap materials. I'm now on my 5th controller, (My Day One controller lasted just three days) through the left stick failing. I play Fifa, I play Fifa a lot, like 5 hours a day,
 the controller was obviously not tested on this game, because the left stick is used constant. At the first the controllers start to grind at 11 and 2 o'clock positions, after a few days, then these areas become unresponsive, and the controller fails. Thankfully
 my GAME store know of this problem, so its just not me. Microsoft need to sort this out, and quick, I wish I could use my 360 controllers!!!</p>

<p>These controllers are quite possibly the cheapest controllers I have ever used in my entire life, and I'm not exaggerating. &nbsp;For being first party controllers, these are despicable. &nbsp;I have never had a broken controller for any console I have ever owned.
 &nbsp;I am very gentle with my electronics but these controllers feel like they're breaking within weeks of owning them and I only play 1-2 hours a day.</p>
<p>First of all, when I was playing CoD, it kept feeling like the conroller was flexing whenever I was pressing the right thumbstick, I was examining the controller and realized that the panels on the sides are loose and flex in when pressed. &nbsp;I guess these
 cover up the screw holes maybe? &nbsp;Regardless, its very annoying when you are playing a game and it feels like the controller is caving in. &nbsp;I never had a problem with any 360 controller.</p>
<p>I bought a second controller from another retailer and it also had the same issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another problem is the triggers feel different from one controller to another. &nbsp;Another issue is if you just tap the edge of the controller you can feel the vibration go through the whole controller, it feels like its mostly hollow with cheap metal inside.
 &nbsp;But only one controller does this and the other doesn't.</p>
<p>Another issue is the analog sticks wear out very quickly. &nbsp;After just a few days of use, the rubber on the analog stick (not the thumb area but the stick part of the analog under the thumb area) started to wear out and plastic dust was all under the thumb
 area, again very cheap materials. &nbsp;The 360 had this issue but it was much less.</p>
<p>The quality control is very inconsistent from one controller to another.&nbsp; This last weekend I used my older 360 controller (2 years old with much more use) and its build quality is miles ahead of the One's controller.</p>

<p>Mine keeps disconnecting (it is not battery issue). &nbsp;Light blinks and it comes up saying reconnect for no reason. &nbsp;So sight line issue or any reason I can tell for the problem. &nbsp; Chat swaps from headset to TV when this happens also and then back again when
 it reconnects on its own. &nbsp; &nbsp;Never had these issues with 360.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection</h2>
                    How come I have to reinstall Microsoft Solitaire Collection every time I want to play? If I don't reinstall it, it starts up and then disappears. So I reinstall it and it plays alright. But all the icons and such are just pink squares. Except for the cards,
 of course.

            Alright. Well, I just realized that this all started after an update to Win 10 about a four days ago now. It just seems odd that this has happened after an update. I've been having other weird issues after updates, but those are for other posts.

<p>When I looked at my notes for the activation key I saw that windows has changed the installation ID.

            Hi Carl, this is a known issue with the Microsoft Activation servers at the moment,  you do not need to do anything, this matter will be resolved automatically
<br />
<br />Quote From Chat Support 
<br />" 
<br />Microsoft has just released an Emerging issue announcement about current activation issue related to Pro edition recently. This happens in Japan, Korea, American and many other countries.I am very sorry to inform you that there is a temporary issue with Microsoft's activation server at the moment and some customers might experience this issue where Windows is displayed as not activated. 
<br />Our engineers are working tirelessly to resolve this issue and it is expected to be corrected within one to two business days.

 not helping.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

<p>Hi Zaaphod,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Your issues regarding the activation of Developer Mode in Windows 10 is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the Web and Software Developer audience on Microsoft Developer Network
 (MSDN) Forum. Please post your question in the MSDN Development forum.</span></span><span> Kindly visit the link provided here:
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=development&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>In addition, I have stumbled upon a document in our support site when I was doing research regarding your concern.I thought providing you this document would help you a bit with your concern. The document contains information on how you can properly enable
 the Developer Mode in your computer, including sub-links, which still leads to the MSDN forum threads for workaround. Anything else that cannot be answered by this document, please feel free to post on the said forum. The link is provided here:

            Hi James.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the touchpad software from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.
<br />
<br />Then check the controls to adjust as necessary at Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad.
<br />
<br />Also there under Additional Options click the touchpad tab on Mouse Properties to adjust any settings needed there, including ticking the box to "Disable touchpad when external pointing device is attached" to avoid palm-drag on touchpad causing cursor to jump.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi FormlessChief,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. I understand you are attempting to purchase Game Pass Ultimate but, are experiencing issues completing the order. Are you on an Xbox One or a Windows 10 PC? If you are on a console, try purchasing the item online:
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-pass?&amp;OCID=AID644966_SEM_XsmS1YP1#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate - Microsoft Store</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

            You did a recharge so it is not a standard debit card it is a pre-paid card; that is most likely the problem.

            Yes it would be different for subscriptions because they are recurring charges once you sign up for them and with these pre-paid cards they do not like recurring charges like that.

<h2>            Issues with the multi keyboard languages in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Strange multi keyboard conflict </p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 10 in English to write in 2 languages - English and Hebrew, with the standard US and hebrew keyboards. Occasionally, a third keyboard appears - the UK English keyboard, which is a little different than the US one. I cannot remove this keyboard,
 however, as it doesn't appear on the language options:</p>

<p>
</p><p>The issue is coming and going. Any ideas what to do?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Nitzan,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might be if you have enabled the UK (English) language in the Control Panel.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Provide us with the below details for better clarity on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Did you check whether the UK keyboard is listed in the Control Panel in the Language settings?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the below steps for the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + X</strong> keys on the keyboard, select <strong>Control panel</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Language</strong> in the search bar located at the top right corner of the control panel.</li><li>Click on <strong>Language</strong> from the search bar results.</li><li>Check whether you are able to see the UK language keyboard layout, if you are able to see then select it and click on
<strong>remove</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this information regarding removal of the UK language in settings is helpful. If you are facing this issue further please contact us we will be glad to help you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The Control Panel language screen shows the same languages as the Settings language screen, so there's no language to remove:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee972174-efa6-4b96-ac4d-3688f322fc06" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee972174-efa6-4b96-ac4d-3688f322fc06" /></a></p>
<p>I'm able to *temporarily* solve the problem by adding UK English then removing it. It then disappears for a while, but re-appears after several hours.</p>

<div>Sorry I don't recognize the problem. Please provide more information about your problem to make it easier for&nbsp;technicians&nbsp;to solve it.<b>&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<b>Method[1]: Make sure Windows recognizes the driver</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Start menu and select Run...</li><li>Type the following into the text box:&nbsp;compmgmt.msc</li><li>From the left pane, Select Device Manager under System Tools</li><li>From the right pane, Make sure that you can see your driver name under "Network adapters". If not, Then your driver may not be probably installed. (You may see an exclamation mark next to the driver. If you do not see the mark, Then Windows could not detect
 that the driver was attached to the system)</li></ul>
<br />
Please notice that Some Laptops/Motherboards comes up with a CD/DVD which contains the drivers installed on the Laptop/Motherboard. Sometimes these drivers are integrated with the Windows CD that comes up with the Laptop. You have to insert the CD/DVD that
 came up with your Laptop to be able to use the drivers within it. You may also have problems with the Sound Card, VGA Card and Network adapters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may want to search the internet for the drivers if you can't find your CD/DVD.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
I hope this was helpful :)</div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I Agree with Picrofo EGY.</p>
<p>It seems that your wireless network adapter is not recognized and you need to </p>
<p>install the driver throgh you CD\DVD driver of your laptop or you can directly go to
</p>
<p>Aspire site and search for your laptop Model and downloading the Driver.</p>

<p>Let's try clearing ALL live tiles: From the Windows 8 Start screen, select Settings, Tiles, and Clear personal information. This will clear all info from all tiles. Each tile will rebuild with new info from the point at which you cleared the info and the
 previous “bad” info will not be included.</p>

<h2>            OEM license in corporate environment</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if it's okay to purchase Windows 10 pro OEM licenses from a webshop to upgrade several laptops. Or even a Retail license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware of the differences between OEM and Retail, but i can't find any downsides to a OEM version besides it getting stuck on your MOBO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are planning to upgrade all laptops which are running Windows 7 pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any best practices and input on whether we need to buy OEM or Retail licenses?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi JoeyPol,
<br />
<br />I would advice against purchasing OEM licences from a 3rd party website, most are a scam - what website were you proposing to purchase these licences from?
<br />
<br />Legally, you should be purchasing Retail licences as OEM licences are only meant for System Builders and not meant for upgrading From Windows 7 to 10 . . .

<p>Hi Dave thanks for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clear, we will be buying retail licenses.</p>
<p>After a little bit of research, the price difference between OEM and retail licenses don't seem to be that big. Could you somehow confirm this for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, via the official Microsoft website, they ask a whopping €250,-.</p>
<p>And €39.99 here:&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Beware of Product Keys Sold Separately 
<br />With the exception of Product Key Cards (PKC’s) distributed with COA’s, Microsoft does not distribute products keys as standalone products. If you see a listing on an auction site, online classified ad, or other online page advertising product keys for sale, it’s a good indication that the keys are likely stolen or counterfeit. If you were to purchase and use a stolen or counterfeit product key to activate Windows installed on your PC, the key may not work for activation, may already be in use on another PC, or it might be blocked from use later by Microsoft when the key is reported stolen.
<br />
<br />Essentially the keys sold to you might stop working anytime. However, if you buy a PC that comes with preinstalled Windows, it is okay to use so in the corporate enviornment.
<br />If you have a large number of PCs buying volume licenses would be a way to go.

            Hi Joey, the licences on that web link you have provided are not legit . . .
<br />
<br />They are volume licence keys, they will activate at the start and after a month or so, they will deactivate. They are meant to be used in an organisational environment and would be re-armed from the company server on a regular basis
<br />
<br />Honestly they are a waste of money!

            Hi,
<br />please read system builder agreement on OEM packet. When you installs OEM, you become obliged to sell a computer after installation. Is this what you want?

            To bring the computer out of the power save mode press the "Windows" key once and release, wait one second, then press enter. The system should come out of power save mode. The Windows key is the key with the Microsoft Windows Symbol on it. Another solution
 would be to disable power management. <br />
To disable power management, right click on the desktop, click on properties, screen saver, then Energy Savings Settings button.<br />
Change all the settings to "Never", then click on "apply" and "ok". Power management has been disabled.<br />
