                    <p>I cannot log into my other Skype account either because I entered the wrong email for the primary alias so the verification code I need was being to a non email</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried MULTIPLE times to use an existing email/create a new email/ and even rename the alias; however, EVERY time I get the error "You've already renamed this account. &nbsp;Please try again later." &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the account recovery process (via the community discussion boards), but it asked me to change my password (that has been reset at least six times during this process), and then looped me back into the same cycle of trying to fix it and
 getting "You've already renamed this account. &nbsp;Please try again later." &nbsp;What does that even mean? &nbsp;I'm still able to log-in with my other Skype user name AND password, I just cannot go any farther because it is waiting on a verification code from an email

<h2>            Windows 8 won&#39;t boot on battery, build 9200 &#33;&#33;&#33;SOLVED&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I have this weird problem windows 8 not booting up when using battery on my laptop, it just hangs in boot screen with windows 8 logo and rolling circle and hdd activity light stopped after two rolls, where it normally would have booted up. Also i have
 to force restart and then it boots up on battery mode. But every first boot it hangs on battery. It boot up just fine when its plugged in.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is quite annoying problem and it shouldn't happen, had no problems with windows 7 whatsoever.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'am not a total newbie with computers and i have tried troubleshooting by changing power modes and processor states, as they could(?) affect the battery mode. I can't remember if it was like this after install as the laptop is plugged in 99% of the time,
 so it's not the first thing i try when i install new OS, that it will boot up when using battery.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have disabled hibernation</div>
<div>I don't have any third party firewalls or virus protection</div>
<div>I have installed latest( best working, newest are beta's ) drivers for GPU's</div>
<div>chipset is up to date same as samsung firmware</div>

<div>I don't know why it affected my windows 8 booting up mainly on battery mode!!! But it is very weird problem.</div>

            Hi Matias Vatanen,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting the question. It‚Äôs very unfortunate that you are unable to boot the computer to normal mode. I will help you to find a resolution regarding the issue.<br />
<br />
1. What is the make and model of the computer? <br />
2. What type of installation have you performed? (Upgrade or clean installation of Windows 8)?<br />
3. Do you get any error message when you tried to boot the computer? <br />
4. Do you get any black screen? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps and check the status of the issue:</div>
<div>a) Boot using Windows 8 Installation disk and perform startup repair. <br />
b. Insert the disk into DVD drive and restart the computer.<br />
c. Press F12 key (typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers) and choose the drive that you inserted the installation media into.<br />
d. Once the Windows Setup window appears click Next.<br />
e. Click on Repair your computer.<br />
f. Click on Troubleshoot and then select Advanced Options.<br />
g. Click on Automatic repair.<br />
h. Follow the on-screen instructions and finish the repair.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For reference:</div>
<strong>Windows hangs or freezes </strong>

            1. computer is laptop by clevo model p150em, assembled by notebookguru.
<div>2. I performed clean installation on NTFS formatted ssd from kingston 8gb usb stick.</div>
<div>3. No error messages nor black screen just startup animation with windows logo with rolling circles. animation does not stop, it keeps rolling just nothing wont happen and disk activity stops.</div>
<div>4. No black screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is not a huge problem, since i rarely need to boot using battery, but it is weird and i want my pc to run flawlessly, no matter the condition.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Edit</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Ok, i tried the automatic repair, twice, <b>which didn't find any problems</b>, and after the repair, i was unable to boot up while plugged in either, waited with boot animation for
<b>15 minutes</b> with no change and then i had to force restart. After restart booted up fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, i'am using legacy bios mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Update</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>So, i figured out that the problem is somehow related to my <b>secondary HDD</b>, since it seems to go away (at least 5-6 restarts worked without any problems) with the HDD disconnected. I have my master drive Samsung 830 128gb SSD with the win 8 installed
 and secondary HDD western digital scorpio blue 5400 rpm 750gb as a data drive, and it has no programs installed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is very odd that it could affect the os booting? since windows 7 x64 professional worked without any problems like that. just windows 8 x64 professional have this weird not booting up at battery and randomly even plugged in.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>NOTE&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>samsung is at SATA III 6GB/s</div>
<div>WD is in HDD caddy ( dvd-drive replacement ) in SATA II &nbsp;3GB/S</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also tried booting up in safe mode, which have no affect in the issue, also tried to boot in selective modes and they have no effect aswell. Also did error checking on the HDD, with no errors found. &nbsp;S.M.A.R.T data show that the HDD is still in good
 shape with 6700 hours of usage and 2500 starts.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'am out of options, since i don't want to disconnect my secondary HDD every time i want to boot up on battery without extra restarts..&nbsp;</div>

            Did you solve the problem or merely find out the problem? Am having similar issue too. If it's like what you said(bad sectors on HDD) how can I format C drive(with OS in it) without affecting the files?

<h2>            Print Spooler needs to be restarted when printing from Adobe to HP Plotter printer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having an odd issue where if I print from Adobe to an HP Plotter printer (when using Print Preview) the print spooler gets stuck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open a PDF document and go to print dialog page. From there I click on properties and check the box that says show print preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I print the print preview never comes up and the document never prints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look at the queue for the printer and the document is stuck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to clear is to stop print spooler, clear queue, and restart print spooler&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used another local admin profile on the PC and it has the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe Acrobat DC is being used (Version 19.010.20098)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HP Plotter is an HP DesignJet T770. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! </p>

            Hi Chelsea.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can run the Printer Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />The latest firmware and driver software is from 2015.  Make sure you have those versions installed in both places from <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-designjet-t770-printer-series/3980524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservic...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps: . 
<br />
<br /> Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model‚Äôs Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Changing target line in properties to a shortcut for video game.</h2>
                    I am trying to change the target line in the properties tab, but I am unable to click on it. It is just grey. I was able to do it in XP, but not in Windows 7. How do I do this?

            Hi lifesaverjoe75,<br />
<br />
Can you check something: Navigate to the game's folder &gt; Right click on the file which is launching a game &gt; Create a shortcut &gt; can you change properties of that newly created shortcut?

<h2>            Windows 10 update stuck in restart cycle</h2>
                    I forced the update today by following some methods I found online by deleting the downloads folder and running a command line prompt. Everything seemed to go well I went through the black screen with the percentage icon now my computer restarts every
 30 to 40 seconds without booting to the desk top.

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I can understand the inconvenience caused, be assured that we are here to help you with your concern.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Some PCs may need a long time to download Windows 10, depending on the quality of the internet connection, the amount of data to move and the computer‚Äôs speed.&nbsp; In some cases, it may take as long as 24 hours, so please be patient.&nbsp; If your hard
 drive is still flashing, there‚Äôs a good chance it is still making progress.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are a few points in particular where the progress bar may slow down significantly enough that you may believe that progress has stopped:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>At the black screen with a blue circle at the 30-39% range, while Windows is downloading all dynamic updates for Windows 10</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Again at 96%, when Windows is busy backing up your data</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>And at the message ‚Äú</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It's taking a bit longer than usual to set up your device, but it should be ready soon‚Äù</span></span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>If the upgrade seems sluggish, try disconnecting any USB devices and extended display cables that may be connected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This has been seen to speed up the download process significantly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please contact support or start a new thread if it‚Äôs taking longer than 24 hours on the same screen or percentage.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you do, make note of the CPU‚Äôs make and model, the country you are located in, what screen you are stuck on and the percentage shown.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The agent may ask if they can collect the setup logs to investigate the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps. Please reply for further queries on this.</span></span></p>

            <p>This has absolutely NOTHING to do with what I said. The entire update was fully downloaded and the installation process was running just fine, it finished the screen with the large percentage wheel and was attempting to restart after that. It would then
 restart approximately every 30 seconds, without loading into windows so there was nothing I could do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now spent over 8 hours on hold waiting for technical support, this last instance being over 2.5 hours to have the system hang up on me and tell me your closed. I have a ticket number and I've explained my issues countless times to reps and no one has
 done anything besides forward me to another wait line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've manage to get my computer running by installing windows 10 through a usb key onto another hard drive doing a clean install. I've attempted to recover/roll back to windows 7 and all of my recoveries do not show up in any of the supplied windows tools.
 My windows 10 now says I haven't upgraded and that my windows 7 key is invalid.</p>

            I solved it by reinstalling SQL Server.&nbsp; I'm not sure about this it seems the recent Windows update caused a problem with SQL Server.

<h2>            Output to external monitor from surface book... can&#39;t set resolution on external monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an i5 Surface Book with the Nvidia GPU. It's connected to a 34 inch ultrawide LG monitor using the mini display port/hdmi cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The resolution is set as 1920*1080. In the display settings I cannot choose a resolution greater, so the screen looks fuzzy. I've tried using windows update, and have tried updating the monitor and display adapter drivers, but nothing has worked so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be massively appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Prompt to select the type of audio device inserted not working. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordan--the doctor--davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Prompt to select the type of audio device inserted not working.</h2>
                    I just upgraded to windows 10, and I have to say I love it. The problem is that I have an acer aspire v5, which has only one slot for audio/microphones. This is fine, as when you put something in, it asks what kind of device you have put in, and then it
 works. The issue I have right now is that when I put a device in, the prompt comes up asking me to click on it to input the device inserted. As of now, when I click on the prompt, it simply closes, and it does not allow me to select my device, rendering my
 headphones/headsets/mics useless. Help would be appreciated.

<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We would like to get a little more information from you to help troubleshoot your issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please answer the following questions as best you can.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Who is the manufacturer and the model number of the MP3 player?</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><br />
You cannot directly transfer video to video mp3 player using Media player. In order to transfer it you will first need to convert the video file to the format that the mp3 player support. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>You can check with CD that came with the player that might contain the file converter or check for any third party converter that will help you accomplish this task.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will need to contact the player manufacturer to get more information.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let me know if this worked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            svchost.exe localsystemnetworkrestricted is reading unnecessary files</h2>
                    I have windows vista sp2.<br />
svchost.exe localsystemnetworkrestricte is reading unnecessary files like videos and big downloaded files (not system files). It causes slow harddrive.<br />
+ it reads files from my external harddrive and its drives me crazy because I cant disconnect it so I have to restart the computer to safetly remove the harddrive.<br />
Why does svchost.exe reads unnecessary files when INTERNET IS CONNECTED!?

    <title>Rearrange account order in Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajarn_thomas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rearrange account order in Mail</h2>
                    <p>Recently the order of my accounts changed. I have no idea how that happened as I haven't initiated any changes in any of the email accounts, like changing a password or adding or deleting an account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook, my main account, used to on top but now it has been moved down by a Yahoo account that I do not use much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This shows that it is possible to change the order. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I change it back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to delete all my accounts and then add them back in the order I want. I went thru **** setting up Mail in the beginning and don't want to have to go&nbsp;thru that again!</p>

            <p>Windows 10 mail is so rigid and user unfriendly. It's little issues like setting a default email account or changing their order which gets peoples goat and makes them revert to another platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the language spell check is mediocre at best ... sometimes you have to select the langauge "English" multiple times before it refers to an alternative dictionary. Even then it often doesn't take t all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Buggy programme; should be great.. it's not. Are they looking issues like this at all?</p>
