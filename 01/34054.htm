<h2>            Password entry on the screensaver required every 2-3 minutes</h2>
                    I have a 2013 Lenova laptop with windows 10. If I let it sit for 2-3 minutes for a break the screensaver pop-up box requires me to re-enter my password to continue. Annoying time waster.

<p>If I am reading this right you put disk in for the first time and after that you don't need to install again. why don't Microsoft have the game installed to the cloud already and when we get the disk we install a patch to beable to play on the cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sony said you can play the game while it is downloading. in order for it to do this. they have to play on some type of cloud.</p>

 Xbox One games on any console as long as you are signed-into your profile. &nbsp;In addition you can begin playing your games even before they are fully installed.</p>

<p>I personally think buying the CD is a waste now. &nbsp;You're better off just buying the game online.</p>
<p>Then when the next Xbox comes out in 2022, they will close out the current system and you will loose all those games anyway.</p>
<p>I feel bad for the folks who have bought arcade games on the current Xbox Live system. &nbsp;Microsoft is saying, sorry, you loose all of those and we take your money.</p>

<p>They have made physical discs 100% useless. Also I understand that installing it locally is faster than downloading it from the cloud but why bother?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Everyone says that this is the same as Steam? No..its a watered down waste of time.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Tell me about the Xbone's support for user created mods. Tell me about all those 3rd party peripherals you can use. Explain to me how I can take advantage of lower prices due to multiple markets being supported. Can an Xbone do everything a PC can do? No?
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>NO it can not. It wants to implements all the negative aspects of PC gaming with NONE of the benefits. It just does NOT offer enough to justify its existence.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>They intend to nickel and dime you down to the last incompatible headset. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>We ALREADY enjoy the positive features now without the restrictions. I can go to my friends house right now. Recover my account and download any of my games on demand games and play them on his system. I can also leave a disc there and he can play it with
 ZERO hassle. Because it has been purchased and its not up to MS or the developer after the sale.</p>

<p>I just need some evidence that we wont face losing our arcade downloads if they shut anything down. I just find it strange that while Minecraft for instance is already on the arcade, but they are releasing a disc version soon (if not already). I just find
 that very odd for any other reason than added content, which could have been added by download anyhow.</p>

<h2>            cannot restore from backup with only a Bluetooth keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Booting from a Recovery Drive created in Windows 10, it wants me to enter my user password, but my Bluetooth keyboard won't connect. I found an old USB mouse that works,&nbsp;but there is no option to even use the on-screen keyboard!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to install Windows 10 from scratch, then recover from within Windows 10, but it did not recover all the important stuff (!?) my apps and settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Will recovering from the USB Recovery Drive image my machine back to the way it used to be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How do I do this without a a USB keyboard?</p>

<p>
</p><p>2. I started having daily hard system crashes that seemed to correlate to a recent update to the Plex app, the only thing running during the last time it crashed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unable to easily install an older version of Plex, I decided to use my diligent backups to roll back to a previous system state. By the way, Windows 10 makes this very confusing with the various 'kinds' of backups in a bunch of different places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I do a restore while Windows 10 was running, only selecting the system drive to restore. That completes, but also complains about not being able to replace a few exiting files. I don't see the correct changes and now apps aren't running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I boot from a USB install disk and restore the C drive, formatting it to clear any old files. The restore throws some errors at the very end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything boots, but none of the apps work and all of my settings are gone!</p>
<p>I try restoring everything via File History, but same scenario - no settings.</p>
<p>I try restoring from earlier and earlier backups, always the same situation.</p>
<p>I try making a recovery drive and restore from that, but it is now asking for a password but the Bluetooth keyboard is not recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now at my wits end. Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

    <title>How do I stop any program being associated with a .lnk file type&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _tony_i_  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop any program being associated with a .lnk file type&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My daughter has associated Microsoft Word as the default program for all .lnk file types. This means that any time we try to click through a shortcut to open up a program we end up opening Word instead.</p>
<p>I know how to associate another program with a file type. But I can't work out how to remove the association that has been set up without replacing it with another equally unhelpful program. Alternatively I don't know what program should be set up as the
 default for .lnk files.</p>
<p>Any ideas gratefully received.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. I tried it but unfortunately no joy.</p>
<p>The first problem was that the command prompt in the menu is itself a link which is now associated with Microsoft Word! However I found the program that it points to (cmd.exe) and ran that as adminstrator and did as you say.</p>
<p>When I typed the line in bold it responded with .Lnk=Lnkfile which looked promising. But unfortunately nothing has changed. I rebooted for good luck but still nothing.</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Tony.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Media Player media library update, from  music files stored on external usb drive.</h2>
                    <p>Media Player is adding my mp3 and flac files to the media library as I type.</p>
<p>I have several Various Artist collections and Media Player keeps adding individual songs by Artists to the play list. How to I stop this from occurring? I do not see anything in settings that could be selected to prevent this behavior.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>I am a Linux user and do not have this problem with the Banshee Music Player.</p>

            <p>Here is another solution to consider.</p>
<p>I found that my external hard drives were constantly being re-indexed each time I accessed a different media file to play. The following fix described was for Windows 7 Media Player but the procedure also works on Windows 10. I will add one additional step
 to the procedure that you will need to reboot your computer for the changes to take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Excerpted From:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/4c6edb49-f335-44e1-9339-9d86ae0dea25/windows-media-player-auto-sync-to-external-storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/4c6edb49-f335-44e1-9339-9d86ae0dea25/windows-media-player-auto-sync-to-external-storage</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Currently, we may still use the workaround to disable sync settings. Meanwhile, Media player cannot differentiate between a media player and any other portable device so the only viable method I have found to deal with this issue is to disable the auto sync
 entirely.&nbsp;This will also stop Win7 from auto-syncing images and everything else but you will still be able to manually transfer files to and from your media players and cameras and no important Win7 function is impaired.</p>
<p>

<li><span>Click Start and then Run... (Or the shortcut is Windows key + R).</span></li><li><span>Type "Services.msc" and press Enter.</span></li><li><span>Scroll down to "Portable Device Enumerator Service".</span></li><li><span>Double click and change "Startup Type" to "Disabled".</span></li></ol>

            I had this as well. When I retried to search and load updates the computer called for a restart. After the restart I searched and installed again. The message is gone. Maybe it required one update to be installed and the computer restarted before it could
 install another.

 file was corrupted and couldn't be used.&nbsp; Only backup was from 5 days ago.&nbsp; Restored that file and caught it up to date but need to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking that maybe the file needs to be closed and unused, I quit Quicken (I usually just leave it open for quick updates) and left the computer running.&nbsp; After three hours there still isn't a new backup from today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; What triggers this process to run?</p>

</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and on the run box, type
<strong>services.msc </strong>and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Find and double-click Windows Search and check if it's disabled. Set it to <strong>

<h2>            Airplane Mode turns on by itself&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a MSI Apache Pro GE72-2QF with Windows 10 64bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I start my laptop from being totally shut off or from sleep mode the Airplane Mode automatically comes on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check the Action Center and the Airplane mode is on and so then I go to settings to turn it off but then the same thing happens every time I turn the laptop on or wake it from sleep.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your time!</p>

            <p>Hi Kara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide the&nbsp;assistance required to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the&nbsp;information stated below</p>
<p>Did you make any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I would suggest that you&nbsp;perform the methods mentioned below to help us narrow down the cause&nbsp;of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Safe Mode</strong></p>
<p>Place you computer in Safe Mode and&nbsp;check if the same symptoms re appear when you reboot your computer. Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. Click on the link
 below to learn how to log into Safe Mode</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Clean Boot.</strong></p>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. Click on the link below to
 learn how to troubleshoot in &nbsp;this mode</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to me. Sorry to just get back to you now as I have lots of things going on at one time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not say with any amount of certainty rather the issue began after I installed a program or made an update or anything of the sort.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just purchased this computer in January and have been adding the needed software and updates bit by bit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the things you've suggested at my earliest convenience. However, it may be a couple of&nbsp;days before I can go through the trouble shooting suggestions as I am in the middle of several workflows which makes it too difficult to close everything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not forget that you're trying to help and I promise to return to address this matter as soon as I am able.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your patience and understanding. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Kara&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I get rid of &#34;Test Mode&#34; from my desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>So a while back I noticed that for some reason the words "Test Mode" were in all four corners of my desktop, along with "Microsoft(R) Windows(R) (Build: 6002: Service Pack 2)". While it doesn't seem to affect&nbsp;performance&nbsp;at all,
 it is certainly annoying.</span></p>
<p><span>I think at about the same time I first noticed this when I noticed that there was a second user account on my computer called "ASP.NET" or something like that. Fearing it was some kind of virus (stupid, I know) I deleted this
 account and ever since this "Test Mode" watermark has been on the corners of my desktop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This is a totally legit version of Windows Vista that came with a computer I bought off of New Egg.</span></p>

Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do<br />
not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also<br />

    <title>WWE Network App Login Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fallingstar333  say:</h3>
<h2>            WWE Network App Login Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Despite providing correct login information, the app has told me "USER or PASSWORD unrecognized." I'm having no issues through the WWE website or the app on my phone, just the 360.</p>

<p>Anyone else experiencing this? Any word on it being a known issue/being fixed?</p>

<h2>            Strange Windows10 update pattern</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 computers (HP TouchSmart, HP Sprout, and Microsoft Surface Pro 3). All 3 are always up to date with the latest updates. When the Windows 10 update button appeared in my task tray (All appeared on the same day) I reserved an update on each computer.
 All with in 5 minutes of each other. The Surface Pro received its update on Wednesday. The other two are still waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess Microsoft is updating their computers first.</p>

    <title>Shut-down error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cshane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shut-down error</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sometimes get the following error when shutting down:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcf754ca-05bf-4a04-ad39-af32cca22b0a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I find out what the first program is? The long string looks like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_unique_identifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Globally Unique IDentifier">
GUID</a>, but only the first part is shown. The icon looks like a webcam, so I'm <em>
extremely</em> worried that someone has hijacked my webcam. Does anyone recognize this icon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Shane.</p>

            <p>Thanks to the MS Answers implementation, we know absolutely nothing about your system (but that is the way they run things here).&nbsp; So let's break out the crystal ball.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What did you find when you performed a Google search on that string of numbers 94f11419-869e?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you now or have you ever had CyberLink YouCam installed?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one link from a Google search that might help:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't look right, browse through some of the other search results and look for those that have a happy ending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find it is CyberLink YouCam, perhaps your installation is afflicted of there is an update to their software that will correct that problem (look in their community).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could uninstall it, see how things look and reinstall it again, right?</p>

            <p>I can't find CyberLink YouCam on my system, but I did find this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>c:\Program Files (x86)\Hewlett-Packard\Media\Webcam\YCMMirage.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program is called "YouCam Mirage", and the icon looks the same as the one on the shutdown error screen. I'm not sure how the GUID relates to the program .exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like this is not a virus, which is good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, this program is <em>always</em> running, even though I never use my webcam. It creates a problem when I try to shut down. I guess I just need to find out why or how it is being started every time I start my computer, and change it to only
 start when I need it.</p>

            <p>Good detective work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to look at your startup items is through the msconfig program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>msconfig is a troubleshooting tool, not a startup manager, but it is often used as such (which is okay I s'pose).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link from a Google search that will show you how it works:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://netsquirrel.com/msconfig/msconfig_win7.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://netsquirrel.com/msconfig/msconfig_win7.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before making any changes it is prudent to <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/697-system-restore-point-create.html?ltr=S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
make a System Restore point</a> in case you need to undo anything and/or take notes about startup items you might be disabling so you can undo things if you need to.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always have an undo strategy so if things get worse, you can undo any changes and don't make too many changes at once - reboot and see how things look and do a little at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another popular free tool is CCleaner which has a lot of things folks like to help cleanup their system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get CCleaner here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>CCleaner has a registry cleaner option which you should stay away from for now because if something goes wrong there you might not be able to undo it easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CCleaner will let you manage most Startup items and also do some other cleanup oriented operations.&nbsp; Some people will recommend you not to use the registry functions in CCleaner so avoid those features for now.&nbsp; I have no issue with it myself, but it is
 sometimes a contentious issue I prefer to avoid whenever possible!<br />
<br />
You can uninstall CCleaner later if you don't like it.<br />
<br />
You can disable startup items, see how things look and if you want - totally delete unneeded startup items, or just leave them disabled while you continue troubleshooting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that disabling things does not uninstall anything and if there is a problem, you
 can just enable the item again.&nbsp; If you are sure you don't want it at all, <br />
then you can delete it.<br />
<br />
After launching CCleaner and seeing what startup items you can disable/delete if you still are not sure about your startup items, do this:<br />
<br />
Launch CCleaner and choose Tools, Startup and in the bottom right, click the "Save to text file" button to save the Startup information to a text file on your desktop with a name you can remember - something like startup.txt<br />
<br />
Save the startup information text file to your desktop (or someplace you can find it) open the text file with a text editor (notepad or WordPad), select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy all the highlighted text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V)
 the contents of the startup list back here in your next reply and perhaps somebody can tell you other things to consider.<br />
<br />
A more revealing startup analyzer is Autoruns which will allow manipulation of all areas of startups and does not actually install anything:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Autoruns can be a little intimidating at first since it displays so much information.&nbsp; You would mostly be interested in the Logon and Everything tab and if you see an item you are not sure about, you can right click it and choose to Search Online to learn
 more about the item.</p>

            <p>You can also read about YouCam Mirage online and see what other people have to say about it (looks like quite a bit) and somewhere in those readings you will probably find out how to disable it, control it, remove it...</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question on Microsoft Community forums. As per the description, you need to know whether Pokerstars is compatible with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you tried to download and install the app after upgrading to Windows 8?
<br />
<br />
2. Which is the version of Pkerstars that you have installed on the computer? Is it Pokerstars or Pokerstars.it?
<br />
<br />
3. What exactly are you referring when you say 'Was able to run software previous to upate'? Was it working before on Windows 8 or Windows 7?
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On my research, I could not find the appropriate information on the compatible center for Windows 8. You may refer the article:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=win8&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;TextSearch=pokerstars&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=win8&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;TextSearch=pokerstars&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have not downloaded the latest version, I would suggest you to visit the administrator website and download the copy. You may also check if the software is compatible with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pokerstars.it/en/poker/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pokerstars.it/en/poker/download/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if games that are found in the <strong>windows 8 compatibility center </strong>
to be not compatible, then you can install those games in the compatibility mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><span>Install Game in <strong>compatibility mode</strong> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The games which are not compatible with windows 8 , then you may install the games in<strong>compatibility mode</strong> and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a)</span><span> </span><span>Press the ‘<b>Windows + W</b>’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b)</span><span> </span><span>Type <b>compatibility</b> in the search box and then press<b>enter</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c)</span><span> </span><span>Click “<b>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</b>” option from the list appeared in the left side.</span></p>
<p><span>d)</span><span> </span><span>Select the game and install.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please reply with the status so that we could help you further.

            i was able to get pokerstars on my win 8 computer... however, i had to use a computer running win 7 (or earlier)&nbsp;and after installing it on 7 i copied the "pokerstars" folder from C:\Program Files and then pasted into C:\Program Files on Win 8. Then i
 went into the "pokerstars" folder and copied the "pokerstars.exe" file and pasted to the desktop. i hope this helps!

    <title>Schedule file compression - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skc-psi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Schedule file compression</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to determine if it is possible to schedule the compression of the files in a specified folder in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is possible, how would I go about creating the steps to make this happen on a regular schedule, like once per day?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can use the Task Scheduler to set up the schedule for the process, but am unsure how to create the program to tell the computer exactly what I want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example of what I would like to is to compress all of the files and folders under the "C:\data" folder into a compressed file called "DataBackup20170825", with the date for the specific backup automatically added at the end. I want that to run every day
 at a specified time, placing the compressed file in a specified folder, say "c:\backups".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Unable to play videos in Windows Media Player.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 7 32-Bit Home Premium Minidump File &amp; Repairing Help</p>
<p>I'll try to make this as simple and easy as possible, I've had good help before so I'll try to articulate my issues specifically.&nbsp;
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><u>Specifications:</u></b></div>
<div><b><u><br />
</u></b></div>
<div>ASUS Eee PC Seashell series 1215N (Netbook)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 32-Bit Home Premium Edition Version 6.1 (Build 7601: Service Pack 1)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>~If more specifications are needed (HDD model, CPU, RAM, exc), just ask and I'll supply the info.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before I get started stating/explaining the complications I'm experiencing, here is the Minidump file I found in the folder:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>SkyDrive:&nbsp;http://sdrv.ms/Qmr74O &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><u>Issues I've Been Experiencing:</u></b></div>
<div><b><u><br />
</u></b></div>
<div>First off, the Minidump file, as you may have noticed, was created several months ago (didn't do anything about it), primarily what the issue I've been having was first I was unable to play videos in Windows Media Player; I would be able to see a thumbnail
 Image and audio, but no video.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Let me stress before I go further, I <u>HAVE</u>&nbsp;searched Windows forums, Windows Answers, various searched throughout Google; after coming up dry after two weeks of trying all the suggested fixes, nothing has been resolved. I tried obtaining video codecs,
 didn't work, I tried going into Control Panel and Disabling/Enabling Windows Features ("answered" thread had suggested procedures doing this for Windows Media Player to reinstall/reconfigure the program). Neither of those worked. I also tried various HDD repairs,
 I did three different Error-Check reboot scans, I performed Defragment analysis and defraging, even performed various scans with my ESET NOD32 Virus Protection. Nothing was resolved. Nothing Worked.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Perhaps what was most frustrating, was when using Windows.Microsoft.com I went to this page&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-media-player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-media-player</a>&nbsp;
 and tried to download the player/codecs and it said first download and run "Windows&nbsp;Genuine Validation Tool" so, I did and a window said "This version of the Windows Genuine Advantage validation tool is no longer supported. Please download the newest version
 and ensure that you system clock is accurate". As far as I can see, my system time and date
<i>is</i>&nbsp;correct so why this was the case I do not know. I also searched the web and Windows to try and find the most "recent" supported version and I was unable to.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried this four times and have resolved nothing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now the problem I'm running into is that any video file I try to delete or remove, I receive a&nbsp;dialogue&nbsp;that says "this file is already in use by another program" which they're not, so I opened Windows Task Manager, checked running applications/processes
 and even services and found nothing that could be using/running that file; at least to my knowledge.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only thing left that I can think of, which I'm feeling <i>may</i>&nbsp;have a high probability of being the reason for all these issues. I had read this from another thread awhile ago however the solution did not resolve my issue so I stopped there. The
 person, as well as myself, had performed a "Disk Cleanup" under the General tab of the Hard Drive (Local Disk (C:)) Properties. I forget what Files/boxes I checked to clean up, but I feel this may have caused all these issues.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As you may see, I've put much much time and research into finding a solution for these issues before jumping in and creating a hastily made submission without including much detail. I have tried to provide as much information and specifics to to help Windows
 Technicians to find a solution easily and quickly as there are innumerable&nbsp;inquiries&nbsp;to answer I'm sure, and their time is valued and appreciated. If there is any information required to find and resolve these matters, please simply request it and I will supply
 it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank-you.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First I'd like to thank-you for your response David, however&nbsp;unfortunately&nbsp;Method 1, FixIt, did not work, it was able to scan and "fixed" (I use quotes for this as I'm just simply&nbsp;quoting&nbsp;what the results displayed) the issues it found which I will
 now list; Scripting registration corrupt, reset windows media player, Windows media player Library, settings for windows media network streaming are corrupted.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I followed its instructions to attempt to playback a video, I chose a .wmv file for maximum compatibility-I will answer your question from earlier, it is
<u>all</u>&nbsp;video formats that are giving me the same issue, .wmv .avi .mp4 and so forth; as well as I can use other players-like you mentioned, which work successfully, i.e. RealPlayer, VLC Media Player, and even opening the video in Google Chrome.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Alas, Method 1 did not lead to a fix.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Method 2 is not a concern, I as am already and have been&nbsp;using&nbsp;the most recent Nvidia WHQL Driver 306.23 so, that is not the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Method 3, I will attempt to do soon as I finish this post; I already know how to enter Safe Mode so that will not be an issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; And lastly, I went to and read Method 4 however that was personally unhelpful as it seemed to appear to only provide general and somewhat intermediate information about the matter; which I stated in original post I had already gone to the extents of
 scoping out the processes <i>and</i>&nbsp;services that may be conflicting with the program.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the meantime, I will attempt Method 3 to see if I will be able to remove the&nbsp;for-mentioned&nbsp;files. Also, from the SkyDrive link I provided, what information did the minidump file provide as to what the problem was (what the minidump file was saying
 what caused its generation)? Until then I patiently await feedback.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank-you.</div>

            <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I just finished Method 3, performing Safe Mode, and sure enough, I still encountered the problem with removing video files. I even opened up task manager and showed Processes from All Users (even though I'm the only user, I still did so), they were
 all just the basic Windows components necessary to run, but still experienced the same problem.&nbsp;</div>

            Still having issues. Even after performing more troubleshooting yesterday. I've run Windows update, and no new updates are available, I've also used device manager to try and see if certain devices needed driver updates; all are current.
<div><br />
<div>In the meantime while I wait for support, where can I find and download/run the
<u>current SUPPORTED</u>&nbsp;Windows Genuine Valadation tool? I've tried finding and using it to download Windows Media Player from the respective page but every single time it says that "this version of WGV is no longer supported" or whatever
 the original text was. I listed it in my first post of the thread.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Like I've previously stated, I've provided an extreme amount of specific details an information including the minidump file and having done already much research and troubleshooting via other threads Microsoft Answers and nothing else worked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've been thinking a long time about just upgrading this current version of Windows 7 to the 64-bit home Premium edition, but I've already spent so much money for the Discs and software codes for my other computers at home (I have 4 other computers at
 home, along with 3 separate hard drives that I've installed Windows 7 onto) that I do not really wish to pay another good $100 to upgrade. I'd prefer to pay around $20 which I've heard from some college campuses that's around what they charge for Students;
 maybe I can obtain a copy via that method. However, this netbook does not have a CD drive so I would have to find another method to install the software onto it, but I have not reached that point yet...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hopefully this issue can be resolved soon, until next time, thank-you.</div>

<div><br />
<div>I did as you said and saved/ran the Windows Activation Update, the results said that it was successful; however when trying to run Windows Genuine Validation Tool, I still received the "not supported" message. The page I received it on was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/exe-validation.aspx?id=16546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/exe-validation.aspx?id=16546</a>&nbsp;
 - the reason for that particular download is for the Windows Media Player 12 &nbsp;Windows 7 N/KN media pack (understood that the packs wouldn't most likely fix the issue, but I'm literally trying everything), and I still received that error regarding the version
 of the tool is &nbsp;not supported and stated to use the most recent/supported version.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do appreciate your assistance, maybe there is more to go forward now that the validation recognizes that I am running a genuine copy of Windows 7.</div>

            Bumping thread, still experiencing all the issues I had listed in originating post for the exception of the validation/genuine checker.
<div><br />
<div>At this point, nothings been resolved, and no one has suggested or informed me of what the minidump file is telling/what caused it to be created-that I had supplied SkyDrive url in original post.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I am able to provide the required information for validating that I have a genuine version of Windows 7 32-bit Home Premium, can I request a download for a new copy of Windows 7 of the same tier that I have? Remembering, this is a netbook, there is
 no CD/DVD drive. Unsure, but willing to try, if&nbsp;re-installing&nbsp;of Windows 7 will bring about the&nbsp;desirable&nbsp;repaired results. I do have the stickers under my netbook that list the VIN/SN number of netbook itself, as well as version and serial of the copy of
 Windows 7 Installed; however, the sticker information has been rubbed away over time, making some of the information unable to be read. I can still take photos of the Windows 7 sticker under the netbook, providing at least what information is still legible.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I've stated previously, I have done to the best of my ability to provide as much accurate, detailed information that I could gather; as well as the steps/suggested methods for repairs before even posting a thread. It has come to the point that it is
 very frustrating that my netbook is not functioning as it should, I understand that there are specific&nbsp;guidelines&nbsp;and&nbsp;protocol&nbsp;procedures that Microsoft employees have to&nbsp;abide&nbsp;by and simply cannot simply distribute copies of Windows OS's to anyone having
 problems. I appreciate all the attention and help I have received so far, and hope that this endeavor will soon come to a resolved end. Thank-you.</div>

            I think the most frustrating thing is when a new thread pops up, you type your answer, add links and submit, only to see the thread is locked. Other than that I agree that certain threads should be locked. This may have been better posted in the Ambassador
 forum and taken up with your CM.

            Some threads are locked because someone replied to a thread or post that is 2 or 3 years old. There may have been several changes in Dashboard, hardware, etc since then so it would have been better if the poster started a new thread instead of adding themselves
 on to an old thread as a "Me too..." posting.

            Too often people spam the same answer over and over in threads that have already been answered. I have no problem with getting repetitive topics off the front page instead of bouncing back up over and over. I agree with the policy and I don't think it
 has anything to do with 'power' but with keeping these boards working optimally.&nbsp;

            I think threads are locked accordingly. Not "every thread" is locked, &nbsp;Some are however and most have various reasons why they've locked them. I'm pretty confident that Microsoft employees and forum mods are not "power" hungry and doing this for no reason
 at all. Being upset about this is rather pointless. Why be mad at what is. If you don't like the forums and how they're run why not stick to responder and the video gallery. The people in charge of the forums are the ones... In charge of the forums. Our job
 as volunteers is to help when we can and trust the decisions made by the forum mods and staff.

<h2>            Startup Issues &#8211; Windows 10</h2>
                    I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 last month. &nbsp;I initially had major issues with being able to start windows once I did the initial upgrade. &nbsp;After Googling the issue I did two things: &nbsp;1) I upgraded the video driver and 2) I eliminated non-essential
 tasks from the “start-up” process. &nbsp;This seemed to do the trick and I was able to use the new OS without any issues thereafter. &nbsp;Then after not using my laptop for a week or two, I went to use it last Saturday. &nbsp;I noticed that in was installing some updates
 and when I went to start up the OS it slowed a little. &nbsp;Bottom line I was able to get in though. &nbsp;Then the next day I attempted to start it up and now I cannot boot up my laptop at all. &nbsp;The same issue that happened last month has resurfaced. &nbsp;Unlike last
 month though where after several tries I would eventually be able to start it up, now it won’t start up at all. &nbsp;All I keep on getting is the “diagnosing the issue”

    <title>Does reinstalling Win 7 wear on an SSD&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Does reinstalling Win 7 wear on an SSD&#63;</h2>
                    I was setting up a new system this weekend, and kept running into problems with the install. I just went back through and reinstalled Win 7, deleting the partition. I'm assuming Windows install just does a quick format? Basically, I'm paranoid and have
 no experience with SSD's. Does wiping it in this way 6-7 times and reinstalling Windows wear the drive?

            The wear and tear of an SSD is over a period of years and its not dependent on how many times you reinstall Windows. Research involves over thousands of trials in terms of input and out along writing data. So, don't worry, reinstalling Windows will not
 affect its performance or reliability.

            <blockquote>I'm assuming Windows install just does a quick format?

</blockquote>
<br />
Yes, it does a quick format when you format the drive during the install process.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Does wiping it in this way 6-7 times and reinstalling Windows wear the drive?
</blockquote>
<br />
No - SSD drives are designed for many years of use and many writes to the drive. Reinstalling Windows 7 a few times will not wear on the drive.<br />

 find the printer. &nbsp;Any help would be awesome<strong>.</strong></p>
