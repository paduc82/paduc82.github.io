<h2>            Second Monitor&#39;s Taskbar Completely See-through</h2>
                    <p>I have my taskbar locked, and auto-hiding. When I turn off transparency effects, the problem occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The taskbar on my second monitor goes completely see-through apart from a small border across the top. If I turn off auto-hiding, it's got a solid background. When I turn auto-hiding, it goes solid again. Once it's disappeared and it pops up later though,
 it's see-through.</p>

<h2>            Win XP backup does not recognize my external hard drive</h2>
                    Windows XP backup wizard does not recognize my external hard drive and does not list it as an option for storing backups.&nbsp; I suspect a registry problem because backup wizard&nbsp;previously recognized this drive and backed up to it many times before&nbsp;I ran ARO
 2012 to clean up registry errors.&nbsp; I can still open the drive in windows explorer and see the files on it, but&nbsp;Windows XP explorer&nbsp;now lists the drive as an "expansion drive" rather than a "removable drive".&nbsp; When&nbsp;I right-click&nbsp;in windows explorer and open
 "properties" for this drive,&nbsp;it shows it as&nbsp;a "local drive" rather than a "removable drive".&nbsp; The drive shows up ok when&nbsp;I click the "safely remove hardware" button, and it reports&nbsp;"safe to remove hardware" after&nbsp;I click on &nbsp;"USB mass storage device - Drive
 (J:)".&nbsp; Help!!!!!

            <p>That did it.&nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp; Now... the reason I used Aero2012 to clean errors in my registry is because my computer is agonizingly slow, especially when starting up (8-10 minutes) and also with internet explorer (moving the cursor to&nbsp;previous typos&nbsp;when composing
 a new email message).&nbsp; Is there a safe way for me to speed up my computer? </p>

            Hi Michael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode shown here:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />1) Run the Blue Screen Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Prepare and submit the BSOD crash report back here for a BSOD expert's analysis following these steps:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: 
<br /><a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br /><a href="https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatools-bootable/using-seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatoo...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />5) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

What is the exact error message that you receive?<br />
<br />
Did you get any error code?<br />
<br />
Have you made any changes to the PC prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
A blue screen error (also called a stop error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly. When you experience this type of error, you won’t be able to see things like the Start menu or the taskbar on the screen when your PC
 is turned on. Instead you might see a blue screen with a message that your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.<br />

<br />
If you have any issue with performing the steps in the article, then I suggest you to create an Installation Media and then perform Automatic Repair.<br />
<br />
You may use Windows 10 installation disc/USB to perform automatic repair by creating a Media Creation Tool. Use the link below to create the media tool.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Please follow the below steps to perform the Automatic Repair:<br />
<br />
Perform the Automatic repair:<br />
<br />
a) When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be F12.<br />
<br />
b) The boot menu key might differ with each manufacturer. If you are unable to find the boot menu key, you may refer the user manual.<br />
<br />
c) Restart the computer, when the manufacturer's logo is displayed, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to CD\DVD ROM.<br />
<br />
d) After you boot your computer using Windows 8 DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.<br />
<br />
e) Select the correct time and Keyboard type.<br />
<br />
f) Click Repair your computer in the lower left corner<br />
<br />
g) Click on Troubleshooting, advanced option and then click Automatic repair. </blockquote>
<p><strong>Hello Peter:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ive been trying to get as many opinions and ideas to try as i'm using a library computer until I can get mine to work again, I purchased a DELL latitude E6410 refurbished back in May of this year but just over a week ago I tried starting it and I
 got a blue screen saying my computer has a system licence violation and to contact Microsoft&nbsp;about it. I also contacted DELL about this too, however since its a refurbished laptop there was little they could offer except the model I purchased was not tested
 for windows 10 but only windows 8 had worked on this model so I contacted the people who sold me the computer and all I got from them was a complete runaround about it so I started coming onto the Microsoft&nbsp;community to try and find some answers to try to
 fix this on my own as i'm on disability and cant afford too much as it is.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I will explain to you what happens when I attempt to start it, the first screen is the DELL screen with the model at the bottom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next screen is the windows but the circle of dots that usually shows it loading up is not there</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next screen is the blue screen with a message saying the computer experiencing a system licence violation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next the diagnose screen comes on but only for a few seconds</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next screen is the automatic repair but also only stays on a few seconds</strong></p>
<p><strong>then another blue screen saying to restart or try advance options</strong></p>
<p><strong>and thats as far as i can get until i figure out why this happened and how i can try to fix it so any suggestions&nbsp;you may have i will certainly be grateful.</strong></p>
<p>

But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install
 in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:

I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Michael, neither of those keys are used for entering Safe Mode with Networking (so you have internet) or Safe Mode in Windows 10.  Please follow one of the methods that works in the first link I gave you.

<br />Then continue with the rest of the steps.  If you need any help performing them I will be here to help.

<p><span><span>Hi Rod,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Have you previously performed system restore?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try the below methods and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Run
<strong>SFC (System File Checker) scan</strong> on the computer to fix the system file errors on the computer.<br />
To run SFC scan, follow the steps: <br />
Open an elevated command prompt. To do this:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start,</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>And then click
<strong>Run as administrator.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>v.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow or Continue</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>vi.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>At the prompt, type
<strong>sfc /scannow </strong>and hit enter. Once the scan is complete, restart the computer for the changes to take effect.
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Search for the Volume shadow copy service</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Please let us know the Status and start up type. Make sure the start- up type is automatic</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span></span><span><span>Search for the service
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right click on the service</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If the service is stopped then Start the service</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select Properties</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>v.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><strong><span>Disable the firewall/ anti-virus</span></strong><span> temporarily installed on your computer and then check
 if the issue still persists. If the issue resolves, then you might need to uninstall the software and reinstall it back or change the settings and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>You can even try with
<strong>any other system restore point</strong> and check , if the error message occur</span></span></p>

    <title>Why does Windows 7 Backup and Restore disconnect, not recognize, and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenoracle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 7 Backup and Restore disconnect, not recognize,  and basically destroy my new external USB3  HDD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Here's the problem.&nbsp; I used Windows Backup and Restore on my laptop to back up C: to a new external USB3 HDD.&nbsp; After backup complete, the external HDD could not be accessed and was listed as disconnected.&nbsp; I consider this a Disaster. No backup No Drive No
 Nothing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my Question. How do I get access to&nbsp;my new HDD&nbsp;drive?&nbsp;Has the new HDD been&nbsp;destroyed by Windows Backup and Restore? &nbsp;I would be happy to reformat it and never use Windows Backup and Restore again. Not sure how to do that either.&nbsp; Help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the story.&nbsp; Purchased new Toshiba 2TB USB3 external HDD and&nbsp;connected it to my Lenovo WIN 7-64 laptop. External HDD was recognized as drive E: under My Computer. No problem.&nbsp; Then I used Windows Backup and Restore from the Control Panel&nbsp;and after
 about 2hrs the Back and Restore progress bar&nbsp;and other&nbsp; indicators showed backup&nbsp;100% complete. The next day I&nbsp;booted up the laptop and&nbsp;My Computer did not recognize the drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I ran&nbsp;Backup and Restore from the&nbsp;Control Panel which then listed TOSHIBA E:
 drive as disconnected, with a big red X.&nbsp; The&nbsp;HDD drive in fact was physically connected via USB and powered up.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>i had the exact same scenario with a client - malware from a word document. the first report from the client was "i can't open outlook". used malware bytes to scan and remove and started getting the system properties box popping up shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i found the source - it's a scheduled task. it had a random name and was set to run on a regular basis. it was pointing to a bogus executable located in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\(random number)\SystemProperties.exe. I actually had two of these on the machine,
 each in a different random number directory and the executable name was different each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>strangely enough, I submitted the executable to virustotal.com and got zero hits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i deleted the scheduled tasks and removed the bogus directory and executable. no more popups!</p>
<p>

</p><p>Wizdude, you're a champion! You nailed it, this was exactly what was happening on my machine.

<p>
</p><p>Task name was "Endysheyrwity" so it was pretty easy to spot. I removed the task, directory and exe, everything seems status quo now. Just for grins, I ran my files through virustotal and, just like yours, received no hits.</p>

                    I created a couple of local user accounts on my computer that I later deleted.&nbsp; Even though the user accounts are no longer on my computer, their libraries still show up in Windows Media Player "Other Libraries" on my system and for other people on my
 network.&nbsp;How do I get my computer to quit sharing libraries that don't exist?<br />
<br />
Actually, I don't want any of my libraries from ANY of my user accounts to show up on other network user's computers.&nbsp; How can I stop sharing all libraries?<br />

            Open up services.msc and find the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service. If you stop and then disable the service the media libraries should no longer show up on other computers.
<div><br />
<div>But if you had a deleted user that was still showing up you might need to dig into the registry to fix it. I had the same problem with a deleted user and only just came across how to remove it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>First you need to find the SID of the deleted user before removing any items in the registry.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Look through HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList. You will find sub keys which represent SID's of users on the system. When click on each sub key you will see on the right side ProfileImagePath which can help determine who the
 user is.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once you have the SID go to HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\PREFERENCES\HME (HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\PREFERENCES\HME if you are using 32bit Win 8). In here will be sub keys using the same SID you found under the ProfileList
 key. Remove the key folder that relates to the SID you want to remove. To remove the SID folder you might need to take ownership of the SID key folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then go to HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Media Player NSS\3.0\Media Servers. In here will be another SID related folder that you remove. Once both keys have been removed restart the Windows Media Player Network Sharing service.</div>

    <title>8.1 update disables space bar hand tool in photoshop cc - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            8.1 update disables space bar hand tool in photoshop cc</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently updated to Windows 8.1, after this the spacebar hand tool no longer works in photoshop cc (and all other versions by all accounts) anyone who uses photoshop to anywhere near advanced levels will know that this function is essential.&nbsp;</div>
<div>A little research has shown that the problem more than likely is the touchpad driver update disabling certain gestures when the space bar (and indeed other keys) is pressed.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Can I step back to windows 8.0? Or step back the synaptics touchpad driver? Is there an update on the way to fix this?&nbsp;</div>
<div>It literally renders the device useless to hundreds of thousands of photoshop users when editing on the fly.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is not the old problem of programmes running in the background such as Firefox or chrome. This is a new windows 8.1 problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Chris.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Windows 10 update wont boot ,screen just flickers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ill gates  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update wont boot ,screen just flickers</h2>
                    <p>I've done hours of research to no avail on this. I updated from Win 7 to Win10 last wee. Win 10 ran as normal for 1 date.The next day it wouldnt start and I got the "Error Code : 0xc000000e". I tried the fixes that the prompts lead to but nothing.I then
 downloaded a Win 10 install disk via an ISO and booted with that . I followed the included fixes there but nothing. Then I tried the Command Prompt edit suggestion which is supposed to repair the Master Boot Record. After booting and shutting down over and
 over, Windows now boots into a flickering black screen with just the edges of a normal desktop showing. I cant get past this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed solutions for flickering and and opened Task Manager and navigated to turn off the services that are commonly suggested but nothing. I can post a vid if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any experience that could help. I'm desperate </p>

            <p>First, thanks for the follow up</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 The PC is custom made with an Asus MB i7 3770 6core @3.4 ghz wth 16 gb of ram</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 I am not able to access the desktop. Sometimes&nbsp; I boot to error screen , other times it makes it to the flicker screen. It flickers before the desktop background loads.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 No security programs were installed. After upgrading and getting running I installed Trash 2 an audio FX program from Isotope.This computer is used in a project recording studio</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 as mentioned above</p>
<p>&nbsp;a Tried the "repair Computer" thats suggested by the error screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;b I made a Win10 ISO disk and booted from that and tried the repairs there</p>
<p>&nbsp;c I followed the suggestion to open Task Manager go to Command line ,run nsconfig and repaid the Master Boot Record</p>
<p>&nbsp;d I tried the fix thats widely circulated for flickering screen in which I went into Task Manager, navigated to Services and turned off the 2 services that are commonly suggested. Also there is talk of Norton or 2 other programs causing this; I dont have
 those</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also task manager flickers as well and I do have an Nvidia 650 graphics card. </p>
<p><br />

<p>
</p><p>at this point I would just like to get running in a follproof way that doesnt involve formatting and reinstalling ; I cant afford to lose info and a reinstall of dozens of programs would take weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disk image of my C drive from 2 months ago that I made with Macrium back up software. What is the best way to go back to this? I cant do much because of the flickering. Anyone please let me know</p>

 you're saying "Clean Install" in the context of some approach new to Win 10, please let me know.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You've already seen &nbsp; problems which can be caused by an Upgrade install, the reason most tech enthusiasts would never run that or a factory install.&nbsp; Unless you want an inferior install that causes endless issues, then that is your best path.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to try to repair what you have then you can try <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">

<p>
</p><p>But it will likely take less time to create your bootable media (which you'll need for the repairs anyway), boot it, rescue files if needed, clear all partitions and do the best install you can get, better than you can pay money for.&nbsp; Everything is in the
 link needed to get and keep the best install possible.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you've mistaken my question to mean I'm questioning your level of knowledge or something. This is not the case at all. I just wanted to know if the clean install approach would be an "official MS recommendation. Thats all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record , I'm a music professional running a project recording studio. Before this upgrade a did a lot of research and encountered a lot of folks who used the free update with few issues (reinstall soundcard drives and such). Thats why I did it.&nbsp;
 My Win 7 install was OEM on a custom computer that is now 4 years old. I only upgraded to Win 10 because I have 3 software programs that basically only work with 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, to successfully record and produce contemporary music takes a lot of software; in my case approx 100 different programs. There is no way on earth I'm going to wipe all of that and reinstall each one ,going to each manufacturer with each key and
 getting a new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be a better way since</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 I have a Win 7 disk Image I could go back to</p>
<p>

    <title>What to do if reliability monitor in action center does not show any - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> balaji kundalam  say:</h3>
<h2>            What to do if reliability monitor in action center does not show any activity&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate x64.</p>
<p>Recently, when I was going through the performance tools, I found the reliability monitor (Action Center-&gt;View Reliability History). Surprisingly, I found no activity shown there - neither information nor error, not even the graph.</p>
<p>How to make it work?</p>

            <p>Hello Balaji M Kundalam, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for asking the Question!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry to know that you face issues with Reliablility Monitor. As I get it right the reliablity monitor does not show any
 activity. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I need to ask you a few questions in order to assist you in a better way.
</span></p>
<p>1. Does the issue persist only with reliability monitor?</p>
<p>2. <span>
Were there any changes (hardware or software) made to the computer prior to the issue?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>Reset the reliability monitor and check if that resolves your issue.
<p><span><span><span>a: </span></span></span><span>Click on start, click on computer and then click on organize</span></p>
<p><span>b:&nbsp;</span><span>Click on Folder and search options.</span></p>
<p>c:&nbsp; <span>Check the <strong>Show hidden files and folders </strong>
option and click on Ok.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d:&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open Windows Explorer and navigate to<strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\RAC</strong>.</span></p>

<p><span>A) Copy both the <strong>PublishedData</strong> and <strong>StateData</strong> folders and Paste them to another location as a backup.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f: </span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>To Reset Reliability Monitor -</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span>D) Select all the files in the folder and click on <strong>Delete</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>After you click on <strong>Delete</strong>, you will need to click on<strong>Yes</strong> (confirm),
<strong>Continue</strong> (approve), and <strong>Continue </strong>(UAC) to delete these files</em>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span> </span></span></span><strong><span>To Restore the Current Reliablity Monitor Data –</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A) Copy the contents of both the <strong>PublishedData</strong> and <strong>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other
 security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the
 time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

<p>Three options.</p>
<p>1: Grab the corners of the window and drag it to full screen size. Do not use Maximize. Close all other windows first via the Taskbar and this one last.&nbsp; Windows will remember the size used of the &nbsp;<strong><em>last</em></strong> window closed the next time
 you open the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will have to do this for each problem window one at a time.</p>
<p>2: Whichever shortcut you are using to launch the window, right click it and select properties. Under the 'Run' drop-down, choose "Maximized".</p>
<p>3: <strong>IE New Window Maximizer </strong>(For IE only).<br />

<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, my name is G.Paz, I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />I am so sorry to hear about this issue. 
<br />From Command Prompt execute: sfc/scannow  to verify damage files on the update process. 
<br />Then, execute:
<br />dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth
<br />dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />Restart your PC and pause antivirus. 
<br />After that, try to install Chrome again.
<br />Let me know about results, I hope this work.

    <title>Laptop shutting down when playing games &#40;skyrim, League of - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Laptop shutting down when playing games &#40;skyrim, League of Legends, that sort of game&#41;</h2>
                    When running games like skyrim or leage of legends my laptop shuts down randomly without giving BSoD, just goes off. sometimes it would let out a weird screech through the headphones (Not the insides of the computer) but that doesn't happen all the time.
 It doesn't happen with all games tho, I can run games like Civilization 5 all day long and it won't shut down.<br />
<br />
Temperatures around shut down time vary, it might be around 65c to 80c but I have been at much higher temps without it "always" shutting down.<br />
<br />
Memory dump file when opened says the following:<br />

            Hello zoero,  I would suggest monitoring the CPU Temp. If the CPU overheats the unit will **** down to save the processor from burning itself up. If this is the case you will need to get a cooling pad for your computer. You can buy these online at amazon ebay or walmart for that matter.  Thank you, Tyler M

            i have a cooling pad and right&nbsp; now the CPU temp is at 81c running civilization 5 which isn't that "big", i have to check what temp it reaches with heavier games and applications. Normally i would look at the GPU temp i dont know why, right now that one
 is at 63c...... thanks for the fast reply tho.<br />

            What make and model of laptop do you have? I know some Acers shut down at high temps, and some HPs shut down before the high temp is reached. Every make and model are different.
<br />
<br />

            I'm using a Sony Vaio F Series (VPCF136FM)<br />
<br />
the thing that worries me is that it didn't use to shut down when i bought it. I could easily run 2-3 heavy applications or games without a problem (not that i would do that normally, just once to test how far could it go) and right now it can and will blow
 at any chance it gets.<br />

            <p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting my post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. When (approx. date) did you do the clean install of Win7 32-bit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How long has McAfee Security Suite been installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has any other McAfee&nbsp;application <em>or a Norton application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you did the clean install of Win7 32-bit</em>?</p>
<ul>
<li>McAfee (and Norton) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not upgrading (or uninstalling) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>4. Why is MBAM &amp; S*PERAnti-Spyware installed? Has MBAM and/or SAS&nbsp;ever detected &amp; removed anything (other than harmless third-party cookies)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Is KB3021674, KB3022777, KB3019215, KB3008923, and/or&nbsp;KB3013126 listed in <strong>
Installed Updates </strong>(<em>not</em> <strong><em>Update History</em></strong>)? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. <em>Assuming Java is installed =&gt;&nbsp;</em>Is <strong>Java Version 8 Update 25</strong> (or higher) or&nbsp;<strong>Java Version 7 Update&nbsp;71</strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER&nbsp;<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt;
<a href="http://java.com/en/download/uninstallapplet.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://java.com/en/download/uninstallapplet.jsp</span></a>&nbsp;[2]</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Is Adobe Flash Player <strong>v16.0.0.257</strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>8a. <em>Assuming IE11 is installed =&gt;</em> When (exact date) was <strong>Internet Explorer&nbsp;11</strong> installed according to
<strong>Installed Updates</strong>?</p>
<p><br />
8b. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE11's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: XX.0.54 (KB1231231)</strong> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8c. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?<br />
<br />
9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; Glary Utilities; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC;
 PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner's&nbsp;<em>Registry Cleaner

            <p>1. Yes that is correct the updates are installed.</p>
<p>2. No I don't have backups of the McAfee Quick Clean made to the registry, I thought the program was supposed to save them but it didn't.</p>
<p>I checked for a restore point but all restore points before the 19 of January are gone. They were not saved by Windows. I should know better than to remove something without backing up the registry. I screwed up.</p>

            <p>Roll up your sleeves, cross your fingers &amp; try the following multi-step fix...</p>
<p>
</p><p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions (or copy/paste into Notepad) for offline reference. IMPORTANT =&gt;<em>DON'T SKIP ANY STEPS</em> &amp; perform all Steps in one, uninterrupted session!&nbsp; If a Step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em> ] </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Uninstall <strong>AT&amp;T Internet Security Suite powered by McAfee</strong>&nbsp;[AKA McAfee Security Suite] via
<strong>Start | Control Panel | Programs |</strong><strong> Programs and Features</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt; Make sure&nbsp;the Windows Firewall is enabled&nbsp;<em>immediately</em> after rebooting!&nbsp; [Should happen automatically but I want you to double-check.]</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING <em>else</em> online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed&nbsp;Step #7&nbsp;below!
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to&nbsp;run the McAfee&nbsp;utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. <strong>OPTION A:</strong> Do a clean install of&nbsp;<strong>AT&amp;T Internet Security Suite powered by McAfee</strong>&nbsp;via your ISP's&nbsp;page (i.e.,
<a href="https://uversecentral1.att.com/uvp/myhome/mam/ISS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">https://uversecentral1.att.com/uvp/myhome/mam/ISS/</span></a>&nbsp;)&nbsp;&amp; reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OPTION B (Recommended but still optional):</strong> Download/install Microsoft Security Essentials (also free but&nbsp;less problematic&nbsp;&amp; infinitely more&nbsp;reliable!) instead =&gt;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials/product-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>7. If you reinstalled the AT&amp;T/McAfee freebie in #6 above, manually and repeatedly&nbsp;update the McAfee application&nbsp;until you get a "no more updates" prompt - otherwise, you may skip this one step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Re-assert Internet Explorer as the default <strong>Browser</strong> in the CUSTOM (<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-default-programs-using-Set-Program-Access-and-Computer-Defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">Set Program Access and Computer Defaults</span></span></a>. [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>9a. Right-click on the following link and SAVE the download to your desktop: <a href="http://www.slipstick.com/doit/chromehtml.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>9b. Double-click on the file you saved in #9a above &amp; accept the prompt to MERGE the data with the Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10.&nbsp;Reset Internet Explorer&nbsp;per the instructions on this page:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note=&gt; For optimal results, check the <strong>Delete personal settings</strong> option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11a. Open Internet Explorer (<em>only!</em>) to&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/windows-update-error-8000ffff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/windows-update-error-8000ffff</span></a>
 [ignore the title &amp; references to Vista].</p>
<p>
</p><p>11b. Ignoring any "Not recommended" or similar warnings, run the Fix It (#50202) in DEFAULT
<em>and then AGGRESSIVE modes</em>. [3]</p>
<p>
</p><p>12. <em>Reboot one last time</em> then run a manual check for updates and see if KB3023266 will successfully install now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ImgBurn - In addtion to supporting the creation of CD's from .ISO files,<br />
it supports a wide range of other image file formats, and it's free.<br />
(BIN, CUE, DI, DVD, GI, IMG, MDS, NRG, PDI and ISO)<br />

<p><br />
Note: Always use the slowest burn speed (4x or 2x) if offered a choice.</p>

            That is very common in web design, since your web browser will cache the last version of a local web page
<br />
<br />Just use Ctrl + R on the browser every time you change some of your code
<br />
<br />I run a virtual server on my system for web design and still sometimes have to refresh on different browsers when checking my code . . .

            Hi Jithendra,  ordinarily if you are coding in Notepad, keep Notepad and the browser open
<br />
<br />When you make changes to the HTML in Notepad, press Ctrl + S to save your changes in Notepad. 
<br />
<br />Then jump over to the Browser and press Ctrl + R to see the changes take effect 
<br />
<br />Does this not work for you?       
        </p>
