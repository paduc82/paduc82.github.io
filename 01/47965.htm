    <title>How do I stop Win10 pop-unders&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I stop Win10 pop-unders&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Confirmation boxes (often) appear UNDER the windows I'm using (browser, office program, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario: I'm installing something that requires a confirmation window before it will install. I choose my options, if there are any, and click Install. The percentage installed stays at zero. Eventually, I figure out that there's a confirmation window (User
 Account Control: "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your PC?"), and either select that on the Windows Taskbar (which auto-hides), or minimize all the windows needed to uncover the confirmation window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frequency: Oddly, it happens sometimes. It seems frequent, but I've seen pop-overs, too. Typically, User Account Control makes all other windows minimize, but I have seen UAC pop under, or perhaps just as it's taking control I'm in the midst of something
 that makes it pop under, somehow without my noticing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expected results: confirmation windows should pop up, over current window.</p>

            <p>In Windows 7, prior to the upgrade to Win10, yes, confirmation windows appeared over the current window. In Windows 10, often they are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no obvious change I've made, and it's happened with more than just installs. The User Account Control was just one example where pop-unders have occurred in Windows 10. It's just a frequent annoyance of Win10, to my knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next time it happens, I'll try it again in safe mode.</p>

            <p>darshan j and thofikh amahad are being intentionally unhelpful, trying to force you to do a lot of unnecessary work that they know won't address your issue. nothing they suggest will help you (and to pretend it would is, in fact, insulting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>the issue is that at least since windows 7, and possibly as early as vista, windows has put program-generated popup windows under, rather than over, the active window. this is not the result of any errors in your system, lack of updates, etc. it is by design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows does the same thing with the print dialogue, imposing an additional and frankly needless step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the frustrating reality is that not only does windows hide the window you actually need as a pop-under, windows 10 nevertheless allows 3d party programs to steal focus in a pop-up (pop-over), which often results in accidental clicks or text input into an
 unwanted window (e.g., approving installation or activation of an unwanted program).&nbsp; see here for a discussion of this serious problem and security flaw:&nbsp;

            The UAC dialog does a pop-under quite often when launching applications from within File Explorer. Since it does not show in the taskbar either, you have to minimize windows to find it. It has not been fixed.

            <p>It happens in Windows 10 and maybe prior versions, on every machine I use. I see it very often, because I typically organize all my application shortcuts in folders on the desktop. I also lower the UAC by one level, because I do not like the screen dimmed.<br />
<br />
One way to easily reproduce this:<br />
Make sure your UAC is on, but bump it down to "do not dim my desktop."<br />
Make a new folder on your desktop and place a shortcut to launch an app like notepad.</p>
<p>Close the folder and re-open it. The pop-under only happens the first time.</p>
<p>Right click on the shortcut and click Run as Administrator.<br />
</p>
<p>Result:</p>
<p>The UAC dialog "pops under" the File Explorer window making it look like nothing happened.<br />

Hey Microsoft, have you tried the steps I provided? If not, stop responding to this with safe mode and re-installing windows. You are not helping at all.

<h2>            My computer consistently crashes when playing newer Steam games</h2>
                    Hello. I am trying to play Steam games on my computer, but I find that after playing certain games (newer, more graphically-intensive games) crash anywhere between 5 minutes to an hour or two. They all give me different crash messages every time (driver_overran_stack_based_buffer,
 IRQL not greater or equal to, etc.). I ran tests through console commands and Windows Memory Diagnostics, but nothing bad came back. I checked my drivers and updated as many as I could, and downloaded the latest updates from Windows. Just short of wiping the
 whole thing clean (which may not resolve the issue still), I tried everything. And it ONLY crashes when I try to play newer Steam games.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This has been going on for a month now and is incredibly frustrating. If you have any questions free to ask.

            1. It mostly only happens with games, or if I play the game, it freezes, and I have to force-exit. That's when the computer crashes. A few rare times the computer crashes immediately after booting up from a previous crash citing a memory error as the cause.<br />
<br />
2. Its only Steam games.<br />
<br />
3. No, I'm not entirely sure what overclocking even is.<br />
<br />
4. No, I bought the computer 4 months ago, and made no physical hardware changes to it.<br />
<br />
5. It is a premanufactured computer. It is a Toshiba Satellite S55t.<br />
<br />
I have posted multiple times on Steam forums, and no one ever responded back to me at all. I have no clue why.

            Yes, I have asked the Steam forums and the forums of the problematic games multiple times to no avail (or even any answers for that matter). The games that crash the most are Cities: Skylines and 7 Days to Die.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Correct. Reinstalling Windows is not likely to solve the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- What are the cpu and gpu temps at the time of the crash (or the highest when there is no crash) ?</p>

</p><p>- What is the minimum frame rate with these games ? (Note that Fraps can cause some games to crash, but</p>
<p>it's not common.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fraps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FRAPS game capture video recorder fps viewer</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Are you multi-tasking.&nbsp; or do you limit the number of processes while running games ?</p>
<p>- If any of your software (Anti-virus excluded) is setup to automatically check for updates disable that</p>
<p>option. Auto updates can crash games. Windows updates should be set to <em>'Notify to schedule restart'</em></p>
<p>( Settings &gt; Windows update &gt; Advanced options), so it does not begin an automatic update while gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Have you tried running Steams '<em>verify integrity of game cache</em>' tool ? This is meant more for</p>
<p>games that aren't launching, but if you are not already aware of this tool it is worth knowing about,</p>
<p>and <em>may</em> still help if corrupt files are causing the crashes.</p>
<p>(R/click on the games title in your Steam Library and select Properties &gt; Local Files)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Have you sourced your graphics drivers from Toshiba ? With laptops it is important to use the
</p>
<p>graphics drivers that are provided by the machines mfg.</p>
<p>- To prevent Win10 from reinstalling it's choice of graphics driver you need to run the driver blocking tool.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- It's difficult to accurately extrapolate from other games benchmarks, particularly as the developers rarely</p>
<p>show a laptop graphics card for the games system requirements.</p>
<p>Some games that require high end graphics when using very high/ultra settings also have relatively low
</p>
<p>requirements when running with low res and settings, which makes comparing with other games a bit trickier as well.</p>
<p>The review below does not have benchmarks for the games you mention, but I expect they should run
</p>
<p>over 30 fps @1024x768. 1366x768 <em>may</em> result in fps below 30 with 7 Days to Die though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find some of your other games in the reviews benchmarks.</p>

<br />
-I actually don't know, but I did suspect that heat was an issue, and I did talk to customer support from Costco, where I got the laptop from to begin with, and they recommended that I get a computer fan. I was telling them how the device always ran very hot;
 hot enough to burn my hand, and I have to move stuff away from the air exhaust to avoid damaging items. I got a new fan running under my laptop, so it doesn't run hot anymore, but the game still crashes.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">-With 7 days to Die, it seems to be around 40-60 fps, even on ultra settings, except for low motion-blur. As for Cities Skylines, I don't know, because I can't even get that game to go past the main
 menu screen. Every time I try to resume my old game it crashes entirely on the loading screen.<br />
<br />
-The only thing I may have open besides Steam is Google Chrome, though sometimes its just Steam.<br />
<br />
-Verifying the cache was the first thing I did, for both games, to no avail.<br />
<br />
-Looking at device manager under "Display Adapters" (I hope that's the correct location), I have Intel Graphics 530, and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 950M drivers. If the graphics driver is in a different location, tell me where and I will look.<br />
<br />
I am now thinking that it is a major hardware issue, and if I can't get a fix for this soon I may just use our warranty to send it back to Toshiba through Costco to get it fixed.</span></p>

            <p>We started having the same type problem on our older desktop. Could no longer play games without crashes and even some rapid scrolling on websites would make the monitor lose connection, go&nbsp;from&nbsp;digital to analog mode as the system crashed. Another monitor
 went into sleep mode during the crash. Sometimes the system rebooted, sometimes not.&nbsp;After testing temps, other monitors and mouses, support of Video Cards, drivers on everything, decided to upgrade to a brand new laptop and not waste any more time and money
 trying to repair the older technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new laptop worked great until we installed Steam and tried to play games this weekend.&nbsp; Now, it is doing the exact same thing.&nbsp; So frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted you to know before sending your new system back.&nbsp; It may not fix he problem.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that was provided, the issue is with the actual name of the file that you're trying to copy from an external drive to your laptop. Regarding this concern, we'd like to confirm if you've already tried
<strong>renaming the file</strong> into a shorter name. If you haven't done it yet, please try to do so and check the result.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input. It worked when I shortened the file name. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But this is an interesting thing: if the Win 10 operating system supports more than 260 character in path, it means no matter how long the file name is, I should be able to copy the file over to my laptop. Right now, I have to rename the file to get it work.
 Just try to find out the logical reason for this symptom. </p>

<br />You don't need it, you already have protection with windows defender, If it's your pleasure to cancel it, do it, Even if in the future you want to acquire another protection, you can do it in the future

            Its a scam, Microsoft does not call anybody to activate Windows 10:
<br />
<br />2018 has turned out to be a year when fake scare sites have appeared all over the Internet with fake ads pretending to Microsoft support and insisting you call them. You need to watch out for these sites. They look like a genuine Microsoft website but they are not. 
<br />
<br />Warning: There are "Tech Support Scams" pretending to be Windows 10 Support and Activation Technologies. Please be vigilant. Microsoft never calls or emails users to inform them their license is expiring, accounts will be closed or they need access to sensitive information such as passwords or banking information. Neither should you get an email. Learn more in the following article:

            Hello,
<br />Microsoft never calls anybody to sell products.
<br />And very important, W10 Security center is powerful and contains all Tools to manage security on your pc.
<br />All third-party softwares are at least useless and more often cause troubles on your system.
<br />W10 works very well alone.

    <title>Internal SATA hard drives show up as removable devices in &#39;Safely - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nooboy_58  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internal SATA hard drives show up as removable devices in &#39;Safely Remove Hardware&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Issue;</em> I've got two of my internal SATA hard drives (4 internal hard drive in total) showing as removeable drives in the 'safely remove hardware and eject media' tray icon list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to accidentally eject one of them so I would like them not to appear in the 'eject media' list.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>What I've tried so far</em>; I've checked the BIOS and all 'Hot Plug' for these devices is disabled. I've checked the Policies in Device Manager that Cache Writing is enabled ('Better Performance' or 'Quick Removal' are two other options and they are
 set to Better Performance for each device)&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a solution on the MS forum which partly works for me. That is a registry edit run from command prompt as follows;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>reg.exe add “HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\storahci\Parameters\Device” /f /v TreatAsInternalPort /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d x (where 'x' is the Bus number of the device)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two drives Bus 0 and Bus 1 showing as removeable. The problem is, I enter one Bus and it no longer appears as removeable. So far, so good. But when I try the same for the second bus, it just replaces the first entry in the Registry, so I can only
 fix one or the other, not both. I can't add the second drive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'd be grateful if anyone could advise how/if I can work around this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi auggy, many thanks for your reply. I have, since posting my request for assistance, solved the issue by eventually finding out how to add both drives into a String Value via the following command;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><em>reg.exe add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\storahci\Parameters\Device" /f /v TreatAsInternalPort /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d "0\01"</em></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I copied and pasted this exactly into an elevated Command Prompt.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This enabled me to add Busses 0 and 1 into the 'Treat As Internal Port' entry in the registry</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope this info will help anyone else with the same issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I must point out that I backed up my registry before I made any changes as this was entirely experimental and working from info I found on other websites.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks again</span></p>

</p><p>The consensus seems to be that it's safe to delete, although you might need to reboot in Safe Mode to do so. Before that however see the second link above for a suggestion related to disabling the XBox app. Perhaps that'll help you too.</p>

<p>Hello Petr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are multiple possible reasons why it does not activate after re-installation, and one of them is that the activation server is unavailable.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Your PC ran into a problem &#40;by Windows Defender&#41;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So this Windows 10 blue screen of death comes up everytime I let Windows Defender do a "full scan" (quick scan doesn't make it crash)!</p>
<p>1/4 way through of the scan blue screen pops up saying "Your PC ran into a problem" (every single time I do a full scan, this issue started recently btw). Then it goes into a boot mode telling me to select the correct boot drive: I have to use the power
 button to turn off the computer and then start it back to correctly boot back to Windows. Any idea why this is happening and is there a way to fix it? Any info will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, why are you running a full scan, do you suspect that&nbsp;an infection is present on your devise? Are you having other problems? If so let me know.</p>

            <p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually Widows Defender does automatic scans in the background and notifies you of the result(s). The reason you are getting the "Windows Defender needs to scan your system" notification is because something else&nbsp;on the computer is interfering with Windows
 Defender completing the process and updating it's log. So no, this&nbsp;would not be the&nbsp;normal behavior for Windows Defender other than it is notifying you&nbsp;that it has not been able to complete the scan process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your report indicates that you are&nbsp;using Ccleaner.&nbsp;Ccleaner is know to be the cause of&nbsp;the exact&nbsp;issue&nbsp;you are experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I refer you to this thread&nbsp;containing the pertinent&nbsp;information:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_start/message-that-windows-defender-needs-to-scan-when/d847f3af-6ba2-46d4-ad23-78fc4b71a5ad">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_start/message-that-windows-defender-needs-to-scan-when/d847f3af-6ba2-46d4-ad23-78fc4b71a5ad</a></p>

<h2>            How to change a tiff file to pdf after scanning with windows fax and scan</h2>
                    <p>I scan my document pages, I have adjusted the File Type on my scanner as TIFF, JPG and PDF. I then open WIndows Fax and Scan and find my scanned document saved as a TIFF. Then I attempt to save as JPEG, PDF and am unable...Word pad will open to display my
 document and it is a lot of goobly goop. How do I transfer that into English? And when I try to use an on-line pdf convertor, my document opens only 1 page, not the 4 pages in my tiff file. I spend nearly 6 hrs fighting with this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please tell me how to scan my document and save it to a PDF file.</p>
<p>Thanks tons</p>

            Hi Marie, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. 
<br /> 
<br />WordPad can't open a graphics (binary) file so you will need a program that can both open and convert it as you wish. Many programs that can open a graphics file can't convert it to something else.
<br />
<br />I prefer to use this excellent free program for graphics file conversion.
<br />
<br />IrfanView - Free - Be sure to download the 32 or 64-bit version as your system requires. Also, cownload the plugins.

    <title>usb mouse and keyboard drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> borikborik  say:</h3>
<h2>            usb mouse and keyboard drivers</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>I turned on my pc and when i got to the lock screen i realized that the computer does not recognize my mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>after digging a little i found out that they work perfectly in the BIOS and in the window recovery environment.</p>
<p>the problem starts ass soon as the windows itself boots up. the moment it see the initial lock screen they stop working.</p>
<p>i managed to get my hands on an USB to PS/2 adapter and connected a wired USB mouse with it and it worked. then i went straight to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>device manager to see maybe the problem is in the drivers. and as i though the windows says that the drivers for the mouse and keyboard could not be found on installed. i tried update them and reinstall them and do probably anything possible to try to get
 the windows to set up the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tried to connect my wireless mouse and wired as well both USB</p>
<p>only the wired mouse with the PS/2 adapter worked but im stuck here.</p>
<p>tried to connect my wireless usd headset but its dedicated software can not recognize it.</p>
<p>also i downloaded a third party driver updater which said that all my drivers are recognized and up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>does anybody know what can be the cause of the problem or how to solve it?</p>
<p>i suspect maybe a windows update caused it but im unable to figure it out.</p>
<p>thank you.</p>

            If you can find a way to do it, try uninstalling Windows Update<span><span>:</span></span><span>
</span>
<p><span>2018-02 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4074588)</span></p>
<p><span>It has corrected the problem for us.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We were&nbsp;seeing the same problem here on our Dell OptiPlex 9010 labs.</p>
<p>It was more than a little unsettling to see Mouse and Keyboard listed as "Other" in Device Manager.</p>
<p>And, Update Driver, was coming back with No Drivers Found and both set to NULL</p>

<p>Same problem here on a ASUS updated from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 a while ago. Since about a week both keyboard and mouse are only recognized in the BIOS. Tried starting up Windows in safe mode by forcing shut down 3 times (no other way to get into that
 safe mode really...), and still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funnily enough, both mouse and keyboard work when the initial troubleshoot menu pops up. But subsequently starting up in safe mode doesn't do the trick. So I can't roll back an update, I can't check the drivers (let alone update them), I can do literally
 nothing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way of solving this without scrapping the entire system and starting anew?</p>

<p>Thx! That allowed me to get the keyboard working again, and after another failed attempt also get the update going.

I just wish Microsoft would stop treating their customers as beta testers. Or pay me for solving the problems on the computer of every family member and friend.

<h2>            How many drives &#63;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">How many drives can Win XP address, when they are all plugged&nbsp;into one computer ?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">I *think* it's six... or is it eight ?</span><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">I believe that each Partition counts as one drive. Yes / No<br />
And does that include CD/DVD drives? Yes / No<br />
And "floppy" drives? Yes / No<br />
And NAS drives ? Yes / No</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has a built-in card reader with four different-sized slots - do these count ? &nbsp;Or only those with a card in ?</p>
<p>I have lots of add-on USB drives; how many can I use at the same time ?</p>

            <p>AFAIK, there is no limit ... but there are certain practicalities that you need to consider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, you need to distinguish "partitions" or "volumes" from physical devices.&nbsp; Most people refer to partitions as "drives," but a physical hard drive can have many separate partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows, partitions, are typically identified by letters followed by a colon.&nbsp; A: and B: are reserved for a floppy drive (which almost no modern computer has anymore).&nbsp; The remaining letters, C: through Z: may be used for partitions on hard drives (or
 other devices).&nbsp; Typically, C: is the system partition, i.e., the place where Windows is located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An optical drive (CD or DVD) counts as a partition and takes up a drive letter.&nbsp; So does each slot on a multi-card reader, whether or not there is a card in the slot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each USB flash drive counts as a partition -- or more than one, if you have created multiple partitions on the device.&nbsp; You can "partition" a USB flash drive just the same way you can partition a physical hard drive.&nbsp; Unlike the card reader, however, the
 USB flash drives only "count" when they are connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let's assume that you have a typical system with a single hard drive that has only one partition and that partition of course includes Windows.&nbsp; You also have one optical drive (e.g., a DVD drive) and a 4-slot card reader.&nbsp; You don't have any floppy
 drives.&nbsp; Here's what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive letters A: and B: are reserved even though there are no physical devices.&nbsp; Actually, you can manually use these letters for other partitions, but most people don't,<br />
</li><li>Drive letter C: is assigned to your system partition on your hard drive</li><li>Drive letter D: is assigned to your DVD drive</li><li>Drive letters E:, F:, G:, and H: are assigned to your card reader</li></ul>
<p>Because the English alphabet has 26 letters, you then have 26 - 8 or 16 letters left.&nbsp; These can be assigned multiple physical hard drives connected to the computer through the motherboard; multiple partitions either on the main hard drive you already have
 or on external drives; or to drives connected via USB.&nbsp; These latter might be either flash drives or "real" drives in external cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, this is what "My Computer" looks like on a system that has 3 physical drives installed inside the computer, 1 physical drive connected by USB, 1 USB flash drive; and 4-slot card reader.&nbsp; One of the internal disks has 2 partitions, as does the
 external drive, and there are no cards in the reader.&nbsp; The system happens to be Windows 7, but XP would be the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk 0 -- Partition C:</p>
<p>Disk 1 -- Partitions D: and E:</p>
<p>Disk 2 -- Partition H:</p>
<p>Disk 3 (a physical disk in an external enclosure connected via USB) -- Partitions F: and G:</p>
<p>Disks 4 - 7 (the card reader) -- Partitions I:, J:, K:, and L:</p>
<p>Disk 8 (the USB flash drive) -- Partition M:</p>
<p>DVD drive -- Partition Y:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You are not, however, limited by the 26 letters.&nbsp; A partition can be "mounted" and referenced as a directory as long as you are using the NTFS file system.&nbsp; This essentially gives you the ability to have an unlimited number of partitions (at least I don't
 know of a limit).&nbsp; See this article for more information --&gt; <a href="http://ask-leo.com/26_drives_is_there_a_way_around_the_26_drive_limit_in_windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thank you for that explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what my Win 7 desktop computer has:-</p>

</p><p>This was after I plugged five memory sticks into a couple of 4-way USB adaptors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confess that I was very surprised that each one showed up as I plugged it in - in the past, it has reached a point where the next drive plugged in is not recognised until I have dismounted another one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I get the same result when I fire up my old XP machine ? &nbsp;Or is XP limited in the number of drives ?</p>
<p>What about Win 98 and Win 95 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have often used the old MS-DOS Command, Subst.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was never bothered about there only being 26 letters - it was the number of drives that concerned me, i.e. how many add-ons can I hang off my old XP when I connect it to the Network ?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>While on... just WHAT is Drive Q: ? &nbsp;I can't access it.</p>

</p><p>I suspect that what was happening is that once all 26 letters were used, subsequent USB flash drives didn't show up in "My Computer" until you removed/dismounted one to make the drive letter available.&nbsp; If you open Disk Management (right-click My Computer

<p>XP should behave the same way as your Windows 7 computer behaves, assuming that you installed it using NTFS (see next).</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>What about Win 98 and Win 95 ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AFAIK, these versions of Windows will also behave the same way with respect to drive letters, but it's been too long since I used either version and I don't have any machine with one of those operating systems installed on which I could check.&nbsp; On the other
 hand, mount, mount points require NTFS, so you can't use these in Win 95 or Win 98.</p>

<p>As explained in the Ask Leo article, using mount points should enable you to have any number of additional partitions.&nbsp; If there is a limit to the number of mount points, I don't know it.</p>

<p>Starting with Office 2010, Microsoft introduced click to run, "a streaming and virtualization technology that is used to install Office&nbsp;products."&nbsp; If you elect to use click to run rather than the traditional "MSI" installation, you can start using an Office
 product within about 90 seconds, rather than waiting until the installation is complete.&nbsp; Microsoft creates and uses the Q: drive to accomplish this virtualization.&nbsp; In fact, if you had already assigned Q: to a physical partition, you would get an error when
 you attempted to install Office using click to run technology.&nbsp; </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
What specifically are you looking for / refering too.&nbsp; Many of the old tools that used to come with the media have been replaced with newer and more functional tools now.&nbsp; For example, whereas before you probably would have used Sysprep to clone machines, there
 are things like the Windows 7 Automated Installation Kit - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=696dd665-9f76-4177-a811-39c26d3b3b34&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Let me know what you're looking for and we can try to point you in the right direction.<br />

With Best Regards,<br />

            This is a Vista Forum but in XP make sure you uninstall everything to do with Windows Live Messenger, as an Administrator, via Add or Remove Programs. &nbsp;Next Reboot.&nbsp; Run programs like Disk Cleanup, and clean out your user's Temp files and IE's Temporary
 Internet Files.&nbsp; To find your user's temp files type %temp% in the Start Run box.<br />
<br />
Logon as an Administrator.&nbsp; Temporarily disable your Anti Virus software&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;downloading and installing Windows Live Messenger&nbsp;(for the umpteenth time).&nbsp; In fact disabling (temporarily) all Startup programs and non-Microsoft Services as well as Anti Virus
 might help, as long as you remember to put them back.&nbsp; See the MsConfig tool.<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />

<h2>            &#40;0x8007042D&#41; Error When Attempting to run System Image Backup on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I am trying to run a simple System Image Backup on Windows 8.1 and it keeps giving me this error:

<div>I have not been able to find any answers that have worked for me online. Which is why I'm now posting here. I did have an Oracle Database/SQL server installed on this computer a while ago, but I believe I have removed all files related to that.</div>

<p>Two major cause of the issue could be due to: </p>

            Thank you for your reply. I have finished all 3 steps that you recommended above but none of them seemed to work. I am still getting the same error message in the original post.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>When I ran <b>sfc /scannow</b>&nbsp;it did say there were some corrupted files related to AMD, which is a little weird since I use Nvidia, but other than that it didn't look like anything was related.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Unable to activate windows after a Motherboard change</h2>
                    My computer went in for a change of the cooling unit which had failed. While in the shop and under testing the "found" a problem with my motherboard and had replaced that as well. However, upon doing this I have a message in the bottom of my screen saying
 that I need to activate my windows which is kind of annoying because it's always ontop of my screen while gaming or watching videos. Can anyone help me activate my windows short of buying a new key for $200? &gt;.&gt;&nbsp;

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />
<br />(Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.)
<br />
<br />If the troubleshooter hasn't helped, you can get in touch of an agent using the link below who can help you to get your copy activated:

            Hi Chugonnadie 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />1. If Windows was preinstalled i..e OEM version, then you can not use the license on another hardware. OEM license is tied to motherboard and if motherboard is changed, you can not reuse the same license on new motherboard.
<br />
<br />In this case, you need to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />2. But if it was Retail license, then you can follow the below process
<br />
<br />To Reactivate Windows 10 after a hardware change, refer to following Microsoft Help - 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a> 
<br />
<br />3. If above doesn't work, To analyze the cause, I need the screenshot of following output
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste into Powershell / Cmd windows and Enter 
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>It would be extremely upsetting if i am forced to buy a new version of windows for a hardware change that i had no control over. If there is a work around it would be greatly appreciated..&nbsp;</p>

            My apologies for confirming your fear and conveying non-pleasant news.
<br />
<br />Since your motherboard has changed and your old license is tied to motherboard and your license was OEM which is not transferable, hence your fears are true, There is no other choice but to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />Best place to buy Windows 10 license is Microsoft Store. Click below to buy it from Microsoft
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows</a>
<br />
<br />You will find that there are many online sites selling very cheap licenses, don't fall for them as majority of the times, keys expire after some time.

<h2>            Bluetooth mouse &#38; keyboard has to be paired each time I turn on laptop after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>My Bluetooth mouse and keyboard used&nbsp;to pair and connect automatically to my slate laptop with Windows 7&nbsp; and 8, but since switching to Windows 10, I have to pair and connect the devices manually (by entering bluetooth settings, pairing,&nbsp;typing in the secure
 number for my keyboard, etc.) &nbsp;each time I start up the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's up to five minutes of my life wasting away with each bootup and I'm terminally ill... okay, no, I'm not, but still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I just start up my slate laptop, turn on my mouse and keyboard, and have them connect like the old days?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Erreur 8007000D lors de l&#38;&#35;39&#59;installation d&#38;&#35;39&#59;une extension de jeu PC</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour à tous amis gamers,</p>
<p>Voilà, j'ai un souci avec le téléchargement et l'installation des deux extensions de GTA IV sur PC. J'ai acheté ces deux jeux hier sur le site et lorsque j'essaye de les télécharger à partir du client marketplace, ce dernier plante à environ 5% du téléchargement.
 J'ai déjà tout essayé, ouverture de ports, désactivation de mon pare-feu... rien ne fonctionne. Après plusieurs tentatives j'ai tout de même réussi à télécharger une des deux extensions en me reconnectant plusieurs fois au client après qu'il ait planté. Cela
 a pris du temps mais le téléchargement continuait malgré le plantage. En revanche l'installation du jeu est impossible, le message d'erreur&nbsp; "Échec de l’installation de l’élément. Si la nouvelle tentative échoue, supprimez l'élément et téléchargez-le à nouveau.
 Code : 8007000D" apparaît. Lorsque je clique sur l'onglet "plus de détails" il est inscrit ceci "Données non valides. (Exception de HRESULT : 0x8007000D)". Bien qu'ayant tenté de retélécharger l'élément comme il est conseillé, rien n'y fait, le même message
 d'erreur apparaît de nouveau. Je ne sais plus quoi faire, j'ai besoin d'aide s'il-vous-plait.</p>

            When your laptop connects it's using DHCP to automatically get an IP Address from your router. You could try configuring a static IP address on the system to see if that works (so you know it's a DHCP problem assigning you an IP, not a wireless connection
 issue for example). &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Also you could open an elevate command prompt (right click on cmd, Run As Administrator) and run the following:
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>ipconfig /release</li><li>ipconfig /renew</li><li>ipconfig /all</li></ol>
<div>The first 2 would be to fix the lack of dynamic IP address (DHCP), the 3rd is for you to see that you get one (it you get an address starting with 169.254 then you probably didn't get an address).&nbsp;</div>
