            <p>This is a "typical " MS support answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It avoids tackling the question directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Sending person to a solution that shows a process that is working. Not a fix, nor a solution. to attain the working state</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. It gives a very unfortunate message that the MS support staff or the organisation itself is &nbsp;:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a) Not competent.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b) lazy</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c) not interested&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;d) &nbsp;are not given enough time to investigate.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;e) why do people buy 3rd party products and Not MS all the time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. From XP onwards MS has dumbed down and degraded intelligence as a consequence of chasing after some ill defined , indescribable corporate goal or target</p>

</p><p>I did what you asked and downloaded and ran the Windows Update troubleshooter but it did not find any problems.</p>
<p>So I tried to download and install the KB3156421 UPDATE again but still got the same error message (screenprint below):</p>

            <p>The screenshot you posted looks SO familiar, since you're apparently having the same problem I was. Ever since the April updates were pushed out, I've been unable to install
 troubleshooter, the clean boot, changing settings, restarting services, etc. I tried all of those and they did nothing to correct the problem. It appears that the problem wasn't with the individual updates themselves or with Windows Update per se, but with
 the copy of Windows 10 residing on my PC. I did a live chat with a Microsoft tech and got the problem resolved. This is what worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the main <strong>Windows 10 Help page</strong> (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/support) scroll to the bottom of the page and click on "<strong>Ask Microsoft Answer Desk</strong>." On the next page, click on "<strong>Chat online with a
 Microsoft</strong> <strong>Answer Tech</strong>" and establish a live chat with a support tech (they'll walk you through the steps to connect). Describe your problem and, if possible, paste in the KB number and error code so they know exactly what the problem
 is. Allow them remote access to your PC and if they're unable to get the updates to install, which they weren't able to with my PC, they can do an "<strong>in-place upgrade</strong>" for you and get you a fresh copy of Windows 10. It is a time consuming process,
 since the download takes a while and then some more time to allow Windows to finish its install and setup process, but once the install is complete you should have no more problems with updates failing to install. This procedure left all my files and current
 settings intact, and for me it was well worth the time spent to get the problem resolved. This may not be the answer for everyone, but it worked like a charm for me - since reinstalling Windows, I've had two Windows updates and two security updates for Flash
 Player install with no issues at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

            <p>The most annoying part is that after having this cycle occur several times a day over the last 30 0r so days, There is no way to block the change from starting to download from Microsoft. There is also no way to find out what the error is that it is encountering
 that makes it determine what cause the install to fail. This is a very typical syndrome of Microsoft software. "We know better than you what is wrong with your ccmputer and you are not smart enough to understand what is wrong even if we tell you"</p>

            Hi,
<div>Assuming that you are requesting for Windows 8 drivers for your printer the bad news is that Canon does not have them.</div>
<div>You might want to try the Windows 7 ones that can be downloaded here:</div>

<p>In the manage game screen it shows its installed, but in game the characters aren't available.&nbsp; In the game store, it shows Killer Instinct: Ultra Edition as "Content Not Installed", but when you click on it you have to buy for $39.99.&nbsp; When the game starts
 up, it says there this add-on is purchased but not installed, but when I go to install I'm prompted to buy.&nbsp; How can I get this resolved?</p>

<p>No such luck. &nbsp;They were already "installed". &nbsp;For kicks and giggles I uninstalled and reinstalled, but it's still saying purchased and not installed, without letting me install. &nbsp;I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game, the add-on, the individual characters,
 spun around and clucked like a chicken, but still can't get things to work.</p>

<p>Did you guys use a promotional code to get the games? I got a 2-day code with Sunset Overdrive and the Games With Gold FAQ says you're not eligible if you use it. In addition, I got Sherlock Holmes and when I opened it it said I need an Xbox Live Gold membership
 to validate it. So you may want to get a 1 month code and try redownloading it.</p>

            <div><i>From our contributor&nbsp;Ronnie Vernon:</i></div>
<div><br />
<div>You cannot change the Desktop font color.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Because Desktop wallpaper images have varying colors, it is easy for the font colors to be unreadable if they are on top of the same color as a wallpaper image. For instance a black font on top of a dark part of the background image or a white font on
 a white part of a background image.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Desktop icon fonts are dynamic and will show white on dark backgrounds and change to white with a black shadow effect on a light background.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In previous versions of Windows, it did not matter what color you picked for the Desktop fonts, some would always be rendered invisible because of the background color of a desktop wallpaper. The user was constantly moving icons around the desktop to a
 different colored area where the font could be read. This was the source of a large number of complaints from users asking for a font that was always visible, regardless of the color that was behind the font.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The white/shadowed font solves this problem.</div>

<h2>            External hard drive disconnects my wifi</h2>
                    
<p>So i bought a toshiba canvio 3.0 1tb hard drive because i have read it works well with xbox one, and i got it in the mail the other day and plugged it in. This is where my problems began, as soon as i formatted my im disconnected from my network. So i got
 online with xbox support and the guy told me to unplug it from the xbox and unplug the xbox and press the power button for 20 seconds, then restart the xbox. That worked but now when ever i plug the hard drive in my my xbox does not recognize any networks
 at all. Im not sure if this is a known issue but i know this hard drive works with xbox one. Im just not sure where to go from here trying to fix this issue so that i dont have to constantly screw with this to make it work.</p>

<p>I have heard of this happening to some other users, however, I have not been able to find a solution. &nbsp;Do you possibly have a friend you could test the external drive on their system to see if it causing the same problem? &nbsp;May be something defective in the
 drive. &nbsp;Also make sure you are using a USB 3.0 cable and try different ports on the console. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah it's a 3.0 transfer cable and I can test it on someone else's Xbox. It's weird it only only happens sometimes. Like if I put the 3.0 caplet in the Xbox while the hard drive is plugged in to the other side. If I plug the cable in first then attach it
 to the hard drive it seems to not happen as often.</p>

<h2>            Mouse Random Freezing Problem</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed a new motherboard and ever since I have been having a problem while gaming where my mouse will randomly freeze for a second or two. There isn't a correlation between when the graphics are at their peak, as it happens in the game menus
 too. It also only happens on certain games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC Specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU: intel i7 5820k</p>
<p>GFX: Radeon R9 200</p>
<p>RAM: 16GB</p>
<p>Motherboard: MSI</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps taken:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean windows install</p>
<p>Re-install mouse drivers</p>
<p>Remove all recently installed programs</p>
<p>Disable all USB power saving settings</p>
<p>Disable Realtek Audio Manager</p>
<p>Lowered gfx settings</p>
<p>Checked motherboard settings are correct</p>
<p>Re-installed motherboard drivers</p>
<p>Tried different mouse</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as I'm at the limit of my knowledge.</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for the help</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made another account, unfortunately it didn't help. The issue seems to be only with 3 games - Arma 3, War Thunder, GTA5. All my other games seem fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>re [2]: i might do this, but i've written to the MS support, maybe they can help. even considering a reset to factory settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Refresh or a Reset (or even a System Recovery - <em>not </em>to be confused with Sytem
<em>Restore</em>) may correct the behavior. See <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: Pay particular attention to the Notes &amp; Warnings on that page!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a final followup: Eventually I was forced to do a System Refresh as for some reason my User Profiles got lost (the junction I created for the Users folder kind of disappeared). After the refresh obviously all is running smoothly again. Have now used
 the Move function to move individual user folders such as Music or Documents to my data drive instead of moving the entire User folder and tricking Windows into believing it is still on the system drive by using a junction. Well, some times you have to learn
 it the hard way. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line: I do not think my system was infected, but rather that either my Antivirus / Firewall was messing with the update, as the MS support said that the Update log file showed permission issues, or that the junction I had created was also messing
 up the update from being executed (as with the installation of Windows 8.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers and thanks again!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - How do I use a System Repair Disk &#40;System Image&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dxab  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - How do I use a System Repair Disk &#40;System Image&#41; to restore my computer to an earlier state&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a ‚ÄúSystem Image‚Äù saved on DVD +RW ( a ‚ÄúSystem Repair Disk‚Äù). The System Image was created in September 2018, shortly after purchase of a Lenovo ideapad 320 ‚Äì 171KB (a ‚Äòlaptop‚Äô computer).
 I would like to use a System Image to restore the laptop to an earlier state. However, when I try, the following dialog is displayed, even though a portable hard drive is attached or the Repair Disk inserted:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‚ÄúWindows cannot find a system image on this computer.</p>
<p>Attach the backup hard disk or insert the final DVD from a backup set and click Retry. Alternatively, close this dialog for more options‚Äù
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The System Image was created<span>&nbsp;
</span>using the ‚ÄúCreate a System Image‚Äù option, accessed via the following path:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; Backup and Restore (Windows 7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was suggested that I change the BIOS Boot order, using the information contained provided here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/ &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After shutting down the computer, I accessed ‚ÄúBIOS Setup‚Äù. That opened up ‚ÄúInsydeH20 Setup Utility‚Äù. Under that heading, five tabs are displayed and accessible:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‚Äú ‚ÄòInformation‚Äô;</p>
<p>‚ÄòConfiguration‚Äô;</p>
<p>‚ÄòSecurity‚Äô;</p>
<p>‚ÄòBoot‚Äô;</p>
<p>‚ÄòExit‚Äô.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As advised, I accessed the ‚ÄòBoot‚Äô tab. The following was displayed:</p>
<p>‚ÄúBoot Mode [UEF1]</p>
<p>Fast Boot<span>&nbsp;
</span>[Enabled]</p>
<p>USB Boot<span>&nbsp;
</span>[Enabled]</p>
<p>PXE Boot to LAN<span>&nbsp;
</span>[Enabled]</p>
<p>IPV4 PXE First<span>&nbsp;
</span>[Enabled]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EFI</p>
<p>Windows Boot Manager (ST1000LM035-1RK172)</p>
<p>EFI DVD/CDROM (HL ‚ÄìDT-ST DVDRAM GUE0N)</p>
<p>EFI PXE Network (54-E1-AD-E0-36-3D)‚Äù</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the options under ‚ÄúBoot Mode‚Äù can be disabled or enabled, but cannot be listed in a different order. Each of the items listed under ‚ÄúEFI‚Äù can be moved to occupy a different position
 in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‚ÄòBoot Mode‚Äô can be switched from ‚Äò[UEF1]‚Äô to ‚Äò[Legacy Support]‚Äô. If that is done, ‚ÄòFast Boot‚Äô is substituted with: ‚ÄòBoot Priority<span>&nbsp;
</span>[UEF1 First]‚Äô</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lenovo User Guide only offers two options to restore the computer ‚Äì neither involve restoring a saved system image. Both involve reinstallation of the factory default configuration.
 However, one option preserve‚Äôs user‚Äôs data and important settings. Obviously, neither option is preferable to using a System Image, if you don‚Äôt want to have to spend hours reinstalling software and tweaking settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I‚Äôve said, I have not been able to use the System Repair Disk that I have. Can anyone help me to use my System Repair Disk to restore my computer system? It seems strange that the computer
 would come with the option to create a System Image if once created it cannot be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the computer informed that a system image that is older than 60 days is likely to be un reliable at restoring drivers and programmes and that they may need to be reinstalled. How
 likely is that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi,
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia, an independent advisorr, and I am glad to assist you today.
<br />
<br />We are sorry to hear about this inconvenience. Now, we would like to help you promptly. 
<br />
<br />Now, below, you‚Äôll find two ways of fixing ‚ÄòWindows can‚Äôt find system image on this computer‚Äô error. And you can follow either way and apply provided methods to remove this error and perform Windows system image restore on your PC without any problems now:
<br />Way 1. Manually fix Windows system restore error - Windows can‚Äôt find a system image
<br />
<br />Step 1. Change System Image Folder as 'WindowsImageBackup'
<br />The system image must be named as WindowsImageBackup so to lead Windows to find a system image on the computer. So if your system image is set as this name, change and correct it now.
<br />
<br />Step 2. Put ‚ÄòWindowsImageBackup‚Äô folder in the Root Directory of a Drive
<br />
<br />The system image folder must be put at the top level of your hard drive on the computer. Otherwise, Windows system recover won‚Äôt get success since the system image can‚Äôt be found. Check to find out where you are placing your system image in the right directory on your computer drive. If not, change the folder to the right place now.
<br />
<br />Step 3. Don‚Äôt change the sub-folder name
<br />Step 4. Don‚Äôt add any folders in 'WindowsImageBackup' folder
<br />Make sure not add any other folder in the WindowsImageBackup folder.
<br />
<br />Step 5. Make sure mediaID.bin file is saved together with your system image
<br />No matter where did you keep your system image, on a USB drive or an external hard drive, do remember to copy the mediaID.bin file together with your system image folder files.
<br />
<br />After following all above steps, checking all system files and folders are placed at the right location on your computer hard drive or external storage with no extra added files or folders, you can retry again to perform Windows system image recover on your computer.
<br />
<br />If you succeed, congratulation! You can use your computer and continue your jobs and enjoy fascinate network life again.
<br />If you failed, don‚Äôt worry. Way 2, an alternative tool for Windows system recovery can directly help you resolve ‚ÄòWindows can‚Äôt find a system image‚Äô error.
<br />
<br />Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we‚Äôll be glad to assist you.

    <title>Administator password missing win 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davelshaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Administator password missing win 8.1</h2>
                    I updated win 8 to 8.1 and everything works fine except:
<div>My user account will not let me install or uninstall anything - it doesn't have the privileges.</div>
<div>When I go to 'Administrator' it asks for a password which I have never had on this computer which was XP then Win 8.</div>
<div>At no time was I asked to provide a password in the installation of 8.1, only for a hotmail account for my user account.</div>
<div>I cannot change the user or anything else and I cannot go to an earlier installation and I cannot reformat because it asks</div>
<div>for the administrator password every time. I tried using lusrmgr.msc but all the options said 'the following error occurred</div>
<div>while attempting to save properties for user Administrator. Access is denied'&nbsp;</div>
<div>So what do I do now - how can I get a password or how can I reformat?</div>
                </div>

            Your Admin password is your Microsoft Acct password that you set up when you installed windows 8. That will also be your Hotmail acct password. Try that. This confused me too when I set up windows 8.

            As soon as I click on 'command prompt (Admin), a box appears asking for a password.
<div>If I use just the 'command prompt' and type in 'net user administrator/active:yes' I get a whole string of syntax commands.</div>

            I went through all this using my win8 dvd and at the end it said: command successful.
<div>I then went back into win8.1 and it still asked me for the administrator password.</div>
<div>I used the same one as for the win 8 as above and it still did not recognise it. I have never at any time used the administrator setting, or have I been knowingly asked for a password. I tried to reformat the drive but was again asked for the password
 so I couldn't.</div>

            <p>This is also useful to bypass the standard account password reset in normal mode. If you have a local 8 or 8.1 account and can access dos, it will allow for password reset w/out authentication.

<h2>            Miracast stopped working after latest Windows 10 update&#33;&#33;&#33; Please help&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Above a week ago, Windows notified me that my Windows 10 Pro is too old and asked me to update to the latest version. I thought why not, just gave it a go. Then after that, I cannot connect to my Miracast device anymore. I searched on Google, it seems that
 quite a bit of people got the same issue as me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated all my drivers to the latest and tried to resolve the issue. Sofar, there is no luck with it. I have no choice but to use my Macbook Pro to connect to my TV box to cast the screen on TV. Someone suggested to roll back to previous version, I have
 not tried it yet. Unless I have no option, I will not roll back. Please Microsoft, check out the issue, provide the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certain functionality can get affected after a recent feature update. This may continue to persist due to missing or damaged system files. Just to confirm, may we know how you updated the drivers for Miracast? Is it through the Device Manager or directly
 from the manufacturer's website?</p>

<p>Personally it didn't help my problem. &nbsp;I looked at my adapters and I didn't even have the Teredo tunnel adapter installed. &nbsp;I manually installed it and everything worked. Instructions for that taken from:</p>

<p>Open up your device manager</p>
<p>Click the action tab at the top and click Add Legacy Hardware</p>
<p>Click next and next again it will then scan and find nothing</p>
<p>Click next on the screen after that</p>
<p>Wait a minute and you will see a list of hardware appear, scroll down and choose network adapters then click next</p>
<p>On the left column choose Microsoft then in the right hand column scroll down and choose Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter, then click next and this will install it.</p>
<p>Reboot your PC</p>

    <title>Installers keep crashing&#47; .dll corrupted - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installers keep crashing&#47; .dll corrupted</h2>
                    Hello, My name is Jesus and I've owned my computer for a little less than a year now and it has been working fine until a few months ago. I was installing a program and when I got to the license agreement, the installer crashed. I thought it was odd but
 I lived with it until now because I've had enough. Also when I would open some programs like games off of steam, a pop out would come up and say "C:\Windows\system32\Riched20.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error...", the games
 and/or programs would still run but that pop up would always show up. When I came to find a solution, it would ask me to run a sfc scan on my pc, when I would run the scan... it crashes and says there is an error. When I was hanging onto my last thread I decided
 to just factory reset my computer, when I was factory resetting, it goes to about 40% then an error comes up. It's almost like theres something corrupt in my computer and when I try to fix it, I can't. I can't run any install

<p>Hi Jesus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the issue is with the installer you previously used a few months back. Since you are unable to perform a system reset and possibly unable to perform a system restore since it's already been a few months now, we suggest that you perform a repair
 upgrade instead and if it fails, we would need to perform a clean install instead. Click&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085"><strong>here</strong></a>&nbsp;on
 how to perform a repair upgrade, an article created by one of our Community MVP<em> "Andre Da Costa"</em>. Other Community members found this article very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Regarding to the issue when performing the repair upgrade, are you using a fresh copy of the latest Windows 10 ISO? If not, it is recommended to download a fresh and latest copy to prevent any errors. Regarding to your second concern, it's possible that
 there might be a corruption on your Microsoft Visual C++. We suggest that you download the latest version/update&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>            screen flikkering and low fps when playing fullscreen games</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since windows 10 updated to the fall creators update, my games have been acting strange. They start flickering and my fps get a lot lower. I have updated windows to a previous version mutiple times, but it keeps updating to this windows version (this is
 the second time in a week that my laptop updated to this version).</p>
<p>(don't know if this will help, but I've got an Intel core i5-2400 and 4 GB of ram)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried multiple solutions, but the only one I've found is to play in windowed mode (and going back to a previous version).</p>
<p>As nothing helped, I reckoned maybe this could help.</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer crashes at every login with faulting module - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Explorer crashes at every login with faulting module twinui.dll</h2>
                    <p>I've Explorer.exe crash at every login in Win 8.1 64-bit for awhile. It manifests itself visibly by brief screen freeze at login&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;Explorer restart. Lately after recent Windows optional updates series, some features don't work after 1st login,
 like IE page scrolling, Charms Bar access, etc, but everything works after login out and in again. Not sure if these symptoms are related. But Explorer keeps giving this error at every login regardless, and even before the updates. SFC / scannow and DISM /RestoreHealth
 show no errors now after&nbsp;they did&nbsp;post-update fixes. The updates can't be uninstalled any longer, relevant system restore point is hidden now, clean backup without this error is too old. The error in Event Viewer&nbsp;is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: Explorer.EXE, version: 6.3.9600.17667, time stamp: 0x54c6f7c2<br />

</p><p>I followed this thread <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/explorerexe-keeps-crashing-after-update-to-81/3f13cb2f-1407-4a26-ae15-84b18e5e1de9?page=1">
Explorer.exe keeps crashing after update to 8.1</a> and collected some dumps:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can someone&nbsp;suggest how to fix the issue or figure out its cause. System Reinstall or Refresh is not an option so far, the goal is to troubleshoot and debug, not reinstall&nbsp;OS and all packages&nbsp;after each Windows update.</p>

            <p>For <em>windbg.exe </em>make sure you have a path to symbols.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To store symbols in&nbsp;C:\Symbols folder&nbsp;:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on WinDbg &gt; File &gt; Symbol&nbsp;File Path&nbsp;and then paste the following under "Symbol path":<br />
<br />
<em>SRV*c:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols </em><br />
<br />
then click "OK" &gt; File &gt; Save workspace &gt; File &gt; Exit<br />
<br />
Then try running the following commands to get information on the crash:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>!analyze</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>!analyze -v</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>To&nbsp;get information on all modules loaded</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>lmtn;lmtnsmn;lmv</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>atidxx64.dll is a "third party" module so no symbols will be loaded for that module or any other non-Microsoft module.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the issues you are describing it may help if you could provide the following information on the computer that may help determine any issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R&nbsp;&gt; type <em>msinfo32 </em>in the "Run" &nbsp;box &gt; OK &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make the resulting .nfo file&nbsp;available via&nbsp;mediafire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R&nbsp;&gt; type <em>eventvwr </em>in the "Run" box&nbsp;&gt; OK&nbsp;&gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make the resulting .evtx file available via mediafire.</p>
