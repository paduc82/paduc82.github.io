<h2>            Realtek audio drivers causing crashes on some systems</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
TL;DR - Tracked a crashing issue down to realtek audio driver. Generic windows 10 HD audio driver works fine. I'm wondering if anyone has encountered a similar issue. (Or maybe this info can be helpful to others doing troubleshooting)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
This seems to be linked to a strange file included in the realtek audio driver package - mbfilt64.sys</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
It's signed by Creative Technologies (Not Realtek!) and is very old - Dated 2009 according to it's signature! This file is distributed even in the very latest Realtek driver packages.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I've got an MSI Z97 Gaming 5 motherboard which includes the Realtek ALC1150 chip</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
For a while I'd been having very infrequent crashes. Maybe once every few weeks- A freeze, followed by a bluescreen and a reboot. Never during games. Always during streaming video. Running windows 8.1</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
About two weeks ago I installed a new NVME M.2 SSD and did a clean install windows 10.. And the crashing increased to once every few days.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Ok, So I'm thinking I've got a hardware or RAM issue.. OCCT runs for 8 hours, no problem. Prime95 - No problem. Ran Memtest for 24 hours. Again, no problem. Crashes only occur while streaming video.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Next, I ran Driver verifier using the following instructions</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983</a></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Immediately crashed on boot (Had to boot in to safe mode to disable verifier) - Crash dumps immediately pointed mbfilt64.sys, which I verified belonged to the realtek HD audio driver using the device manager (Listed under driver details)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I uninstalled the Realtek package and let windows revert to the generic HD audio driver - Less optimal solution as you don't have the ability to configure audio jack options without the control panel. I have, though, been crash free ever since.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Googling for "mbfilt64.sys" I found lots of people reporting random crashes similar to mine, with mbfilt64.sys being listed in system info dumps. Also lots of advice to update audio drivers because of mbfilt64.sys's old 2009 timestamp&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Problem is, there is only one version of this file and it's distributed with even the lastest Realtek driver packages available.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I've got a hunch this driver is causing problems on some people's systems. I don't know what triggers the bug. Maybe it's specific to the ALC1150. Maybe it's something else.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
It's odd that there is a creative signed driver being distributed with Realtek audio software, but I vaguely recall some creative branded something or other being sold with motherboards that had realtek chips (Some sort of software enhancement) I also know
 that Realtek packages branded features for some motherboard manufacturers. - If you install the driver package, downloaded from Realtek's web page, on a system with an MSI motherboard (like the one I list above) then the control panel will have MSI branding.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
It's possible that this creative signed driver <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
mbfilt64.sys</span>&nbsp;only gets installed under specific circumstances. Looking at the laptop I'm posting now I see that it has a realtek audio chip.. But the offending creative driver is not present under the device manager.</p>

            On 9/23/2016, my wife's Windows 10 system lost functionality, because explorer.exe repeatedly hung and was closed by the OS (viewed in Event Log). (This hang eliminated all the icons on the taskbar, and the Start menu was non-functional. As a whole, the
 system was unusable for normal tasks.) After much reading on the web, I looked at recently installed software. The last thing installed (9/22/2016) was the Realtek HD Audio driver. I uninstalled it and--miracles happen--everything started working just fine
 again. &nbsp;So, yes, IMHO there can be problems with the Realtek drivers.

            Hi Rpbert
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Personlization - Start
<br />
<br />To clear those lists, turn off 'Show recently opened items on jump lists on Start or Taskbar'
<br />
<br />
<br />To change the number of items stored on those jump lists, please see this article for a registry fix . . .

<p>Are these signs of malware activity?</p>
<p>There have also been 1534 Warnings of failure of Profile notification of events, which might explain why I had no warning of this problem. Do these imply that User Profile Service is not functioning properly?</p>

<h2>            PC is not working well</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have tried refreshing my PC before but it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>i tried refreshing it recently - it gives me a complete list of programs which are to be installed again after the refresh and the list is very long (u torrent, windows driver package, realtek audio drivers, Bluetooth drivers, nvidia files and lots more..!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea from where will i get all these files? i do not have any source---&gt; most of them are pre-installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI:- Yes, i do have the LATEST WINDOWS 8.1 version installed (KB&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1); font-weight: bold">2919355), No&nbsp;</span>virus present (kasperky).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1); font-weight: bold">My need to refresh:-</span> The PC isn't working well.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1); font-weight: bold">*&nbsp;</span>None of the metro apps work but crash.(store, music)-&gt; now even the icons(images) don't even display on the start screen but there are just orange , green blocks.</p>
<p>* I feel it is quite slow for a PC with intel i5 4 gen. processor with 4 gb ram.(no , the memory occupied is not even that much!)</p>
<p>* "change my pc setting" also i had to fix somehow otherwise it was crashing too.</p>
<p>What to do?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Surface Laptop 2 battery drains during sleep&#47;hibernate</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
I've had my SL2 for 16 days and so far struggle to believe the claimed runtime for these things. I have heard so many times that Chrome is the culprit but why does my Macbook not suffer from using chrome? Nevertheless, I have installed "the great suspender"
 addon for Chrome and removed all other unnecessary addons and I block all notifications from websites.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
I think it's not just that though, two nights ago I closed the lid and resumed from hibernation 16 hrs later and lost 7%. Last night I did the same thing and lost another 6%. My macbook could sleep all week and lose nothing.
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
Is it unrealistic to expect Windows to be able to match this kind of performance on Microsoft's hardware or is this unusual behavior?<br />

    <title>The Surface Pro isn&#39;t properly marketed. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnwithac  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Surface Pro isn&#39;t properly marketed.</h2>
                    <p>I rarely write about products, but the surface pro in my opinion is a revolutionary product that should be shaking up the community more than it is. Personally I believe that the reason that people aren't praising the surface pro enough is because Microsoft
 has cornered themselves under the title of being a "tablet". I think the way this product should be marketed is a similar way the iPhone was originally shown to the world as a "internet communications device, a phone, and an iPod with touch screen capabilities".
 To only be a tablet is too limited for a product of this magnitude.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think a good idea for a commercial to show off this device is for it to start out docked as a PC with a guy working in the morning.&nbsp;The man then&nbsp;un docks his Surface pro, and starts riding on&nbsp;a train writing notes on the documents he was just working on.
 Proceeding that event he goes to some coffee shop or whatever, and plugs in the type cover, flips back the kickstand, and writes an email with those documents attached. Finally to finish off the commercial it should be him falling asleep with the surface pro
 in his bed playing a movie, and then perhaps the windows hello giving him&nbsp;a wink and turning the screen off as he falls asleep or something.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A commercial like this would give the surface pro the personal feeling that the current commercials aren't giving. This is a real step towards the one machine that can do everything, and it should be celebrated. The one machine that can do it all isn't about
 just being a tablet that has desktop capabilities, it's about a personal&nbsp;computer&nbsp;that can go anywhere with you and do anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I'm just happy that Microsoft has injected some real innovation into the marketplace, and I'm excited to see how the competition will drive these types of products in the future.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Seriously ... there are numerous problems with Surface 4.&nbsp; Additionally I have had all 4 of the Surface's and this one is giving me the most trouble.&nbsp; Just Monday I had to restore mine to factory condition because of the critical error "Your start menu isn't
 working.&nbsp; We'll try to ix it the next time you sign in" which will not fix itself until doom's day.&nbsp; I have received this on my Surface 2, 3, and 4 all running Windows 10 - and would probably have it on my original Surface if I still had it.</p>

            <p>I have had mine for a month now. I realize that it does have some technical issues, but my point isn't about the technical issues, it's about the fact that it's not marketed well. The iPad was sold as a window to the world, yet it really didn't do much.
 The surface pro does more, and delivers on apple's initial idea for the iPad much better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just find this phenomenon interesting. I find it interesting that Apple is able to sell dreams, and Microsoft is able to on occasion, deliver a better product that matches that dream much better, but it doesn't get the warm reception that a new MacBook
 would get.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if as Apple starts to stagnate with their unwillingness to change that Microsoft will be able to change people's perceptions and take their top dog spot back.</p>

    <title>Shadow Copy lag issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david_5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shadow Copy lag issues</h2>
                    <p>I am having some issues with shadow copy taking up a lot of disk time and causing lag. Lag spikes are occurring approx every 30 seconds to a minute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the resource monitor, under System, I currently have approximately 100+ (approx 3.5 pages) \device\hardiskvolumeshadocopy instances running. (Hard to count exactly as they keep changing.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total CPU usage is ~15%; Memory usage is 40%; Disk usage fluctuates between 10% and 60% (up to Total: 16 GB/sec) at idle. (I know a comp is never truly at idle, but the only active windows up right now are this Chrome window, Task manager, Resource Monitor
 and the PowerShell.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each shadowcopy instance/file is grouped in sets of seven:</p>
<p>&nbsp; harddiskvolumeshadowcopyxxxxx</p>
<p>&nbsp; harddiskvolumeshadowcopyxxxxx\</p>
<p>&nbsp; harddiskvolumeshadowcopyxxxxx\$Mft</p>
<p>&nbsp; harddiskvolumeshadowcopyxxxxx\$Secure:SDS</p>
<p>&nbsp; harddiskvolumeshadowcopyxxxxx\$Extend\$Reparse:$R:$Index_Allocation</p>
<p>&nbsp; harddiskvolumeshadowcopyxxxxx\$Secure:$SII:$Index_Allocation</p>
<p>&nbsp; harddiskvolumeshadowcopyxxxxx\System Volume Information</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Shadow Copy Storage association is</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;For volume: (C:)\\?\Volume{95564550-02d1-4593-afdb-8ac81a1584c2}\<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Shadow Copy Storage volume: (C:)\\?\Volume{95564550-02d1-4593-afdb-8ac81a1584c2}\<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Used Shadow Copy Storage space: 1.68 GB (0%)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Allocated Shadow Copy Storage space: 2.77 GB (1%)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Maximum Shadow Copy Storage space: 22.3 GB (10%)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Pro, 64 bit. The hard drive is a SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other data you need?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago, I resized to the current 10% max space and created a restore point.&nbsp;Originally I thought the lag was a conflict between VSS and Carbonite (it appeared that the two were in a continuous Do loop with each other). I limited the Carbonite
 back-up to only running in the middle of the night and to not do a continuous back-up.&nbsp;<br />
It fixed the issue for about a day.</p>
<p>Going back in today, the huge number of shadowcopy instances is back. In addition, the manual restore point I created a couple of days ago is gone. There are no other restore points.
<br />
Regarding the potential conflict with Carbonite: the Carbontie files that were present originally in Resource Monitor are not there today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to keep shadowcopy running but it makes some applications extremely difficult to use due to the lag.</p>
<p>How do I stop the constant read/write to disk? Better yet: how do I stop the frequent lag spikes?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I check what is taking up room, it states I am using almost 80gb in games and apps.&nbsp; When added up it is less than 5gb.&nbsp; So where is the space going to?&nbsp; I have tried all that I know, such as disc clean ups etc, all to no avail.&nbsp; I even deleted iTunes

<h2>            Why is windows media player suddenly missing in my windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    I no longer have Windows media player in my 8.1 and did not remove it myself. I believe there is now a different one that has replaced it and now it wants &nbsp;you to buy this particular dvd player. I am so unhappy with windows now. I have always used 8.1
 but tried windows 10 and removed it after a short time. My computer has been having difficulties since then, I have missing files and now the dvd player is gone. I don't remember the name of the one that keeps popping up when I try to download windows media,
 but it makes you think it is giving you a different one and if you click on download ,, it ends up asking you to download it for a fee. I clicked on it and then realized I had made a mistake. I had to remove it from my computer. But think it did not all remove.
 I found out later it is a malware program. But that is beside the point. I have not &nbsp;had trouble with my really good windows 8 until I downloaded windows 10. It has been months since but I still cannot find programs I

            <p>First, update Windows Defender and run a full scan.</p>
<p>Then download, install, update and run a full scan with (free) Malwarebytes. Keep it free, no need to start a trial. Malwarebytes -
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/antimalware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/antimalware/</a>
</p>
<p>Hopefully, these scans should help indicate if you PC has any malware and remove it if its found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, try uninstalling WMP, restart the PC, reinstall WMP, restart the PC, as per -

http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/26107/how-to-reinstall-windows-media-player-in-windows-7-to-solve-problems/</a> which should hopefully restore WMP to your PC.</p>

            I want to thank George for replying , I was not able to get media player back, I was so frustrated trying to. that I finally gave up and just purchased a media player and can finally watch &nbsp;my dvds. &nbsp;I believe it is windows 10 that caused the problem.
 They keep asking me to down load it even though I don't want it and have said so. It is a pain in the head for want of a better word. 10 is a pest. Bea

<h2>            How do I activate my Print Spooler in services.msc&#63;</h2>
                    I have Windows 8 loaded on a Samsung laptop NP355E5C. A week ago today we had a power outage in the office and had to replace the modem and router. In the office my laptop was wireless to a Konika-Minolta Bizhub 253, and all was working fine. We called
 the company's tech support to reconnect in the office network to the photocopier/ printer, and this was done online. All was working. I printed a test page. Two days later, I could not communicate to the printer. The message was "no printer spooler." After
 troubleshooting with the copier companies tech support, we discerned the problem was to get the printer spooler running and keep it running. For this I went online live chat with Samsung. I can start the spooler, reboot, and then see the spooler is running.
 But when I try to run the setup to reinstall the printer driver (I removed this in order to re-install this, thinking this might help) I get the message again "the printer spooler is not running...reboot". After three sessions of liv

<h2>            Cant install BootCamp 3.0 64-bit on my Windows 7 64-bit OS partition.  This partition was made by shrinking the C&#58; drive.__ </h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows 7 (have both 32-bit and 64-bit OS's) on my iMac using BootCamp assistant.&nbsp; I can install bootcamp 3.0 .exe on the C:Drive (32-bit), but can not install bootcamp 3.0 64-bit .exe on the D:Drive (64-bit). &nbsp; Note that the 64-bit Windows
 D:Drive was created by shrinking 32-bit Windows C:drive.&nbsp; I think the cause of this issue is the fact that the 64-bit D:Drive was created by shrinking the C:Drive.</p>
<p>The info box that pops up when trying to do the install says that this machine/hardware cant run/install bootcamp 3.0?</p>
<p>It works on the C:drive, but not the D:drive...&nbsp;&nbsp; WHY?</p>

    <title>When I try to use any alt code that starts with alt 17, it brings me - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> igpay atinlay86  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I try to use any alt code that starts with alt 17, it brings me back a page.</h2>
                    <p>In Chrome and Firefox (I didn't check Internet Explorer) it makes me go back a page if I do alt-17, so I assume this is a problem with my computer, not the browser. I tried going through the Internet settings in my Control Panel and my Google Chrome settings,
 but nothing mentioned alt codes. This only seems to be a problem on my computer; no other computer has this problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, we can’t conclude where the issue is.&nbsp;</span><span>I would appreciate if you could help me with more information:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>1. What happens when you try to use different ALT code other than ALT-17?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Have you installed any keyboard tweaking program? </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Which keyboard layout do you have?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Is the ALT key associated with other shortcuts on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the meantime, to confirm where the issue is, </span><span>I would suggest you to try the following
</span><span>steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Try to do the same activity (ALT -17) on Internet Explorer as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. You may check if the ALT key is functioning correctly in on-screen/off-screen keyboard. This will help us to verify if there is any issue with the Alt key on the keyboard.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. You can also check if the ALT codes are working on other applications like WordPad, Notepad.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>1. If I do a different code, it just puts in the character I want. For example, if I do Alt-162, it brings up ó, whereas if I do Alt-175, instead of bringing up&nbsp;», it tries to bring me away from the page.</p>

            <p>When I use the on-screen keyboard, when I click the alt key, it is only depressed until another key is pressed, so I can only use one-digit alt codes. However, when I use my physical keyboard while the on-screen keyboard is open, there is no problem.</p>

<p>I also had this problem and I found that if I just finish typing the shortcut it would create the symbol I wanted in the url bar (I'm using Chrome). I just copied it from there and went back a page for the longest time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that for some reason I hit the number lock key on my keyboard (no idea how) but without number lock on it would redirect me to the about:blank page and with number lock on it would just make the symbol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alt+home brings you to your home page and 7 and home are on the same key for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is your problem but it was mine so hopefully this information will help.</p>

<h2>            Cannot move files - Windows says that folders are in use even though no programs running</h2>
                    I opened a file in Excel in a Dropbox folder. &nbsp;I closed the file and closed Excel. &nbsp;I am now trying to move the folder to another folder in Dropbox using Windows Explorer. However, Windows Explorer returns a box of the message that says "Folder in Use."
 The box says "the action can't be completed because the folder or a file and it is open in another program - close the folder or file and try again" and gives me two buttons that say "try again" and "cancel." &nbsp;However, I checked Task Manager and all of my
 programs are close – in particular, neither Microsoft Excel or Word are running. I also closed Dropbox and tried moving it in Windows Explorer without Dropbox open. Same result. I'm having the same exact issue with an external hard drive that will not safely
 removed because Windows thinks that a program that uses it is open. Please, does anyone have an easy way to fix this recurring annoyance? The only fix I know of is to restart Windows, which is a hassle and a waste o

    <title>Dual Monitor Setup - wrong resolution locked in when displaying on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordontwatts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual Monitor Setup - wrong resolution locked in when displaying on second monitor only</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 3, which when I sit at my desk I connect to a Samsung 1920x1200 monitor. It was been working just fine for quite a while. When I arrived this morning the resolution was down at 800x600. In retrospect, I think this had to do with a cable
 that was becoming disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suffice it to say, after playing for a while, I'm in a state that I can't use the setup. Here are the symptoms:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Works fine when the SP3 is on its own.</p>
<p>2. Works fine when I connect the monitor, and select duplicate or extend for the dual monitor setup.</p>
<p>3. When I select second screen only, the Samsung displays only white. Further, none of the menu options on the monitor itself work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to get #3 working again. I'm pretty sure this is because when I had the 800x600 display, I went into display settings, and selected 2160x1440. And somehow I must have accidentally hit something that said "this setup is ok", as it didn't revert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to get Windows 10 to forget the configuration for this second monitor so I can configure it from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I attempted to blindly configure it using the tab key, etc., but I wasn't able to get that to work. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!!</p>

</p><p>I've tried creating a userdump on the machine via the registry, but the dump doesn't actually get created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, tasklist and taskkill do not work on the machine, remotely via psexec or locally, and give "server execution failed" when attempting to run them. &nbsp;Visual C++ redistributables were not installed by default, but the latest versions have been installed,
 and the issue has continued</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be appreciated</p>

<p>No other changes aside from Windows updates have been made.</p>
<p>I've run chkdsk, sfc /scannow, attempted system restore (which fails with a generic error, despite AV being disabled), I've run dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to use procdump to determine the actual root of the crash, which has now caused explorer.exe to not restart when it does crash (user isn't too happy with that), along with adding the registry entry for having WER create a userdump, which has also
 not been successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run Malwarebytes on it, with nothing being found.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe boot aka Clean Boot is not going to help, as the user is running into the issue when moving files from her machine locally to OneDrive, and Safe Boot will prevent her from being able to have the appropriate services running.</p>

            <p>Oddly, this is happening even when not copying directly to OneDrive, user's Desktop/Documents/Favorites are linked within the profile to a local server and are not actually stored on the local computer's hard drive. &nbsp;When the user copies a number of files
 from a subfolder on the desktop to one under Documents, she has also experienced these crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other wrinkle that I can't figure out the cause, is that explorer.exe will not relaunch after it crashes, and even trying to run it from Task Manager causes the process to show up for a few seconds, and then close. &nbsp;Only running userinit from the Task
 Manager will relaunch explorer.exe with the Taskbar, Start menu and desktop view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to see if I can snag any more crash dumps, and see if it's all caused by OneDrive. &nbsp;Reading into crash dumps is not something I have any past experience with.</p>

<h2>            Print Processor Does Not Exist</h2>
                    I am currently using 64bit Windows 10 Pro and I want to connect a network printer. &nbsp;The printer worked fine until recently when I performed an update on the printer software and a major windows update. &nbsp;Now, when I try and set up the printer, I get an
 error saying "The print processor does not exist." &nbsp;I get this error when I use the printer software and when I use the Windows setup wizard. &nbsp;I checked the registry following instructions I found in other threads and the registry entry has winprint.dll and
 the winprint.dll file is in the correct place. &nbsp;I am not sure what else is the problem.

            What ended up working for me was when installing the printer it asks a question along the lines of "use existing driver or install new". &nbsp;Make sure to choose to install it new. &nbsp;Once I did so it worked as expected. &nbsp;Hope this helps.

<p>Caso o x-box seja roubado e o usuário tenha registrado na microsoft o console juntamento com o serial e a NF, tem possibilidade da microsoft bloquea-lo?<strong>(inutilizar o console - igual como é feito com celular)</strong></p>
