<h2>            Photos app malfunctioning</h2>
                    I have been using Windows 10 since the last month and this is the only problem from Windows' side yet. Anyways, when I try opening the Photos app from the Start menu, it, in the simplest words, just doesn't open. I have tried variations trying to launch
 the app but to no avail.
<p>START MENU</p>
<p>When I click on the tile, it pushes back owing to the animation but doesn't give any response. The app doesn't launch and it seems as though I didn't click the tile at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>APPS' LIST</p>
<p>I have tried opening photos from the apps' list; no use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CORTANA</p>
<p>Yes, I have also commanded Cortana to launch Photos. It recognises and executes my command by loading the app. But then the Cortana app closes, the way it normally does, but does not launch the Photos app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also rebooted my laptop and then tried all three again; it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Tell me an alternative to access my photos by the time you come up with a solution to open the app. I have tried doing so through File Explorer using the address you'll see in the screenshot below. Also, you must have noticed in the screenshot that a dialog
 box preaching some registry error opens every time I click on any file in the folder to view the photo. Please help me. I have some extremely important photos&nbsp;and screenshots that need to be printed urgently.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Shashwat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand that you are facing issues with the Photo app, start menu and Cortana. Be rest assured I am glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First lets run the Windows app troubleshooter and check if the Photo app can be restored.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue persist, I would suggest you to follow the suggestion below and check.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Type PowerShell in the search bar and click on run as Admin. </span></li><li><span>Type in the following command listed in the&nbsp; below under the <strong>‚ÄúRemove PowerShell Command‚Äù column
</strong>to remove the&nbsp;Photo app.</span></li><li><span><strong>get-appxpackage *Microsoft.Windows.Photos* | remove-appxpackage
</strong></span>&nbsp;</li><li><span>The app can be reinstalled using the Store App or by following the link listed in the table below.
</span></li><li><span>You will need to exit the Store app if it is already open before reinstalling the app.
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now lets try and fix the start menu and Cortana through&nbsp;PowerShell Command.&nbsp;</span><span>Please try the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows + X</strong> on your keyboard</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>task manager</strong></span></li><li><span>Click File &gt; Run New Task </span></li><li><span>Make sure you have a check mark beside ‚Äú<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges</strong>‚Äù
</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>Powershell </strong></span></li><li><span>Type the following in the Powershell prompt: <br />
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method A</span></strong><span>: Perform an SFC (System File Checker) scan on your system for any corrupted file settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows + X</strong> on your keyboard.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Command prompt admin</strong>.</span></li><li><span>At the command prompt type ‚Äú<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>‚Äù (no quotes), and then press ENTER.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this post helps. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help!</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for attending to my issue. I tried troubleshooting to yield no results. Now, I shall move on to the PowerShell solution. Before that, I must tell you that I just found out that the problem is exactly same with the Store app. Now I am thinking whether
 uninstalling the Photos app to reinstall it will be safe, since the last step includes downloading it again via Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help which I'll require once again.</p>

<h2>            Sat as away, but still active</h2>
                    What are the logical explanation when a person claim to have the mobile off and not using it at all, but on my Skype he is sat as away with "last activity 3 mins ago"? This was occuring over several days (5 mins ago, 20 mins and so on), where the phone
 was supposed to be off and he did not have any internet connection at that time. No computer back home either.<br />
<br />
On my Skype-app on mobile phone he was sat as "last seen &nbsp;x days ago".<br />
<br />
Can it be a bug? Does it imply that he was not where he was supposed to be?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
TIA

<h2>            My laptop is not producing audio, Can i please have some assistance&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My audio device is a "Conexant High Definition SmartAudio 221" its an integrated sound device, and i have tried just about everything. The weird part is the volume slider, audio mixer shows up and i can move the volume up and down. Whats even weirder is
 sometimes the mixer will show the green bars which indicate sound, but i cant hear anything whilst this phenomenon happens. I have grabbed the latest hp drivers but there may be newer, so far this is the newest driver i found.&nbsp;http://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp45001-45500/sp45166.exe
 The device in question is a laptop running Windows 10 64 bit, any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT 1.2: No, the sound does not work with headphones. It does with an external device, but i dont like bringing a bulky life support box with me. My father gave this to me as a graduation gift, he had a close friend build it and preconfigure it. When we
 got into contact with him about the sound issues he said "It was working when i was setting it up." Yes, i did run the troubleshooter, Many times infact. I have tried to find some drivers, still no dice. I have even disabled driver signature enforcement, still
 nothing. For more info you can pull up case number&nbsp;1391251672</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some device info: Its an HP G50 With a pentium processor.</p>

            I'm getting the same message (on Windows 8.1). &nbsp;This happens whether or not I'm shutting down completely or just trying to restart. &nbsp;By the way, I am running Acronis True Image 2014 (which does not seem to be working properly despite having received tech
 support from them when installing it). &nbsp;Is there a specific fix for this? &nbsp;I'm not technically proficient and am pretty frustrated. &nbsp;At this point in time, I don't know whether to contact Microsoft or Acronis to provide technical assistance. Thanks for any
 help you can offer.

            My webcam is back hours ago after restarting. I installed driver succesfully. After 3 hours, i heard "device was disconnected" sound and it's gone again.

            After again restarting it's working good. But in modern apps like camera and skype it's not working. It's working fine on desktop.

<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span><b>Right click</b> on your ‚ÄúWebcam‚Äù and then select ‚Äú<b>Uninstall</b>‚Äù.</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span> </span></span></span>Restart the computer for changes to take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now go to the manufacturer website of the webcam and install the webcam drivers and check with the issue.</p>

            Sounds like the device is well supported by its manufacturer under Windows 7 but not so supported by its manufacturer under Windows 8/8.1.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Contact the manufacturer and see if they plan on providing actual drivers and support for their device under the Windows 8/8.1 OS or if they are just going with the, "should work" theory...<br />

    <title>Mouse click capability lost - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse click capability lost</h2>
                    <p>I am helping my elderly neighbor with an unusual problem.&nbsp; He has a 4 year old Dell desktop running the latest version of Windows 10.&nbsp; After about 15 minutes of the computer being idle, the mouse click function dies (although the pointer still moves).&nbsp; Also,
 the keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+Alt+Del have no effect.&nbsp; Can't do anything other than press and hold the power button to reboot and start over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried new mouse, new keyboard, turned off screen saver -- problem still exists.&nbsp; I tried to reload Windows 10 via Media Creation tool, but the mouse clicker froze before the process got too far, so I had to abandon that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next steps?&nbsp; Any ideas would be most appreciated!</p>

<br />
<br />If you recently upgraded to a new version of Windows 10, there might be a compatibility issue.
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to run the manual Batch Command on resetting the Windows Update Components. This will clear not just the history, it will also do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reset the Windows Update</li><li>Rebuild the broken components</li><li>Re-register broken DLL system files</li><li>Remove the failing updates</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I have uploaded the batch command file on my <strong>OneDrive</strong>. Please click &nbsp;this
<strong><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Arb5kodhc6j2ig1ylBAp-qkkUEvt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to download the file.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, right click on the file and <strong>Run</strong> <strong>as</strong>
<strong>Administrator</strong>. Run the command twice and restart your computer. After the restart, you can now try on running the Windows Update again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you. Let me know if this doesn't work so we can have another resolution for you.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Pro 64, windows update&#47;defender&#47;firewall stopped working. Firewall gives me the error 0x6d9 . Defender gives me 0x80070424.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Windows 7 Pro 64, windows update/defender/firewall stopped working.
</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 Professional 64 bit installed, after the time of my last update on 7/31, my windows update stopped working, and so did windows defender and firewall.&nbsp; Firewall gives me the error 0x6d9 . Defender gives me 0x80070424.&nbsp; Windows update for
 7.31 was a defender update, however, windows update will not give me the option to uninstall that update since Defender has completely disappeared from the prompt that lets you pick what updates to uninstall. Is there a way to manually remove them somewhere
 else?<br />
<br />
I ran the SFC /scannow and it told me&nbsp; WAB32res.dll was corrupted, so I copied the file off of my windows 7 CD for professional 64 (from program files/common files) and copied and replaced my program.files/common files one.&nbsp; I reran SFC and the same error occurred.&nbsp;
 I had 5 errors just like this:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;2012-08-03 19:15:59, Info&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CSI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 000002fb [SR] Cannot repair member file [l:24{12}]"wab32res.dll" of Microsoft-Windows-WAB-Core, Version = 6.1.7600.16385, pA = PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE_AMD64 (9), Culture neutral, VersionScope = 1 nonSxS, PublicKeyToken
 = {l:8 b:31bf3856ad364e35}, Type neutral, TypeName neutral, PublicKey neutral in the store, hash mismatch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I also ran Microsoft Safety Scanner Scanner, it found 16 errors and fixed them (I saved the names)&nbsp; but even after i reset the computer my Windows update/defender/firewall STILL did not work!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas? Especially how to repair "wab32res.dll" maybe I saved it to the wrong location?
<br />
<br />
I noticed there are one in each "program file" folder (the program files x86 and regular one for 64 bit).&nbsp; Is wab32res.dll somewhere in system32 also?
<br />
<br />
Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Game clips not uploading to activity feed, or saving onto my captures. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the smithmaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game clips not uploading to activity feed, or saving onto my captures.</h2>
                    
<p>No matter what I try, game clips never upload to the activity feed. A notification pops up showing that it was recorded, but the clip disappears along with that notification. In the bottom right corner upon opening the notification, it shows the message
 "Uploading...0%" Giving it a few hours provides no success. Taking the clip into upload studio, whether its for editing or even trying to upload the clip from there, yields no success either. Displaying the message "Something went wrong, we were unable to
 upload your clip". Followed by it telling me to check my internet connection and try again. My internet is working perfectly fine, as I can play online and talk with friends during the same time as getting the message. My last clip that was saved was 27 days
 ago at the time of this post, meanwhile screenshots seem to upload perfectly fine. I have also recently come off of a communications ban on September 2nd, which is about a week from my last clip saved date.</p>

<h2>            Turned Cortana On and Lost Sound in Certain Programs</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and love it!&nbsp; I decided I would turn on the Cortana function today and play around with it.&nbsp; First it was looking for a microphone on my laptop.&nbsp; I do not have one installed.&nbsp; I followed the rest of the prompts and was exploring
 the functions.&nbsp; I exited Cortana and wanted to watch some Netflix.&nbsp; I opened up Edge and logged into Netflix and it would not play.&nbsp; It was working fine prior to today in Windows 10, edge.&nbsp; I opened up Google Chrome and logged onto Netflix and it worked fine.&nbsp;
 I did some exploring in other programs.&nbsp; I lost the Sound in my Spotify App.&nbsp; I lost the sound in my Steam App.&nbsp; I lost the sound in my Wild Tangent Game App.&nbsp; I open up iTunes and immediately a message pops up saying, "iTunes has detected a problem with your
 Audio Configuration.&nbsp; Audio / Video playback may not operate correctly."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked on all of the forums and haven't been able to fix my sound problem.&nbsp; I went into Cortana and turned it off.&nbsp; I checked all of my sound settings and audio driver and they all seem to be set correctly.&nbsp; Any assistance to get my sound back would be
 appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I say sound I mean internal lap top speakers as well as headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...</p>

<h2>            Windows defender</h2>
                    I was on a Ford forum site when up popped something about my Flash being outdated. Then up popped a notification box that Windows Defender had quarantined a Trojan virus. When I went to Windows Defender it says there's no threat and nothing in quarantine
 but the screen shot shows it is quarantined. I can't get to any place to remove the virus-if it is really there. Would somebody look at the screenshots and tell me what's going on? Thank you.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1a1b32e-ca1a-4ab0-9a4a-f6a2bd4797cc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1a1b32e-ca1a-4ab0-9a4a-f6a2bd4797cc?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/830d667f-ce16-427a-9fb2-63d242e83280?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/830d667f-ce16-427a-9fb2-63d242e83280?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20ee2755-4d22-450d-a014-509618bb52d7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20ee2755-4d22-450d-a0

<p>Never click on anything that pops up likes that. They are almost always malware. Run windows defender again and this time select Virus and Threat protection, Scan Now. Notice that the last scan was run yesterday. That should let you check the quarantined
 files and delete them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the free version of Malwarebytes as an added protection. It is run manually and can work with Defender.</p>
<p>https://www.malwarebytes.com/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit--to open quarantine--go to Virus Protection, Scan History.</p>

            I ran a full advanced scan-took 4 hours- and I'm still confused. It says no threats, no quarantined threats and no allowed threats BUT click on "see history" and voila-Trojans under quarantined threats and Trojans under allowed threats AND no button to
 click to remove them. Also ran Malwarebytes and NO threats found. Please tell me in "tech savvy as a rock" terms how to get rid of them-if they even exist.

</p><p>I have several directories shared on my local network. </p>
<p>When I access these directories from my mobile phone via SMB I have really bad transfer speeds of max. 2-3mb/s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is connected via a GBit switch to my router. </p>
<p>From my router I have around 150-300Mbit WiFi 5GHz connection to my mobile (depending where I am in my flat).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC was previously connected only with a 100Mbit switch when it was running Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back then I always had the full possible transfer speeds of about 10mb/s (limited by the 100Mbit connection).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have GBit connection to my router, though it's A LOT slower than before. That's
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>REALLY</strong></span> annoying!<br />
</p>
<p>So far I tried everything I could find that may solve this problem - without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was basically:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Turn Off Large Send Offloads</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Disable TCP AutoTuning &amp; Receive Side Scaling</p>
<p>
</p><p>And a few tiny tweaks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help to solve this issue is very appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 installed now sleep timers don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I installed the windows 10 upgrade over my windows 8. 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything went pretty well except.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the power settings for sleep and&nbsp;turning off monitor don't work at all. They are set turn off monitor at 10 minutes and sleep at 30 minutes. I tried setting these to other settings but makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They worked fine in windows 8.1 </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press the sleep button on my keyboard the system does go to sleep as it should and does com out of sleep just fine when I move the mouse or hit the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me solve this problem ?</p>
<p>

            <p>I have this same issue. When I close the lid on my laptop, it goes into sleep mode. However, when I open the lid, it doesn't come out of sleep mode. I have tried keys on the keyboard, clicking my touchpad, pressing the power button...nothing. I have to press
 and hold the power button and shut it completely off and then turn it back on again. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this issue?</p>

            I have exactly the same issue. It is definitely not a Driver problem, as I can manually enter the power save mode via the start button. Just the timers do not work.

<h2>            Upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 7 has made my laptop unusable</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 from Windows 7 yesterday, 28th July, and it has been a complete disaster, it is completley unusable. I did my desktop at the same time but that has worked with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the timeline of events. I need help quickly, if anyone is able to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After completing the laptop Windows 10 upgrade&nbsp; installation, I went into Windows and all of my programs and settings were there, but after about 30 seconds all of the</p>
<p>icons started dissappearing and then reappearing. If I was in the middle of something, he work that I was doing wold dissappear at the same time.</p>
<p>Eventually, I could not even log into windows on the laptop. I just get a blue screen with teh disk light going mad.</p>
<p>I can get into it in safe mode.</p>
<p>When in safe mode it still displays the same effect of blinking off and then blinking back on again every 20 seconds or so, but this time there is a message that says:</p>
<p><strong>This app cannot open</strong></p>
<p><strong>Get started can't be opened by the built-in administrator account. Sign in with a different user and try again.</strong></p>
<p>So I created a new user and logged in with that (in safe mode) but then got this message:</p>
<p><strong>You'll need a new app to open this ms-get-started.</strong></p>
<p>But then nothing happened and no instructions. I spent about 4 hours reading what others had written about this, within MS Community,about creating non-admin users and then copying files from the admin to the new user. But none of it made sense. They said
 copy all files across except these three, but I could not find those three, so I gave up on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then decided teh best course of action was to revert back to Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in Advanced Recovery Options, I did as the Microsoft instructions say and clicked "Go back to Previous Build" but then received message:</p>
<p><strong>We ran into a problem and wont be able to take you back to your previous build</strong></p>
<p>So that was a dead end</p>
<p>So then, as I cant access Windows 10, I went back into Safe Mode and tried to Click Update and Security, which would have given me the option to go back to Windows 7, but when I clicked it, it just dissapeared and did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the end result is that I am totally stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the Microsft chatline and after an hour they said they could not help. They gave me a Microsoft telephone number to ring in the UK, but that will not accept technical fault calls, unless you pay. My laptop is completely unusable, just because Microsft
 persuaded me to upgrade to Winows 10, but Microsft are not doing anything to help me resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas welcome</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the questions below to assist you better.</p>
<p>- What exactly do you mean, when you say "get a blue screen with teh disk light"?</p>
<p>- At the time of installation, did you receive any prompt to create an account?</p>
<p>If yes, did you create Microsoft account or Local account?</p>
<p>- How did you upgrade to Windows 10, is it through Windows update or using ISO file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not created any account, then Windows will create an temporary account. In temporary account you will not be able to use/perform any activities.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;suggest you to update&nbsp;display drivers in safe mode with networking.</p>
<p>Refer the link below: <strong>Troubleshoot screen flickering in Windows 10</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Since you can get into Safe Mode, please work through the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-install-integrity-checklist/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">

<p>
</p><p>But keep in mind that the Upgrade is an inferior install which like a Factory Install most tech enthusiasts would never run in the first place.&nbsp; You can have a vastly better install if you follow

            <p>Hi Kiran,</p>
<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1) the blue screen means exaclty waht it says, when I power up, I get a gren Microsoft flag momentary, with a rotating circle below it. Then teh green flag dissapears and I am presented with just a blank blue screen - nothing else. None of tehfunction keys
 work. Alt, control, delete does not work, so I cant go into task manager. Nothing works. But the disk activity light is flickering, suggesting that there is some activity in the laptop.</p>
<p>2) There were no requests, atthe time of installation, to create an account</p>
<p>3) I upgraded using the teh standard windows 10 upgrade request that has been pestering me for teh last year. It stated that it had analsysed my laptop and it was compatible and ready to migrate. I have no idea what an ISO file is.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the display drivers were not compatible with Windows 10, why did teh Microsft message tell me that it had anakysed my PC and it was compatible and reday to migrate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have delayed upgrading to Windows 10 becasue the previous version, Windows 8 was so aweful, and i could not risk any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have followed my instincts and not done this upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you read my original post properly you can see where the issue is. It tells me when I open in safe mode:</p>
<p><strong>This app cannot open</strong></p>
<p><strong>Get started can't be opened by the built-in administrator account. Sign in with a different user and try again.</strong></p>
<p>I dont understand how this can be mistaken for the need to perform a driver upgrade<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont have time to mess about trying things that might work or might not<strong>.
</strong>My time is too precious.</p>
<p>I need to use the laptop urgently today as it is used to manage very important golf tournamenets in the UK. I have a rpiority job due now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only solution is to go and buy a new laptop at PC World and get them to migrate all of teh files from teh old one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first job today will be to get the Microsoft support to ring me from the Microsoft contact us page</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just a complete disaster</p>

            <p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read teh link that you provided for Windows 10 install Integrity Checklist and thsi talks about using this list if you have performance problems. I dont have performance problems. I just can not get Windows 10 to start at all. So most of the checklist
 will be irrelevant (unless of course it is mistitled)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont see how&nbsp; can run the Clean Windows Install from Safe Mode given that the install needs to interact with me as a user and even teh Safe Mode does not work at the moment as it keeps being interrupted by teh message that I have described, at which point
 nothing works until I close the message down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious qustion is - if you get a problem reported every few minutes with the Windows 10 Upgrade every few minutes, why havent Microsoft done something about it. Why did they say they had analysed my laptopn and it was compatible and ready. Why dont
 they instead tell everyone to use teh Clean Windows Install instead. Then there would not be any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a laptop that is completely useless. I cant get into Windows at all. All of teh suggested potential solutions are just that "potenbtial" and will take hours or days to work through, with no guarantee of success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the laptop now as I have important work to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be quicker to go out and buy&nbsp; new laptop from PC World, get them to tranbsfer all of the files and then throw the old one away. This will qlso be cheaper in terms of teh use of my time. It might cost ¬£500 but that is cheaper than me spending hours
 chasing my tail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all Microsoft's fault</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just followed their recommendations and procedures for the upgrade to the letter. None of this is therefore my fault, but I am the one who is having to suffer</p>
<p>

But it's just as likely this is a false error forced by a corrupt install.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are trying to do an in-place Upgrade which is an inferior install that like a factory install most tech enthusiasts would never run in the first place.&nbsp; It is dependent upon the condition of the old install and the anomalies of a million different combinations
 of hardware - unlike a phone or I-device upgrade which only has the one hardware set to worry about.&nbsp;&nbsp; It does work in about 99.99% of cases which is not reassuring I realize to the other .01%.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you actually read <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10</a> it illustrates how to boot the media to clear all partitions and avoid the disk junkyard many have built up.&nbsp; It is a vastly better install than the Upgrade, and even better than buying a new PC which will be larded with bloatware
 that throttles Windows by up to half.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are steps in the link also to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">

            <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help. I am not having a go at you, but at Microsoft, who are entirely responsible for this debacle and disaster</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just spent 7 hours on the phone to Microsft support, who could not find any method of resolving this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have provided me with a clean version of windows 10 to reinstall, like you advised, but, only then, explained that this would destroy all of my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They did this via my desktop computer, whereby the upgrade from 7 to 10 was successful.
</p>
<p>(Though there are things that I did not like such as - it got rid of my bqckground image, it automatically made me have to provide a password, which I did not have to do in Windows 7, and I cant find Notepad anywhere in the list of programs. This is essential
 for the web development work that I do. I just cant find it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS support could not take over my laptop, in order to a thorough daignosis, as, for some reason, the safe mode will not allow any networking (it just can not see the networking hardware in the computer), even when entering safe mode with networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we had to go through the painful process of them explaining everything to me over the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then discovered that it is impossible to copy and save my files, as every time the error message appears, every 10 seconds or so, it wipes out any tasks that I am undertaking. So it is impossible to select any files to copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whicn means that it is not possible to undertake that clean install until this is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also we could not find any way of finding my Outlook files to copy them across. I could not even find the Outlok .pst files from within the Safe Mode list of files, in order to copy them. There is very valuable information in my saved emails, which I would
 not wish to lose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There aren't any hidden admin users, but the message does clearly apply to an admin user, although probably spurious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would have been quicker and cheaper to go to PC world and buy a new laptop and get them to copy the files across. My time is far more valuable than the price of a laptop. I have now spent all day yesterday, and today, doing nothing but grappling with
 this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that the support assistant did admit was that my laptop is not on the list of those tested for Windows 10 (It is a Dell Inspiron N5050)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I asked why then did Microsoft's invitation to upgrade specifically state that they had checked my PC and it was compatible with Windows 10 and ready to upgrade, she would not answer this question!. It is clear that Microsft deliberately lied to me
 with their statement. They could not possibly have checked my laptop, like they claimed to have done, before telling me to migrate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can understand I am very unhappy</p>
<p>
</p><p>But again, thankyou for your help</p>

            <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am even more stuck now. I followed your advice to copy the files using the Advanced Startup Options, (I must have been in here 50 times over the past couple of days), as per your screendump, but when I clicked Send to having selected a folder, nothing
 appeared in the device list - it is just a blank box - so cant select memory stick, CD or anything to save the files onto.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is clear that my Windows 10 safe mode is not recognising any devices. It just gets worse! This is also why it probably does not recognise the network devices</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another session booked with Microsft Support (Level 2) tomorow.</p>

</p><p>I gave you the steps to both rescue your files and do the vastly superior <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10</a> using the booted Windows 10 media provided, so you didn't need to lose anything and would have had a much better install than any store or Support can give.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending upon if they had you boot the installation media to clear the drive&nbsp; - which is how to get an install cleanest - there may still be a C:\Windows.old folder in which is archived your entire previous install including User files.&nbsp; If not then you
 should have been able to rescue your files using one of the methods given in the Clean Install wiki had you chosen it instead of a MS Support agent reading from a script.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I already said, I cant download any third party solutions to the laptop, as it will not recognise any of it's networking hardware in Safe Mode, even if I start Safemode with Networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am stuck with what is available as left over and visible in Safemode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just tried your suggestion of Copy &amp; Paste - in Windows Recovery Console and that did not work because that is targeted at Windows 7 and I am stuck in Windows 10. So when I click on "Repair your computer" I see a complately different console, which
 does not lead to the&nbsp; Copy and Paste feature.</p>
<p>

<h2>            PC stuttering</h2>
                    <p>About a hour ago my pc started to stutter, whenever I move the mouse it freezes for a half a second, to where you notice it. I'm not sure what the cause is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/c1KOBlYhHYU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://youtu.be/c1KOBlYhHYU</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/c1KOBlYhHYU?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/c1KOBlYhHYU?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>The video shows some stuttering. I would appreciate some tips on how to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A side note, I dont think it was a resource issue, since task manager shown 20-30 percentages on the CPU and graphics card. other than that I do not know.</p>

            It's the same as it's been since Windows 95:&nbsp; the StartUp folder would not show AVG in any older systems either.&nbsp; That's why there's the alternative.<br />
<br />
Type the word <strong>msconfig</strong> into your Start menu, then press Enter.&nbsp; Just like Windows 95 through XP: this will let you uncheck Startup items.<br />

            How did you solve it? I can't finds Edge anywhere, but if I run the command prompt as administrator it pops up with the tabs I was using, but I can't find it again if I open, for example, IE. I can find not trace of the program and the window is gone!

<h2>            User profile sharing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my friend added his account to my PC and now I have 2 accounts on my computer. We don‚Äôt share one PC, he has his own. He has a bunch of stuff installed on his account which, from what I see, take up a lot of space on my computer. Now the question
 is: if I delete his account from my PC, will it not clear his whole account data back on his PC at home? I don‚Äôt want to accidentally delete his whole account, only remove it from my PC to free up space.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Seba
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Deleting it from your local computer will not delete it elsewhere. 
<br />
<br />During the deletion process, it will ask you if you want to delete data thats also on the computer.

<h2>            Zune HD and WP7 USB mass storage connection support</h2>
                    <p>MS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you answer and tell me to network share files: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/support/surface-with-windows-rt/files-folders-and-online-storage/share-files-on-a-home-network?lc=1033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/support/surface-with-windows-rt/files-folders-and-online-storage/share-files-on-a-home-network?lc=1033</a>&nbsp;can you please comment on WHY and IF support on this front is missing/under consideration for the Surface RT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a ZuneHD. It is an ARM based Windows CE device. I have a Surface RT, an ARM based Windows RT device. Why cannot the two talk to each other - even just for file transfer between the 2 via USB?&nbsp;Can MS add USB file transfer support for these devices?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WP8 handsets are supported with a Windows Store App for USB connection - and yet WP7 users AND ZuneHD owners have no quick/simple USB support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crazy. I know the way of the future is cloud connected, however am at a loss as to why these recent devices are not supported. AFAIK it's as simple as an ARM compiled Driver to allow USB connection and file transfer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surely this is not too hard????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sheeds.</p>

            Greetings Sheeds,<br />
<br />
The Surface with Windows RT doesn't support Zune software, which is what Windows Phone 7x and Zune device both use. I can put in a feature request for you to see if the Product Team will acknowledge it and create Zune for Windows RT, however it seems that everything
 is pointing towards Xbox Music. <br />
You may be better off waiting for the Surface with Windows 8 Pro as it is x86 based and will allow .exe files to be installed such as Zune.
