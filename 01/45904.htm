<h2>            Restore OneDrive device backup settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently performed a full reinstallation of my Surface Pro (not just a refresh). All the sync options for OneDrive were checked and I have a save on OneDrive from the day before the restore.</p>
<p>When I did this previously, it restored all me settings and my tiles on the metro UI and I just needed to click them to reinstall the apps.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this time around, my apps were in the app list but not the tiles...</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive has the backup for the device with my start screen tile settings so I was wondering how I could restore this to my Surface? Or will I have to rearrange the start screen myself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a2dcd18-c999-4baa-9533-8d9757b29863" /></p>
<p>I think my current settings are saved in the fourth one down, but I'd like to restore those from the fifth one but I can't see any other option than deleting them... (they were both from the same device running Windows 8.1 Update 1)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would ask you to manually pin the apps to the start screen and enable the ‘turn live tile on’ option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Steps:</em></p>
<p>a. Go to the ‘all apps’ screen.</p>
<p>b. Right click on the app you want to see on the start screen and select “pin to start’.</p>
<p>c. Go back to the start screen and right click on the tiles and select ‘turn live tile on’.</p>

    <title>why my media keys &#40;media, stop&#47;pause, next, prev&#41; on my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> desprate lee  say:</h3>
<h2>            why my media keys &#40;media, stop&#47;pause, next, prev&#41; on my keyboard only work for windows media player and not for other music players software &#40;such as iTunes&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, I need some help here.</p>
<p>I recently updated my bluetooth and sould driver and some wired things happens to my media keys on my keyboard.</p>
<p>The media keys(media, stop/pause, next, prev) which are fn+ f9-12 respectively dont work for any third party desktop media players such as iTunes and qq music. However, when I add some songs from my files to the windows media player, they work perfectly
 fine.</p>
<p>So I know there is nothing wrong with hardware. Also, another wired thing is when I press fn+f9, which is the media key, it shows a window that "the assigned command is not available, please reassign it," when I click next, it will direct lead to the MS
 mouse and keyboard center and then a wired keyboard 600 setting on the keyboard tab. However, the thing is I dont have a MS keyboard, certainly not this one, since I am using a logitech wireless keyboard. I do have a MS touch mouse though, thats why I have
 the MS mouse and keyboard center.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me here with my situation, I always keep a clean computer and I am sure there is no extension or addon that will lead to this and the media keys worked just fine before the updates. So I would appreciate it if someone could show me how to
 make the media keys work on every media software ( used to work to switch songs, movies, and even youtube vedios on webpages) instead of just the windows media player?</p>
<p>Thanks again for the time and help, cheers!</p>

            It's up to your computer manufacturer, and how they implemented the media keys on the keyboard. &nbsp;You may be able to solve it by installing (or updating) the software your manufacturer provides for those buttons, but there's no global standard. &nbsp;If the
 company that built those keys didn't design them to send signals to iTunes, then there's not a way to force it.

            <p>HI, Shawn Keene:</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and reply. My desktop is manufactured by Acer and I went to the Acer support website and select my model, which is Aspire AT3-605-UR21, and to my understanding, the only thing that might has somwthing to do with this a software called
 Hotkey Utility. I downloaded it and found it completely useless.</p>
<p>For my keyboard, it is a logitech and &nbsp;I have the SetPoint, but the only option for the media key are "Windows media player 12" and " windows player 8."</p>
<p>So I really dont know what to do now&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: I also disable my WMP, which did not help.</p>

            Yup, I'm familiar with Acer (I own two of their laptops) and their Hotkey utility. &nbsp;But as you found, it can't control iTunes. &nbsp;Unfortuantely there's not option around this unless they update their utility to send those commands.

<h2>            After a clean install of Windows 8 I cannot get three monitors to work</h2>
                    <p>I have performed a clean install of Windows 8 pro.&nbsp; I have a Dell T1500 with a Firepro V4800 video card.&nbsp; This machine formerly had Windows 7 installed and functioned with ATI driver.&nbsp; With Windows 7 the three monitors worked without a problem.&nbsp; Now, with
 Windows 8 installed I can only get two monitors to work.&nbsp; I am using the most up to date Windows 8 driver for the card from the AMD site.&nbsp; The third monitor can be seen on the Screen Resolution page but I cannot "Extend desktop..." over to the third one.&nbsp;
 When I attempt to do so it gives me a message saying </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The display settings could not be saved.&nbsp; Please try a different combination of display settings."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three monitors are the same, Dell P2210.&nbsp; I have tried different resolutions. I have tried the driver I was using on Windows 7, I have uninstalled the adapter and drivers multiple times.&nbsp; I have installed just the drivers from AMD with the extras (hydravision,
 etc.).&nbsp; I have used just the default Windows drivers. I have switch the placement of the monitors on the video card but no matter where I plug them in, only two will work.&nbsp; All monitors are operational.&nbsp; I have even tried different monitors.&nbsp; All of this with
 no results.&nbsp; I have tried using the Catalyst Control Center.&nbsp; It sees the third monitor but simply shows it as being disabled with no way to enable it that I can see from within the Catalyst Control Center.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
This is the final hurdle for me to full use this Windows 8 machine.&nbsp; I am stumped.&nbsp; I have read many other forums.&nbsp; I have heard of this problem with Windows 7 as well so I don't know that it is specific to 8 but very well could be.&nbsp; Again, I had Windows 7
 with three monitors with the same card.&nbsp; Help with this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>I have experienced this issue on a Lenovo three monitor setup using the built in laptop display, one monitor off of the mini HDMI, and a third monitor off of the HDMI from the OneLink Port Replicator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end it was a simple fix. &nbsp;When accessing the display settings, all three monitors defaulted to 1920x1080 and the configuration could never be saved - however the 3rd monitor only actually supports 1680x1050 which was the (Recommended) Resolution.
 &nbsp;After changing the 3rd monitor to the Recommended Resolution I was able to save the configuration in Display &gt; Screen Resolution without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why the unsupported resolution was defaulted to - after selecting the correct one there is now no option to go to the higher unsupported resolution on that monitor.</p>

<p>I've recently installed Windows 7. The microphone worked well. Except that I got told that the quality my voice was being sent in was really low. So I tried to find new drivers and look up the problem. Now instead of having the voice being low-quality I
 can't get my microphone to detect my voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked through the different sound settings making sure that the&nbsp;microphone&nbsp;is not muted. The listening part of the headset works, it's just the mic that doesn't work. It is not that Windows 7 doesn't detect the device, that it does, it's just that
 the mic part doesn't work.</p>
<p>The headset is an:&nbsp;<span>CREATIVE HS-1000 HEADSET FATAL1TY USB</span></p>
<p><span><span>Please tell me if there is any other information that you need, and I will try to give it to you.</span></span></p>

            Alright, allow me to try to giving some more information:
<div><br />
<div>I've tried to uninstall all drivers and then try to install them again. The problem lies in the automatic update, even though I've disabled the automatic update windows 7 automaticly installs drivers that doesn't work. I've tried to find where on my harddrive
 they store these drivers, I've found them, but windows doesn't allow me to uninstall them. I'm also worried it has something to do with the old windows installation "Windows.old" map. I've tried to uninstall this as well, but it won't allow me, although I'm
 the administrator of the system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've tested the headset on other computers, it works on them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've tried installing a lot of different drivers, ranging from new modercard drivers to sounddrivers, doesn't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is what I found when i checked the "dxdiag command":</div>

<p>Hi LivinDaDream,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, to set QoS marking to Skype for Business on specific devices using Group Policy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Create Group Policy: Group Policy Management console under your domain&gt;Group Policy Objects&gt;Create New Group Policy Object (enter a name).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Edit the policy and you need edit and create 3 separate QoS policies (voice, interactive and default): Computer Configuration&gt;Policies&gt;Windows Settings&gt;Policy-based QoS&gt;Create new policy&gt; add name
 according to the policy you are setting up (for example "voice")&gt;add value according to the following table&gt;Leave ‘Specify Outbound Throttle Rate’ unchecked&gt;Next&gt; ‘Only applications with this executable name: lync.exe'&gt;Select ‘Any Source IP Address’ and ‘Any
 Destination IP Address’&gt;Select ‘TCP and UDP’ and ‘From this source port number or range’&gt;enter the value (50000 - 50019 for voice, 50020-50039 for interactive and 50040 - 50059 for default).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Apply GPO to your Windows laptops: Navigate to your OU that contains your laptops&gt;choose 'link and Existing GPO'&gt;select the GPO created before&gt;restart to let the policy to be applied.</p>

<h2>            desktop icons had disappeared,could not minimize, nor restore down the browser and other issues</h2>
                    <p>OT:</p>
<p>Strange update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi all, so, I updated &nbsp;my computer from windows 7 to 10. At first, my windows 10 wouldn't work, and would crash every time I logged in. I reverted and switched back to 10 after a few days. For roughly a month, it worked like a charm, my computer seemed to
 run exceptionally well. Then I noticed that my desktop icons had disappeared, and to the left of my screen, sat three icons, one depicting a power button, below that, one depicting a small list, and in the top left corner, one with three white lines. The latter
 brought me to what was previously the windows button's function. The one with the small list thing brought me to all of my applications, and the windows button served as a transition to the desktop.</p>
<p>Now, these aren't very interesting, nor are they concerning really, just questionable. (Bear in mind that once this started happening, I ran a scan, and checked all of the most recent updates, only to find nothing, really.) So, I next opened up internet
 explorer, or 'edge', because, street cred for Microsoft. I found that I could not minimize, nor restore down the browser, which was odd. After about 10 - 30 seconds of snooping around on the edgy browser, it exited to desktop. Not closed, mind you, but just
 exited to the desktop. The 'action bar' or what have you at the bottom of the screen cleared, then returned, while this was happening. Oh, and I also can't click on the desktop. Anyway, I opened up more and more applications, same thing. Every ten to thirty
 seconds, the application randomly quits to the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to go to the control panel, thinking that I might be able to... Do... Something... I don't know, but when I opened it, it flashed on the screen for a moment, before (of course) exiting to the desktop. But this was different, this time, I could
 see all of my desktop icons flash for a split second, (mind you, they had previously fully disappeared) I tried a few more times to open the control panel, but every time was unwillingly greeted by the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, all in all, this is not really so much as a real problem as it is a persistent nuisance. For instance, writing this, my browser has cut to the desktop maybe fifty times... And it really sucks. I can't watch movies also.</p>
<p>Anyway, if anyone anywhere could perhaps take the time to help, or read this, for that matter, that would be really be helpful.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Keyboard is phantom pressing number nine</h2>
                    Hi. This is the first time I've experienced this on Windows 10. Yesterday I noticed that my number 9 (the one with the page up command) on the keypad of my keyboard doesn't work, then today, it would randomly input "999999999999999999999999999999999999999"
 into fields until I press some other key like backspace or another letter or number. It would also randomly use the page up command. When I press the numlk key, instead of 999999s appearing, it would just do the page up command. Actually, as I'm typing this,
 the 999999999999s would come up and it's just very annoying. I checked and all my drivers are updated but the issues persists. I have an Asus X541U Intel Core i3-7100U 64-bit 4GB Windows 10 version 1803 (updated on October 21, 2018).

            Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall 
<br />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
From where are you trying to install the XP mode?
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> Place the computer in clean boot and check whether you are able to install Windows XP mode.</div>
<div><br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Follow <strong>step 7</strong> to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.

<h3> bob6592  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC using Vista Home Premium keeps locking up forcing me to power down using the power button. Also, with not shut down on it own.</h2>
                    Everytime I use computer it locks up after a while - sometime a few minutes other time after an hour or more. When trying to shut down it gets to the stage "Windows is shutting down" but never shuts down - I have to manually power the machine off.
<br />
<br />
I recently had a new hard drive installed in my Toshiba U405 laptop at a Toshibe service station that reinstalled the operating system with service pack 1.
<br />
<br />
I am not receiving error messages computer just stops responding. <br />
<br />
I tried installing Service Pack 2 and the update readiness tool but system stopped responding during the installation.

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Check if the issue duplicates in safe mode. If the issue still occurs in the safe mode, then probably it could be an issue with the hard drive itself. Then I suggest
 you to contact the Manufacturer. If the issue does not occur in safe mode, do a clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>A)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span>Start the computer in the Safe Mode.
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly,
 or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. If a problem does not reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers as possible causes. If a recently installed program, device, or driver prevents
 Windows from running correctly, you can start your computer in safe mode and then remove the program that is causing the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To start in Safe Mode so the following steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp; Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp; Do one of the following:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• If your computer has a single operating system installed, keep tapping the F8 key as your computer
 restarts. You need to tap F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating
 system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option
 you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe mode).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.&nbsp; Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display.
 To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check

</span></span></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Clean boot</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set
 of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot.</span></span></p>

</span>Perform clean boot (Check the link for Performing clean boot)</span></span></p>

</span>Enable half of the startup items</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Determine whether the problem returns</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat the above steps until you find out which service or program is causing the issue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer
 to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the step 7 from the article
</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span><span>

<p>
<strong><span><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>i)<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>ii)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></p>

    <title>Harddrive not detected after shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Harddrive not detected after shutdown</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a new computer ( Asus H81M-R/C/SI motherboard )&nbsp;with an old&nbsp;SATA 1 hard-drive, after I do shutdown ( from Start Menu or a full shutdown with shutdown /s ) the&nbsp;hard drive is not detected at first system boot.
</p>
<p>If I turn off the computer and start it again, it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem does not appear if I choose "Hibernate" in Windows.</p>
<p>In ASUS BIOS it does not have an option to set SATA delay, to wait for hard drive a few seconds more, but at power on in the first second the case the hard-drive is not detected the computer is very silent.</p>
<p>When it works ( at the 2nd attempt ), I hear the sound of the hard-drive very fast after pressing the Power on button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

                    <p>Hello. This is my first time posting in a forum. I have just redeemed my free copy of Fallout 3 that came with Fallout 4 when I bought it 2 years ago. It is not expired because it downloaded and successfully installed. When I go to play the game it says I do not own the game.</p><p><br /></p><p>I called Xbox support and was working with them for hours and tried everything. It even plays on my Xbox 360. I don't know why it won't work. Has anybody else had this problem? If so, what did you do to get it to work?</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>In some laptops, the Wireless has to be switched On first in the BIOS.</p>
<p>In others there is a Physical switch, and in many it is a combination of pressing Fn + F4 (or other combo).</p>
<p>While I have few laptops, I do not have a Gateway. Read your Laptop manual there should be there instructions about how to switch On the Wireless.</p>
<p>--------------<br />
From Windows perspective (when the Wireless is physically on).</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wire card entry.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a><br />
<br />
If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wire card's Drivers.</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>Try to install the latest drivers of the card from the support page of the&nbsp; manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Download the drivers and unpack them to a folder of your choice.<br />
<br />
In the Device manger, right click on the adapter.<br />
<br />
Click on Update Drivers, and choose the Browse my computer for drivers, <br />
<br />
Choose let me pick from a list, Click on&nbsp; Have a Disk and point to the folder with the Drivers.<br />
-------------------------------------</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Local Area Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Log to the Router's menu from a working computer and make sure that the DHCP is On and it is configured to assign IPs that can cover the number of computer that are connected (few more will be even better).<br />
<br />
Switch Off the computer and the Router, Reboot the Router, and the computer.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><strong>On IP status.</strong> <br />
<br />
TCP/IP and its variables typically look like this.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.<br />

<br />
<strong>Description</strong> is the card manufacturing data.<br />
<strong><br />
Physical address</strong> is the card's MAC number.<br />
<br />
The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).<br />
<br />
yy should be from 0 to 255<br />
<br />
zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.<br />
<br />
<strong>The lease date</strong> should be valid to the current time.<br />
<strong><strong><br />
*Note 1.</strong> IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>*Note 2.</strong> There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>Also Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called
 the Trusted Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled)</strong> . If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic.
 If the 3rd party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>

    <title>Empty but full folders in Windows.old after upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjago  say:</h3>
<h2>            Empty but full folders in Windows.old after upgrading to Windows 10 and connecting an existing Microsoft account to my local account.  Local account files now gone or hidden.</h2>
                    <p>Situation: &nbsp;the folder in "Windows.old&gt;Users&gt;sanjiv" (that's me) seems to have 730 mb of data in it, but then the sub folders within it appear to be empty (my specific interest in in the documents folder). &nbsp;This folder was just created today when I upgraded
 form Windows 7 to 10 (ultimate to pro, respectively), and connected my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have copied the folder onto my desktop, and that folder still has the same problems. &nbsp;It still has&nbsp;1,824 Files, 258 Folders, and takes up 730 mb of space, but again, appears to be filled with empty folders. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempt to de-select the folder's attribute option for "Read-only (only applies to files in folder)," &nbsp;but this does not appear to help any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a migration xml file in&nbsp;"Windows.old&gt;Users&gt;sanjiv". &nbsp;I copied its contents below, in case it reveals what the problem is. Other than folders or shortcuts, it's the only actual file I could find.</p>
<p>
&lt;Objects&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;Object Type="System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject"&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Property Name="Source Path" Type="System.String"&gt;C:\windows.old\users&lt;/Property&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Property Name="Source User" Type="System.String"&gt;Sanjiv&lt;/Property&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Property Name="Destination User" Type="System.String"&gt;Sanjiv&lt;/Property&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Property Name="Files Processed" Type="System.Int32"&gt;0&lt;/Property&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;/Object&gt;<br />
&lt;/Objects&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>The C:/Windows.old folder itself is about 32 gb. &nbsp;I tried de-selecting the read only attribute for it and its subfolders as well, but this did not seem to solve my problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this folder has files in it. &nbsp;How do I actually see those files?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This should be normal that your Windows.old should have folders/files/... and to have some size in it. That contains your old Windows with the drivers and softwares you had in your old
 windows. And it will show for like 30 days then it would delete itself automaticly. If you still have your "Windows.old" folder in your OS partition that means you could revert back to your windows 7 how it was before the upgrade to windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So! you can leave that for now there and if in case you don't want to use Windows 10 anymore you can go back to your previous Windows xx</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); margin-left: 30px">
Here is how you revert to the previously installed OS.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); margin-left: 30px">
1. Go to&nbsp;<em>Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery.</em></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); margin-left: 30px">
2. Look for the&nbsp;<em>Go back to Windows XX</em>&nbsp;entry which will say either 7 , 8 or 8.1 depending on your former OS.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now if you passed those 30 days, you can't do this anymore, beside installing your windows from scratch.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you, but you missed the key detail: &nbsp;I cannot see my files within Windows.old. &nbsp;The sub folders within contain 0 documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here's an update: I reverted back to Windows 7, and this caused more problems.</p>
<p>1) Windows.old was gone, and so were the files that were theoretically hidden within Windows.old&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I'm now running into errors when I try and upgrade back up to Windows 10 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that my user name was still my MS account name, and not the name that the local account initially had. &nbsp;I figure that this name-change is what caused this major disconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless. &nbsp;Those files are now lost, AND I can't seem to upgrade back up to Windows 10... Ouch. &nbsp;Those are two major burns back to back.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No i didn't miss it. I just mostly skip over it as from my point of view should be ok. I don't see them either, and I don't have any problem with it as when I moved on Windows 10 I checked to keep my data. ( when you were asked to upgrade to windows 10 all
 your documents , music, video ... and all other from <strong>My Documents</strong> were moved in your new documents of windows 10. You just had to look for them if you had any )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now about the errors you say that you get now after you went back on Windows 7.</p>
<p>&gt; To your ( 1 ) first error . The missing Windows.old folder. That should be normal as Windows.old folder is now your current Windows folder. ( any files of windows 10 should have been deleted ).</p>
<p>&gt; About the error ( 2 ) you are writing I am not familiar with as I don't know what error it is. But you should be able to upgrade back to Windows 10 again if you want to do that in the close future ( till the end of free upgrade mentioned by Microsoft ).</p>
<p>- So ! If you could manage to come back with the error you have when you try to upgrade again,,, you might get a better answer on how to upgade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving to your MS account name ( username ) and password. In Windows 7 removing that should be easier to do than in Windows 10 as people has worked thru that "problem" more than on the new windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link on how to do that ( link if made for Windows 8, But it should work for windows 7 too )</p>

            <p>My problem was that *some* files didn't make the jump to Windows 10, and I believed I'd find them in windows.old, but couldn't seem to get at them there. Interestingly, some files *did* make the jump. &nbsp;I.e. I noticed wall-paper images in my pictures folder
 were still there (which allowed me to revert back to the old desktop image), and my video folder contents were also intact. &nbsp;I believe that because many of my old files did remain exactly where they were supposed to be, I made all the appropriate selections
 during the upgrade process to keep my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other details were not problems. &nbsp;The only problem is that some files didn't make the jump to Windows 10, and I was hoping to recover them from within Windows.old &gt; user &gt; Documents, or wherever that documents folder was. &nbsp;I was looking for a way to
 see into the Windows.old folder, since other instructional sources suggested I could freely copy and paste files out of there.</p>

            If you do think to upgrade again to Windows 10 I'd suggest to make a backup first and/or if you have other partitions than ( :C ) OS partition, you should move your files from :C to :D for example or any other partition you have. &nbsp;That way you don't have
 to look for them after upgrade as they won't be in your windows partition. You will find them in the partition you moved &nbsp;them ( like partition :D ).

<p>************** JIT Debugging **************<br />
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this<br />

jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.<br />
The application must also be compiled with debugging<br />

<br />
1. When exactly do you get the pop-up?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />

<h2>            Printer Causes Windows 10 Computers to Not Stay in Sleep Mode</h2>
                    <p>After receiving a new HP OfficeJet 7740 MFD device, I cannot keep either computer in Sleep Mode while the 7740 is turned on and the USB cable is plugged in! The computers will go into Sleep Mode for around two seconds and then wake up. I have tried toe of
 the 7740s and both do the same thing. None of my other HP printers cause this problem---a PhotoSmart B8850 and a LaserJet 5000 which are substantially older units. The 7740 just recently came on the market. All the devices are plugged into USB 3.0 ports. If
 I plug the 7740 into a USB 2.0 port, there is no Sleep Mode issue but I need the only two USB 2.0 ports for my keyboard and mouse for proper operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">HP has not resolved the issue and has gone so far to write, "<span>Unfortunately there is nothing that we can do, all the attemps that we try don’t work in your unit, and since all HP printers are directly USB 2.0, they had compatibility
 for USB 3.0 but we can’t assure that it will work in all USB 3.0 ports, as they are directly USB 2.0 we can only assure that they are going to work properly on USB 2.0."
</span><span>&nbsp;This is interesting! USB 3.0 ports are backwards compatible&nbsp;with USB 2.0, that is why my older USB devices work fine plugged into USB 3.0 ports!</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>The motherboard manufacturer says basically that in Sleep Mode, no power is supplied to the USB 3.0 ports so that the 7740 has to send power to the port to wake the computer. Can a device actually send power to a port?</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>The USB 3.0 ports are using the latest Intel USB eXtensible Host Controller Driver and when I checked the Root Hub, the option under Power Management to "Allow this device to wake the computer" is grayed out so how can a device
 plugged into the USB 3.0 port wake the computer?</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>I would appreciate help in getting the Sleep issue resolved soon!</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Thanks</span></p>

I've had a problem following the computer resuming after going to sleep and I need to know which version I have before I can download a patch to fix it.

            Go to the c:\program files and take full control of the folder. Open the  task manager and stop Apoint.exe and ap_hid, then deleted the Apoint2k folder and reboot. 
<br />
<br />Or Scan your pc with windows defender or an anti malware solution like this:

<p>Hi again Douglas</p>
<p>it won't be deleted because it is working in 3 programs:</p>
<p>Alps SMBus Monitor Serices</p>
<p>Alps Pointing-Device Driver</p>
<p>Ap Msg Fwd</p>
<p>but none of them is to be found in my machine !</p>
<p>I have scanned Apoint2k in AVG that says everything is fine,</p>
<p>but also that is impossible to makulate it.</p>
<p>I tried in windows defender, but just after starting my machine frose,</p>
<p>and I couldn't start it again.</p>

<p>Douglas I have totally Reset my machine</p>
<p>in hope that Apoint2k would disappear -</p>
<p>but AK when it started again the procesline</p>
<p>was occupied with Edge and Alps Pointing-device.</p>
<p>I have used the Antimalware that You suggested.</p>
<p>It found 2 problems to solve,</p>
<p>and the one called someting with AL it couldn,t get rid of !</p>
<p>It is a strong enemy.</p>

                    <div>
<p>Hello. I own a Lenovo Y500 GT650M Sli.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had W8 license when I got the machine. Then I had an upgrade to 8.1. Finally, I got W10 upgrade. My recovery has W8.</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had a problem when I was trying to reboot my computer. It got frozen for like 10 minutes and so I had to use hard shut down by pressing the power button. Then I got this error;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recovery</div>
<div>Your PC needs to be repaired</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Boot Configuration Date file is missing some required information.</div>
<div>File:\BCD</div>
<div>Error Code: 0xc000000d</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You'll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media. &nbsp;If you don't have and installation media, contact your system admin or PC manufacturer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I looked it up for it from my Android phone and this one popped out.&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an external DVD-RW but I don't have a setup disc containing any version of Windows. I used Onekey Recovery when I needed to refresh my os. And I don't have anybody with the disc close by.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I wanted to check it out if Onekey Recovery had a repair option but it doesn't. So I was at BIOS screen and changed booting option from UEFI to Legacy first at one point. And now I can not get into either of BIOS or Recovery. When I hit power button, nothing
 displayed on the screen. Pure darkness.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1- How could I change back to UEFI booting while I can not see a thing on my screen?</div>
<div>2- I don't want to lose my datas, so I don't want to make a full recovery yet. How could I make this os running again so I could backup my files before going under a full recovery?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Yes, it is legal, but you should contact Acer about obtaining alternate Windows 7 Professional 64 bit recovery disc so you can install it.
</p>
<p>Please see: Acer Recovery Media Purchase Program</p>

<p>You should also run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor to find out if all your applications and hardware are 64 bit capable.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/upgrade-advisor.aspx</a></p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.</p>
