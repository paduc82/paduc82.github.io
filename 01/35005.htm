    <title>Windows 10 anniversary update frozen midway through installation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 anniversary update frozen midway through installation</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 Home desktop machine downloaded the anniversary update this afternoon and completed the first part of the installation process. &nbsp;It then switched to a screen that says "Working on updates xx%; &nbsp;Don't turn off your PC. &nbsp;This will take a while.
 &nbsp;Your PC will restart several times."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The percentage completion gradually increased to 82% over an hour or so. &nbsp;It now has been at 82% for about 6 hours. &nbsp;There's minimal hard disk activity now. &nbsp;What can I do to get out of this frozen update process. &nbsp;I haven't tried the power switch or pulled
 the plug. &nbsp;Is there some way of gracefully exiting the process that is less likely to inflict injury on my operating system or data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Very similar here. On a Microsoft Surface 3 pro, trying to upgrade from an existing windows 10 up to date installation. Stuck for several hours in the same blue screen, except in my case it's stuck on 32%. The surface gives no indication of disk activity
 so I don't know whether it's actually doing anything except spinning the dots. My surface is in a docking station, and increasingly looking like this is not going to end well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be useful if someone from Microsoft actually responds to problems on launch date...</p>

            <p>Hi Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that anniversary update is stuck at 82% and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the status of the update still the same?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the PC?</li></ul>
<p>This could be due to any third party software conflict or firewall blocking this update to be installed. If the update is stuck at some percentage, you may restart the computer and try the following methods.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Place the computer in clean boot state to avoid any third party software conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
<em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Disable security software</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Important: </strong></span><span><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

            <p>OK. I followed these steps and it did not result in any change. This is not exactly surprising. The advice seems like rather generic advice given for regular updates. The anniversary update is nothing like a regular update. It's a full OS upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, It's still stuck at 32% and gives zero diagnostic information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only good thing I can say is that the OS seems to be able to roll back from the failed update to it's previous state (more or less).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas? Any way to get any diagnostics from this process?</p>

            <p>When I got up this morning, the computer screen was unchanged except that the &nbsp;% completion had increased overnight from 82% to 91%. &nbsp;After a couple of hours of watching it stay at 91%, I hit the power button, which aborted the installation and restored
 my computer to normal function. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like a fool, I decided to follow the suggestion of turning off my antivirus (Avira Free Antivirus) and attempting the installation again. &nbsp;At first, I thought that I was making progress. &nbsp;The "getting ready to install' section of the process completed, and
 the "Working on updates" went all the way to 100% and the computer restarted. &nbsp;When this restart was taking a while, I went outside to do some yard work. &nbsp;An hour or so later, I came back to find the computer screen back at "Working on updates" and the completion
 figure back to 82%. &nbsp;Now I can't get the thing to exit this process again. &nbsp;When I turn off the computer with the power button and later turn it back on, it's back to the "working on updates" screen. &nbsp;The same is true even if I pull the power plug (desktop
 machine) after turning it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now been without my desktop machine for about 22 hours. &nbsp;During part of that time, I've searched the internet for a solution, but I'm not finding one that seems to be working for most folks who are having problems with the update. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, I downloaded the official MS update tool from your website to apply the AU immediately, and have exactly the same problem as described by Ed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have same Windows 10 build 10586.494. Never ran any insider builds, and never installed any AV software, nor security suites, nor 3rd party app firewalls (the only malware I have is iTunes), and also recently enabled Hyper-V for Docker software. I ran
 the whole process a 2nd time (I didn't rebooted between the 2 tests), and it was again stuck at 82%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing found in the Event Viewer, and I am not that expert into Windows updates log file structure. Is there a folder with logs files, whrere people could check what is happening in the background?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sth inside these hidden $Windows temp folders, or maybe in c:\windows\softwaredistribution?<br />
</p>
<p>(edit : just ran Process Explorer, and noticed the update tool "SetupHost.exe" is using one CPU core at full speed, and the thread using this huge CPU is WINDLP.DLL!DllMain+0x85f0. The next one is only using 2%, and is
</p>
<p>&nbsp;msvcrt.dll!endthreadex+0x30. No disk I/O, no network traffic. Hope that helps.)</p>

            Same case here, &nbsp;i think we juste have to wait. I am "stuck" at 91% by now but since last nighy i still was on 81%. I checked that i took me 4 hours to go on 83% from 82😂! So the problem is not to have the installation stucked but i'ts just horribly slow..
 never seen before

<h2>            Enforcement Action</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I'm writing here after repeatedly failing to get a case review on Xbox.com due to an unknown technical difficulty. After several chats with Xbox techincal support staff I was advised to post here as every time I try, I get kicked back to the home page on my account when at the stage of clicking "I Agree to the Terms and Conditions".</p><p><br /></p><p>Anyway, here's the basic facts. My other account (zMiari) was recently banned permanently (9999) under very odd circumstances. I was chilling in a lobby with two friends. Then two people from a clan who detest me joined the same lobby. One of these people started sending me hate mail and repeatly hit me and my friends' cars trying to get a reaction of some kind - basically trolling and griefing us out of spite. The next day they joined my lobby again. However this time a bit of a battle broke out with the guy who was sending me hate mail and hitting me. His friend watched from the sidelines. After being sent a bunch of offensi

            <p>I was told by Xbox Live's technical support staff  to post here as ambassadors have contact with Enforcement and have the ability to relay my feelings to them or something. I have tried on three different devices and cleared browser history and so on. The same thing happens every time. I've spent hours on the phone to technical support staff none of whom were able to resolve the issue. This seems to be more or less my last chance of letting Enforcement know what happened from my point of view.</p>

            <p>On another note, I am aware what DDOS and so on are and how they work. But I had to give as much detail of the history as possible. I also suspect some kind of system tampering was used to create a ban in some way, given the suspicious nature of the circumstances. I really only want my feelings conveyed as I've tried absolutely everything and nothing works. It's as though the system is deaf to complaints. The staff I spoke to were very nice and helpful but the actual system for making appeals and so on seems to be broken. So if anyone here can contact Enforcement and forward my feelings to them I'd be grateful</p>

            <p>Hey there GH0U1 D011,</p><p><br /></p><p>The Enforcement teams don't use the forums at all and they only communicate through a <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Case Review</a>. Not all suspensions are reviewable though, as an example, 24 Hour communications suspensions and Console Suspensions are not reviewable. However, you can find more information in these cases through the communication sent by the teams to the email address associated with your Xbox Live Gamertag. Remember that all suspensions are only enforced when a breach of the <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Code of Conduct</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Services Agreement</a>&nbsp;has happened.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>One of the common myths is that people who report another user for no reason will see that person suspended. This is not the case and in fact is subject to action as well for false reports which you can find more information about Enforcement Myths&nbsp;<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>If you believe the suspension was in error and&nbsp;if you're eligible, you can submit a case review using the steps <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>, however sometimes you're asked to complete a short questionnaire before you can submit a case review. All of the questions refer to the <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Code of Conduct</a>, which you should review prior to filing the review.</p><p><br /></p><p>Since the enforcement teams don't use the forums, there is nothing else we can do here. You'll want to try other browsers and devices to file the review as ngocphi suggested. Mobile devices are not recommended for this however, use a desktop PC for the best results.</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            LG 4K UHD external monitor limited to 1024x768 after surface restart</h2>
                    <p>Environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surface Laptop 2 is connected to the Surface Dock and using a single DisplayPort cable connected to the monitor.</li><li>Windows 10 Pro x64 Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.648), fully patched..</li><li>Surface Dock is using the <strong>latest </strong>firmware.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Troubleshooting notes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Connecting Monitor directly to Surface works well</span></li><li>Connecting Monitor to Docking station works well until <strong>surface restart</strong></li><li>After surface restart monitor is limited to 1024x768</li><li>One can connect and re-connect any component (Monitor, Surface) and the monitor will remain limited to 1024x768</li><li>One can disconnect everything (including power) from docking station, re-start surface while disconnected from docking station and reconnect all back. This will make the setup work as expected (4K resolution) until the next surface restart</li></ul>
<p><span>Basically, pretty annoying that makes me avoid using the docking station which is unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I really appreciate any help on this.</span></span></p>

<p>Also, which volume specifically are you referring to? Is it the volume while on a call or the alert tones when a chat or a call comes in?</p>

            The problem only occurs on headset, never checked loud speaker. The volume ,in specific, is during call. The version of Skype I'm using is 8.15.0.4 calling version 2018.04.01.6 . One of my friends also has this exact issues with headphone volume in mobile
 Skype but I can't tell you any of her specifics.&nbsp;

            I updated my skype to version 8.19.0.1 and the volume was I'd say 5x better than before. However it's still a bit too loud and one of my biggest problems is the volume meter doesn't go down enough. It simply needs a bit of tweaking right now because it
 still does need to be quieter.

<p>I ordered mine at kmart over 15 days ago. The disc drive didnt work so they let me exchange it in the store. Not sure if walmart is the same but they tend to be a little more lenient than other major stores. I would at least give it a try.</p>

<p>My bet is they would let you exchange it. Since you are not trying to return it I think they will not have a problem with it. Worth a shot. I would try it over taking someone's word on it because you never know.</p>

    <title>Spades continually on bottom row in Freecell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cindybode  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spades continually on bottom row in Freecell</h2>
                    I've been noticing lately that for some reason, often almost all the spades are on the bottom row in Freecell games, and usually in some kind of order. Here are screen shots of the last three games I've played. This has been going on for a few days, and
 even though I only play a few games each day, it's getting kind of old. They have all been solvable- I just don't want this layout all the time. My PC has been restarted. I've not reset the game yet, as I've got almost 900 straight wins in a row, and don't
 really want to start over. I always choose Random. Any ideas?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0630f463-a4ea-49ee-89ac-b5ef5861cdae?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0630f463-a4ea-49ee-89ac-b5ef5861cdae?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f4cc8de-e6d9-4698-9d8b-0ba7540c519e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f4cc8de-e6d9-4698-9d8b-0ba7540c519e?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0754331e-86e9-4273-8947-b205eaa23686?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0754331e-86e9-4273-8947-b205eaa23686?upload=true" /></a>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Refurbishing in Malaysia... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> felixlee0530  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Refurbishing in Malaysia...</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I'm a student in ISKL, and I bought the Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I needed a laptop for my homework and schoolwork, so I decided to buy a Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I'm a Korean student and I needed a Korean type cover, so I bought both the Surface and the type cover in a Korean Microsoft store and brought it to Malaysia.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>6 months later, I found a serious problem happening in the display. There are some thin, black lines on the top of the display, and sometimes the screen blinks rapidly and it went very crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c49742b-b1b8-4242-bd07-609517ccc6de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c49742b-b1b8-4242-bd07-609517ccc6de" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ba79f83-b1cd-482a-8233-16482592cb0f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ba79f83-b1cd-482a-8233-16482592cb0f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the service center in Korea and they said that I need to send the device to them, and they'll send me a refurbished product to me. However, I have no idea to send the product to Korea, because the Surface is a sensitive electronic device, and it
 might be damaged if it's sent by parcel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm trying to refurbish my Surface in Malaysia. As the Surface Pro 4 is accepting world-warranty, is it possible to refurbish in Malaysia?
<strong>And is here the service center of Microsoft in Malaysia?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.google.com.my/maps/place/Microsoft+Knowledge+Capital+Centre+Sdn+Bhd/@3.1667981,101.6293381,13z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1smicrosoft+service+center+near+Malaysia!3m4!1s0x31cc37d6c684188f:0x564619978c4015e2!8m2!3d3.157723!4d101.711609?hl=en</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. I'll hope waiting for the answers.</p>

    <title>Cannot Locate the microsoft teredo tunneling adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fumbles007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Locate the microsoft teredo tunneling adapter</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I am playing Gigantic on PC and was trying to setup voice chat on Xbox app and it diagnosed that microsoft teredo tunneling was not allowed. So after research I checked up to see fixes. And I cannot find it anywhere on my PC. I tried viewing hidden
 devices(nothing) and I tried adding legacy(nothing). However it seems to be there somewhere cause I am able to disable it through command prompt(admin). So I am now at a loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help elimate some future TS, yes I followed and checked up on the suggested solutions(nothing worked). Any light to shine on this? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Jimmy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that the adapter is missing due to some corrupted or missing system files. We'd like to learn more about your concern so that we could provide the proper resolution. We just have a few questions for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which build version of Windows 10 is on your computer? To check, click <strong>
Start</strong>, type <strong>winver</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong>. For example, 14393.1066.</li><li>Did you make any changes to your computer before this issue occurred?</li><li>Did you receive any error messages? If yes, please post a screenshot.</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far, aside from checking the Device Manager?</li></ul>

            <p>Ever noticed how most publications (web pages, newspapers, magazines, brochures, books...) use a standard mix of upper and lowercase lettering?&nbsp; It is not only easier to read, but the all uppercase lettering is like a headline, a shout...&nbsp; "WAR OVER!!" or
 "WE DID IT!!" and the all lowercase is like "i just dont care and i am not even going to try".</p>
<p>Of course - how you post is completely up to you.&nbsp; I was just pointing out, indirectly, that you are more likely to get more responses and people helping on your issues if you post in a manner that is easy to read and comprehend as opposed to SHOUTING AT
 EVERYONE.&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>Sounds like a few possibilities:</p>
<p>1) Your CD laser is out/defective/misaligned.&nbsp; Yes - you have a laser for CD and a laser for DVD in that drive.&nbsp; One is not 'dependent' on the other.</p>
<p>2) You have a bad driver somehow.&nbsp; Unlikely - but feel free to go into Device Manager and remove the CD/DVD drive and restart the computer.&nbsp; It will re-install the driver.</p>
<p>3) You may need a firmware update from the CD/DVD drive manufacturer.&nbsp; You would need to refer to their support for that.</p>
<p>4) Bad media.&nbsp; Less possible even, but you could have some bad CD media - might try another brand name.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/258fd0e5-6a5f-434a-9cef-9de7909c2f30" title="ShannonTucson Insider">
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that Skype Pro is no longer available, this is why you can no longer search it on Skype help webpage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for your questions, please find the answers below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) will I be able to receive calls on my Skype Number for free?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- If the calls are covered by your Skype Pro subscription, then yes, it is for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) will I be able to call landlines and mobiles in Australia for free?</p>
<p>- With Skype Pro, you will be asked to choose one country only so if you choose U.S. you'll be able to call U.S landline and mobile numbers only. You'll need to purchase a subscription in Australia in order to make calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) will I be able to call landlines and mobiles in the USA for free?</p>
<p>No, they're are not for free but as long as your Skype Pro subscription covers the country you're calling, you will not be charged extra. It will be deducted on your subscription's minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have questions and clarifications.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, but I'm not sure I understand.&nbsp; I would appreciate any further information you can give me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the problem: You say the calls will be free "if the calls are covered by [my] Skype Pro subscription," but my question is, "Are these calls covered by my Skype Pro subscription?"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pay every month for this subscription, but I can't find anything on any Microsoft website telling me what is actually covered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I also can't find anywhere to "choose one country" to be covered.&nbsp; Nor can I find anything telling me if the choice has already been made by default somehow and, if so, what the choice was.</p>

<p>I tried the fix and it still requires cont, alt, del before password. It must ave something to due with the fact that I had to re-install Windows 10. My system locked up after last auto update and I had to due a full reset and reinstall 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the only issue I have since the reset.</p>

<p>The issue still continues but the system is working fine other than the Ctl, alt, del quirk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The box has been unchecked but the issue still persists. I can live with the issue as long as the system continues to work. It is definitely connected to the Windows 10 upgrade.</p>

Open Registry Editor and navigate to the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon<br />

In the right pane, right-click on DisableCAD and click on Modify.<br />

<p>It seems to vary from version or release or even build.&nbsp; In W8 it was the case that any keystroke including pressing down on a modifier was enough.&nbsp; Then it seemed that Tab worked.&nbsp; Then on Touch we needed to use a swipe up.&nbsp; Then, I'm not sure what seemed
 necessary; lately I think I had been using just a Ctrl- key.&nbsp; Otherwise I agree something seems different. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else have you been trying besides Ctrl+Alt+Delete?&nbsp; Have you tried starting Narrator?&nbsp; (Win+Ctrl+Enter now works from the Lock screen.) &nbsp; So, I tried that with Narrator's Locked Caps Lock key in effect and tried its F2 (Show commands for current item)
 but got no response? &nbsp; YMMV.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Narrator can describe each link in the Lock screen when I tab to one but refuses to give any response to its F2 there either. &nbsp; Pressing Shift-Enter (Locked Narrator key's version of Caps Lock Shift Enter) gives an item for the Lock screen pane but doesn't
 give any clues about what we can do with it. &nbsp; E.g. right-click sends me right back to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently right-click on the Lock screen is now an option for us to get to the Login screen.&nbsp; Discovered accidentally, no thanks to Narrator.</p>

<h2>            Intel&#40;R&#41; 6 Series&#47;C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller &#8211; 1C2D and 1C26 and USBxHCI compliant Host Controller. Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using the same system for over 5 years now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel Core i5 2500 CPU</p>
<p>ASUS P8P67 PRO Motherboard</p>
<p>8gb of RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 7 as soon as it came out, and I never had this issue. I installed Windows 10 at launch, and the issue didn't show up. But until 2-3 weeks ago, this is happening randomly when booted fresh; my USB devices, that are connected to the 1C2D
 and 1C26 controllers, stop working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is easily fixed by going into the device manager, disabling and then re-enabling them. But this is of course annoying. The USB 3.0 ports are unaffected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the drivers and allowed Windows 10 to reinstall them, but I still get this error. The worst part is that it isn't consistent. Sometimes one doesn't work, sometimes the other, both, or they both work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>From several forums, I've read that this is a Microsoft issue, since they are the ones who provide the drivers for these USB controllers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I get some help to stop this behavior in my machine?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This topic was created before, but there was no solution: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/intelr-6-seriesc200-series-chipset-family-usb/755c7557-cb03-4761-8bdc-bad07efaaa79?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to install the drivers in
<strong>compatibility mode</strong> if you haven’t tried it yet. The steps are provided in the thread link provided by you. Further try the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with hardware and devices. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with the Bluetooth adapter. Refer these steps:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press <strong>
Windows key +X</strong>, select <strong>Control panel.</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Change the <strong>
view by </strong>option on the top right to <strong>Large icons.</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>
troubleshooting</strong> and click on the <strong>view all</strong> option on the left panel.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Run the <strong>
Hardware and devices troubleshooter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span> your computer and check if the issue is resolved</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, try Method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Perform a Clean Boot and check the status of the issue.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>My USB 3.0 ports are not affected by this.</p>
<p>

            I reformatted my computer and this fixed the issue. So I guess case closed.

            Hi <strong>Kendall</strong>,<br />
<br />
Getting back the deleted applications after a fresh install of <strong>Windows 10</strong> may depend on which apps you would like to reinstall. To isolate your concern, we'd like to verify which apps are you pertaining to. Are those the pre-installed apps
 on your computer or apps from <strong>Windows Store</strong>?<br />
<br />
We'll be looking forward to your response.<br />
        </p>

 may contact the manufacturer for the latest update and check on the video settings to select the camera device.</span></span></p>
