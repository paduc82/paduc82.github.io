    <title>Phantom Homegroup after upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> therealmiggy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phantom Homegroup after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I ran the Windows 10 update earlier today and have been running through my programs / settings all day. Everything looked great until just about 20 minutes ago when I tried to create a homegroup. There are two PCs, my desktop and my wife's laptop. I had
 updated her laptop to Windows 10 a few nights ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of points: For years, I've created homegroups between our Windows 7 computers without any incident&nbsp;at all;&nbsp;I removed the homegroup before I did the Windows 10 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, what happened was that I created a homegroup on my desktop and wrote down the password. Then I tried to join my wife's laptop, but it gave an error saying that there was an "error creating a homegroup on this PC". I wasn't trying to create one, I was
 joining one. I'll skip over some tedious troubleshooting, but what the situation I ended up with is that I can create a homegroup on the laptop and then join it on the desktop - but I want to create the homegroup on the desktop. As it sits right now, my wife's
 laptop has the "Create a homegroup" option up. My desktop does not, it rather has "Join a homegroup" and tells me "Miggy-PC has created a homegroup" (that would&nbsp;be me!). If I try to join it with either of the two passwords I ended up with, it runs for a&nbsp; while
 and then says "Hey! There's no homegroup on this network. Click OK and then select Create a homegroup." But when I go back to the homegroup page, it still thinks there's a homegroup to join and it won't let me create one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd hate to think I'm going to have to start over with a clean install on the desktop to fix this (and maybe even then the phantom homegroup will still be hanging around!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas out there would be appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I apologies for delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically, a homegroup is created automatically when you set up a PC with <span>
Windows 10.</span> If a homegroup already exists, all you need to do is join it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several problems that can prevent you from creating, joining, or using a homegroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Find devices and content" might be turned off, Date and time might be incorrect, Two or more PCs on the network might have the same name, One or more required services might not be running, Network discovery might be turned off, IPv6 might be disabled,,
 The peer networking idstore.sst file might be damaged, There might be a problem with your network, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
<p>

    <title>Runtime error on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mojayhawk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Runtime error on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to play a digital edition of The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, Deluxe Game of the Year on my Dell XPS 8500 system with Window 8.1. The game was downloaded from the Gamestop app aka Impulse. I keep getting a runtime error that says the program is terminating
 in an unusual way and the launch of the program then crashes. I've been playing the game on and off for several months with no trouble and this issue did not arise until I upgraded my system to 8.1. I have been in contact with both Bethesda and Gamestop on
 this problem and both sides agree that it is a Windows issue. Both have analyzed my computer and game information that I provided and both agree that the game should play on my machine. I do have a borrowed CD copy that I installed for a test and the CD copy
 does run with no errors. However, it is not the deluxe version nor what I paid for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a rundown of ALL the things I’ve done to try to correct the runtime error on the Oblivion digital download:
<br />
<br />
-I made sure the game was installed outside the Program Files folder. It is installed on C:/ drive outside the Program Files folder.
<br />
-I uninstalled and reinstalled DirectX, C++ 2010 and the net framework twice. <br />
-I tried getting the program to run with a clean boot.<br />
-I’ve tried getting the program to run in safe mode. <br />
-I checked to make sure the firewall wasn’t blocking the game or any of the necessary programs. I ran the game with virus &amp; firewall disabled.<br />
-I have tried to reinstall all the programs listed above with the firewall disabled.
<br />
-Compatibility troubleshooter does not fix the problem using any of the recommended settings.
<br />
-I have scanned the computer multiple times with multiple scanners for viruses and malware that might affect the program and have found nothing.
<br />
-I have refreshed the computer settings, reinstalled the game and still get the error.<br />
-I have created a new user account and tried the run the program using all the above options.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm stuck. I'd be happy to provide you with my computer and game specs if you need them. This has become a big headache since there is no reason the game shouldn't work on my system with Windows 8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can give me.</p>

            <p>My apologies for not getting back to you sooner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my files and drivers as you suggested but suffered a system crash that forced me to reinstall Windows to fix it. I'm back to Windows 8 but I have not upgraded to Windows 8.1. I reinstalled the game and it works perfectly without the OS upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the game did work fine before in Windows 8, I'm convinced that this is a Windows 8.1 issue. The OS refuses to run the older software. The Oblivion game was released in 2005, two OS ago. Clearly there is a software conflict here that must be addressed
 by the engineers before more of these older but still popular programs are affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do plan to upgrade the OS in a few days to 8.1 and try again. I'll be back, I have no doubt. Thanks again.</p>

            <p>I've read reports around forums that this issue is only present with the combination of Windows 8.1 AND a game with encrypted executable, as found from various download services like GameStop.&nbsp; If you install from a disc, or you install from Steam, the issue
 does not occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not located a resolution other than purchasing the game in a different format to install it.</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying to this issue, BradN2. </p>
<p>It's been 6 months since the initial post and I still haven't gotten the issue resolved. Upgrading to Windows 8.1 produces the same results as before with a runtime error when I try to play a digitally downloaded version of Oblivion.</p>
<p>I ended up purchasing a used disk version of the Oblivion game and am using it with no issues. I do think you are exactly right about the download executable file problem, BradN2. Perhaps it's one of the reasons why Gamestop has discontinued selling digital
 downloads through it's Gamestop app. I can only hope the problem won't persist with newer games.
</p>
<p>

            <p>After over 6 months struggling with runtime issues and slow processing, I contacted Dell support for the 7th time and they have finally reached the conclusion that the hard drive is failing. It is unknown exactly why since all scans from multiple sources
 show no malware, viruses or other issues. Many of the problems have existed since I purchased the computer 2 years ago and are now escalating. I'm unable to connect to the internet through any browsers now, and any programs that require access to the internet
 for any reason are very slow or unresponsive despite reinstalling the OS and rolling the computer back to factory settings.
</p>
<p>Needless to say, I'm happy I purchased the extended warranty and will receive a new hard drive this week. I"m hoping that will clear up many of my issues involving connectivity, processing speed and encrypted files.</p>
<p>I wish it had taken a lot less than 6 months to resolve the issue on all ends, but thanks for your help..</p>

            <p>It was a few days after I wrote that&nbsp;last&nbsp;post that I was forced to call Dell&nbsp;support&nbsp;as I noticed that parts of my Windows 8.1 program were beginning to crash and I could no longer connect to the internet or run several programs. &nbsp;After running diagnostics
 several times and several virus and malware scans, it was decided that Dell would replace the hard drive since they believe the hard drive was failing. I've since had a new one installed with an all new installation of Windows 8.1 and there are none of the
 issues I was dealing with before. The new drive is 2x bigger and faster than &nbsp;the previous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed an older game, Dragon Age: Origins from a digital vendor, EA's Origin, and it ran with no errors or messages. After I updated Windows 8.1 with some routine updates later that day, I again began to get the runtime error notice. I haven't tried
 to get the game to run on the new drive since I have purchased disk copies of the games and play from them now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my new computer specs so that you can forward the information to your software engineers for research.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description provided, it looks like you get the autorun.exe while installing a program from a disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we need more information about the issue to assist you better.</p>
<p>Please help me answer this question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Is the issue specifc with a particular program?</p>
<p>2. Is the issue specific while installing a program from a particular CD?</p>
<p>3. Which program are you trying to install?</p>
<p>4. Which anti-virus&nbsp;do you use?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The probable cause for this error&nbsp;"<span>Not a valid 32-bit application" can have many causes:</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
I have listed some of them below.</p>
</span><b><span>File is corrupt, bad, or missing</span></b><span>.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span><br />
a. If the hard disk drive is corrupted or bad it can cause working programs to fail either because not all the data can be read from the hard disk drive or because the program has become corrupted while on the drive. Run scandisk and defrag on the hard disk
 drive to check for any potential errors.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;If you're running the program from a shortcut on the computer, verify that the program is still on the computer. In some cases if the program is no longer installed on the computer you may get this error.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>File is not designed for your version of Windows:<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>a. &nbsp;If you're trying to run a program that is not designed for your version of Windows you may get this error.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;Although many older programs designed to work in older versions of Windows will work with new versions of Windows, unfortunately, not all programs will work.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;If the program is an older MS-DOS program or early Windows program you may get this error.<br />
d. &nbsp;If the program is designed for a 64-bit version of Windows and you're running it in a 32-bit version of Windows, it will not work and generate this error.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>File is a virus, worm, or other malware file. <br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>a.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This error can be generated by a file that is a virus, worm, trojan, or other type of malware file. Often, this will be caused because the virus scanner installed in the computer will not allow the file to be installed or run. Try
 scanning the file to verify it is not a virus and/or infected.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>b. If the file has been checked and is clean, it is still possible that the virus protection program and/or another program installed on the computer is causing issues during the install or execution of the program. Boot the computer into Safe Mode
 and try running the program, booting the computer into </span></p>
<p><span>Safe Mode will make sure nothing is running in the background that could be causing this issue.<br />
<b><br />
Hardware incompatibility.</b><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.</span> If you're getting this error during the installation of a program it's also possible that the CD-ROM drive or the drive you're installing the program from is not compatible with Windows or has drivers that are not compatible with Windows.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;Download the latest drivers for your CD drive or other drive from the computer manufacturer or from the hardware manufacturer. (Microsoft does not make driver for other hardware)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide us more information about the issue to provide a better solution.</p>

                    <p>I'm using Windows 10 and just switched from the Skype Desktop version to the Skype Modern Version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my notification sounds are gone, but my call sound works fine (I can communicate with people via voice, but don't hear any "dings" when someone chats).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Test Audio" option does not make any sound when my working Audio Device is selected (works with all other applications that use sound).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other troubleshooting steps I can take or should I just revert back to using the Desktop version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may have the wrong device selected in your computer system. If more than one device is listed, make sure that the device selected is the headset you are using. For example, if you’re using a headset that connects through a USB port, be sure that
 you’ve selected an audio setting that tells your computer to find the&nbsp;headset in that port.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Check this by locating your Windows Sound settings, choose <strong>Start → Control Panel → Sound</strong> or Sounds and Audio Devices. (This path may differ on some computers with different operating systems and configuration setups, but your aim is
 to locate the Sounds and Audio Devices control panel.) Force quit Skype using task manager &gt; re-launch &gt; make a test call.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, make sure&nbsp;your sound&nbsp;under volume mixer is not muted for Skype.
</span></p>

<p>No it does not help.</p>
<p>There is no option to choose Skype in the notifications and actions setting for Windows.</p>
<p>All notifications are turned on in Skype.</p>
<p>Have both Win 10 App and classic Skype. No notifications for either.</p>

            Windows10 does not allow me to download any other version of Skype. What should I do? I use it for work and it is very inconvenient not receiving the notifications with sounds, and showing your status in yellow as in away when you are actually in the computer

</p><p>They just killed support for all of the stand alone Skype models, you HAVE to use the windows store one now, and it's garbage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- No sounds for active conversations, you have to watch the taskbar for the message thing.</p>
<p>- No buddy lists, only contact list (just like the crap Yahoo did)</p>
<p>- No online green/yellow/red status bubbles on their pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a single one of the "Big IM" companies care about their users, they're just more focused on turning what shouhld be an IM program into some e-mail inbox looking thing.</p>

<h2>            Original adapter for xbox one availability in India</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>There are alot of post regarding this on forum but no helpful answer<br />
I have purchased an Xbox one from US and now bought it back here in India. Since it has 110 watts adapter which is from US, I wanted to buy new original 220 volts adapter here in India but I am unable to find it anywhere. Tried a stepdown converter for 50 watts
 which did not work</p>
<p>The other one available is 1000watts step down converter, want to if this can work with this Xbox</p>
<p>I have contact support 4 times and no help, they just say that the xbox was purchased from out of region and they can't help. Even though I told them I am ready to purchase a new adapter and just point me to the right place where I can buy the original Microsoft
 220 volt Xbox one adapter, they did not know where to find it.</p>
<p>Here in India Xbox one is not sold by retailers, only Amazon.in sells Xbox one console but to original adapter available on Amazon. Multiple 3rd party adapters are available but I am not sure about purchasing them as I keep reading that those adapter fail
 after 5 to 10 days.</p>
<p>Microsoft has the worst kind of support I ever had, I get that they can't replace my adapter under warranty because of out of&nbsp; region purchase but they can't even point me to the right place where I can purchase the adapter. I don't know how then do service
 in India if someone purchases xbox from India.</p>
<p>Can someone please help on what is the right voltage converter I should use. Is 1000 watts fine or can someone point me to the right place where I can purchase original xbox one adapter.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Sarfaraz Rahman</p>

<p>The UK Adapter will work in India you would just need the correct plug adapter for the type of sockets you have, I think you would find them on Amazon UK.</p>

<p>250 watt voltage converter worked for me.</p>
<p>Don't buy those 3rd party xbox one adapter they are just 135 watt adapter and ur xbox will shutdown when u launch games.</p>
<p>So go with 250 watt voltage converter. Original Xbox adapter is 255 watt I think.

    <title>Surface Book Windows key does not work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book Windows key does not work</h2>
                    <p>I purchased my Surface Book in January 2017. It has performed flawlessly up until the past 5 days. Pressing the Windows Key does nothing. Also, clicking on the Windows Key with my mouse or pressing it on the screen have EXTREME Delayed reactions, if it all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the mouse only works about half the time, and pressing the screen only works about two thirds of the time. I have tried detaching / reattaching the tablet and restarting the Surface Book. Neither of these has the positive effect I hoped for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Function keys work fine, as does the detach button. This seems to only affect the Windows key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! I need access to the Start menu.... (Unsure which topic to place this under, so chose power, battery, and performance, since it is not performing as designed)</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Vicky,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows 10 Pro Version 1703</li><li>Numerous reboots and detaching / reattaching the tablet portion.</li><li>Recent changes: (1) Windows Update on October 10. Only update was 2017-10 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based systems (KB4041676), and (2) Yesterday, October 12, I removed my McAfee Livesafe security software and replaced it with
 Norton Security. However, I was experiencing this problem before I did that.</li></ul>
<p>I have also now noted that my Action Center is non-responsive, and my Search box is, too. Apps on the Task bar work, but other parts of the task bar do not.</p>
<p>

<p>To date I have reinstalled windows 10 3 times. I begin reinstalling my apps, which include several IOBit utilities. It appears that there is something about these apps that affect Windows, as the Windows key becomes unresponsive, as does the Cortana search
 box and the action center. I have even tried using a system restore point, but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have this problem on any of my other PCs running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just how far back do I need to go, here?</p>

<h2>            essent 489 in Event Log on WIndows 8 Pro x64</h2>
                    I've been getting these in my Event Log for a while<br />
<br />
taskhostex (2976) An attempt to open the file "C:\Users\Gary\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache\WebCacheV01.dat" for read only access failed with system error 32 (0x00000020): "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.
 ".&nbsp; The open file operation will fail with error -1032 (0xfffffbf8).<br />
<br />
According to Process Explorer "WebCacheV01.dat" is being used by:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dllhost.exe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5,576 K&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7,648 K&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1736&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COM Surrogate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Corporation<br />
<br />
<br />
On a vanilla VM I use, Taskhostex.exe has them opened which is correct AFAICT.<br />
<br />
Anyway to get things back to normal?<br />

            Sorry for the delay.&nbsp; I narrowed it down to the fact that I am using auto log in.&nbsp; The instructions to do this is here:&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2894-log-user-account-automatically-windows-8-startup.html?filter[1]=User%20Accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Log On User Account Automatically at Windows 8 Startup</a><br />
<br />
Logging into my account via the log in screen never produces this error.<br />
<br />
I recently did a clean install of Windows 8 because of this problem and a few others.&nbsp; I again activated auto log in and only get this error once in a blue moon.&nbsp; I think maybe 2 times in the past 3 days instead of every time I restart or do a cold reboot.<br />

            &nbsp;2 times in the past 3 days is a bit often to be once in a blue moon in my opinion.&nbsp; Still, it sounds a bit better than before.&nbsp; I don't know what else to suggest other than to turn off automatic login.&nbsp; Thanks for the feedback.

<h2>            Windows 10 Log In screen never appears - cannot log in.</h2>
                    <p>Shortly after WIndows 10 updates I started getting the screen flashing error.&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft tech via chat for assistance twice.&nbsp; The screen flashing slowed but never went away.&nbsp; Now, I am unable to log into my pc at all.&nbsp; The sign in window never
 loads.&nbsp; Just before this happened a long error code popped up and I got a screenshot - but because I can no longer get into the PC I cannot tell you what the error code was.&nbsp; Very upsetting that a patch was not sent out for this before it created the problem
 I am facing today.&nbsp; This is my desktop PC - has everything in it.&nbsp; Does anyone have a solution?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Task Manager uptime clock</h2>
                    <p>I am having some confusion with the uptime counter in the Task Manager in Windows 8.
</p>
<p>I notice this on both my laptop and my PC. The counter has been clocking up hours of time since...well since I first started using Windows 8.</p>
<p>I always Shut Down the system and have only left it on a few times to complete maintenance tasks. No matter if I Shut Down, Sleep or Restart, this counter is always going. Even removed the power and still the counter keeps going.</p>
<p>Why is this happening and can it be fixed? Isn't uptime supposed to count the time since the machine booted up?</p>

<p>&nbsp;Please could someone explain this for me.</p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have the <strong>Fast Startup</strong> option enabled, the <strong>Uptime Clock</strong> in
<strong>Task Manager</strong> will not be reset if you <strong>Shut Down and restart</strong> or
<strong>Sleep and restart</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it will be reset if you <strong>Restart</strong> the computer from the
<strong>power options</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Web browser keeps opening to msn by itself randomly</h2>
                    Hi every now and then with no user interaction my default web browser firefox opens to the msn home page (my home page is google)(this also happens if edge is set as the default browser). It is completely random and comes up over whatever I'm currently
 doing on my computer stopping me in my tracks this is very annoying. I've run anti virus software and its come up clean, I reloaded my operating and it returned after a few weeks and I haven't added new apps or software that may have caused it. The only thing
 I've found that may be involved is a system restore point automatically created by windows module installer what its for I have no idea, so I tried a restore point prior to that date and the issue seemed to go away but alas it has returned this time there
 hasn't been a restore point created by anything that might indicate a change. Any ideas on what be triggering my web browser to open to msn?

            Hi as previously stated this issue is not isolated to firefox it occurs with edge as well if it is set to the default browser. It does not matter what I use as a default browser this issue of randomly opening to msn occurs. A little help please.

            So any ideas why this is occurring? I tried uninstalling reinstalling firefox but no change. The only thing I've found that apparently solves this issue is a registry hack, but I shouldn't have to alter the registry to stop msn from opening at random times.
 This seems to be a windows issue that many people are having trouble with so a solution would be nice. I've never actually gone onto the msn website there is nothing I want on there this lack of response from microsoft makes it seem as if they are trying to
 force it on me which isn't right. Again a little help with this issue please.

</p><p>Hi no matter what I have set as my default web browser it opens randomly by itself to MSN homepage. I've checked for viruses and found none, tried uninstalling reinstalling web browsers to no effect even restored my pc to an earlier time only for the issue
 to return. I've seen some people have altered the registry to stop this happening, but surely there is a fix that doesn't involve a registry hack? As this seems to be a windows issue I was hoping you could help? thanks</p>

In the Settings, every browser has a setting to set your Home page. <br />
<br />
If it won't set or stay set, run full scans with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner: <br />
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />
Remove any Add-on's, Extensions or other Search services in Browser settings. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            This issue occurs no matter what browser I use firefox edge chrome etc. Whatever is set as my default browser randomly opens to MSN which is not my homepage (thats google and I know how to set a homepage thats not the issue) I have never even been onto
 MSN. Please actually read the question it does help. So again what windows component is triggering whatever I use as a default browser to open to MSN with no user interaction?

<p>&nbsp;You said your browser was being hijacked by MSN which isn't a browser but a web page.&nbsp; It's somehow set as your Home Page, probably because something like Bing was added.&nbsp; I told you all ways this can be removed.&nbsp; If you won't follow the steps then I can't

            I said whatever is set as my default browser firefox edge chrome etc randomly opens with no user interaction to MSN, my homepage in all of them is google, MSN never sets itself as my homepage. Why is my default browser randomly opening to MSN all by itself?
 This has absolutely nothing to do with what is set as my homepage nor which browser I am using (MSN isn't a browser who said it was). There is a registry hack that fixes the issue but I'm trying to find out which windows component is causing it as I'd rather
 not hack the registry.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to fix your issue, please provide additional information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Was there any recent changes/updates/drivers installed on your computer?
</li><li>Do you receive any error message?
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try installing the latest drivers from Acer support site and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.acer.com/us/en/product/default.aspx?tab=1&amp;modelId=1290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.acer.com/us/en/product/default.aspx?tab=1&amp;modelId=1290</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you disable the touchpad to verify if it’s creating a conflict with the mouse or if the sensitivity of the touch pad is high.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to temporarily disable the touchpad from Device manager and verify if the mouse works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to access device manager and disable touch pad.</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on Start. </p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Run window and type “devmgmt.msc” and press enter.
</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Expand Mice and pointing device.
</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right click on Touch pad and Disable it.
</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the computer and verify if it works fine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incase if you find the mouse is working fine, you need to contact computer manufacturer on this issue to verify if it’s the sensitivity or the drivers causing the issue and get
 their assistance to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>This behavior can also happen if the computer is infected with Virus.&nbsp;I would also suggest you to download and run the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner on your computer and check
 if it helps: </p>

<h2>            Unable to watch ABC iview on windows 10 answer.</h2>
                    I have viewed a number of locked posts about this issue. This is an adobe flash player problem. You click to play the program and all you get is a black screen with the play button even though your player is enabled. Believe it or not the solution is to
 hit the X to close it then click on the program again and for some reason it plays. Don't know why it just does. So there you have it.

<h2>            Windows Live Movie Maker keeps shutting down</h2>
                    Hello and thank you for your time.
<div>I'm working on a project that so far is around 8 seconds long.</div>
<div>It was working well at first but later I tried it and it shut itself down when pasting a video clip that before was not giving me any trouble. I tried fixing all Windows Live Essentials and also re-installing all Windows Live Essentials, but it did nothing.
 It shuts down a few seconds after starting it now.</div>
<div>Do you guys have an idea why this is happening?</div>
<div>I can supply more details.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Kittie_Kat _Storm,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are glad to help you regarding this issue. I understand that you need to prevent Movie Maker from closing so you can use it properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Please ensure that your video card drivers are up to date.</font></span><span><font color="#000000">
 Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with various software.
<br />
<br />
To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;</font><font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>dxdiag</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in
 the Start screen, then press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Enter</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>key on the keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;Click on the </font></font><font color="#000000"><strong><span>Display</span></strong> tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p>
<span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If in case the issue persists, please provide us log files for Movie Maker. I have sent you a private message for the instructions.
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">After uploading the logs, please notify us in this thread.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Kittie_Kat_Storm,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation. Since your Video card driver is up to date, i<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">t is most likely that this is due to Movie Maker related files that became corrupted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As additional troubleshooting step, please perform a clean install of the program. Clean Install is different from manually removing then reinstalling the program. This process has steps that would permanently
 remove all&nbsp;Movie Maker related files on the system giving you a fresh new state to work on. Please follow the procedure below</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">:<br />
