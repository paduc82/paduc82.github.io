You've verified the camera works in other video applications?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You've checked the Skype settings (video) to make sure the source it is using is that specific camera?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You've verified the drivers you are using for the camera in Windows 8 are the ones provided by the manufacturer of the camera/computer for Windows 8 (not another operating system)?<br />
[If the camera manufacturer or computer manufacturer don't have Windows 8 drivers - they may not support said device under Windows 8.]

<h2>            Stuck in middle between DOS and inaccessible Windows 10 ruined by KB3081424 failure</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally, I had 8.1 Pro on my SSD (Cruical) as OS only (C:) and Users/Documents/others on D: &nbsp;It has been running great as I always kept my system fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to Windows 10 around August 1st, it ran beautifully and I sure like Windows 10...much faster and more accessible to apps and others...better than 8.1. &nbsp;Later, I believe around August 11, I was working on something -- all sudden, BSOD (Bad_System_Config_Info)...endless
 loop over and over -- of course I panicked! &nbsp;I don't want to lose everything...I sure don't want to do fresh clean install if I can get it back up running again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had studied many kinds of solutions offered here on this site... first with SID using regedit... &nbsp;First of all, I want to explain clearly in beginning before I talk about my experiences trying several solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I wasn't able to access Safe Mode at all, kept getting BSOD...I even tried each special safe setting each line...all failed. &nbsp;Nothing worked!</p>
<p>2. I used recovery DVD that I created by downloading Windows 10 64bit ISO... I tried repairing windows...no avail.</p>
<p>3. Nothing to restore from restore point because I didn't make backup that soon...it happened unexpectedly -- to be honest, I haven't made any backup since XP because I normally keep several partitions to keep separate and safekeeping so I can easily re-install
 OS if absolutely necessary like I did several times -- that is why I am so familar with workarounds until now with windows 10 -- baffled!</p>
<p>4. Cannot restore system image because there is no image created yet.</p>
<p>5. cannot roll back to previous build because of errors (it didnt say what error)</p>
<p>6. Cannot reset PC at all due to errors (it still didnt say what error)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to solutions that I have tried -- &nbsp;DOS is the only "working OS" that I am able to see everything in all drives (SSD and regular HD) -- whew!! &nbsp;I do see windows.old (8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>first solution that I tried was deleting stray SID as instructed... &nbsp;I did wonder what to do since I am unable to access windows to use regedit...I decided to risk to see if I could edit registry using command-lines in DOS... I have done many different kinds
 of commands in past, but never regedit...so I typed in regedit then pressed enter... to my surprise, it pulled up another screen in GUI showing exact same look as regular regedit inside windows. &nbsp;YIPEE! &nbsp;I was so relieved because I could &nbsp;use mouse to navigate
 inside registery instead of having to type so many locations with slashs!! &nbsp;so I went to ProfileList to see if I could find stray SID... nope I only have -18, -19, and -20 --- drats i thought. &nbsp;I had searched on Internet for more solutions...I learned about
 checking specific users in SID so I went back to that screen a couple days later... &nbsp;I realized that my user is not there -- how did I know? &nbsp;I had to quickly check my daugther's new laptop to make sure no problems because my girl was excited to upgrade windows
 10... dang, she was lucky! &nbsp;all installed KBs successfully with no problem! &nbsp;lucky her! &nbsp;However, I decided to check out her registry so I can compare... sure enough, I can see her user and my wife's in both -21 with long string of numbers so I compare to
 mine...weird! &nbsp;none of my user is listed other than defaults:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. -18/profileimagepath/%systemroot%/system32/config/systemprofile</p>
<p>2. -19/profileimagepath/X:\windows\serviceprofiles\localservice</p>
<p>3. -20/profileimagepath/X:\windows\servicesprofiles\networkservice</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought wait a minute... X:??? &nbsp;What's going on?!? &nbsp;So I used cd.. back to systemroot. I checked X: dir -- I see that it is a boot drive with DIRs (program files, program files (x86), sources, users, windows and offlinerecenvtrace.etl)</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I changed drive to C: to check its directory -- strange enough, it is my regular hard drive (data storage). &nbsp;Also, I changed to D: drive to discover that it is from my SSD with whole OS files along with windows.old. &nbsp; WHOA! no wonder I was unable to
 access windows at all due to changed drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did use bootrec instructions...somehow it did move closer to "end of tunnel" for it discovered 8.1 installation as it kind of fixed MBR to show screen to choose either 10 or 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I studied some solutions relating to DISM -- I thought why try editing registry to change drives to help repair, hopefully...but sadly, it didn't make any permanent changes! &nbsp;it kept coming back to its original values..I wasn't able to export or import reg
 file...guess it only works in windows, not DOS window shell outside windows environment -- anyway I went ahead and try DISM...ARGH it didn't work -- got error: 50 and it said that DISM does not support servicing windows PE with the /online option. &nbsp; Again,
 it seems only works while inside windows, not in DOS environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried installing windows 10 using USB method...nothing happened because it told me to remove usb to let windows run...of course it didn't work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to this point, I need help... &nbsp;I am really hoping that there is a special dos program that someone created that I could download to usb or dvd then run it to let DOS do its magic to correct those stupid errors. &nbsp; I just want to be able to fully access
 the windows 10 in safe mode so I can make sure all updates successfully installed then back to normal windows and I can move on with my life as well as yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so far I noticed so many solutions are while you are in safe mode or actually in windows. &nbsp;Nothing about outside of windows while in DOS environment. &nbsp; I really need solutions from DOS perspective. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;I simply cannot access Windows 10 at all. &nbsp;Believe
 me, I have attempted every solution out there to restore somehow...ALL failed. &nbsp;DOS is the only accessible using recovery GUI window shell. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time reading this -- I am sure that many of you have same problem as I do...Hopefully Microsoft find a way using DOS instead of focusing on window issue, I dunno.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate it!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;If you are unable to boot to the computer then I would suggest you to create installation media and then try to perform automatic repair and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>&nbsp;Step 1:</strong> Create ISO for Windows 10
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;You may also refer to the article mentioned below to for downloading Windows 10 on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Download Windows
 10</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong>
<strong>Perform an Automatic repair</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>The Automatic repair can detect and fix the issues that prevent the computer from working normally.
</span></p>
<p><span>After you have a Windows 10 installation disc/USB, follow these steps:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be<strong>&nbsp;F12.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
The boot menu key might differ with each manufacturer. If you are unable to find the boot menu key, you may refer the user manual.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Restart the computer, when the manufacturer's logo is displayed, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to&nbsp;<strong>CD\DVD&nbsp;ROM</strong> (in case you create DVD). Select USB in case you create USB.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or&nbsp;<strong>System Repair</strong>&nbsp;Disc, a black screen &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appears&nbsp;with gray text<strong> "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD".
</strong>Press any key.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select the correct time and Keyboard type.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click&nbsp;<strong>Repair</strong>&nbsp;your computer in the lower left corner.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting,&nbsp;advanced option</strong>&nbsp;and then click&nbsp;<strong>Startup Repair.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>Paul -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am up the same creek - and I think, perhaps, Microsoft is hiding our paddles for fear of news of this catastrophic problem reaching civilization. Definitely feeling as though I'm hanging out here in the wilderness. You seem like pleasant enough company,
 though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, your responses have been less than helpful, and now, after days being jerked around with this problem, I, like Paul, will need to cut my losses and run. I have a dissertation to finish, and I don't see my committee taking "but Microsoft ate all
 250 pages of my just-revised document" as an acceptable answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be reloading Win10 momentarily. Hate the sleepless nights, but I *can't* sleep while this problem is unsolved and while I lack a timetable guesstimating when I can actually *work* again. I'll be going for an automatic backup plan, too - and nothing
 involving your ideas of the relative importance of my documents compared to the inflated value you place in cutting and running to save your skins. In case that's unclear, I WILL NOT be using any backup plans run by Microsoft. Just so we're clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And thank you, Paul, for c&amp;p'ing such a great lot of information. It's because of you and your clarity of thought in including everything possible that I knew I was not alone; nearly every issue you encountered was replicated down to the last jot and tittle
 in my situation. Thank you, thank you. And thank you again, Paul.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft? I know you won't be any more helpful when it comes to my situation; I'm ready for the pro forma excuses at any moment. But at least write and let me know that someone in the dungeons at Redmond has heard me. (I do rather wonder if that poor prisoner's
 last name is Valjean... and if his ID number is 98052. Then again, $98,052 might be this 'Valjean's' weekly take-home, so I'm not ready to take in that candle-stick coveter's &nbsp;story *quite* yet...).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck, Paul... and little but exasperation for you, Microsoft...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laura</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I'm no slouch on the computer / programming front. When I first learned to program, punch cards were still de rigeur - and the last I officially programmed was fewer than ten years ago. I am quite well aware of what an idiot problem this is... and that
 you are up to the challenge, but disinterested, it would appear!</p>

            <p><span>Hello Aaron,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>With the issue description, I understand that you <em>are getting black screen with mouse cursor on screen after installing Windows 10 operating system</em>. I will certainly help you with the query.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If you could help me with more information, I would be able to provide you more effective solutions:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is any external device connected to your computer apart from mouse and keyboard?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do you get any error message/code on the screen?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do you have any Security software installed on your computer?</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>The issue might be occurring because of any software conflict or external device. There could be possibility of corrupt
</span><span>Graphic/Display driver. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to disable the Security Software and disconnect the external device which is connected with the computer apart from mouse and keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Let‚Äôs try the below mentioned steps and check If that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>1. If you see the black screen or have a flickering screen before sign-in:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1)&nbsp;Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>2. </span>Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1)&nbsp;Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video <br />
2)&nbsp;Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
<br />
Check the PC or display adapter manufacturer‚Äôs site for an updated driver.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>As you mentioned that you are unable to boot to safe mode. So I would suggest you to use the power button to restart computer three times. This will start the Windows Recovery Environment.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue still persists, then you might have to boot from the installation media and run a Startup repair. Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page to create media:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</span></a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After creating the media, boot the computer from the medium and then try the following method to perform a Startup Repair in Windows 10.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Contact the computer manufacturer to know on how to change the boot order of the computer. You will have to change the boot device to CD/DVD drive and then boot from the Windows&nbsp;10 installation disk.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the ‚Äú<em><strong><span>Windows Setup</span></strong></em>‚Äù dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click ‚Äú<em><strong><span>Next</span></strong></em>‚Äù.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on ‚Äú<em><strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong></em>‚Äù from the lower left corner.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From the ‚Äú<em><strong><span>Choose an option screen</span></strong></em>‚Äù, click on ‚Äú<em><strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong></em>‚Äù.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click ‚Äú<em><strong><span>Advanced&nbsp;Options</span></strong></em>‚Ä

            <p>Hi Neha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>- no external device</p>
<p>- no messages &nbsp;of any type</p>
<p>- windows only i.e. defender</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you noticed from the origional post while im able to boot into recovey mode, rebooting in low vis and safe mode does not work so a lot of the additional &nbsp;steps referanved cannot be tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given safe mode has the same issue however id assume that we could rule out graphics drivers and anti virus software as these would not be loaded in safe mode that im aware off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional fix attempts tried tonight include restore from two recovert points - both faied trying to restore defender related files. Boot recovery ... failed with no detail so no insight to possible issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chkdsk currently running now with stage 1 complete and no issues found so far ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting to run out of options before a full factory reset back to win 8.0 ..... but nothing so far is giving any indication of the issue or why it stopped working overnight after being cleanly shutdown ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h3> lalahachi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updated to Windows 10 and now my sound is acting up</h2>
                    <p>I have my stationary computer connected with both sound and image to a TV-screen, which has worked very well..... Until I updated to Windows 10 about 6 months ago. Since then, sometimes when my computer has been in "sleep mode" or whatever happens when you
 leave it for a while, the sound stops working. Running an error check says that no speakers or such are present (even though restarting it solves everything without touching the HDMI-cable) and strangest part is that the "volume panel" - or whatever it's called
 where you can see and change the colume of all programs currently running - doesn't even show any sound being made. Even though I know that games, youtube, vlc was and is making sound. I have been waiting for an update of Windows 10 to fix this but that doesn't
 seem to be happening so can someone please help me. Pretty please. <br />

            <p>Well, just like they axed Favorites with Windows 10 when migrating from any previous version, and I had well over 900 of them (luckily I had a backup which I have since streamlined), they (MS) have done it again with the WLM 2012 Stationary for emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read up all over the internet about a solution, and there is NO solution that I can find - and I combed it.&nbsp; Like all Microsoft and computer problems in general, you now have to find a work-around for the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other suggestions have been to use a new email package.&nbsp; Using a new email client is not really an option either due to the fact that the emails to import into whatever you plan on using, don't deal with .EML file formats that well.&nbsp; And if it's not that,
 it will be something else.&nbsp; There is never an apple to apple situation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This I am sure is another thing for sure Microsoft did on purpose so that you are forced to use WLM2012 and stay with them with regard to usage of their email client (for marketing purposes).
</p>
<p>____________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Solution (work-around) no. 1:&nbsp; So - my solution was to find an old email I'd sent which used the template in that case, which I formerly had and automatically saved in SENT items, and then forwarded it to myself.&nbsp; I edited it, and dragged that version
 into the Drafts folder.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then created several draft versions of it, over and over again, and kept them in that Draft folder - topping it off as needed after subsequent "sends".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run out of the draft versions, I go back into Sent items and do it all the above all over again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, as you reach the last one in Drafts, I BCC myself on that same message so that the message comes back to me reminding me to drag it back into Drafts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Solution (work-around) no. 2:&nbsp; My other solution I am using too, whichever is more convenient at the time, is to SAVE one version of the Draft email in .EML format which uses the template stationary to your Desktop for example.&nbsp; This works well if your
 Desktop is not cluttered, and you dont have your WLM2012 email client open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There all you have to do is double click on it from there and you don't have to regenerate more draft version to blast them out as you use them.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>It's a sad solution to a perfectly legit and necessary feature which was eliminated without giving it any thought, but works very well for me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that it helps...</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hello Rohitash,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</strong> message indicates that a kernel-mode process or driver attempted to access a memory address to which it did not have permission to access. The most common cause of this error is an incorrect or corrupted pointer that
 references an incorrect location in memory. This error usually occurs after the installation of a buggy device driver, system service, or BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high. This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the&nbsp;methods below&nbsp;and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Disconnect all the external devices</strong> connected to your computer except mouse and keyboard and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run Memory diagnostics</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Memory diagnostic tool will check and fix any issues with the computer‚Äôs memory. You can refer these steps to run this tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key +X, select
<strong>Control panel</strong></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <strong>Administrative tools
</strong>and select ‚Äú<strong>Windows memory diagnostic</strong>‚Äù and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Update BIOS and chipset drivers</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could also be caused due to outdated Basic Input Output system (BIOS) or chipset drivers. I would suggest you to visit the manufacturer‚Äôs website to download and install the latest BIOS and chipset drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong><span><span><em>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems
 resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</em><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4: Automatic repair</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to boot the computer, then I would suggest you to perform an Automatic repair. The Automatic repair can detect and fix the issues that prevent the computer from starting normally. You will need the Windows 8 disc to perform an Automatic
 repair. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be F12.
</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Restart the computer, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to CD\DVD ROM</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Select the correct time and Keyboard type.
</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click <strong>Repair your computer
</strong>in the lower left corner</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <strong>Troubleshooting, advanced option
</strong>and then click <strong>Automatic repair</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know the result, we‚Äôll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Canon iP4500 &#34;printer not responding&#34;</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
I have two computers with win7. My desktop uses win 7 pro while my laptop uses win 7 home premium. The issue is that my laptop cannot print anything while connected via USB. It worked fine while the printer was a shared object over my network but since my desktop
 recently crashed I just moved the USB-cable.<br />
<br />
I've been in contact with the Canon support and so far I've tried the following:<br />
- Removing/reinstalling the driver with files software from Canon countless times<br />
- Checked if the services runs ok<br />
- Executed the printer troubleshooter without being any closer to a solution<br />
<br />
After many emails back and forth with the Canon support they told me it must be some kind of glitch in the registry that makes the drivers not work correctly.<br />
<br />
So how do I "reset" or delete the registry entries that are of concern in my case?<br />
<br />
It's seriously annoying not being able to use my printer! I use it almost everyday which makes me feel a little bit of handicapped!<br />

            <p><span>Hi Richard Alfj√§rd,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the printer ever worked with your laptop?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact error message/code?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The issue seems to be USB incompatibility with the printer. I would suggest you to uninstall and re-install the USB controller drivers
 for your computer and then test the issue. </span></span><span><span>Follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type device manager on the search box and press enter.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Device manager window will open, expand Universal Serial Bus controllers.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click Uninstall to remove them one at a time.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer, windows will reinstall the USB controllers.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Plug in the removable USB storage device, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>

<h2>            &#91;XBOX ONE&#93; ERROR 0x803f80001 when opening Titanfall 2</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past few weeks, I have been unsuccessfully attempting to open Titanfall 2 on my Xbox one. It gives the error 0x803f80001 every time I open it, along with a message about making sure I own the game. I have several hundred hours on the game and would
 like to get back to playing it. It seems as if I have tried every possible solution and nothing has worked. Is there a way to fix this problem? Thanks for your time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: I have Titanfall 2 on disc. </p>

            <p><span>Hi Maxi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft&nbsp;Community and being part of Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in accessing&nbsp;files/ folders in Windows 10. We will help you to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the below steps to provide permission to the folder and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Use the following procedure to fix this as long as you don't reboot your machine:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Sign-in as an administrator on your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Navigate to the folder where you're having the problem. Right-click and select
<strong>Properties</strong> from the pop-up menu.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Under <strong>Properties | Security tab</strong>, click the
<strong>Advanced</strong> button, then click "<strong>Change</strong>" owner on the
<strong>Advanced Security Settings</strong> dialog (if you are already the owner, do this step anyway!), and in the resulting dialog enter whatever you want the owner to be</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now a new check-box appears labeled "<strong>Replace owner on sub-containers and objects</strong>"; check it.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also check the box at the bottom "<strong>Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object</strong>."</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Make sure under the Permission entries grid that your current account has Full control (if not Edit or Add your account to be listed with foll control). Finally hit
<strong>Apply</strong>. This may take a while.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>For reference go through the below article:</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2623670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Access Denied" or other errors when you access or work with files and folders in Windows</a></strong></p>
<p>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. Reply to the post with an updated status of the issue to assist you further.</span></p>

            Hi sujatjain, you can switch out of S Mode for free, there is no time limit, there used to be a charge for switching out of S Mode, there no longer is . .. 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />In the Switch to Windows 10 Home or Switch to Windows 10 Pro section, select Go to the Store. (If you also see an "Upgrade your edition of Windows" section, be careful not to click the "Go to the Store" link that appears there.)
<br />
<br />On the Switch out of S mode (or similar) page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.
<br />
<br />After you see a confirmation message on the page, you'll be able to install apps from outside of the Microsoft Store.

    <title>Skype for Business account listed, but it does not exist - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype for Business account listed, but it does not exist</h2>
                    When a customer searches for my corporate email, 2 accounts appear, one that I use normally and the other "Skype for Business" does not exist (I did not create nor did my company create). Trying to send a Skype message to this "business" account doesn¬¥t
 work, it just seems like a fake account linked to the Office license, but I'd like to hide, avoiding contact in vain.

<p>Hi vitorcanato,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you can search this user, the Skype for Business user should exist. Based on your description, you may use Skype. In this situation, the Skype for Business user may not response your message because the user are not allowed to communicate with external
 Skype users. For your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34badcf5-aded-498f-ad7f-b32d99302c8a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34badcf5-aded-498f-ad7f-b32d99302c8a?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>And it isn‚Äôt feasible to hide the Skype for Business account. Your understanding is much appreciated.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had to finish a project today so I uninstalled/reinstalled the program.</p>
<p>I am thinking that when I open a picture in picture viewer or something like that... then right click to edit in Adobe this is when the application fails, and then cannot recover, where I then need to reinstall the application.&nbsp; But that's just a thought...
 thanks for looking into this.</p>

            <p>From the loaded modules I&nbsp;can't see anything that stands out as a issue.&nbsp;The saHook.dll from McAfee Site Advisor is loaded during both crashes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I might suggest is to capture a user-mode dump of the&nbsp;PhotoshopElementsEditor.exe crash to get more information on the crash and to see if a third party module is causing the crash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as pedump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time&nbsp;PhotoshopElementsEditor.exe
 crashes&nbsp;should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\PhotoshopElementsEditor.exe]<br />

00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
</strong></em><br />
<br />
After&nbsp;PhotoshopElementsEditor.exe crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?<br />
<br />
The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>

    <title>How to disable PC speaker option&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattdp101  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to disable PC speaker option&#63;</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit on a Gateway NV56.&nbsp; Like other Gateways, I have the incredibly annoying beep when the power cord is connected or disconnected.&nbsp; My cord is a little loose now, so it's becoming even worse.&nbsp; From my own searches,
 I found instructions to disable the PC Speaker. (Right click on speaker icon, select Playback, right click on Speakers, select Properties, select Levels, mute PC speaker.)&nbsp; But I DO NOT HAVE a PC Speaker option, only the single Speaker option.&nbsp; Muting the
 speaker option mutes all sound from the speakers.&nbsp; I only want to disable system sounds like the beep.<br />
<br />
I found a help article where I could download the PC Speaker driver (I thought maybe it had been corrupted and I needed to reinstall) but the driver only worked for ME, XP and Vista.&nbsp; I need to find/install/enable the PC Speaker option for 64 bit Windows 7.&nbsp;
 Is there a driver to download or a system work-around?&nbsp; Thank you!<br />

            Fixed!&nbsp; I updated the audio driver (Conexant 4.98.9.) downloaded from the Gateway website.&nbsp; Once installed, it gave me the PC Speaker option in Playback levels that I disabled.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I suppose Gateway knew about the problem and released an updated driver with the additional option.&nbsp; Sweet relief!<br />
