<h2>            Nikon D5600 NEF format impossible to edit under Photo Editor</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The photo editor of Win10 cannot edit raw image files written by D5600 Nikon camera. I supose this is because the format is rather new and hasn t been fully supported yet. Initially it was not even possible to view (had to install a codec)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any plan for fixing this issue?</p>
<p>The message is</p>
<p><strong>We're having trouble opening this file for editing.</strong></p>
<p><em>Canțt edit</em></p>
<p>For other Nikon nef files (like D3300 for example) there were no issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>On my Desktop with build 16199 I can edit the but when saving a copy it is converted to .jpg
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not do a lot of photo editing but Nikon has free software at least they did when I bought my D3200. Guess more can be done with the RAW format. I just take a lot of photos and have the camera set to create just the .jpg format then go through all the
 photos and remove the ones I don't like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I changed the camera to make a .NEF and Cropped it and saved a copy.</p>

<p>Everything I've seen on the web claims there's no way a NEF can be edited and rewritten as a NEF except by the software that comes with the camera. &nbsp;If a NEF's codec is installed, Photos can edit it but can only save it by converting to a different format
 such as jpg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes sense because NEFs can only be edited nondestructively. &nbsp;The original file remains intact but with a layer of instructions on how to edit it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Photos ever "rewrote" a NEF, it may actually have been a programming bug that caused it to use the same filename extension. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: &nbsp;It looks like I misunderstood the OP. &nbsp;The problem is the codec is present but Photos can't edit it at all. &nbsp;That seems to make no sense at all; does anyone have a clue as to what might be wrong?</p>

<p>If you want software to work with your camera without paying for it just go to Nikon. The same software that works with my camera works with yours NEF is NEF.

<p>Hi Tom</p>
<p>Maybe I didn't make myself sufficiently clear: of course I do not intend to edit&nbsp;a NEF file while preserving the original format. I normally use to convert the processed file into a JPEG format. The problem was that photo editor cannot open D5600 generated
 NEF files for editing while it has no issues in doing the same&nbsp;on NEFs &nbsp;generated by other cameras (like D3300 in my case) types</p>
<p>Actually I did receive an email from Nikon Support suggesting me to use their own free editing legacy software
<a href="http://downloadcenter.nikonimglib.com/en/products/220/ViewNX-i.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://downloadcenter.</a> which I've been successfully using ever since</p>
<p>Thanks for all your support</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 takes forever to load files - Vista</h2>
                    Have had Windows Media Player 11 and Vista for well over a year. Suddenly about a month ago, it takes forever to load files in my WMP.&nbsp; I'm talking about files on my computer as well as attached to emails (Windows Mail).&nbsp; When I double click, the Media
 player screen pops up right away, but takes almost a minute to start playing, no matter what size of file.&nbsp; Eventually it plays.&nbsp; I have verified that Windows Media Player is the default program for playing WMV files, which are most of the files I'm talking
 about.&nbsp; Almost seems like a security thing.&nbsp; I have Semantic's Norton Anti Virus.

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
If this is a recent problem, try doing a system restore back to before the problem started.<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps: <br />
Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
<br />
In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.<br />
In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.
<br />
Click Finish.<br />
The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.<br />
<br />
If that does not work, or you don't have a restore point for the right time period, try disabling your security software and test it to see if that is the cause.<br />
<br />
Also try doing a clean boot to see if the issue may be caused by a third party program or process:<br />

<h2>            Cannot access Windows 7 Share - Error 0x80070035 network path not found</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Hi,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I have a small LAN with five PC's (two Windows 10 and three Windows 7).&nbsp; I have assigned all of these PC's to the same Workgroup (which I named "MAIN").&nbsp; All five PC's are set to Obtain an IP address automatically.&nbsp; My wireless router assigns each PC with an
 address in the range 192.168.2.x.&nbsp; The router itself is at at address 192.168.2.1.&nbsp; I have created shares on all five PC's by right-clicking on the folder I'd like to share and choosing Properties.&nbsp; On the Sharing tab, I chose "Advanced Sharing" and clicked
 the checkbox for "Share this folder".&nbsp; I assigned it a share name and added Full Control permissions for both the local Administrators group and also for one particular user (who happens to be a member of the local administrators group).&nbsp; On the Security tab,
 I also assigned Full Control permissions to the local Administrators group and for the same particular user as on the Sharing tab.&nbsp; In Control Panel | Network and Sharing Center | Advanced Sharing Settings, for my current profile (which happens to be work),
 I have Network Discovery ON, File &amp; Printer Sharing ON, Public Folder Sharing OFF, Media Streaming OFF, File Sharing connections set to 128-bit encryption, password protected sharing ON, and I have selected "Allow Windows to manage homegroup connections".&nbsp;
 I have used these same settings on all five PC's and my shares work just fine on four out of the five, but I am unable to access one of the Windows 7 PC's (named \\BAK-THINK) through the network.&nbsp; When I browse the Network folder on any of the other four PC's,
 \\BAK-THINK does appear in the list of connected PC's, but when I double-click on it, I get a message saying "Windows cannot access \\BAK-THINK.&nbsp; Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network.&nbsp; To try to identify and
 resolve network problems, click Diagnose."&nbsp; If I select "See Details", it shows Error Code 0x80070035 - "The network path was not found".&nbsp; Clicking the Diagnose button does not solve the problem.&nbsp; I do have Norton 360 firewall/security suite installed and
 running on \\BAK-THINK (and also on the other computers), but I have it configured to allow all traffic on the local subnet.&nbsp; Even if I disable Norton, it still does not solve my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Interestingly, I AM able to access shares on any of the other four PC's from \\BAK-THINK, so this makes me think that I do have network connectivity, but there is some security setting (unknown to me) that is blocking access from the other PC's.&nbsp; If anyone
 has a suggestion as to how I can solve this problem, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Thanks in advance,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Paul</p>

<h2>            Disk not usable..&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My laptop's CD/DVD driver is recognizing the CD, but will not allow me to burn anything. Whenever I try, it says: "There was an error burning this disc. The disc might no longer be usable." However, all the CD-R discs I have tried were blank and brand new.
 Before when I had Windows Vista the CD/DVD Burner worked fine, but this is the first time I have tried to burn something with Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted the two registries as well, which I saw to do on another post, but it still isn't working.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The DVD drive does not function after you install Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975270/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975270/</span></a></p>
<p>Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Did you run the Upgrade Advisor and check the Compatibility Center?<br />
<br />

<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>Also check the Compatibility Center <br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>You might also need to contact the System maker for special instructions, drivers, and/or known issues.</p>
<p>=========================================================<br />
=========================================================<br />
<br />
The below might help :</p>
<p>You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD burn and
<br />
CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others&nbsp;do so
<br />
properly. <br />
<br />
Burning at slower speeds or using the Master Format might help.&nbsp;A CD/DVD cleaner might help.<br />
<br />
CD's have a +- tolerance and yours might&nbsp;read/write on the edge outside of those discs&nbsp;tolerances.
<br />
They can be realigned however it is usually more economical to replace the drive.

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your
<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays
<br />
all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

            <p>While the OP hasn't put his point across very well, I can kind of see the train of thought he's been following.<br /><br />The big advantages of consoles was that you could buy a console at the start of the generation and, revisions for size and power efficiency aside,&nbsp;the console you could buy at the end of the generation would be the same. No matter when you buy, you get the same experience.<br /><br />However this generation from Microsoft has bucked that trend somewhat. A person who bought an Xbox One at the start of the generation now clearly has an inferior console to someone who is buying one in the middle of the generation with the S or the X (especially the latter).<br /><br />I imagine the OP is feeling annoyed at having the 'worst' Xbox One model. And of course I'm not forgetting Sony here and their upgraded machine, they get&nbsp;just a slight leeway since their base model is still available to buy.</p>

    <title>Which version of XP Pro do I need&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Which version of XP Pro do I need&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I apologize in advance if this is a repeat topic, but I cannot find the answer I am looking for.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cnet.com%2fi%2fmb%2femoticons%2fsad.gif" /><br />
<br />
I have recently been asked to re-install windows on a Laptop that a friend of mine bought off ebay, it came pre-installed with Windows XP (he didn't say which version-but I'm hoping it was the original) but he had a problem and formatted it before he realised
 he didn't have the disk to re-install from. This is where I come in.<br />
<br />
This Laptop has a Windows CoA on the bottom so I had hoped to install the same version of Windows as it was shipped with, But I don't know which version I need.<br />
<br />
I have contacted the vendor RM plc (a specialist company that provide computers to schools and students) but they claim the machine is out of warranty and refuse to help
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cnet.com%2fi%2fmb%2femoticons%2fsad.gif" /><br />
<br />
Anyway the CoA has the following info (obviously I'm not going to type the real Product Key here but everything else is accurate)<br />
<br />
so anyway, as you look at the sticker, you see the following information...<br />
<br />
Windows XP Professional 1-2 CPU<br />
RM<br />
[barcode] OFZ-633<br />
Product Key: ?????-?????-?????-?????-?????<br />
[barcode]<br />
00045-417-081-734<br />
<br />
Also rotated 90 degrees and on the left hand edge of the sticker is...<br />
X08-73060<br />
<br />
The Problem I am having is that of the copies of XP Pro that I have, both are Volume Licence, one 32 and one 64 bit,
<br />
the 64bit won't even load as the cpu is an intel P4 mobile 1.9GHz<br />
and the 32bit gets as far as asking for the Product Key but won't accept it.<br />
I have read that you can change the Pid in setupp.ini but am in the dark as to what to change it to, have tried a couple of the OEM codes floating around on the interweb, but with no joy.<br />
Can anyone identify which version of XP Pro (or Pid) I need to install <br />
thanks in advance

<p><br />
No need to do that. And definitely DON'T post the product key either!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since that's not a major brand name, you will definitely need to obtain a generic OEM (aka System Builder's) Windows XP Pro installation CD, assuming your COA sticker is for an OEM version of XP Pro.</p>

<h2>            No boot disk has been detected or the disk has failed plus slow programs</h2>
                    I just bought an HP all-in-one Pavillion PC and since day one I have had multiple problems. &nbsp;Half the time when I boot up I get the "no boot disk" message and half the time I don't. &nbsp;I can't seem to run more than one program at a time or the rest of the
 computer lags behind. &nbsp;I can't listen to music on it while doing anything else because it actually "skips" the music like old CDs and records used to. &nbsp;This is my first time with an HP and I'm almost ready to return it. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

    <title>Fax and Scan does not recognize my Modem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronrosenfeld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fax and Scan does not recognize my Modem</h2>
                    <p>Windows Fax and Scan does not seem to recognize that my modem is a fax modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>W10 Pro 10586</p>
<p>Modem:&nbsp; US Robotics 56K Fax PCI&nbsp; (Internal Modem)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The modem worked on this computer running Windows 7</p>
<p>I don't recall if I've tried it since installing W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a clean install of W10.</p>
<p>There is a Fax printer in Devices and Printers.</p>
<p>I can start WFS</p>
<p>&nbsp; Navigate to Tools/Fax Settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;Although the Device name is present, the option to "Select Fax Device" is grayed out.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a88851cb-1afd-432b-9c1a-458e74da4d38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a88851cb-1afd-432b-9c1a-458e74da4d38" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select OK, WFS continues to be unable to send a Fax</p>
<p>If I navigate to Tools/Fax Accounts/Add Account, it tells me I need to Connect to a Fax Modem.&nbsp; If I go through the options, choosing the defaults to try to attach a modem, although it seems as if it might be connecting, I eventually get to an error message
 telling me I need to connect to a Fax Modem:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22cae1ea-ed41-4c4d-a497-4b879a67b8dd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22cae1ea-ed41-4c4d-a497-4b879a67b8dd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I continue, the program will eventually become non-responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I could not find anything relevant in the Event Viewer, but I might not be looking/searching in the right place.</li><li>I have disabled, rebooted, and re-enabled the Windows Fax feature</li><li>I have removed and re-installed the modem in Device Manager</li><li>I have physically removed, cleaned,&nbsp;and reseated the modem card</li><li>I have executed the modem diagnostics in Device manager with no errors reported</li><li>I can make telephone calls from Outlook 2016</li><li>And, as I wrote above, this card did work when I was running Windows 7</li></ul>
<p>Any help/suggestions much appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>I had the same problem and finally fixed it.&nbsp; It was a problem with a windows firewall permission.&nbsp; I went to add account, connect to a fax modem,&nbsp; name the modem, then chose the last option on the next page instead of the first one which kept giving me
 the message to set up an account...</p>
<p>&nbsp;By choosing the last option it came up with a new window that said I needed to allow a windows firewall permission.&nbsp; Problem fixed!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone else.....</p>

            Hi there!<br /><br />If you are trying to call the same user in Skype you won’t make the call because you are not able to add yourself as a contact. But if you try to call a phone number at the same time you use the account to call another number from another device, yes you can do it.

            No, both of you would need to have separate accounts in order to communicate with each other. 
<br />
<br />It would just disconnect if you try to contact the same account you are sending the call from.

    <title>Xbox One using Ethernet adaptive link rate &#63; &#40;toggles between - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philippe majerus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One using Ethernet adaptive link rate &#63; &#40;toggles between 100Mbps and 10Mbps link speed&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I had the Xbox One connected to a switch (Catalyst 2960 series)&nbsp;configured to enforce 100Mbps full-duplex on that port (interface fastEthernet 0/X; speed 100; duplex full), and noticed that the port sometimes went into a "link is faulty"&nbsp;error state (LED
 blinking green and amber) and then returning to a good link. This could be seen in a loop several times per minutes while downloading games to the Xbox.</p>
<p>The Xbox wasn't showing any error and downloads would still continue, but I wanted to find out why the link went faulty regularly.</p>
<p>I configured the port to automatic speed and duplex again (speed auto; duplex auto)&nbsp;and noticed the link now stayed good. However there is a new weird behavior...</p>
<p>It seems the Xbox changes the link speed between 100Mbps and 10Mbps dynamically.<br />
It mostly goes into 10Mbps when in connected standby and back to 100Mbps when turned on. However, it seems it also dynamically toggles between 100Mbps and 10Mbps even while on and actively downloading (which might still be the right thing to do, since it's
 connected to the Internet over a 40Mbps uplink and therefore the 100Mbps link can be suspended about 60% of the time with no effective speed difference).</p>
<p>Can anyone confirm if the Xbox One uses some kind of adaptive link rate to save power and if the link dropping to 10Mbps is expected&nbsp;?<br />
If so, could there be a note in the support site about the best way to configure a managed switch for the Xbox One, mentioning that the port should be configured for automatic speed negotiation instead of fixing it to 100Mbps. It&nbsp;seems like valuable information
 that should be written somewhere.<br />
The Xbox OS should also&nbsp;test the dynamic link speed&nbsp;reliability&nbsp;as part of its network diagnostic tests and show a warning if the link is faulty when using 10Mbps, so that people who do have control over that on the switch side could find out and configure
 the switch properly.</p>

<p>I've noticed mine is also doing this, toggling between 10Mbps and 100Mbps and effectively shutting down the switchport between these changes. &nbsp;Unfortunately I can't change the port settings, but as you I've not noticed any issues when using the Xbox (I've
 only had it for a couple of days though).</p>

            <p>You post Interesting results. I had wired my house with CAT6 and noticed that when I connected my XBOX One that the link speed almost always showed 10Mbps to my HP Procurve&nbsp;HP 1810-24G. I assumed a bad termination or cable and swapped some stuff around and confirmed that the network drop was in fact fine, and when I connected the XBOX to a Netgear "smart" switch that it also showed a 10Mbps link. Your post got me to testing active versus standby and sure enough the link speed jumps up to Gbps when active. It is also the only port on the switch that generates packets with errors and that appears to happen coming out of standby. I have three network drops in that wall box and I see the same behavior with all three while the other devices connected do not exhibit the behaviors. I've swapped out patch cables with no change in results. If I were a betting man, I'd say there was something wrong with the hardware or more likely driver/software on the XBOX One console.</p>

<h2>            How do I install Xbox Minecraft on my Windows 10 PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased the latest version of Minecraft via my Xbox One. I would like to install it on my PC. (Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the Microsoft Store and click Buy, it says "You already own this title."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on Install on My Devices, it only shows my Xbox One, not the PC I am logged into while typing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I get it installed on my PC?</p>

<p>King I did read somewhere that you had to have an actual disc copy of it right now in order for it to work. &nbsp;It was one of the few Xbox 360 games that I had hard copies of that I kept. &nbsp;Maybe look for a cheap disc copy off of amazon.</p>

<p>Well, I was hoping they would make it available to buy from XBL now that it is BC. I have been looking for that game for years &amp; never managed to find a copy. I'll keep trying.</p>
<p>Speaking of discs, anyone has DEUS EX for 360 Directors Cut with 2 discs. Cuz Mine won't work &nbsp;but I can download the non directors cut version from XBL. I tought it would work now that the Witcher 2 works &amp; it also has 2 discs &amp; the reason they said DEUS
 EX did not work is cuz it had 2 discs, anyone &nbsp;know whats up with that?</p>
<p>cheers!?</p>

<h2>            Someone else using my account&#63; Old email linked to Skype - can not get access&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to log on to Skype today I got a message saying "It looks like some else might be using your account,- in order to get get it back we need to verify that its yours". I have a feeling it happened because I aborted the logon to Skype on my iPhone
 this morning and at that time was not logged in on my desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that my Skype is linked to an old email address and mobile number to which I dont have access to anymore. When I try to answer the questions the reply I get from Microsoft is basically that the answers werent good enough so they can not let
 me use the account even though I have the correct username and password! Not so strange really because quite a few of the questions ask for last emails I sent / subjects of same emails which obv is difficult to provide when I dont have access to the email
 anymore..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my Skype for work and have more than 700 contacts so its a small disaster if its all gone. Someone in Microsoft/Skype please help!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>

            I do have the SkyDrive app installed, I was looking to keep the local Documents folder, so I could work from and save documents there, and sync that with the SkyDrive folder, so effectively having the files in 2 locations on the hard drive, and in the
 cloud, without using any other software like SyncToy. I think it's just easier to copy everything to the SkyDrive folder and use that from now on, then everything will be on the hard drive and in the cloud anyway, hopefully.

    <title>FSX Acceleration Pack is installed after FSX and requires activation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            FSX Acceleration Pack is installed after FSX and requires activation</h2>
                    Hello guys,<br />
<br />
I purchased the Flight Simulator X, I activated it, &nbsp;and it runs great. After some months I bought the FSX Acceleration Pack and after 30 minutes I receive the message about to activate the FSX Acceleration and make a phone call to 1-800.<br />
In the downloads option of FSX game I can see two Service Packs:<br />
<br />
- SP1: about Activation and installation, Third party Issues, Performance enhancements and Content Issues.<br />
But I can read: If you have already installed the&nbsp;<em>Flight Simulator X: Acceleration
</em>expansion pack<em>,&nbsp;</em>do not&nbsp;install Service Pack 1.<br />
<br />
- SP1: about Multiplayer&nbsp;compatibility with Flight Simulator.<br />
Notes:
<li><span><span><span>Service Pack 2 does not include the code updates required to use the new
<em>Flight Simulator X: Acceleration </em>aircraft. You must purchase and install&nbsp;<em>Flight Simulator X: Acceleration
</em>to use those aircraft.</span></span></span>
<p>Then, I purchased and Installe the Acceleration pack but it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion is welcome<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now, I can't to play even the standard planes of FSX more than 30 minutes.</p>
