<h2>            How to create a new power plan based on an existing custom &#40;OEM&#41; plan &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Beside the usual, Windows default "Balanced" power plan, my new Dell laptop has a custom OEM power plan (named "Dell").</p>
<p>I'd like to create my own power plan, but Win10 only allows me to create one based on the Balanced one, not the OEM (Dell) one. I'd prefer to start from the Dell plan, because I would think it is best tuned for my system. Could there be special, hidden,
 DELL-specific settings in the Dell plan ? How can I create a new plan based on the Dell plan ? Or am I just not missing any subtle Dell tuning by starting from the Balanced (Windows default) plan instead ?

            HI Benoit.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The Dell Power Plan is nothing special with only what you see as settings.  It's considered bloatware by most enthusiasts and goes away when you Clean Install to get rid of the factory bloatware which most all enthusiasts eventually do.  
<br />
<br />To create a Custom Power Plan see here, which applies the same to Dell Factory Install:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-manage-custom-power-plans-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-manage-custo...</a>
<br />
<br />When ready  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can mitigate the bloatware and inferior factory install somewhat by going over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Especially Step 4 to turn off Startup Freeloaders can mitigate the bloatware overhead almost entirely without having to remove it.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Deleting apps that I own from my Surface Pro 6.  What does hiding an app do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey Microsoft,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First of all, thank you for making such great computers! My Surface Pro has been fantastic! Now. I have a concern. By hiding the apps that I downloaded from the store, does that delete the app or just make the app hidden from view? If it just hides
 it from view, is there an app that could be downloaded that would delete these apps? I didn't realize that these apps couldn't be erased from the laptop and i have to use it for school. these apps are taking up 75% of my storage! If there isn't anything that
 I can do, I will just erase all memory from the computer. It would be great if you guys could develop this. thanks so much!<br />

            Hey Dylan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First check if the app has an Uninstall button in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; App Name &gt; Advanced Settings.  
<br />
<br />If not then there is an uninstaller from the IT Pros at Microsoft Technet that will load all the Store apps and provide an uninstaller for each to safely uninstall it.  But there may be consequences although they are minor, e.g. removing Edge removes Bing web results from Search (no biggie, right?).  So I'd save a System Restore point labeled for each one you remove so you can go back if necessary:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go here to download and run Uninstaller, load the apps and use the Uninstaller for each one you want to remove:  <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Windows-10-Store-Apps-5f60b9e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcen...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you Greg for responding so quickly. I will most definitely check these down load out.&nbsp; I was wondering how to use&nbsp;<a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Windows-10-Store-Apps-5f60b9e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcen...</a><span>&nbsp;to

            TechNet is actually the Microsoft forums site for IT Pros like business and college IT desks.   To use the Uninstaller they host, download and run it, click the button to load the Store apps, then choose the ones you want to uninstall and run each one, one at a time.
<br />
<br />Be sure to set a System Restore point first so you can go back if you change your mind:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's pretty easy though to just ignore the apps you don't want without having to remove them.  I don't use half of them and they never bother me.

<h2>            2tb of data i need to retrieve GPT protected partition windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hey There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm desperate to find a solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this 1-2 years ago</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Seagate-External-STCA4000100-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00829THLE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.ca/Seagate-External-STCA4000100-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B00829THLE</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>End up putting it in my pc directly via SATA and stored vital information on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I purchase a NAS, I wanted to transfer all that data to it.</p>
<p>To get the fatest transfer rate i decided to remove the drive from the computer and actually plug it back to its USB 3.0 adaptor so that I can connect it to the NAS and benefit the usb 3.0 transfer speed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gearhack.com/docs/Seagate%20FreeAgent%20GoFlex%20Desktop%20External%20Hard%20Drive%20Disassembly.html.files.hidden/Detactable%20Dock.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gearhack.com/docs/Seagate%20FreeAgent%20GoFlex%20Desktop%20External%20Hard%20Drive%20Disassembly.html.files.hidden/Detactable%20Dock.jpg</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>BIGGEST ERROR ever done on earth !!!! :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drive isnt detected properly on NAS so hook it up on my pc via the same USB adaptor....drive show up as GPT protected partition !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hookup the drive directly to my computer via SATA....Drive isn't even showing in disk management !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Start searching the web and then found this;</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; know that Seagate does something with the connector on some of it's larger external drives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Basically, if you remove the drive from the enclosure or remove the plugin adapter section and use a SATA &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cable, the drive shows up empty... They use something in their controller
 that requires that you use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the same token, if you were to format the drive without the enclosure or adapter and then hook it back &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;up, it will also show empty...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please tell me there's a way to recuperate all data that I have there as I know the drive isn't dead but it's that freaking seagate USB &nbsp;controler that change something on my drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now i can access all my file but my adaptor only support usb 2.0....oh well..I did retrieve my data and for that I can wait a dozen more hours lol !!!</p>

    <title>Windows 7 OS file names and how to get at - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 OS file names and how to get at</h2>
                    <p>I have lost access to MMC (task services Tools etc) due to a registry hack or failure a few years ago on my laptop, thus I could not cleaned up history files so my C drive has reached 90+% usage.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am trying to fix win 7 so I can update to win 10 but I need more free disk space.&nbsp; I have got 19gb now from moving all personal data off but still short my 10 GB.
</p>
<p>I ran cleaner, deleted temp system files had msgt tech support try with no luck, they gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I see.&nbsp; When check space used "Windows" folder under "c" drive it sit sat 67.5GB USED.&nbsp; When I run "Disk Cleanup"&nbsp; I notice it stays in a file folder "system error memory dump file" (something like that) for a minute.&nbsp; This leads me to believe
 with the loss of "Tools" I have let this folder fill up my "c" drive.&nbsp; I have asked msft tech for the file "ignored"&nbsp; so thought others would know how I might fined this folder and delete the dumps.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I also assume "system Log" files are full too.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can get 36GB free, I can ISO load window 7, fix it which is preventing win 10 due to an update failure in win 7.&nbsp; I then can load wind 10 saving all my settings using wind 10 ISO 1903 download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also my laptop started with Vista, then moved to window 7.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long post.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If not able to get space, its "clean load wind 10" and a lot of work.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>If that is your time zone then yes. Is the clock in the system tray the correct time? If not you can set the correct time by right click system tray clock, select Adjust date/time. The settings window&nbsp;will open, scroll to bottom and select Additional date,
 time, &amp; regional settings. On the next window select Date and Time. Internet Time Tab, then a change settings. A new window select update now. That should set the clock to the right time.</p>

<h2>            Installing Jenkins outside of &#34;Program Files &#40;x86&#41;&#34; directory</h2>
                    I installed Jenkins server on my Surface in the&nbsp;"Program Files (x86)" directory. I later wanted to edit a config file to change the port, but it wouldn't let me since I didn't have permissions. Is there anything wrong with installing Jenkins server or
 other programs outside of the&nbsp;"Program Files (x86)" directory assuming the installer permits the directory to be changed.&nbsp;

            Hi Brian, there is nothing wrong with installing some software outside of Program Files. In fact applications like Jenkins WAMP, XAMMP . . . etc. where you need to edit  the server config files are usually installed to a folder in the root of your C Drive

<p>Your internet company is probably right.&nbsp; Are you sure that you didn't mean "RPC Service" instead of "RPC Server"?</p>
<p>Assuming you meant "service", bring up the Services window:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "services.msc"</p>
<p>Then scroll down to the line labeled "Remote Procedure Call (RPC)".&nbsp; The "Status" column should read "Started" and the "startup type" column should read "Automatic".&nbsp; If not, double-click on that line and in the screen that pops up, change it to be that
 way.&nbsp; Being that this is a basic component, you might not be able to change anything (controls may be grayed-out).</p>

<p>This error would indicate that the underlying command executed when you try to renew is the command "ip" which is not a recognized Windows command.&nbsp; This leads to the question as to how you are renewing the connection.&nbsp; (Normally you do not have to renew
 connections as they should auto-renew when the lease is 1/2 expired).&nbsp; Try renewing it manually from a command prompt.&nbsp; The errors are usually more descriptive...</p>
<p>Bring up a command prompt window (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd")<br />
Enter the command:<br />
&nbsp; ipconfig /renew</p>
<p>See if any errors are generated when you attempt to renew this way.&nbsp; If you do get errors, try referring to this article:</p>
<p>"Error Message When You Run the "Ipconfig /Renew" Command"<br />

<h2>            &#34;there isn&#39;t enough memory available to save your movie</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
I have questions related to saving and sharing a movie

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Movie Maker are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3502.922)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
</p>
<p>Sorry, i don't know how to tell which version of windows live movie maker i am using, i have looked in properties.<br />
my issue is suddenly i cannot save a movie, because it says i do not have sufficient memory.
<br />
<br />
Background.<br />
this is the 5 full high definition (FHD)&nbsp;movie i have saved. i have kept them to under 10 minutes to save on stressing my computer out. all other "movies" are fine and i have transferred them to an external HDD and watched in FHD on my telly.<br />
<br />
i have emptied my recycle bin.<br />
<br />
i have 180 gig of space left on my computers hard drives.<br />
<br />
i am not very good with computers but have managed to save others movies in FHD and watch them on telly. i dont know why it suddently says i have insufficent memory.<br />
<br />
i am saving the movies as FHD beacuae thats is what my video camera is and my telly is, it seems pointless to save as DVD when it is not utilising the capabilities of my other equipemt. i do not have a blu ray burner hence i am saving to a external hdd and
 watching that way.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</p>

<p><span>Hi
<span>marcusvideo,</span><br />
<br />
One possible reason for this issue might be due to your computer is not meeting the system requirements for Windows Live Movie Maker. Meeting the system requirements is essential for the program for it affects the performance of the program. Please click

<br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Note</strong>: The requirements listed on the link provided above are only the minimum of what the program needs, meaning, if your computer exceeded those requirements,
 the better the performance of the program.<br />
<br />
Another reason is that you have an outdated version of Windows Live Movie Maker in your computer. To make sure that it is not contributing on your issue, please donwload the latest version of Windows Live Movie Maker in your computer. Refer to the link below:<br />

            Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the answer, but unfortunately it doesn't help. I have Windows Movie Maker 2012 (Build 16.4.3505.0912) running on a laptop with Windows 7, 4gb of RAM and 200Gb of free space, but I still get the "not enough memory" message.<br />
<br />
I tried everything I could possibly imagine. I increased the virtual memory, killed almost every running process but it still doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Apparently this issue is extremely common - there are lots and lots of users complaining about this in online forums. Does Microsoft have any plans to solve this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Eduardo<br />

            <p>Eduardo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you been able to save any movies out of Movie Maker 2012?&nbsp; For example, if you try a sequence of photos?&nbsp; Or some of the sample videos?&nbsp; What about if you work with one short FHD clip and make minor edits?&nbsp; Knowing those answers will help diagnose the
 error as a problem with Movie Maker or a problem with the source files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it turns out to be the source files, you might try converting them to HD .wmv format using something like Freemake Video Converter.&nbsp; I suggest .wmv since that is what Movie Maker prefers.&nbsp; See if a converted file will work as expected in Movie Maker 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing to check is that you have the latest driver for your GPU (graphics card/chip).&nbsp; If you haven't updated it recently, check the manufacturer's website for an update.</p>

            Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
The project I'm trying to export has only 1,5 minutes, it's a series of 4 MTS videos sped 64 times. I'm able to export it only in non-HD.<br />
<br />
I've got the latest Movie Maker version, the latest drivers for my Graphics Card and I tried everything possible. I even tried converting the videos to WMV and used a friend's PC (i7 processor with 8gb RAM) but the issue is still the same.<br />
<br />
I ended up using Sony Vegas and it worked perfectly. Anyway, this is a very common issue in Movie Maker (just search the Internet and you'll see it) and I think it would sensible for Microsoft to chase it up and fix it.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway,<br />
<br />

Well, I manage to save one project in HD 1080 wmv format movie, but I had to:<br />
- close all unnecessary processes <br />
- adjust my computer -&gt; properties -&gt; system properties -&gt; advanced -&gt; performance settings -&gt;on tab visual effects i have changed from "Let's Windows choose whats best" to "Adjust for best performace"<br />
- open WLMM project I want to save<br />
- log in to windows movie maker live<br />
- totally disable antivirus protection<br />
- stop breathing<br />
I guess I was lucky :)<br />

            I have exactly the same problem. I have just updated both movie maker and the vid card drivers and i am getting the same error message.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can you tell me if MS has a fix for this or are we just supposed to use alternate software?<br />
<br />
i am trying to make an animation using about 1000 photos - the laptop has bags of memory and easily supports everything else I ask it to do. I have also noticed that movie maker has tons of errors and wierd quirks that interrupt the use of this program.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
PLEASE can someone at MS tell us what we are supposed to do about this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks.&nbsp;

            Don't expect a reply from MS, they're gonna give the same useless answers over and over again: update your drivers, convert your source files to a different format, add RAM to your machine, improve your virtual memory size etc etc etc<br />
<br />
This is very frustrating, given MS is such a great company with great products, but that's how it is.<br />
<br />
Use Sony Vegas and you'll see what a really good movie software is all about. Forget about Movie Maker.<br />

            THanks Eduado. I've updated the drivers, source files are jpgs, have double the RAM on machine to 4Gb so should be ample. It just looks like **** software. It has loads of other quirks too.   Have looked at Vegas but it costs a fortune. Are there any other (completely) free video editors out there? THanks.

<h2>            Pro 3 3.5mm jack issue... Only one side of earphone produce sound..</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I having an issue regarding to my surface pro 3 which my earphone only produce sound on right side channel after plugged-in 3.5mm jack, but no sound from left side.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following are scenario I tried:-</p>
<p>1.I tried many different brand of earphones &amp; headphone, but results still same. I can gurantee this is not earphone problem..</p>
<p>2.I also tried using bluetooth headphone &amp; connecting via bluetooth which's working fine and no issue at all.</p>
<p>3. Just double checked, there's no dust or any other obstacles within 3.5 mm jack. Clean...</p>
<p>4. I tried to plugged-in loosely which left &amp; right produced sound properly. But when plugged-in tightly &amp; fully, it will back to one channel sound... (I just wonder whether is it the beveled design on the side of surface pro 3 is the root cause of improper
 plugged-in ??) </p>

<p>Hi, the best way is to register to their website, they have an Xbox Live login to make it easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have registered you will be able to access the achievement trackers and also be able to use it on your xbox console through the app.</p>

<p>Sign up for an account with your tag.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once toy are signed in there is an icon in the top right corner next to your gamertag to force scan your account.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can do that a limited amount of times per day with a free account (unlimited with pro). That will
 bring your recent achievements on site and you can drill into the game you want to see your progress in.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>virtual cdrom on USB Stick won&#39;t install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            virtual cdrom on USB Stick won&#39;t install</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
A friend's Toshiba Laptop should be upgraded by USB-Stick for WLAn (from Chello.at) and mobile internet (from Aon.at): Notebook Thoshiba SPA40 GR, Model no PSA45E-0024M-GR. Windowx XP SP3, IE8, Avast AV, Ashampoo Firewall; System free of errors and clean.<br />
<br />
I'm giving all details below though I think it must be a windows problem.<br />
<br />
Two sticks of different make seem to have the required hardware (WLan adapter and mobile broadband) as well as the requried software on a built in virtual CDRom USB-stick. Both sticks are working fine on other machines, XP as well as Win2k.<br />
<br />
Problem: (with both sticks the same) - Sequence of actions:<br />
<br />
Stick is plugged in USB 2.0 slot, after a short while new hardware is detected and "installed" (not really, see below). Stick first blinks differently, but after a while consistently in about half-second intervals. notihng else happens.<br />
<br />
Taskbar shows ikon "remove hardware", which doesn't work, but shows "remove Drive G" clickable. If clicked, nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Opening Desktop doesn't show any ressource (drives) - none .... neither C: or D: or anything else<br />
<br />
Opening Explorer shows a (new) CD-Drive G:, which cannot be opened but stalls Explorer (hourglass).<br />
<br />
Deskotp/Context | Device Manager shows additional CD-ROM: "virtual CDRom 0ace20ff USB Device", no error symbol at all.<br />
<br />
Changeing to "show disabled Devices" (or however this may read in english) shows one unknown Device with Error-ikon. (Presumeably it's the WLAN or mobile device that should be installed from new drive G:)<br />
<br />
Stick cannot be removed by ikon "remove USB device" in taskbar; closing Desktop (or explorer, the same) leads to "program doesn't respond"; clicking "terminate immediately" and closing Desktop results in blank XP splash screen, nothing else, except mouse pointer
 - no Startbutton, no task bar, no systray ... nothing.<br />
<br />
Maschine seems dead until Stick is pulled, after about 10 seconds Windows shows up again and works perfectly.<br />
<br />
I hoped that updated chipset drivers would mend the problem (presumeably with USB master drivers or so), but installing those inf-files and tryining to update drivers didn't change anything on the sit.<br />
<br />
I'd be very grateful for any hint one could give how to get this mended. To repeat the actual Problem:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A "virtual CDRom" provided on the USB-stick will not install; device manager identifies this as virtual "CDRom 0ace20ff USB Device".machine seesm to work undisturbed as long neither Desktop nor explorer are opened. If either os opened, machine is stalled.</p>
<p>Presumeably, said virtual CDRom contains the required software for the hardware (WLan or mobile Internet - there are two different sticks, both show the same problem) to be installed.<br />
<br />
Googleing for "virtual CDRom 0ace20ff USB Device" spits out many results but none with relevant (helpful) information.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance!<br />
Helmut</p>

            Hi
<p>It might be that you need to install first a Virtual CD on the hard drive (search around there programs that can help in configuring a Virtual CD), then load the content of the USB stick onto it, and use it to install the card’s software.</p>
<p>Howvevr, I think that this issue has nothing to do with Windows, it is an issue of how the Chello service provides their propriety Internet Wireless service hardware/software , and it is best to address it on their support site.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Jack!</p>
<p>I'm afraid this might not help: the "virtual CD"&nbsp; mentioned here is very much thge same as a regular USB-stick with plan memory, except that it installs as a virtual CD and not a "mass-storage device"; it contains all the software for the actual hardware
 the stick provides i.e. wireless LAN or Mobile Internet. (there are two sticks of different make that show the same behavior).</p>
<p>Thus ... it shouldn't be chello's (or aon's) problem; nevertheless I have consulted them in the evry beginning&nbsp; and they said the only provide support for the installed software (and hardware) .. if it doesn't install it should be hardware or Windows problem.
 (Buth supports, chello as well as AON say so.)</p>
<p>Nice of you to ponder at the problem though, thanks!<br />

<h2>            Lost Files during interrupted drag and drop</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you could assist me... I had a folder on my desktop which i dragged into my documents. The status bar did not show any signs of activity for a few minutes (did not saw "moving..." and no green progress etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then cancelled the process thinking the move would be reverted back to desktop but it seems like the process was going on in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result: The folder has been removed from my desktop and placed in my documents, but the contents copied are only about 10%. The rest of the contents are missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried checking the recycle bin, and also ctrl+z several times but could not revert the cut files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also run %temp% files location but nothing there, as well as checked out recovery software which i am unsure of</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance will be greatly appreciated. (Running windows 10, 64 bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<br />You can give both of these a shot. now these are both 3rd party apps, and I trust them. Free to use.

Watch out for ads on the sites that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products).

<br />
<br />I’ve had people use EaseUS, and I’ve used Recuva before with success. Give them a shot and they may be able to recovery your missing data.

</p><p>Unfortunately my last backup doesnt contain some of the work i would have liked to recover but i will fall back on that. The moved folder was 120gb so most recovery software (even paid versions) tops out at about 2gb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew i should be able to recover the cut files somehow because my drive usage never dropped my the 100gb+, so i wanted to recover via cmd steps shown here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.easeus.com/file-recovery/recover-cut-files-from-sd-windows-pc-android-iphone-memory.html#part3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/file-recovery/recover-cut-files-from-sd-windows-pc-android-iphone-memory.html#part3</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran chkdsk but encountered the "<span>chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>system restarts? (Y/N)" error.
</span></p>
<p>After typing y and restarting i could see my drive was being repaired... unfortunately after logging in the folder was not replaced and
 i could now see disc usage was down for the fist time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately i didnt work from the lost folder often and can scrape together some idea of what was lost. Just sucks to lose data. Lesson learned :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the help guys. Cheers</p>

<h2>            Yellow Shield detects Windows Updates repeatedly.</h2>
                    Today I installed the updates Microsoft had for both my computers, about 31 for my Windows 7 64-Bit and 16 for my XP-Pro.&nbsp; After all the fixes I applied for the last batch of updates I did not expect this again.&nbsp; For my XP, Windows Update does not detect
 anything more to install; however, the yellow shield detects three which already installed successfully:&nbsp; KB2827326, KB2826020 and KB2826021.&nbsp; So far, my Windows 7, the host computer on this wireless network, shows no problems with updating.

    <title>Cannot edit in Windows Photo Gallery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> damow59  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot edit in Windows Photo Gallery</h2>
                    <p>Recently installed Photo Gallery (PG)&nbsp;on my Windows 10 laptop and was using it to view my photos which were migrated from a previous device. PG was now my default viewer. Was opening and viewing photos no problem until suddenly, moving on to a new batch
 to look at and maybe edit, PG would display a photo full screen but when I clicked 'edit, organise or share', it and other pictures from that batch would not display in PG, for me to edit or otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did it stop working, as it had been doing for the hundreds of images I'd already 'moved' to PG without a hitch. The photos that won't display as required are no different to the images sorted previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know someone out there knows but if you can keep it simple for me, that would be great. I'm new to this thing altogether. Thanks all?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok have uninstalled and reinstalled and was surprised to see the photos I'd already viewed thru WPG still showing up there, as before. Should the reinstalled version have had any photos showing on it at all? I thought it would appear as if new to my laptop
 and ready to be used for the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, unfortunately for me, the problem persists with the reinstall. I can look at and edit the photos I've put thru it so far, as before, but it will not let me go beyond opening a 'new' photo full-screen, which it does do just fine, but then on to
 editing it it's a no no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 Missing Drivers</h2>
                    I have been using this mouse with my Windows 7 laptop for several years without trouble.
<br />
However, the other day when I was trying to resolve a connection issue, I noticed that the Windows Device Manager reported that no drivers were present for the mouse; somehow they had been removed. I tried to search for drivers, but none were found.
<br />
I looked on the Microsoft website for a driver download, but the support/downloads page for the mouse listed only product manuals available for download.
<br />
Here is that page: http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/bluetooth-notebook-mouse-5000<br />
A link to an available driver would be much appreciated.<br />

            Thank you for the reply, but unfortunately the quick start guide did not solve the problem. It merely directed me to visit the same webpage and download "the software," which I (once again) did not find.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, the drivers should be available
 on the webpage I previously mentioned (the same that is mentioned in the quick start guide), as other products have their drivers on similar pages.
<br />
The connection is not the problem; the control panel lists the device as "currently connected," but it is unresponsive, due to lack of driver software.<br />
Thank you for your help so far.<br />

Never found the drivers, however... I removed the Mouse.&nbsp; Then I used the "add a device" and pushed the small button on the bottom of the mouse, as my computer 'searched ' for new devices.&nbsp; it found the mouse and I chose to install (no pairing necessary) and
 the drivers automatically installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It now works.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Family Settings</h2>
                    I recently signed in to my Xbox account on my friend's Xbox. After doing so, I was added to his Microsoft family, and therefore subject to his family settings. Additionally, his parents can now view my online activity. Does anyone know how I would remove
 my self from his family.

<h2>            Help&#33; I&#39;m getting an orange screen with white stripes&#33;</h2>
                    I have been having troubles booting up my acer laptop for almost a year now, it was constantly doing the auto repair loop. I decided to look up how to fix it with a command that disables the loop, but now my computer shows an orange screen with white stripes
 and a text prop at the top that doesn't work. I can't get into it and don't have any spare cash to use to get it fixed or to replace anything. I don't know much about my laptop, other than that I got the free windows 10 when It came out and that It's an acer
 (Im not very tech savvy, also this is where I tried to fix my laptop.

            <p>I used to get that screen, but I went and tried deactivating the auto repair to fix my problem. Now it shows a orange screen with vertical white stripes</p>
<p>http://i.stack.imgur.com/KGNmd.jpg&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a theory on how to get back to the auto repair screen, by getting to the command prompt before the logo would show (that's when the orange screen appears) then re-enabling the auto repair</p>

            <p>Hello, from Germany.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the same problem, too! This morning, everything was okay. This afternoon... I see orange stripes after booting my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've learned that it has something to do with BitLocker. My machine (Dell Latitude) has BitLocker installed. I can type my BitLocker-password when I see the orange stripes and Windows 10 Pro will boot as it should.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I think this issue has to be solved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it has to do with yesterday's Microsoft patch.&nbsp;</p>

            I had four computers in my business go to orange stripe today as well. It does have something to do with Bitlocker. We used the same strategy as the guy above - typing in our pw - and the computer will boot but always on start up comes up with the same
 orange screen. Spent 1.5 hours with MSFT support and they couldn't fix it. Problem needs to be escalated.&nbsp;
