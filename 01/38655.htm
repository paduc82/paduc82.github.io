            Hi ilovesostco, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. If the above did not work and if this is a new computer with an Windows 7 upgrade disk supplied by HP. I would perform a system restore using the recovery partition. Doing this will revert your computer to new in box. From here try the upgrade
 again. Caution should be used as this will erase all data. If you have questions on how to perform this you will need to contact HP.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!

    <title>Xbox Backwards Compatible Game won&#39;t work on 360 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Backwards Compatible Game won&#39;t work on 360</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>



<p><br /></p><p>I bought an Xbox game that IS backwards-compatible with&nbsp;the Xbox 360, but whenever I try playing it, it sits at the Xbox screen (the original Xbox screen, not the Xbox 360 loading screen). I can hear the game running in the background - that is, I can hear the menu music and everything - but the screen never transitions from the Xbox screen to the game. I can't bring up the Xbox menu on my controller to return to the 360 main menu, I have to shut the console off via the power button. I have about 4 other Xbox games on my 360 and they all work fine, so I'm assuming it's a problem with the disc. It did appear&nbsp;to have some scratches on the back of it, I tried cleaning it but it didn't work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br /></p><p>Any suggestions? Or any one else who had this issue that found a fix? If not, I guess I have a faulty disc and will have to return it.</p>

<h2>            severe streaming input lag on wired network</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i'm having a problem with streaming my xbox games on my pc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>while the app seems to work fine and i'm not getting annoying streaming glitches while streaming (even streaming the tv content over the app works fine, even though the audio gets async every once in a while, which fixes itself after a while),&nbsp;</p>
<p>the input lag i'm getting via streaming makes every game unplayable (ca 300-500ms). i'm using an xbox one 2016 controller over bluetooth, which works "lagfree" on local windows games.</p>
<p>network stability on an hardware level also doesn't seem to be a problem, since the ping from the pc to xbox one is under 1ms consistently. both devices are on GB-LAN connection. (simple layout: xbox&lt;-&gt;gb-switch&lt;-&gt;home router&lt;-&gt;gb-switch&lt;-&gt;gb-switch&lt;-&gt;pc)</p>
<p>i deactivated game dvr and built-in wifi (of course) on the pc.</p>
<p>i minimized scaling lag by using the app in windowed mode.</p>
<p>the xbox also doesn't indicate any network problems&nbsp;on multiplayer.</p>
<p>the windows 10 app gets a teredo error for multiplayer services since i'm using double nat (simple layout: ISP&lt;-&gt;ISP provided router&lt;-&gt;home router&lt;-&gt;...)</p>
<p>pcs display driver is up to date.</p><p><br /></p><p>xbox is an xbox one s 500 gb.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>that's all i got.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>any suggestions?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>

 We need it back, the servers no longer work on windows pc, and the only way to start a match on xbox is if it is a private session. Please we need shadowrun back.&nbsp;

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting intermittent problems with Windows Essentials Live Mail 2012 syncing my Hotmail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code 0x80048849.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to depend on the network I am using, so I am guessing it is either a speed/network latency issue or a security issue-- some of the networks I use are rigged with VPNs, so my IP address can bang around the world a few times a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT have this problem with Essentials downloading my Gmail through an IMAP server.&nbsp; That works just fine.&nbsp; I also have no problem logging in to my Hotmail through the Outlook web interface... but that is not part of my normal workflow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to change the server timeout settings for my Hotmail account and was surprised to find that there is no way to do so-- there is on my Gmail IMAP properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two questions: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to change the server timeout settings on a Hotmail account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a security block based upon changing IP addresses?&nbsp; If so, can that be changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has become serious enough that I need to start considering other email clients, so I hope someone can help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 2012 (Build 16.4.3528.0331) running on Windows 7 (latest updates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have automatically detect settings enabled.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Wouldn't disabling <span><strong>"Check for server certificate revocation" </strong>
compromise security?&nbsp; It also seems like a bit of an odd solution for getting a Microsoft client program to communicate with a Microsoft server...

            It only blue screens when I charge my computer, but when it's on the battery everything is fine. I can't charge my laptop at all without blue screening eventually, I've tried your steps, and nothing helped.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><div>

<div>
It&nbsp;may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

<p>The error points to the nvlddmkm.sys, which is the NVIDIA graphics adapter driver:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; 0x9F_3_<strong>nvlddmkm</strong>_IMAGE_pci.sys</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>However I might suggest to uninstall ASUS USB Charger Plus software and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, update McAfee to the most recent version or uninstall McAfee and use Windows built-in antivirus (Windows Defender) and firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists uninstall the presently installed NVIDIA graphics driver and install the latest version available from ASUS for the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider updating the BIOS to the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If updating the BIOS backup any critical files beforehand as a rare BIOS update failure can result in system failure.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Shemiah, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for reaching out to us on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Were any significant changes made to the computer prior to this issue? </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There are several possibilities that could be causing this so we will just have to rule them out one at a time. The DCOM Server Process Launcher is a critical Windows service that starts other services as needed. If it stops working, Windows will automatically
 restart your computer to get it started again. </span><span>You may try following the diagnostic steps given below as we need to find the root cause of the issue and check, if this helps to diagnose the problem.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe mode with Networking. </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would first suggest you to check, if the problem persists in Safe Mode with networking or not. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows
 are installed. You need to </span><span>boot the computer in Safe mode with networking and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click the link and follow the steps “<strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong>”
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not persist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot given in the next step and check if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot. </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Refer: How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:<em> </em></span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would also suggest you to be sure your computer is virus-free and malware-free. Run your antivirus and antispyware scanners.
</span><span>You may try running a full computer scan with the Microsoft Safety Scanner&nbsp;to make sure that the computer is virus free.</span></p>

<br />
<strong>Note:</strong><em> </em>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.

            <p>AA didn't really answer the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A simple No currently you cannot change the game to symbols or irregular mode. They are only available in the challenges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope they add them in the future, number just get boring after a while.</p>

            Absolutely agree.&nbsp; Why aren't there irregular boards in the standard mode?&nbsp; There's an achievement award for winning 100 irregular puzzles, but no way to get them other than the daily challenges.&nbsp; Stupid.

            <p>I agree. I really, really enjoy playing the irregular Sudoku puzzles and I hope that Microsoft decides to add them soon. I can't believe they haven't already added them. They have all the different modes of Solitaire in in daily challenges as well as&nbsp;individual
 games&nbsp;that can be accessed outside of the daily challenges. The same cannot be said for Sudoku.
</p>
<p>Microsoft, can you please add these two versions of Sudoku to your apps store?</p>
<p>I know a lot of people would really appreciate it. :o)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I agree with the other players. Ahmed gave us no answer, but thanks for trying. Microsoft should add the irregular and symbol game boards to be used with the difficulty levels.&nbsp;</p>

            I completely agree as well. The Regular grid puzzles with different skill levels are boring. I greatly enjoy the colorful irregular and the symbol Sudoku. Much more fun to do. I'd even be willing to buy it as a premium option.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6e62e024-09d8-441c-b254-682ac6ec54f1" title="LynnePeterson">
<p>
</p><p>A Skype Name <em>(Skype ID, Skype handle, username, etc.) </em>is the unique username that users created when they first joined Skype. Users who used their email address to crate an account have a Microsoft account and not a Skype Name. This FAQ may come
 in handy on how to locate&nbsp; Skype Name. <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10858/what-s-my-skype-name?q=skype+name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What's my Skype Name?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have a system-generated username if&nbsp;you created your account using an email address or a phone number. The Skype username will show as
<strong>live:whatevercomesbefore@</strong> for email address-created account while it will show as
<strong>live:randomalphanumericcharcretes </strong>for phone number-created accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Locate your Skype username by following the steps below. </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in to <strong>My Account </strong>on the website. </li><li>Scroll down to <strong>Account details</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Purchase history</strong>. </li><li>Your username will show on the upper right side of the website beside <strong>
Sign out</strong>. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Skype Names cannot be changed.</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need additional information or assistance.

<p>Skype never did offer the option to change a Skype Names or Skype IDs. This is to ensure that a Skype username stays unique&nbsp;and different&nbsp;for every user.

<h2>            Windows update error 80004002</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see a few people have had this problem. I have tried everything that is posted without positive results.</p>
<p>Started a few months ago. Windows Media player won't work. (Class not Registered) Internet Explorer opens and just as quickly, dissolves. Windows 10 is available for download on my computer now. I go to download it and it says, Windows 10 couldn't install.
 80004002. I click on the link, "Get help with this error" Won't open. It won't open Automatic Troubleshooter either. (an unexpected error has occurred) 0x80004002. I ran system File Check and typed in "sfc/scannow. "Windows resource Protection Did Not Find
 any Integrity Violations"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would greatly be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thanks Gerry</p>
<p>
</p><p>Done that. Downloaded the update agent and then checked for updates. Only update available is the upgrade to Windows 10. Go to update &nbsp;to Widows 10, "Windows 10 couldn't install" 80004002.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would be my next move. I even had an IT guy come over a couple of months ago and said he has never seen this before and couldn't resolve it. Luckily, he didn't charge me.</p>

<h2>            Deleted account still shows up on login screen</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I recently decided to make another account and saw that there was an option to add a family member so I did using their email account but I later decided to delete it but now everytime I login it shows up the email and password to login
 to that deleted account. I tried logging into it with the password which I'm sure is correct but it rejects it. I tried doing everything such as deleting all files associated with it, using command prompt to delete it but still no luck. Any help will be appreciated,
 it isn't stopping me from using my laptop but its annoying logging in to see that deleted account showing up first everytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>

            Hi, maybe I wasn't clear but this isn't a browser issue, the issue is with a windows 10 account not being completely removed after taking all the steps to do so.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for clarifying. There's a possibility that the Windows 10 account isn't completely deleted. We recommend that you follow the steps below in case you haven't tried it yet and see if it resolves the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Right-click on the <strong>Start </strong>button and then select <strong>
Computer Management</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Navigate down through <strong>Local Users and Groups</strong>, and then double-click on
<strong>Users</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Locate the username in the list that you’d like to delete.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Right-click the user account, and then click on <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Take note of the following:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Before you perform this procedure, you must provide credentials for the Administrator account on the local computer (if you are prompted), or you must be a member of the Administrators group on the local computer.</li><li>When deleting a user account, it is recommended that you first disable the account. When you are certain that disabling the account has not caused a problem, you can safely delete the account.</li><li>Once you delete a user account, it cannot be recovered.</li><li>The Guest account and the Administrator account cannot be deleted.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Should you encounter any further issues, feel free to get back to us. </p>

    <title>OSPPREARM.EXE not working, can&#39;t open zip files, which worked fine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christianr1957  say:</h3>
<h2>            OSPPREARM.EXE not working, can&#39;t open zip files, which worked fine six weeks ago.</h2>
                    <p>I have a 17 month old HP i-7 that I ordered from the factory with Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also equipped with Office Home &amp; Student 2013, which I purchased from HP and which was installed by them at the time of manufacture, as well as a newer copy of Office 365,
 which I needed last fall, purchased last fall, and installed myself in order to use MS Access.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use 7-Zip to open zip files, and it is common in my line of work to need to open large County, State, and Federal zip data files in order to draw information from them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying to open a US Census County employment database for 1986, and have already
 opened newer zip files from the same source back in mid-October.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the zip file as always and when I try to open in within 2 seconds the processes collapses and a pop-up claims that OSPPREAM.EXE is not working, and that Microsoft is working on a solution, which they have been working-on for a week now
 without success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I have over 100 windows open trying to complete three graduate-level term papers and PowerPoint presentations and losing all my open windows in the middle of trying to write three 15-20 page graduate-level studies is not an option that works well
 for me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My last laptop had Windows 8 and it was a far worse experience than New Coke was, which only lasted 13 months until the hard drive fried.&nbsp;&nbsp; What can I do to fix this problem short of reinstalling my operating system or upgrading to Windows 10, as has already
 been suggested?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions</p>
