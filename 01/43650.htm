            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. What is the make and model number of the USB drive?<br />
2. Do you have the latest drivers installed for your USB drive?<br />
<br />
Follow the below steps and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Step 1:<br />
<br />
<strong>I'd suggest you uninstall and reinstall USB controllers.<br />
</strong>
<p>a.&nbsp;Disconnect all USB devices except keyboard and mouse.<br />
b.&nbsp;Click on start button.<br />
c.&nbsp;Type "devmgmt.msc" and press enter.<br />
d.&nbsp;In the device manager scroll down to the USB Controllers.<br />
e.&nbsp;Right click each one, one-at-a-time, and click Uninstall.<br />
f.&nbsp;Restart your computer now, each USB port will be reinstalled<br />
<br />
Now connect your device and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
If step one does not help. I'd suggest you copy the contents of the USB drive on to another computer and format the USB drive to NTFS.<br />
<br />
<span>If there are bad sectors found on your drive, you will be prompted to format the drive.
</span>
<p><span><span>You can also try to format the drive from the Disk Management.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click on start and type ‘Diskmgmt.msc’ in the search field after connecting your thumb drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Select your Thumb drive volume, right-click and then click Format.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. To format the volume with the default settings, in the Format dialog box, click OK, and then click OK again.</span></span></p>

<h2>            NAS not found in Network in Windows Explorer &#40;Win 7 64 bit&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>My 2 NAS devices both appear as media Devices and as Storage&nbsp; when I click the Network heading in the left hand panel of Windows Explorer but their listing in the left hand panel itself it intermittent. I thought they appeared there if on before I booted
 the computer but this is not consistently the case (cold reboot or restart).</p>
<p>Double clicking on the media devices opens WMP and I can see/play the videos etc. Double clicking on the storage icons opens the web page of the appropriate device (in Netgear Frontview in this case). If I look at the full Network map they appear correctly
 sited.</p>
<p>But I want to be able to copy files in and out of the devices and can only do this when they show in the Network section.</p>
<p>I believe I have Discovery turned on for both Private and Public. Windows Help says there should be a Discovery section to expand on the Networking and Sharing Center page - but I can't discover it!</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>

<p>Netgear has a support forum for their ReadyNas devices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readynas.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.readynas.com/forum/</a></p>
<p>The Netgear forum is probably the best place to get advice on how to use this device. Netgear has support people there and there will be other users of the same device there. Having never used the device myself all I can offer is the generic advice of making
 sure the firmware on the device is the latest version.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2. Have you updated all the drivers including the chipset?<br />
3. Were there any changes made to the computer prior the issue?<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></div>
<div><br />
<br />
Refer the following methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Try the steps from the following article:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Windows Kernel event ID 41 error in Windows 7 or in Windows Server 2008 R2: “The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first”</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2028504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2028504</a>
<div><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 1</strong>: I would suggest you to boot in safe mode with networking and check if you face the same issue.<br />
To boot into safe mode refer to the link provided below:<br />
a) Restart the computer.<br />
b) Start tapping the F8 key.<br />
c) You will get advanced boot option window.<br />
d) Select the option “Safe mode with Networking”<br />
Refer to the link provided below for more information on safe mode:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>I would recommend you to place the computer in clean boot and then check if the issue persist.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Put the computer to normal as mentioned in Step 7 from the KB article.</div>
<div><br />
If the issue doesn’t occur when the Computer is in clean boot, then the issue is confirmed to be caused by a non-Microsoft application.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
Download the hotfix and check:<br />
<strong>There is a delay when you shut down, restart, or log off a computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2

<h2>            Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 Webcam cannot hear clearly when have picture running in Skype</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 Webcam</p>
<p>I was using LifeCam VX-3000 for a year or so with Windows XP and with Skype and the quality of sound and picture were really high quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Last week I bought a new PC with Windows 7 and installed the LifeCam&nbsp; with appropriate drivers&nbsp;(LifeCam3.22.exe) on the PC.&nbsp; Windows recognized the Life Cam and there are no errors in the Device manager.</p>
<p>I noticed that when I use the LifeCam with Skype people on another side cannot hear me clear when I have picture running.&nbsp; If I disable picture the sound on another side of communication becomes really good and clear.&nbsp; I have repeated this test many times
 with other users and with myself dialing from another PC-same effect.&nbsp; With picture-sound from the microfone has a lot of noise and difficult to recognize.&nbsp; Without picture the sound is very clear.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Then I used the LifeCAM interface and recorded my voice -noticed that it is a lot of noise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some users in different forums report similar issue with LifeCam VX-3000 on Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you please advise if this is the driver issue and the new one or update is coming or this LifeCam is not supported by Windows 7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really appreciate your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for this suggestion.&nbsp; Actually, I did not mentioned this in the original note but I noticed this issue on the Dell desktop XPS machine running Windows 7.&nbsp; Then I repeated this test with the same driver on Asus laptop that I have running Windows
 7.</p>
<p>The sypmtoms were exactly the same-very noisy and unclear sounds from microfon when picture is running.&nbsp; By the way it is very consistent&nbsp;on all applications-Skype, Messager, original LifeCam VX-3000 interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the same camera worked (and still does)&nbsp;flawlessly on Windows XP-everything points out to&nbsp;Windows 7 driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any comments what could be an issue?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>i just want to note, that I have removed the driver installed by Lifecam3.22.exe, rebooted the PC and plugged the LifeCam VX-3000 into the USB port.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Windows have recognized the device and installed the driver built into windows.&nbsp; It is driver 5.12.1.72. for video and 6.3.6002.0 for microphone.&nbsp; These drivers work fine with Windows 7</p>

<div>My suggestion, find the closest recycle company and donate it. Its just a paper weight for Windows 8.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I find it very curious that this product has the name "Microsoft" but isn't supported by the company or any of its subsidiaries companies such as Skype. I bought this product thinking as long as I have it and use it through Windows, there should be no
 reason they wouldn't support it.&nbsp;</div>

<div>My goodness have they duped us all.&nbsp;I'm<span>&nbsp;sure&nbsp;</span>Microsoft<span>&nbsp;</span>doesn't<span>&nbsp;care one way or another. &nbsp;They know we&nbsp;have to go out and buy a new web cam. What I wont
 do, ever again, is buy any hardware that has the label "Microsoft". In recent years they have proved they&nbsp;</span>don't<span>&nbsp;care about the end&nbsp;user or the end product. This is just another of many examples of that.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I marvel at an earlier post suggesting somebody should use the device on an earlier windows product. To me&nbsp;</span>that's<span>&nbsp;a back hand slap in the face to&nbsp;</span>Microsoft<span>&nbsp;saying
 "if you want it to work,&nbsp;</span>don't<span>&nbsp;use&nbsp;the&nbsp;new software"</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Seriously, its a USB webcam, how hard is it to be supported? ManyCam is able to get it to work with their software through windows 8.1 why cant Skype do the same? That is the real question! Shame on Microsoft!</span></div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Lock Screen Stuck</h2>
                    <p>Hi.<br />
I have my windows 10 Lock screen stuck on one which picture which i find it annoying to some extent. I tried to follow something pertaining to this problem but no solution provided seemed to solve my problem.<br />
I tried the fresh install and re registering the lock screen (through powershell) but it never worked. Some solutions suggested to delete the asset folder where windows 10 lock screen are stored but my pc has a different path to the asset folder than suggested.</p>
<p>I tried to look&nbsp; for the following path to delete the asset folder </p>
<pre>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_&lt;characters&gt;\Settings</pre>
<p>But my pc has a different path C:\Users\Francis\AppData\Local\Microsoft\InputPersonalization\TextHarvester</p>
<p>Anyone with an idea on how to fix this....?</p>

<p>Hi Francis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge you're experiencing with customizing the lock screen might be due to a corrupted user account. That being said, we'll need more details to properly address your concern. Please clarify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly do you mean by <em>"fresh install"</em>? Are you referring to <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Recovery options in Windows 10">resetting your PC</a></strong> or performing a
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10startfresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10">clean install</a></strong>?</li><li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Are you using <strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/windows-spotlight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Configure Windows Spotlight on the lock screen">Windows Spotlight</a></strong>?</li><li>What is the <em>OS Build</em> of your Windows 10 device? Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, type
<strong>About your PC</strong>, press <strong>Enter</strong>, scroll down to <strong>
Windows</strong> <strong>specifications</strong> to verify this information.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For now, we advise isolating the issue by creating a new user account. Name the new user account as
<em>"Test"</em> for distinction and see if the same issue occurs. Follow the steps from this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10">
<strong>article</strong></a> on how to create a new user account.</p>
<p>

</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<h2>            After one rebuild, DiskPart still shows Mirror as &#34;rebuild&#39; status</h2>
                    <p>Hello-</p>
<p>I am running Win7 Ultimate with a RAID 1 mirrored system disk.&nbsp; The system recently failed and I had the error VOLMGRX_INTERNAL_ERROR bluescreen before reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got to command line and ran DISKPART, which showed the main system mirror as FAILED RT.&nbsp; I rebuilt the mirror, and then did a repair install of Windows 7 to fix miscellaneous errors.&nbsp; All has been working fine 2 days.</p>
<p><br />
The system booted extremely slow today, and so I went to command prompt.&nbsp; The Mirrored volume shows "REBUILD" as status.&nbsp; Is that a current rebuild that is in progress?&nbsp; Should I not reboot the comp?&nbsp; Is there any way to get a status or to find out why the
 system is consistently rebuilding the mirror?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks!<br />
Chapman</p>

                    <p>Well, everything worked fine from June 2014 to August. Great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now after deleting the Device from Control Panel and reconnecting ScreenBeam says "connecting" then "something amazing is about to happen" but then "oops something went wrong"!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device, General says:</p>
<p>Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)<br />
</p>
<p>To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer.</p>

</p><p>This type of issue usually happens if there are corrupted files/program on the computer. Having said that, we will be doing some troubleshooting steps to isolate this concern. Before we proceed, may we know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you send us a screenshot with the error message that you are getting? <strong>
Note:</strong> Please do not include any personal information.</li><li>Are you experiencing this problem when installing an specific application?</li><li>Have you tried installing a different application? If so, did you experience the same issue?</li></ul>

<h2>            Xbox One Controller Can&#39;t Sync After Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old Xbox One Controller, the one without the 3.5 mm plug, i was looking at the device configuration on the Xbox and the option "Update" was able for this controller, it updated from 1.X.X to 2.3.X.X. Everything looked fine but after that i disconected
 the Controller and the led was blinking, then i tried to Sync but it just blink faster, i think the console has something so i did a hard reset, then i tried to sync and it didn't. Today i tried to sync the controller on another Xbox One but it's the same,
 Just blink faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The controller works fine with the USB cable, but it don't work via wireless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can helpme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello Victor!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. I understand that your controller is no longer syncing wirelessly to your console. When you do use the USB cable does the control un-sync as soon as you unplug the USB? I recommend safely powering down your
 console then unplugging the power supply from the wall and the console. Also remove the batteries from the controller. After that wait a few minutes or at least for the LED light on the power supply unit to fully shut off. Once that is done leave the batteries
 out of the controller and plug it into the console with a USB then use the controllers Xbox Guide button to turn the console on. Once the console powers on put the batteries back into the controller and disconnect the USB and see if it stays synced. Also here's
 a useful support article:<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/accessories/troubleshoot-wireless-controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot your Xbox One Wireless Controller
</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know with a&nbsp;reply how it goes!</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the fast reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Microsoft guide to sync the controller, but i can't, and i just followed the steps, i didn't tried this, i turned off the console, then i put the power supply off the wall, after a 20 minutes, i pluged&nbsp; the cord to the wall then i connected the
 USB cable to the controller and the xbox and with the guide button i turned on the console, it worked fine, then i tried to use it with the batteries, so i put the batteries on and disconnected the USB cable but the Guide Button started to blink, like it has
 no connection, i tried again with the sync button but the console didn't recognized the controller. It's a little rare because i was using it via wireless yesterday and after the updating process it can't be used wireless, don't sync, but via USB woks fine.
 I hope that if it's a controller update bug it can be fixed with another update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again i thank you for the reply and i'll be trying the steps to see if i did something wrong.</p>

            your answer is very frustrating because it seems you did not even understand the question, which was explained very well. i have the same question. he is asking how to get to the APPLICATION's settings, not the system settings. on windows 8.1 using a right-swipe
 or win-I gave you application specific settings. that no longer works and it now gives you system settings. you gave instructions on how to get to system settings which is exactly what he is asking how NOT to do. please ask your supervisor for help if you
 do not understand the question.

<h2>            Xbox controller on windows 10</h2>
                    Okay, so I recently got a new computer. On my old laptop my controller worked perfectly fine, but not on this computer. I was on windows 7 and it wouldn't work so I decided to upgrade to windows 10. When I plug in the device and look at it in the device
 manager it says, "Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed)". The Controller is a &nbsp;Rock Candy Xbox 360 Wired Controller (blue). I even installed the drivers when I was on windows 7 and again on windows 10. Can someone please help me.

<h2>            Windows 10 Clipboard&#58; Sync across other devices settings randomly turn off after i reboot</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 computers set to sync clipboard text with the settings set to on and I wake up the next day and turn on the computers and my text isn't sync'ing. I go to settings on both computers and the setting is turned off on one of the computers. It is not
 always the same computer this happens to and i'm losing my mind with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i am typing this, i'm thinking maybe turn off sync settings. I will do this now and see how it works out but i prefer my settings to be sync'd if i reinstall which i do once a year or so to keep things running smooth.</p>

            Hi,mikeyhalla 
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />The following command will do a full scan of the protected system files on your computer and fix any file that are causing issues while Windows 10 is up and running.
<br />1.	Use the Windows key + X keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu and select Command Prompt (Admin), as you will need administrator permissions to run SFC.
<br />2.	In the Command Prompt type the following command and press Enter:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />1.	Once the scan completes, you will see one of the following messages:
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations:This indicates that your system doesn't have any missing or corrupted files.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation: This message means that there was a problem during the scan and an offline scan is required.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: You will get this message when SFC was able to fix the problem. Now, you can move on or you can view the logs to get more details.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: In this case, you'll need to repair the corrupted files manually.
<br />Quick Tip: You may want to run the command around three times to fix all the problems.
<br />

<p>Thank you for your swift reply but I have done all of those things. I have had this issue ever since it became a feature in Windows 10. I have reinstalled Windows 10 about 10 times since then even and the issue always occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite sure that the problem is in the cloud where my sync settings are stored. I turned off the feature to sync settings and i will give it a few days and see if the problem persists.</p>

    <title>Can I use an IPV6 tunnel&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kindabusted  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I use an IPV6 tunnel&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>After doing some research I've seen Xbox One's version of XBL is better over IPV6.</p>
<p>My router has the ability to use an 6in4 tunnel for IPV6 and broadcast it.</p>
<p>The question is should I use it or should I just hold out until my ISP goes native?</p>
<p>Also would there be any noticeable difference between my current IPV4 or using a tunnel such as hurricane electric?

<p>A VaultOverseer, basic answer would be no, do not use 6to4 tunnels.</p>
<p>Right now Xbox One uses IPv6 tunnels in some cases, like Voice Chat or Peer-to-Peer connections between console for multiplayer. So forced using of IPv6 tunnels can broke some functionality of Xbox One Network related services.</p>

            Hello RDV25,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using the Microsoft Answers Forum<br />
<br />
Have you cleaned your fans lately? You should check it at least weekly if not more, to make sure everything is running smooth. An update&nbsp;most likely is not the cause. If the fans are dirty clean it out with a can of compressed air. Compressed air can be found
 at any local electronics store.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You may also want to check in task manager for the highest memory processes or highest cpu process(besides System) because typically when large processes are running it can cause one of the fans to run constantly to cool down the computer so it can handle running
 the process. Safe mode can really help determining if this is the cause of the fan problem; you can do this by running in safe mode, usually by pressing F8 or another key depending on your computer manufacturer, and by seeing if it runs non stop when you run
 it in safe mode. Another problem could be because of the fan wearing out and not moving air as efficiently as before.<br />
<br />
To check your Task Manager for running programs you can perform a control+alt+delete keypress and see if there are programs running that will cause your fan to run excessively.&nbsp;

    <title>KB4056892 will not install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremy pearce  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB4056892 will not install</h2>
                    <p>So I've been trying to get KB4056892 to install on my laptop (intel i7 core), but it hasn't.&nbsp; I've gotten 3 different errors at different times, but the first was 0x80070bc2.&nbsp; I've tried every fix (except for clean windows install, which I want to avoid,
 and rolling back), and I eventually ended up with a new error: 0x80070643.&nbsp; After trying the cmd(admin) list of commands to stop bits and what not, I have finally ended up with the error 0x80070490 (current error).&nbsp; Again, I've tried every fix I could find
 online revolving around KB4056892, but I'm stuck as to what to do. sfc /scannow said nothing is integrally wrong, windows update troubleshooter says it fixes things but doesn't, so it's basically useless (I've run it 20+ times).&nbsp; All that's happening now is
 error&nbsp;0x80070490 and "Requires restart to finish installing." </p>
<p>Anyone have other solutions, aside from clean installing windows or rolling back?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My current version is 16299.125 on an Alienware 15 R2 intel core i7.</p>

            There are reports of the patch saying its failed, but its actually installed.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />
<br />See if KB4056892 is installed or not. 
<br />
<br />You can try installing it manually if its not installed.

<br />
<br />If you still experience problems installing it.
<br />
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.

<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

            I tried everything Microsoft recommended.&nbsp; The Media Creation Tool failed to fully deploy to my USB drive as well.&nbsp; I was running Windows 10 Pro for Workstations or whatever the heck build that is.&nbsp; Anyway, I changed my key to a Windows 10 Pro key and
 then after downloading the Windows 10 1709 ISO, I reinstalled Windows over itself while taking up the offer to Update windows during the process.&nbsp; It went through the setup keeping all files, settings, and programs, rebooted a few times and lo and behold,
 I was up from b16299.15 to b16299.125.&nbsp; At that point, I ran Windows Update and the problem update installed along with a few others in the list.&nbsp; I'm now up to .214.

    <title>Sticky keys mean I cannot enter password to get on my laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sticky keys mean I cannot enter password to get on my laptop</h2>
                    <p>Sticky keys suddenly came on. I tried googling how to turn them off but google wouldn't recognise the jumble of letters that appeared when I tried to type so tried turning it off and on again but now can't even get onto that laptop as cannot enter my password
 due to the sticky keys. I have googled it on this laptop and tried pressing shift 5 times but it didn't do the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I log in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I turn the sticky keys off (preferably forever)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who thought sticky keys were a good idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(first 2 questions the most important)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Gareth (having to use wife's laptop to ask you)</p>
<p>
</p><p>**edit** managed to get in with right click and an option for an on screen keyboard and done the 5 x shift thing which asks me if I want to turn on sticky keys, suggesting that they are not on already. But if that's the case, any ideas on why it is suddenly
 putting multiple of every button I hit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't seem to bring back the onscreen keyboard since getting in</p>

            Hi, Nikki,
<br />
<br />1. Try typing OnScreen Keyboard in Cortana Search Bar &gt; Press Enter
<br />
<br />2. Go to Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Sticky Keys
<br />Uncheck Turn on Stick Keys.
<br />
<br />3. There's also a Registry edit. Ensure you back up Windows Registry before editing because it makes it easier to Restore the Registry should something go wrong.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756...</a>
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Type Regedit &gt; Press Enter
<br />
<br />Navigate to: 
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\StickyKeys
<br />
<br />Right click on the Flags  &gt; Select Modify
<br />Change the value to 506
<br />
<br />Go to:
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\Keyboard Response key
<br />Right click on Flags &gt; Select Modify
<br />Set the value to 122
<br />
<br />Go to:
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\ToggleKeys
<br />Right click on Flags &gt; Select Modify
<br />Set the value to 58
<br />
<br />Close Windows Registry and Reboot the Computer for changes to take effect.

<p>Hi, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could not type things mentioned as they looked completely different when I tried typing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have it kind of working by turning on bounce keys which ignores multiple strokes but is then annoying when I actually want multiples as have to wait before I can add second O in BOOK for example or if I want to do multiple backspaces. Every key is suddenly
 sticking but sticky keys appears to be turned off. Don't know what would have suddenly caused it as it was working fine earlier. Might have to find someone with the discs and do a factory reset on it (at least then I can use the opportunity to go back to Windows
 7 so not all bad!)</p>

            Do you know anyone that has a keyboard you can use?
<br />
<br />Have you tried using Cortana Microphone?
<br />You can tell her to Open Ease of Access or Turn Off Sticky Keys
<br />
<br />Windows 10
<br />Settings &gt; Windows Update &gt; Recovery
<br />You can Select PC Refresh which will keep your files.

            <p>Hi ГЕОРГИОСЛОС,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to work with your web-based application. I can imagine the inconvenience experienced by you and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue may arise if the some third party software service is conflicting with the program or if the installed application has got corrupted program startup files or have become unstable. In order to diagnose and troubleshoot the issue, I would
 suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>To rule out the possibility of a third party software conflict, I would suggest you to clean boot your system and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any system files corruption in the system.&nbsp;</span><span>SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:&nbsp;<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>For more information refer to this link:&nbsp;</span></strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span>Use
 the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</span></em></strong></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still exists, then I would suggest you to contact the dedicated support of the program for further assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>
