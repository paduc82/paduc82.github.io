<p>My computer was restarting because my AVG said there was new updates and then a blue screen popped up and had this message:</p>

<p>I have found a fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) Create a copy of the AVG Recovery Disc (http://www.avg.com/ww-en/226386)<br />
<br />
2) Boot from disc, then go into the file manager. Follow the same steps as in this thread:&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.avg.com/ww-en/avg-free-forum?sec=thread&amp;act=show&amp;id=94159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.avg.com/ww-en/avg-free-forum?sec=thread&amp;act=show&amp;id=94159</a>&nbsp;but
 instead of renaming the .dll and .sys files, simply navigate to your programs(x86) directory and rename the entire AVG folder to something else.<br />
<br />
3) From here, simply restart your machine, and it should boot normally.<br />
<br />
This is the best solution you'll find until AVG releases a permanent fix.</span></p>

</p><p>I have this WD ext hard drive 300 gb for pat 3 years. recently I am getting the above error message whenever I try to copy or send files from laptop to external hard drive. I tried different USB ports on laptop with same error message coming up. I ran chkdsk

            <p>Hi Mirle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was the exact scan report that was generated after you ran the ‘Error check’?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did it provide you an option to delete the files that couldn’t be recovered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that Windows has tried to recover some of the files in the bad sectors. If they are corrupt and beyond repair, then Windows might fail to open the file or delete it. If you are unable to delete these files, then you can copy the other files to
 a different location, format the external drive completely to remove all corrupt files, and then copy the other files back to the External hard drive. Right click on the External hard drive in File Explorer and select ‘format’ to format the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 desktop loading loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flybum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 desktop loading loop</h2>
                    I just got Windows 10 from the upgrade on August 1st. &nbsp;It boots into the login screen just fine, but when it begins to load the desktop, it goes into a loop. &nbsp;The background picture is there, the bar on the bottom is there, but the icons are missing. &nbsp;The
 screen then goes black, and it repeats. &nbsp;Occasionally, the icons appear, but it goes black and continues to do this. &nbsp;I can start the Task Manager from here, but that is all. &nbsp;

            <p>I found a "fix" of sorts. &nbsp;When the looping started, I did the basic Windows "Ctrl-Alt-Del" &nbsp;to get the Task Manager. &nbsp;I saw no programs running, so I checked the processes to see which one was using up resources. &nbsp;I had an Apple picture upload process running.
 &nbsp;Since I was not concerned about pictures at the moment, I deleted that process. &nbsp;The looping stopped immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a reboot, everything started up as it should. &nbsp;I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I tried the Task Manager solution, however the processes that were running would jump around so much that by the time I clicked and stopped the process, the activity had moved on to another &nbsp;process. &nbsp;I stopped every process that was doing it, but the loop
 continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up going into safe mode on startup and re-setting my entire computer, saving user files. &nbsp;This deleted all my non-windows programs (office, adobe Photoshop, iTunes, etc...) but saved the user files, then it re-installed Windows 10. &nbsp;It took 7 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has taken me another several days to find and re-install all the programs that were lost in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aggravating to say the least, but everything works fine now. &nbsp;</p>

 and the hacker directly told me he only took the account for that rank in halo. I have talked with many people in microsoft asking weather or not they can give support over a chat room. Sadly they cannot so i am writing this for him.</p>

            Hi Robert, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Klondike has standardized rules for scoring, and the Microsoft Solitaire app uses those standard rules.
<br />
<br />Here's a link to the way scoring works with Klondike (under the heading SCORING), which may give you the information you need to work out your scores:

<p><span>Hi Sophie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are you trying to boot from the Windows 7
 disc and install a clean copy of Windows 7 or are you tying to boot to the current windows installation and install it?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Who is the computer manufacturer and what
 is the model number?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run upgrade advisor for Windows 7 before reinstalling it and check if you need to update any
 drivers for installing Windows 7. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Link to run upgrade advisor:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also check with the computer manufacturer if you need to update chipset and BIOS and update it accordingly,
 later try to install Windows 7 and check if it gives the same error. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>
<p>

            Hello amynicole84,<br />
<br />
<br />
To help determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows Vista, run the System File Checker tool. The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system
 files by using the correct versions. <br />
<br />
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then type <span>
cmd</span> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box. </li><li>Right-click <strong>cmd</strong> in the <strong>
Programs</strong> list, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.
<br />
<div>
<div>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong></div>
</li><li>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>sfc /scannow (yes there is a space after sfc)</span></div>
</li></ol>
This scan may take a while to complete. When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved. If the issue that you are experiencing is not resolved, use the procedure that is described in the "The System Restore tool"
 section.
The System Restore tool
Other troubleshooting methods, such as using the System File Checker tool, may not resolve the issue. If they do not resolve the issue, and the issue that you are experiencing started occurring recently, you can use the System Restore tool. By using this tool,
 you can restore the computer to an earlier point in time. <br />
<br />
Using the System Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in
 which you did not experience the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.
<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this image</span><span>Expand this image</span>, type
<span>system restore</span> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then click
<strong>System Restore</strong> in the <strong>
Programs</strong> list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong>.</div>
</li><li>In the <strong>System Restore</strong> dialog box, click <strong>
Choose a different restore point</strong>, and then click <strong>
Next</strong>. </li><li>In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.<br />
<br />
The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created. Let us know if this helps you either way. Make it a great day!
</li></ol>
<p><br />
<br />

            <p>You are getting the concept of how the "Home Console" feature works wrong. When you say "Game Sharing" you usually mean "I give you my games, and you give me your games, and the 'sharing' is established, and if one side doesn't share, it should automatically unshare the other side too". It does NOT work like that.&nbsp;</p><p>Basically, forget about the "We give games each other" concept.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are unable to play your friend's games, you can't do anything about that. The only person to rectify that, is your friend.&nbsp;</p><p>Your friend has to come over to your console, sign in with his own account, and set your console as his Home Console again.&nbsp;</p><p>It's up to you if you want to do the same. Even if you don't share your games with him, after he set your console as his home console, you will be able to play his games.&nbsp;</p><p>So it's not "Game Sharing". It's the Home Console family sharing. </p>

Hi bunnycub,
What is the error message you receive from Windows when you activate the mobile hotspot? Post the screenshot.
Verify in the properties of the main adapter connected to the internet&gt; Sharing tab that the check boxes are deselected.

no error message pops up it just says applying settings but I haven't changed any

                    <p>OT: My computer shuts itself down with a full blue screen warning message "A problem has occurred and windows has shut down to prevent damage etc."<br />
This occurs during the actions:-</p>
<p>1. Searching in Ebay for say 'mobile phone covers', the site suggests 'samsung mobile phone covers' bit as soon as I click on this, the shutdown occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When using AA Autoroute to get directions. I enter my search parameters and as soon as I click on 'GO' or 'SEARCH' my computer immediately shuts down.</p>

            <span>Hi William Alexander-966,<br />
<br />
1. Was it working fine earlier?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-Windows-7</a><br />
<br />
If the above steps fail, I would suggest you to check for the exact error message in the event viewer and post us back the exact error message.<br />
<br />

    <title>Installed software missing from registry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 123forman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed software missing from registry</h2>
                    <p>After the recent Windows 10 Anniversary Update, my computer started crashing shortly after start up on every reboot, and I was forced to re-install windows. The re-install interface indicated that all software would be un-installed, but that was not the
 case. I keep Windows on a small C:\ drive, and almost all of my software was left intact on my larger B:\ drive. However, none of that software is now in the registry, so much of it won't run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to avoid haphazardly deleting and re-installing ~ 275 GB of software, most of it downloaded painstakingly at 500 KB/s, if possible. Is there some way of adding the software to the registry without having to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            <p>Hi Wungraileng,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to give up and reformat my hard drives and do a clean install. However, since it looks like someone else has the same issue, I'll try to answer your follow-up question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. From the Windows login screen (lock screen?), I held down SHIFT, then hit the power button and selected "restart." This opened a system recovery menu. I selected an option to delete all apps and programs, but keep my files, and reinstall windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted above, in the end this left most of my software seemingly intact, on my second hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. This varies, but certain programs, when I try to run the main *.exe, immediately give an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Again this varies, but it's something to the effect of "[This program] is not installed on your computer."</p>

<p>WOW, are you sure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is pure concidence, because if you look at the screen capture I provided - that is the exact same Device ID</p>
<p>So the device is an Intel 82579LM Gigabyte Network Controller -<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25016/Intel-Network-Adapter-Driver-for-Windows-10-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Click HERE</a> to download the driver for that device
 (select the correct one for your system, 32bit or 64bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One thing to note, I have had issues with this device kicking out on a regular basis, however if you are using WiFi rather than cabled network, you do not need this device and can simply right click the device in Device Manager and select 'Disable'</p>

<br />
you may need to adjust colour on monitor-or check out display in control panel-or update video driver.

<p>Hello kingjoseph,</p>
<p>See if you can boot into Safe Mode. <br />
To get to Safe Mode:<br />
a) Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key(on most systems) on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.<br />
b) Select an option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
c) When the Boot menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear in blue at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>If successful, then try to go to Control Panel and adjust color. <br />
You may also want to update the video drivers. <br />
<br />
If you can't get into Safe Mode, I would contact Sony for assistance. <br />

<p>Did you try installing the game in compatibility mode and check? If not try the steps below to run the game in&nbsp; compatibility mode and check if it helps.

Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘<strong>Properties’</strong>.</p>

Click on the ‘<strong>Compatibility’ </strong>tab and check the box ‘<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for’

<h2>            Desktop Display</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 8 starts up correctly, and my opening Windows screen is OK. However, when I select Desktop from the Menu, the desktop appears, and constantly resets approx. every 5 seconds, preventing me from using anything on the desktop screen. When I
 switch back to the Windows 8 screen, it will also reset every 5 seconds. The only way I can regain control is to use the 3 finger salute, sign off, and sign back on again. It will then return me to a normal Windows 8 screen. I am unable to run anything from
 the desktop, and have limited use of programs from the Windows 8 screen. If I select display settings from the Windows 8 search menu, it comes up on the desktop display, but resets so fast, I cannot check or change anything. I have checked my device listing
 from control panel, and everything is OK. If I run safe mode, it still resets every 5 seconds, so it's not a driver issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not want to refresh or restore Windows 8, as&nbsp;I had to do it once before, and it took me over a week to reload all the programs, find the program keys, and download the ones that I did not have on disk. I even had to buy 2 programs I had previously,
 as I could not find the keys for them. Using refresh or restore is not an option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using an HP&nbsp;Pavillion DV7T laptop, with an I7 processor and max ram. I installed Win 8 over Win 7 professional about 2 months ago, and had no initial problems. A month ago, I had to restore Win 8, as it failed to initialize properly.......
 that's when I found out all my programs were gone on the restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums. 
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the description, computer keeps refreshing itself. Correct me if I’m wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To assist you better I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the hardware or software to your computer prior to the issue?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps and check,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Disconnect the external devices (like printers, scanner,
 USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Disable third-party Security Software</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On your Computer screen Task Bar next to System Clock..</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You will see the third-party Security Software Icon.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on the third-party Security Software Icon, you will see a pop up.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In that pop and select the option to disable, click on it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now the third-party Security Software will be disabled.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer
 against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or
 a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:
</span></b><b><span>Run a system file checker scan</span></b><span> and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the following steps to run SFC scan:</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on ‘Command Prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click ‘Yes’ if it prompts for permission.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the command prompt type in the following command: ‘<b>sfc /scannow’</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix
 and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Method 4: Run a full scan using MSS (</span></b><b><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner<span>) to make sure that
 the Computer is virus free. </span></span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A fast way to check for viruses is to use an online scanner, such as the Microsoft Safety Scanner. The scanner is a free online service that helps you
 identify and remove viruses, clean up your hard disk, and generally improve your computer's performance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To run the Microsoft Safety Scanner:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Go to the Microsoft Safety Scanner webpage to download the scanner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></b></a><b><span>
</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>b. Click
<strong>Download Now</strong>, and then follow the instructions on the screen.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a
 scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method</span></b><b><span> 5:
</span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span>Perform Clean Boot.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known
 as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all the ideas. Unfortunately, nothing has worked so far.&nbsp; In answer to your question, the computer keeps refreshing itself, but only AFTER I switch to desktop. Original Win 8 screen is fine, but after switching to desktop, Win 8 screen will also
 reset if I switch back to it.</p>
<p>I had made a few changes, including adding a wireless printer, and updating some drivers. However, in Device Driver manager, it does not report any issues, and I believe the drivers must be OK, because my initial Win 8 screen is fine.</p>
<p>I was able to try 4 of the 5 methods you listed.</p>
<p>1. Disconnecting all but the mouse and keyboard had no effect</p>
<p>2. Disabling my Norton's security had no effect</p>
<p>3. Could not run sfc/scannow....... As soon as I select Admin command prompt, it switches to desktop display, and starts the reset process before the Admin command prompt could load. Strangely though, if I just selected command prompt, it would load on the
 display screen. However, it would not run without admin rights.</p>
<p>4. Running a full scan with MSS&nbsp;had no effect</p>
<p>5 Using MSconfig for a clean boot had no effect (I had also tried that earlier)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm still back to square one, and it's causing me a lot of grief because it prevents me from using Microsoft Office, as well as many other programs I have. Doing a system refresh or restore may help, but as I mentioned earlier, it took me over a week
 to get most of my programs back up and running.</p>
<p>I'm open to any other ideas. Again, thanks for your help..... hope you have other suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Instead of a system restore or a refresh you should use the last resort on the PC Settings page--Remove and reinstall win 8. You will have to reinstall all your programs and all your files since this is a clean install and has no remnants of your previous
 windows. I updated several computers and not one of them would work 100% unless I used this option. It's a pain, but in the long run you'll be glad you did it. Make backups or copies of all your personal files to external media and make sure you have all your
 programs installation disks or downloads.

            <p>I want to thank everyone for their responses. As I did not want to do a refresh, restore, or reinstall, I continued to seek an alternative. I then remembered that I had purchased a third party software that performed a disk image about 2 weeks prior to my
 problem. I was very hesitant to use it, but it restored my system to an operating function, and I only lost the last 10 days work (most of which I was able to remember and recover).</p>
<p>I still have no idea what caused my original problem, as I put back in everything I had done prior to the issue. I think it must be Win 8 Magic, as this new system has created quite a few situations that I never had in Win 7. I hope the folks at Microsoft
 are listening, and will come up with a revision that eliminates all these quirks.</p>
<p>Again, thank you all for your assistance. It was much appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>I just ran into the same problem - however, running the computer in SAFE mode allowed me to troubleshoot. The culprit for me was Norton background services trying to start missing components upon loading the desktop. Running Norton Removal Tool solved
 the issue for me. I'm wondering if you may have had a persistent background service.</div>

            <p>I FOUND THE ANSWER!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a SERVICE which is malfunctioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to&nbsp;<strong>CONTROL PANEL</strong>, select <strong>ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS,</strong> select
<strong>EVENT VIEWER,&nbsp;</strong>click on <em><strong>Administrative Events</strong></em>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under&nbsp;<em>Administrative Events I FOUND</em></p>
<p>The HP Connected Remote Service service terminated unexpectedly. &nbsp;It has done this
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2683</span></strong> time(s). &nbsp;The following corrective action will be taken in<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> 5000</span> milliseconds: Restart the service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I waited for 4 refreshes. I clicked away from Administrative Events, then clicked on Administrative Events The Counter was at 2687 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I THEN KNEW I HAD THE CULPRIT. To fix my problem, I had to&nbsp;<strong>CHANGE THE PREFERENCES&nbsp;</strong>for<em> HP Connected Remote Service.</em> (YOU MAY FIND A DIFFERENT&nbsp;<strong>FAULTY</strong> SERVICE.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>TO CHANGE THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to TASK MANAGER (Press the keys&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl, Alt, Del</strong> AT THE SAME TIME.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select TASK MANAGER, Choose the TAB Services, Click on the heading NAME, to rearrange the Services by alphabetical order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Find the FAULTY SERVICE.</p>
<p>RGHT CLICK on Faulty Service, select Open Services</p>
<p>In the SERVICES window, find the Faulty Service again, RIGHT CLICK Service and select Properties. Under properties, Select RECOVERY. Under Recovery&nbsp;<strong>I set First Failure, Second Failure and Subsequent Failures to&nbsp;</strong>TAKE NO ACTION, Then click
 the APPLY Button. Now back out OR shut down the Control Panel AND the Task Manager. YOU ARE DONE, No more 8 second refreshes/flickers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a NARRATIVE of what worked on my HP Pavillion G7, You should consult someone knowledgeable before attempting difficult tasks. I am not liable for damage to your computer if YOU attempt or perform these operations on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a HP computer, the problem could be the same</p>
<p>5000 milliseconds is 5 seconds</p>
<p>
</p><p>This procedure saved me the time and money for RESTORING my system</p>
<p>

            <p>Jerry, thanks for posting this. It gave me the clue I needed.</p>
<p>My problem was not resolved in quite the same way but once I had located the problem as you suggested, it was just a matter of uninstalling the offending program and service: TortoiseCVS and March Hare CVSNT. These do not play well with Windows 10.</p>
<p>Thanks, again.</p>

            No one but HP will have drivers for that printer. You can try the Vista drivers and see if they will work. If not and HP has no plans to write drivers for that printer, you are sadly out of luck with it.
