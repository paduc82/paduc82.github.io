<h2>            Xbox live and adding a code</h2>
                    <p>I have an Xbox subscription already on my 1st Xbox One. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a second Xbox One and a few extra controllers. They came with 14 day codes...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I will log in with my same password/account, are the 3 different codes usable or will that mess my account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance :)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can't use them until after the 1 month has gone away. I can't remember if the 14 days codes stack though</p>

<p>Trial codes do not stack and like the previous reply said you would have to wait till your current subscription ends. Then add it in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing is that you would not be eligible for the free games with gold with the trial subscriptions.</p>

<h2>            How can you burn your photos to CD&#47;DVD along with all the tag, caption, flags, and other data added&#63;</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
I have general questions about Windows Live Photo Gallery

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Photo Gallery are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
My father wants to import all our family photos from the CDs they're stored on, and then add information to the files in Windows Live Photo Gallery.&nbsp; He wants to tag the photos, identify people, set captions, geotags, descriptions, etc.<br />
<br />
The goal is to then burn the photos&nbsp;back to CD or DVD, with all of that tag, caption, etc, information saved with the photos.&nbsp; Is it possible to then view the CD or DVD to see a photo and all of that data attached to it?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            @ Eugene R. - I think that you've got your facts almost entirely wrong.<br />
<br />
WLPG <strong>will</strong> save Descriptive Tags, Captions, Geotags, People Tags (if you've identified faces in the image) and Ratings as metadata into JPEG files, as well as holding this information in its local database.<br />
<br />
However, WLPG does <strong>not</strong> save Flags as metadata in the image files, but only in its local database.<br />
<br />
So, going back to the original question of MoiFou, it is certainly possible to import family photos from data CDs onto a PC's hard drive, and then use WLPG to add metadata to the photo files (as long as they are in a supported format, such as JPEG).<br />
<br />
Once the metadata has been added to the files, then it <strong>is</strong> possible to burn them onto CDs/DVDs (<strong>formatted as data discs</strong>). Since the CDs/DVDs now contain copies of the files (complete with their embedded metadata), these can
 be used on other PCs of other family members. If those PCs are running WLPG (or another application that understands image metadata), all the embedded metadata will be revealed by WLPG.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of things to be aware of:<br />
1) What WLPG calls a "geotag" is not the usual meaning of the term. WLPG writes a textual string, like a street&nbsp;address, into the image metadata. If MoiFou's father means geotagging to be adding coordinate data (Lattude and Longitude) to a photo, then WLPG
 doesn't do this. He could use GeoSetter to do this.<br />
2) WLPG will write the "Caption" into the metadata field of an image file that is usually used for the "Title" of a file. These are not the same thing. While Windows itself knows the difference between "Title" and "Caption" metadata, WLPG confuses the two.<br />
<br />

</p><p>If you just want to wipe everything from the Hard Drive, including the operating system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use this: <a href="https://dban.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(26, 13, 171, 1)">Data Removal: Darik's Boot and Nuke - DBAN</span></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just want to reinstall:</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them or us&nbsp;for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Examples:</p>
<p>Acer: Press Alt + F10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell: Press F8 &gt; <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/sln130396/restoring-microsoft-windows-vista-to-factory-configuration?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>HP: Tap F11 at the rate of about once per second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sony Vaio: Press F10 &gt; <a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/articles/00070113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>___________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you do have a Manufacturer's Recovery Partition on your Hard Drive, you should be able to make your own Recovery Disks from it to reinstall the Operating System.</p>
<p>Look under Programs &gt; your Computer Manufacturer's name &gt; then their System Tools or Recovery Software Headings for them, depending how it is worded.</p>
<p>If you can not find any reference to it, contact the&nbsp;Manufacturer for advice on how to make those Recovery Disks.</p>

<h2>            Unable to make Network connections&#59; workstation&#59; Computer Browser services not running</h2>
                    Here at home, my son is running Win7 Home Premium on a Lenovo G470 laptop - which up until about two weeks ago was running great. &nbsp;However, somewhere along the line, he was unable to get to our home network locations: The event log is lit up with errors
 -- Workstation Service and Computer Browser services are not running and the the errors seem to point to the mrxsmb.sys file in the winsxs folder of Windows. &nbsp;I'll post some error entries below: but they all say things like: &nbsp;Service Control Manager error
 7003: &nbsp;"The SMB 2.0 minidirector service depends on the following service: mrxsmb. &nbsp;This service might not be installed." &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've checked the winsxs folder the it contains mrxsmb versions -- so perhaps they are corrupt? &nbsp;I have an indentical G470 laptop for my younger son and have been comparing their configurations but can't see where the problematic on is missing a mrxsmb.sys
 file -- but then that folder (winsxs) if freaking huge and I may be missing something. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So: question: is there a way for windows to repair its system files without wiping the hard drive and starting from scratch? &nbsp;Unfortunately, I don't have the install disks as Lenovo does not ship with them -- but obviously I do have a &nbsp;genuine version
 of Win7 complete with key on the lable on the bottom of the laptop. &nbsp;For some reason, I also didn't have "restore points" &nbsp;turned on -- so there are none to revert the system back to. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried just copying in the mrxsmb.sys files from the working G470 laptop in case the file was corrupted &nbsp;... but Windows prevented me, saying I needed "trusted installer" credentials instead of just "administrator" rights. Ugh ... If anyone could point
 me to some workarounds to this going, I'd greatly appreciate it ... &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've also uninstalled all recent software - hardware additions including Java (which I read my cause this kind of problem), a Logitech web cam ... &nbsp;to no avail.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here are three log files: there are more but all point to seemingly the same thing: the services that are not running: Workstation, Computer Browser, SMB 2.0 MiniRedirector service, SMB 1.x MiniRedirector Service ..&nbsp;</div>

            Try setting WMP as the default media player again, through&nbsp; <strong>Control Panel</strong> -&nbsp;<strong>Programs
</strong>-&nbsp; <strong>Default Programs</strong> -&nbsp; <strong>Set your default programs</strong> . Does that bring the WMP options back?

<p><strong><span>Hi lowndes06,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to change the AutoPlay settings and then check.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps to specify what should happen when you insert different types of digital media into your computer.<br />
a. </span><span><span>Open AutoPlay by clicking the &nbsp;</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button,
 and then clicking&nbsp; </span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>. In the search box, type&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><strong>auto
 play</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then click</span></span><span><span><strong>&nbsp; AutoPlay</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span><span><br />
b. Under &nbsp;</span><span><span><strong>Media</strong></span></span></span><span><span>, find the type of media that you want to change the AutoPlay setting
 for.<br />
c. Click the action that you want AutoPlay to take when you insert that type of media into your computer.<br />
You can select actions like Play audio CD using Windows Media Player for audio CD, Burn an audio Cd using Windows Media Player for Bland CD, etc.<br />
d. Click&nbsp; </span><span><span><strong>Save</strong></span></span><span>.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Points expiration help</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>I was told by a customer agent on the phone to post asking for help on these forums. First time posting here as well. I used to buy a bunch of Microsoft points years ago. Microsoft decided to convert these points to $ value and unfortunately they came with expiration dates. I had over 400$ in points converted and was only able to use some of it. I had a remaining balance of 164.55$ and now they are expired, I was wondering if anyone here with the power to help me get it reinstated. I have done this over the phone a couple times (in 2015 and in 2016). Each time the agent gave it back to me manually in 25$ increments called "xbox live rewards deposit" Please help!</p><p><br /></p><p>164.55$ is a lot of money to lose...</p><p><br /></p><p>Gamertag is DoctorRice87</p>

 </blockquote> <p><br /></p><p>Yeah I was on phone chat for 3 hours with 7 different representatives. I should have just given up, but each representative gave me the impression that it could be fixed, so I keep getting transferred back and forth. Back then Microsoft points never expired, then they converted it to you $ value, and the reps uploaded all my currency as xbox live rewards money... so they came with expiration dates. I was able to extend them twice from 2015 and in 2016 after they expired. Took only one call and it was done. Not sure why this time it's different...</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Briefcase is not viable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s wink  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Briefcase is not viable</h2>
                    I use briefcase extensively to sync my travel laptop with my office desktop. I carry virtually my entire working life in two large synced files. Windows 7 seems to render briefcase unusable. 1) a.sync source file and b. status are missing from the default
 Windows Explorer display. I finally figured out how to restore them, but it is hardly user friendly. 2) Syncing analysis is so slow it needs to speed up to stop (usually Task Manager says it is non-responsive) but it does (I think) usually come back if you
 wait long enough. I've given up on wireless as I believe that is worse. 3) If there is a way to "split from original" so that files or directories may be removed from the briefcase, I haven't figured out how. 4)Other strange things happen. My "Critical" briefcase
 just changed from a briefcase into a normal folder for reasons I haven't figured. Had a file marked read only, which wouldn't sync, and after removing the read only attribute, resyncing and exiting, the briefcase icon was replaced by the folder icon and no
 longer had briefcase characteristics. (That may not bee the reason, I did other things, but that was the strangest.). - If anybody at MS is interested in making Briefcase viable, I'd love to help. - SY Wink<br />

            If one requires synchronization so urgently and in a professional capacity perhaps one should purchase synchronization software such as Allway Sync or BellSync or GoodSync or others. Also, if data management is part of ones profession, than one may have
 buddies that can try out the different software and collaborate on the best of what's out there. Again, if you make more money by being on your A-game with file synchronization than it pays to purchase specialized software instead of kicking yourself and crying
 about it for all to hear, no?. Good software is only about 20 bucks. I make less than 30k a year and can afford that :)<br />
<br />
To all, this thread raises an important problem of compounding a problem with frustrated ranting. If one is frustrated than take a moment to focus on the goal before one speaks out. Otherwise you don't solve anything and you reinforce and popularize adolescent
 behavior. Readers should also consider ranting to possibly be trolling or competitor negative advertising. Compulsive insincerity and cowardly rude behavior are going to cause big problems if we don't all recognize them as bringing society into very dark times.<br />
<br />
Dear S Wink, you could do your listening audience a great service and post reviews of software like the aforementioned. Maybe even get into a Linux club and work with GNU projects perhaps? If your job involves these things than you stand to really contribute
 to making things better. If your job is to talk down Microsoft than you're doing great, lol.
<br />
<br />
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all.

            SYWink,<br />
I stumbled across your post in looking for answers to the Windows 7 Briefcase. What I was able to find as an answer (at least for my situation) was that the necessary menu bar for the briefcase was hidden by default in Win7. The standard Windows 7 folder view
 doesn't have the familiar File, Edit, View, etc. You can re-enable the normal menu bar by clicking on Organize-Layout-Menu Bar. Once this is enabled you will also see the familiar "Briefcase" option in that menu bar when you're in your Briefcase. Under Briefcase
 you should see the "Split From Original" option.<br />
I have not yet looked into the sync speed, so I have no insight as to that. However, as for the briefcase magically turning into a regular folder, I have actually seen that on just about every Microsoft OS, I've never found a reason for it.<br />
I hope this helps you, at least a little.<br />

<h2>            Strict NAT on One Xbox, Open on Another&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having some difficulty opening ports for my girlfriend's Xbox. We are both hardwired directly on the same router.. My Xbox is set to DMZplus mode, so my NAT Type is Open.<br />
My girlfriend's on the other hand, is behind a port-restricted NAT, and therefore her NAT Type is set to Strict. Yes, I have port forwarded every port suggested on Xbox's website, to no avail. I have also setup a static IP for her Xbox. It's still Strict.<br />
I'm on AT&amp;T U-Verse, and I'm using a 2Wire 3801HGV Router (AT&amp;T Supplied.)<br />
Anyone have any tips on how to fix this?</p>
<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in?: <strong>United States/Florida.</strong><br />
Modem brand &amp; model number:<strong> Unknown.</strong><br />
Router brand &amp; model number: <strong>2Wire 3801HGV.</strong><br />
How many Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles are connected to this router?: <strong>Two</strong><br />
Wired or Wireless (for each console): <strong>Both Wired</strong><br />
Things you have tried:<strong> Static IP and Port Forwarding.</strong><br />
Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/No/Unknown:<strong> The router does not support UPnP.</strong><br />
Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT type?:<strong> Strict NAT Type, Network is behind a port-symmetric NAT.</strong><br />

<p>You wont be able to open both without UPNP , you will need a seperate modem and a router that supports UPNP.....the stuff you get from your isp usually isnt very gaming friendly , especially with a 'Gateway" (modem and router combo) ....your xboxs are fighting
 over ports and one will always win....if you can use your own equipment with U-Verse ( i dont know much about that isp) &nbsp;then i would give that back to them and get your own...</p>

<p>@I STAY NASTY hey hey</p>
<p>As @Bimnog stated earlier, it seems Your gateway can't be used for such complex setups, because network port can be used only for one device exclusively. DMZ is automatic port forwarding but for one device, so, You can't use ports forwarded for Your Xbox
 One, for Your girlfriend Xbox One.</p>

<h2>            Screen Burn or Light Bleed, how can I fix it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm Using Surface Pro 2017, and after 1 month usage, I got this pink stain and some dark stain around it. It's visible when only when displaying bright color like white, yellow etc. It's disappear when displaying black color. I also notice a green-like that's
 visible only when displaying black color. It's so subtle that my camera can't quite catch it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the pic of the pink stain:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd637ca8-4bc3-4543-82e5-b4c473bbd499?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd637ca8-4bc3-4543-82e5-b4c473bbd499?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>My question is:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Is anyone experienced this before?</strong></li><li><strong>Did the warranty cover this?</strong></li><li><strong>Can I fix it myself?</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing, I live in Indonesia, and Microsoft didn't launch Surface Pro here. I bought it via dealer that bought it from Microsoft Singapore. I notice that the warranty is still exist until Oct 25, 2018. When i tried to order a repair service, I cannot
 choose Indonesia as my shipping address.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there any other way to claim my warranty without using any 3rd party involved?</strong></p>
<p>My dealer offered me a help to claim the warranty, but I still don't believe him since I bought it online.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks! :)</p>

<p>Hi Afrizal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some Surface Pro units bought online are reported to have backlight bleed issues, and the best option would be is to return/repurchase. Your new Surface comes with a one-year limited hardware warranty and 90 days of technical support, and hardware defects
 and malfunctions are covered. The Surface standard limited warranty is applicable only in the country where you purchased your Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you contact our <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Global Support</a> for assistance if you opt to get a replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any additional concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Regards.</p>

<p>Yeah, plenty of people experienced similar issues before. But I would be even more pissed off by that terrible backlight bleed that you have on the bottom edge of the screen. It kinda reminds me of my own unit, actually.

<p>
</p><p>There is no conceivable way in which you could fix it yourself, and especially in a way preserving your warranty.</p>

            Hi Bespectacled_Balatron,
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />Look for Windscribe VPN on the initial list and also on the Logon Tab of Autoruns, then right click and remove it

            <p>My instance of this problem was caused by my disabling (in registry) Quick Access in Explorer Navigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is to get to Folder Options and set the "Open File Explorer to:" drop-down to "This PC" instead of "Quick access".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe that helps in your case, too.</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply with clarification on what type of device you're using to play Forza Motorsport 7. Since you're using a PC version and are experiencing the game freezing up and not responding, there could be a couple of things happening to cause that.</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the game. Some of these programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform
 a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have bought a new PC (64 bit) on which I installed Windows 8.</p>
<p>On purpose I created a directory where I would like to install XPO pro which I used to run on my old (32 bit) machine.</p>
<p>I tried to install XP with the original CD but it fails as after a while I get a blue screen.</p>
<p>Can anyone give me a clue as to whether or not this is feasible ?</p>

            <p>I would strongly recommend if you need to run Windows XP, you should install and use it in a virtual machine program such as VMware Player or Oracle Virtual Box.</p>
<p>When dual booting with Windows 8, the older operating system should be installed first.</p>
<p>Because you are using a modern computer, it is likely your system does not support Windows XP.
</p>
<p>Also, attempting to dual boot with Windows 8 might render the system in operable:</p>
<p>You can use alternatives such as Oracle VirtualBox or VMWare Player.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a></p>

<p>-----------------------</p>
<p>If you are considering dual booting still, at a minimum, backup your Windows 8 installation:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/how-to-backup-your-windows-8-installation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/how-to-backup-your-windows-8-installation/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>It is important you have a reinstallation or repair disc in case you need to reinstall or repair your WIndows 8 installation.
</p>
<p>The following article will show you how to create a repair disc (references Windows 7, same instructions for Windows 8):</p>

<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drivers for Windows XP:</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</b>
<p>You should first find out if your computer is compatible with Windows XP. A lot more modern computers are phasing out support for Windows XP.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create Partition</p>
</b>
<p>Open a Run command (Press Windows key + R) on your keyboard. Then type diskmgmt.msc then hit Enter on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Once Disk Management is open, select the C:\ or where Windows 8 is installed. </p>
<p>Right click it and click Shrink menu. </p>
<p>Wait while Windows 8 checks for available disk space.</p>
<p>Enter the amount you want to allocate.</p>
<p>Click OK. </p>
<p>The Disk Management window should display unallocated disk space. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install Windows XP</p>
</b>
<p>In order to install Windows XP on the partition you created, you will need to boot into your BIOS and set the hard disk mode to IDE.
</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After you have set the hard disk IDE mode, you can proceed to install Windows XP on the partition you created;</p>
<p>Insert your Windows XP CD, then restart your computer.</p>
<p>When prompted to boot from the CD, do so. This requires pressing any key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Windows XP will go through its setup process. </p>
<p>Once you arrive at the Welcome Setup, press Enter on your keyboard to begin the setup process</p>
<p>Press F8 on your keyboard to accept the license agreement</p>
<p>Select the partition </p>
<p>Select Format the partition using the NTFS file system</p>
<p>Press F on your keyboard to begin the formatting.</p>
<p>Installation files will now be copied to your hard disk</p>
<p>Your system will be restarted, Windows XP setup will continue</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Windows XP installs successfully, you will not be able to boot into Windows 8 This is where the recovery disc for Windows 8 comes in.</p>
</b>
<p>Boot from the Windows 8 DVD</p>
<p>a) At the Install Now screen</p>
<p>b) Click Repair your computer</p>
<p>c) Click Advanced Options</p>
<p>d) Click Troubleshoot</p>
<p>e) Click Startup repair</p>
<p>f) Follow the on screen instructions</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After you have repaired your Windows 8 installation and try to boot it, you will notice that Windows 8 does not boot.
</p>
<p>Boot into the BIOS again and set the hard disk mode to SATA. You will now be able to boot into Windows 8 again.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After doing that, download EasyBCD and add a boot entry for Windows XP to the Windows 8 boot manager;</p>
<p>EasyBCD by NeoSmart Technologies would be your answer, it provides a graphical front end to the BCDEdit Command line that makes it easy for you to define start-up settings and edit boot entries on the new Windowsboot manager.

<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The next step now is make it possible for Windows 8 to boot in IDE mode. </p>
<p>Here are the instructions for doing that:</p>
<p>http://www.vistax64.com/general-discussion/271218-switch-ahci-ide-tutorial-howto.html</p>
<p>Welcome all , so let me explain I installed Windows 8 With AHCI set from Bios , but after that i wanted to use ide (becose it boots faster) and when i set Ide from Bios , the windows 7 loading screan camed upp and BSOD (Blue screen of death) with an error
 code 0x0000005B , i tryed the regedit trick by setting in the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESystemCurrentControlSetServicesMsahci" and then in the right pan the START value from 0 i set it to 1 and it supposed to be working but it was a failiure , it still did the Bsod
 and i was so pissed of , i wanted to make it work ... AND I DID IT !<br />
<br />
Here are the pases :<br />
1) I assume u have installed Windows Vista or Windows 8 with AHCI set from BIOS !<br />

                    There were two updates on 5/15/2019.&nbsp; Right after the updates and resets, wired internet (ethernet) and sound were not working.&nbsp; Wireless internet was working though.&nbsp; Tried everything suggested on this site like checking the default sound device, updating
 drivers, and so on.&nbsp; Nothing worked.&nbsp; Anybody else has the same problems?&nbsp; Any anyone fixed the problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Austin 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Since you have already tried all, there are two other actions which you can undertake. You can try them one by one and check after each.
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Austin
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability/functionality is restored. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point more before the problem started. 
<br />
<br />If the above does not work...
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type: 
<br />
<br />netsh int ip reset
<br />
<br />Hit Enter 
<br />Exit the prompt then restart
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Network adapters
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />If not, press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart. Windows 10 should detect the network adapter then reinstall it. Check if you can connect and browse.
<br />
<br />also try:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom then click Network reset.
<br />
<br />I suggest you to run the Audio troubleshooter and check if it helps.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-sound-problems#v1h=tab03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/f...</a>
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, then try to uninstall and re-install the audio driver.
<br />
<br />    Press Windows  Logo Key+X. Click on Device Manager.
<br />    In the list of hardware categories, look for the device that you want to update, and then right-click on it to Uninstall.
<br />    Follow onscreen instructions to uninstall it.
<br />    To re-install, either you can restart the system or install the driver from the manufacturerÃ­s website (recommended as they will have updated drivers).
<br />
<br />For reference:
<br />
<br />Try all the steps provided in the link below and check if it helps.

    <title>BSOD &#40;DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE&#41; when updating from Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erns pen  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD &#40;DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE&#41; when updating from Windows  8.1 Pro &#40;64 bits&#41; to Windows 10 PRo &#40;at 72&#37;&#41; - Windows update error code&#58; C1900101-40017</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I'm trying to update my Sony VAIO Flip 13 (SVF13N17PXB) with Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 10 Pro. During the installation process (Installing features and drivers part) I get stock on 6% of "features and driver installation" (for like a good 30 min).
 Then installation get stock on 71% (overall % completion), a time at which I get a BSOD (DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE).&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the restart (rolling back to Windows 8.1 of course), I get a windows update error:&nbsp;C1900101-40017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect this is a driver issue, does anyone have this same problem and knows what might be causing this issue (I successfully updated my Sony VAIO DUO 11 in ~20 minutes with no problem, and my drivers and Windows updates in that compouter were really out
 of date so I don't know what the issue might be).</p>
<p>Thanks everyone beforehand &nbsp;</p>

            thanks for the reply Kiran, I've looked at the post and tried a few things out but still get BSOD during the last part of the installation progress. I'm pretty sure is a drivers issue but don't have enough knowledge to look at the installation logs to
 see which driver it is (my guess it's either Intel or Sony's but not sure since I succesfully upgraded my older Sony VAIO Duo 11 a few weeks ago)

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Ther is no way to recall emails in Windows Mail i'm afraid. Once you send it then its gone for good. Perhaps you should just email again and apolise for the error(s) and ask the recipient to ignore that email.

<h3> tobeycox  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you install additional voices for narrator in windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My son's curriculum has a text to speech option using windows narrator in Windows 7. Microsoft Anna cuts too many words short and mispronounces many words and does not take appropriate pauses while reading. I have tried to download many additional voices
 to be able to select them within the program but they never show up in the control panel not in the&nbsp;curriculum's&nbsp;"select voice" drop down box. I do not have the option to extract the voices in the directory that MS Anna is said to be saved in. Has this issue
 been solved. Is there a way for me to get additional voices in Window 7??? Installing a third party program is not an option unless it allows the voices to be used in Narrator as this is what the program uses.</p>

<div>
<p><span><br />
Unfortunately, there is only one program that is Narrator in Windows 7.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>Narrator is the text-to-speech program in Windows 7 that reads what is displayed on your screen, including the contents of the active window, menu options, or the text you have typed. Narrator reads menus without leaving the active window and includes
 a pleasant, natural-sounding voice.<br />
Narrator has a number of options that allow you to customize the way screen elements are read. You can:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><br />
â€¢ Read Narrator menus without leaving the active window.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>â€¢ Move around the desktop with the number keys using virtual focus, which allows you to move through the objects on the desktop and read aloud any content they contain.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><br />
â€¢ Move around the desktop with the arrow keys using virtual menus.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><br />
â€¢ Use bookmarks to find commonly used programs.</span></p>

            I don't need the textbook sales pitch for navigator. I need to know if I can change the voice used. The navigator program has a drop down box to choose the voice to use but I can't seem to get any of my downloaded voices to show up there. Please give me
 a real answer and not a prefab reply that does not answer my question!

            I know this was asked a long time ago, but I just wanted to say that the best voice that I have ever used is Ivona Voice (http://www.ivona.com/us/)<br />
<br />
The mini-reader is free, but you have to purchase the voices.&nbsp; Or you can get the regular Reader, which I think comes with some voices.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You can also try the android app, which is free while it is in beta at the time of this writing.<br />
<br />
I don't work for Ivona, nor am I an affiliate.&nbsp; Just a very satisfied customer!<br />
<br />
They have the most realistic voices.<br />

Agree with your assessment.&nbsp; Microsoft CONSTANTLY gives blatantly WRONG ANSWERS to a valid, simple question that needs nothing more than a simple answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, it's always some hype about buying THIRD PARTY software that THEY #1. DON'T SUPPORT and #2. DON'T
 RECOMMEND,&nbsp;&nbsp; So why bother with THOSE answers in the first place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want MORE voices for MICROSOFT NARRATOR, NOT some dadburn 3rd party software, why does Microsoft MAKE SUCH LIMITATIONS as to ONE VOICE file for their Narrator?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have many voice files in another software package, but they ARE NOT IMPORTABLE into Narrator,
 and THAT IS WHAT I WANT, ADDITIONAL VOICES for Narrator, if Microsoft IS NOT going to make them, then give us the tools and software FOR FREE to build our own voice files that could be imported into Narrator.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I loathe the nickel and diming&nbsp;us to death{more like taking us to the cleaners}&nbsp;with OVER-PRICED Microsoft software to do something as simple as trying to create a nice voice file that we want and can share with others.&nbsp; And that should be something that
 WAS BUILT INTO Windows 7 in the first place!&nbsp; Anyone agree with that?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Assertion Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dj scandal755  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Assertion Failure</h2>
                    <p>I have a program I have been running called Soundswitch. It links my DMX lighting to my Serato DJ program. SInce the last update I have been getting this Assertion Failure. Now when I hit "RETRY"it does nothing. "ABORT" crashes my program. "IGNORE" causes
 the window to pop back up. I previously did not have the Microsoft Visual Studio, but I downloaded and installed it because I did not have the JIT to debug but so far it has not helped. IF I select "IGNORE" I have been able to use the program, but it does
 not run properly as it used to. I'm looking to find out what has changed that would cause this, and please do not reply that the program is the problem because it was not having a problem before and there Support&nbsp; cannot duplicate the fault. I would like to
 know why a working program would all of a sudden have an Assertion Failure?</p>
