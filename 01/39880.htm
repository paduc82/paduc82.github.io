<h2>            Bass Management Audio Enhancement Does Nothing</h2>
                    My system is connected to a 7.1 Home theater system over HDMI. The system is able to address all audio channels including the sub in speaker setup and playback of multi-channel encoded audio files properly utilize the sub. In this kind of setup stereo
 audio will not utilize the sub as its only 2 channel (L+R), not 3 channel (L+R+sub), which is fine and technically what should happen. The bass management audio enhancement is supposed to run all audio from the other channels through a software low pass filter
 and redirect the lowest frequencies to the sub channel to address this. I've tested this with three different system, all with different audio hardware and drivers, and this feature doesn't seem to work on any of them. It doesn't matter how high I set the
 crossover point, playing some bass heavy audio from something like YouTube gets no response from the sub, there seems to be no difference between the enhancement on and off. It seems unlikely that this is a driver issue if it can be

            There is nothing wrong with the home theater system, and I can play audio on all channels from windows provided I'm using an application that supports multi-channel audio. This is specifically about the bass management feature in the windows audio stack
 not functioning as intended.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the issue description, I understand that you are not able to hear sound from Internet Explorer page and a blank screen appears when you play a video from the internet. I will certainly help you in fixing
 this problem. I would appreciate if you could help me with more information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you make any software/hardware changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Does this issue occur on any particular website?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span>Let‚Äôs follow the below mentioned steps to fix the issue
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that Internet Explorer has been selectively muted in the Volume Mixer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span>To check this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>a) Open Internet Explorer, preferably to a page that should be playing some sound.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) Click on the volume icon in the windows system tray (in the right-hand lower corner of the taskbar), and then click on the link labeled "Mixer".</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>c) A panel will open showing the individual volume levels of all running apps that play sounds (you may need to scroll to the right to see all of them).</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>d) Make sure that the volume level belonging to Internet Explorer is not set to mute.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></strong></p>
<p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 Not Charging While Connected To Surface Dock - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 Not Charging While Connected To Surface Dock</h2>
                    <p>Have a Surface Book 2 (i7 8th Generation).&nbsp; Got a brand new machine and the docking station (Surface Dock).&nbsp; Was surprised to see that the dock, once connected, worked for the displays, USB, etc...etc but was not charging the Surface Book.&nbsp; Of course, charging
 from the Surface Book's own charger was fine, as was the use of an old charger from a Surface 2 PRO. &nbsp; I took the following steps - I am not sure what worked, or if it was a combination of these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) removed the Drivers for the Microsoft ACPi-Compliant Control Method Battery (both of them) and then did a hard reboot (didn't make a difference)</p>
<p>b) Downloaded and ran the MS Surface Diagnostics - said battery charger was shot of the cable was defective (no fix, said to call the MS Store)</p>
<p>c) Hard Reboot after diagnostics</p>
<p>d) Downloaded latest drivers (was a MS Windows 10 patch from the MS Support site) - no change</p>
<p>c) Plugged the Surface Dock power cable into the Surface while detached - no change, but then I removed the AC/power cord from the Surface Dock's power supply and plugged it back in - Viola.&nbsp; Started working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to start at the bottom of this list and work backwards to see what works for you.&nbsp; I hear that a lot of people have returned the Surface Docs, but it seems like you have to fool around with them to get them working.&nbsp; The Surface Pro I have one
 day said that the power supply was no longer charging it - hard reboot seems to have fixed that (it had sat for 2-4 months before that, so not sure if battery level or health had anything to do with that particular case). Seems that the Surface is "fussy"
 about charging at times.</p>

 for posting the steps you took to get your Surface Dock to work.&nbsp; I noticed this problem three or four days ago.&nbsp; I had to charge my Surface Book with the power cable that came with the computer.&nbsp; Anyway, I took your advice and started at the bottom of your
 list.&nbsp; I simply unplugged the power cable from the dock, waited 10-15 seconds and plugged it back in.&nbsp; Now it is charging again.&nbsp; I did check the drivers for the Surface Dock before finding your post.&nbsp; I already had the most current drivers installed.</span></p>

            James - I am glad it helped someone out and possibly saved you some time.&nbsp; I wasted a lot of time trying to figure it out - and it seems that it is a simple/dumb fix.&nbsp; Most people would plug the Surface Dock in to the power and then the cord into the computer.&nbsp;
 The other way around seems to be some sort of winner!

<p>Just an FYI, if you use a lot of peripherals with your dock, it may not provide enough power to keep the surface book 2 charged. Read the article below and see that the dock puts out 90 Watts, but the 15" surface book 2 needs 102 Watts. So when you run the
 book, a screen or two, etc, the book may not get enough of the Watts to charge it.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>"</p>
<div style="color: rgba(16, 16, 16, 1)">
<p>As noted, I've been using my 15-inch Surface Book 2 with the Surface Dock. And I haven't had any issues during everyday computing. However, the Surface Dock power supply provides only 90 watts (W), and that charge
 is distributed to the various gadgets you connect to it. The cord that comes with the Surface Book 2 delivers 102W. Even if you use the 102W cord with the Dock, you're not getting as much power as the Surface Book needs in certain situations.</p>
<p>Our Executive Editor Daniel Rubino <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/does-surface-book-2-15-battery-drain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
recently explained why the Surface Dock is not well suited for use with the 15-inch Surface Book 2</a>, despite the fact that Microsoft's Dock page says it supports that laptop and does not mention any potential power limitations.</p>
<p>From Rubino:</p>
<div style="color: rgba(16, 16, 16, 1)">
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he Surface Dock is a few years old now and supplies less power to the Surface Book 2 partially because it allocates some of the power for the other ports (four USB Type-A, Ethernet, and two DisplayPorts) ‚Ä¶ In
 other words, having multiple devices and displays connected to the Surface Dock may reduce the overall power to the Surface Book 2, which is usually fine for everyday computing, but when in Best performance, may not be enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="color: rgba(16, 16, 16, 1)">
<p>Surface Book 2 users who want the best possible experience may want to use it along with a monitor and various other devices. And they may want to enable the device's "Best performance" mode. But the Surface Dock
 could result in power drainage while the device is plugged in, which is unfortunate, at best, and possibly unacceptable for some users.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Surface Dock is now behind the times, in this regard, and it's not a good look for the company to only offer a Dock that cannot keep up with its highest-end laptop."</p>

            <p>I considered that, but that doesn't really help me in the way that I want in that it seems that it would just lead to me spending a lot of time moving files between the two accounts and making sure that they've merged correctly. And I'm under the impression
 that one account doesn't search files in another, so whoever is assisting me wouldn't be able to readily access all of the data.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like that may be my only option at this point. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I may just move everything over to the local account and abandon the Microsoft account for regular use.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But there's also a good&nbsp;chance that I'm going to&nbsp;pay someone to wipe the thing clean and reinstall Windows 8. I just felt&nbsp;safer with that. &nbsp;</p>

            Personally - unless the system is used primarily for social interactions/social media and entertainment - I don't recommend setting up any Windows Live accounts at all. &nbsp;If it is primarily a "business" system, you aren't missing much of anything by only
 having a primary account.
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>As for having the separate account and the technicians having access to your files - if you aren't using encryption and they have physical access to your system - they don't need your account or anything else to have access to all your files (and if they
 are worth the title they may have) they would just create or activate the accounts they need anyway when fixing it. &nbsp;:-)</div>

            <p>Well.......I think you're right about the Windows Live account thing. I was even looking at deleting that account from the computer and just using a local account but it seems that would actually completely close my Windows accounts, including email. I'm
 going to have to set up the local account as my primary and actively work out of that. The deal is that if I'm having a student work with me and I have them using my computer, I don't want them to just be able to click on (Skydrive, Outlook, or even any other
 account like Facebook) and it just open up to my account. I can simply sign out of things like Facebook and Soundcloud, but not Skydrive or Outlook. And I really don't even feel comfortable handing the machine over to a tech (especially one that I didn't know)
 with such simple, fast tracked access to those accounts. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As far as the technician aspect is concerned; I was really thinking about giving them access as opposed to them getting/creating access. Even the last time I took a laptop to Geek Squad a couple of years for a fan problem, they wanted the password but that
 was probably just for ease of access. But, like you said, "if they are worth..." they could get into it whether I gave them the password or even if I wanted them to or not.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Personally, I'm about the diversifying of my passwords for security reasons. Previously I could sign in to the computer with a password just for signing into the computer&nbsp;and just avoid signing into email or whatever&nbsp;if I thought it was a bad idea at the
 time. Now, if I (or anyone) clicks on the Windows Live account, it shows them my email address as an alias (which I do not like at all and will have to remember to avoid at presentations) and getting past that gives them automatic access to anything else linked
 to it and I can't even seem to opt out of that. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But it looks like I'm&nbsp;probably just going to dump&nbsp;8.1 &nbsp;and revert the computer back to 8 and since the FAQ's made it clear that any type of restore will not do that, I'm probably just going have to pay someone to do it. That is unless you know of a quick
 and easy way to do it. But apparently since the device has 7 on it when I bought it and I did the upgrade online, I'm going to have to revert back to 7 and then upgrade to 8.</p>

            Why revert back from 8.1?<br />
You can create/use local accounts without all of that.<br />

    <title>Cannot detach after 1903 and startmenuexperiencehost.exe - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot detach after 1903 and startmenuexperiencehost.exe</h2>
                    Purchased a new Surface Book and I was able to detach the screen normally. I then updated to all updates including the Windows 10 1903 update. Now when I try to detach I get the message: "Please Resolve before detaching. The following may need to be closed
 in order to detach" and the list is&nbsp;startmenuexperiencehost.exe. It appears that with 1903 the start menu has its own process with this name. Any ideas on how to get past this error?

<p>Very rarely I've seen processes do something that trigger processing on the dGPU. In this case, you can either kill the offending process or restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>startmenuexperiencehost.exe can be safely ended using Task Manager. The next time you try to open the Start menu, there will be a short delay as the process relaunches.<br />

<p>I ran the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit on this Surface Book. I didn't see any indication that it found any missing updates or errors. It required a reboot. Same problem. When I try to do a detach it says that the StartMenuExperienceHost needs to be close in
 order to detach. From what I'm seeing, this is an integral part of Windows 10 after the 1903 update. Anyone else have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I kill the Start Menu process in task manager the detach message changes from the above to "Elevated Processes" as what must be closed in order to detach.</p>

            Yes, I can get it to detach after killing the Start Menu process, but this is a work around and not a fix. I just had to talk my client through how to kill a process in task manager each time he wants to detach. Is there somewhere I can report this to
 Microsoft as a bug with the Surface Book and 1903?

            Turns out it was the setting in NVIDIA control panel that changes after video driver update. Need to change preferred graphics processor change from high-performance NCIDIA processor to integrated graphics.

<h2>            Windows 10 A-PRO MIDI driver issu</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a A-500PRO MIDI Controller and the driver "A-PRO" doesn't work anymore. I uninstalled it and try to reinstalled it and, even if the driver icon shows up in the Programs and Features list, the system doesn't recognize it. As a result, I can't use
 my Keyboard with my DAW.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look in the Device Manager, it says that the driver is not installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version I tried to install is the last one available on the Roland WebSite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run it, the Driver setup installation froze and, then, I have to force the closing of the installation setup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you can install the driver in compatibility mode after upgrading to Windows 10.</p>

Run as administrator may be neccessary for some games and programs because they may have a different permission structure&nbsp;in Vista than in Windows 7 (Windows 7 and Vista are different in how they handle some permissions).<br />
<br />
I suggest you test installing the game in program by right clicking the setup file and clicking "Run as administrator".<br />
<br />
This will sometimes resolve such situations because it installes the program in an elevated permission state.<br />
<br />
Test this out and let us know your results

                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I run flight simulator x, the frames are fine because I have the target frame rate set to 15 fps. But I would like to increase that. When I do, FSX frames start skipping, and acting odd. I did try to set the priority to high in task manager, but that
 did not work. Can you please tell me why this may be&nbsp;happening?</div>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Activation not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kate mclucas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Activation not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently bought a new system tower for my computer that originally came with Windows 10 Home, but was later upgraded to Windows 10 Pro from a restored backup on my old system. So far everything seems to be in working order, however, when I checked the
 Activation settings I was received this information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation: Unable to reach Windows activation servers</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://orig00.deviantart.net/c648/f/2017/280/0/c/screenshot_2017_10_08_12_18_46_by_phantomskies-dbpuv2z.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://orig00.deviantart.net/c648/f/2017/280/0/c/screenshot_2017_10_08_12_18_46_by_phantomskies-dbpuv2z.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried troubleshooting for any activation problems and received the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://orig00.deviantart.net/3be2/f/2017/280/d/7/screenshot_2017_10_08_12_17_56_by_phantomskies-dbpuv1y.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://orig00.deviantart.net/3be2/f/2017/280/d/7/screenshot_2017_10_08_12_17_56_by_phantomskies-dbpuv1y.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And it says, "We found a Windows 10 home digital license for this device running Windows 10 Pro. To activate using this digital license, you need to install Windows 10 Home."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also received the following error when trying to install the product key that I retrieved using ShowKeyPlus: 0xc004f050</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried <strong>slmgr.vbs -ipk </strong><span><strong>xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
</strong>in the command prompt, but the problem is still there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I installed the generic Windows 10 Pro product key and while it seems to be working, I have no changes in terms of activation at all. And I received this message when trying to change the product key with the generic one:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://orig00.deviantart.net/2c46/f/2017/280/7/e/screenshot_2017_10_08_13_09_37_by_phantomskies-dbpv1be.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://orig00.deviantart.net/2c46/f/2017/280/7/e/screenshot_2017_10_08_13_09_37_by_phantomskies-dbpv1be.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And it still says "Unable to reach Windows activation servers". This has been ongoing for a few weeks now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I'm aware, this is a recurring problem among other Windows 10 users. Is there any way to work around this? If so, I appreciate the help. :)</p>

            Do you have a full genuine license for Windows 10 Pro? Windows 10 Pro requires its own unique product key. You can't use the default generic key to activate it and you can't used a preinstalled OEM license from another computer to activate it either.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, this computer does have a license key but is an OEM license that was already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in terms of genuine license key, the only one we actually have is for Windows 10 Home. And that was used for installation on another device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new system tower I bought, which is an Acre Aspire TC-780, didn't come with a physical copy as it was embedded in the BIOS.

<h3> theripper890  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creation Update makes chrome crash every 5 minutes</h2>
                    <p>This is really starting to piss me off. Ever since i downloaded the creators update, which i would like to stress in itself took me 2-3 days because of the amount of issues i encountered just trying to download it in the first place, CHROME CRASHES EVERY
 FIVE MINUTES. Every time i use chrome on my laptop, it crashes every 5 minutes. Quickest fix is just closing my laptop and opening it again so i don't have to reboot chrome AND my laptop. If Microsoft as done this to annoy people and force them to use Edge,
 it only makes me want to use chrome even more. This has been an issue for more than 2 months, the fact there hasn't been a patch/update to fix this is just getting ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background info:</p>
<p>-Using chrome canary</p>
<p>-laptop originally was installed with windows 8.1</p>
<p>-Asus UX303LA, made in 2015.</p>
<p>-Lots of space left on hard drive.</p>
<p>-Had many issues with updates previously.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you need to provide a feedback for Chrome Canary. If the issue just started in Creators Update, it might be a compatibility issue. You may try to run the browser in Compatibility Mode. If it will not make a difference, post this issue under
 Google Chrome Canary forum.</p>
<p>

<p>I was advised that using chrome canary could actually help solve the issue, as i was previously using normal chrome. Updates provided by google are immediately put on chrome canary from my understanding, i was hoping that during one of the updates this issue
 would be resolved.&nbsp;</p>

<div>I'n running Win 7 home premium 64bit, Avast! protection, I run Malware Bytes regularly.</div>

</div>
<div>&nbsp;I've tried TDSSKiller and I'm clean, I've also ran malware bytes, and done the /scannow which both come up clean and no errors. I've ran the fixit tool, and again, no errors. What the heck is this issue? I've attempted the ideas here... turning auto update
 off, closing, turning back on... manual updates.... nothing works. I've downloaded the program to reset, still no repair. Any ideas?</div>

<h2>            HP Product Detection - App uninstall not possible because of revoked security certificate</h2>
                    <p>I have a similar issue as described here (thread is locked), but I can not uninstall a software called HP Product Detection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/uninstall-of-hp-power-manager-and-software/be45edcb-ef16-44b8-a180-b1ed85b9dcb8</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just ran into the same problems after upgrading to Windows 10.<br />
Uninstalling using the hidden Administrator-account helped.<br />
The following steps show you how to activate and deactivate the account.</p>
<ol>
<li>Opening a command prompt in administrator mode.</li><li><span>At the command prompt, type "</span><span>net user administrator /active:yes"</span><span>, and then press Enter</span></li><li><span>Exit the command &nbsp;prompt.</span></li><li><span>Logout and login as Administrator.</span></li><li><span>Uninstall what you need to.</span></li><li><span>Logout</span></li><li><span>Login as User</span></li><li><span>Deactivate the Administrator-account using&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;"</span><span>net user administrator /active:no"</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you too.<br />

</div>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I was logged in as Administrator, HP Product Detection was not in the list of installed apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What helped in my case:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out from the error message, that I have to look for C:\Windows\Installer\b66b9ad.msi (Installer directory is a hidden directory, so make hidden directories visible in your file explorer).</p>
<p>In fact in the properties of b66b9ad.msi I saw, that HP had revoked the security certificate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened a cmd.exe window with administrator privileges (right click, run as administrator).</p>
<p>I executed</p>
<p>
</p><p>cd C:\Windows</p>
<p>system32\msiexec.exe /uninstall Installer\b66b9ad.msi</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this can help people with similar problems.</p>
