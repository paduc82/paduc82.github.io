<h2>            Computer suddenly so slow that it can&#8217;t run apps or even open the start menu.</h2>
                    So i was using the computer (A Toshiba Satellite L50 -C model i believe) and suddenly i got a blue error message with a sad face on it. After a bit the computer just shut off. I go and turn it back on the usual Toshiba Boot up screen comes on except for
 a long extended anount of time, maybe 5 - 10 minutes? The computer eventually gets to the desktop menu after like a month of trying to boot the pc and then nothing happens. The mouse and clock are still operating but i cant run anything or acsess my taskbar.
 Only, ONLY sometimes task manager will open. I dont know if this will help but the manager opened for like a second before it blacked out and crashed and i saw CPU: 100%. I dont know if thats suppose to happen but this is really agitating me. I dont know if
 it is ohysiclly damged or maybe something in the files got changed or deleted. I found another post from one of your moderators saying to get a drive with a Installer on it. I did so and it worked fine except for some reason Fortn

            Hi Luipad,<br /><br />I would entertain a system restore, but it might be tough to get to that tool within the OS currently. <br /><br />Do you have a free USB, and another machine you could use (even temporarily) to build windows 10 media?<br /><br />Let me know, and we’ll move forward!<br />- C

<p>I do, i have an 8 GB usb drive stick with nothing on it. I set up an installation media on it and went to the purple page with the Setup on it. I click Install now and it comes up with an option “Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)” I click on that and
 it comes up with a list with only one of them being able to use to install it on and that drive happens to be the actual computer drive that stuffed up in the first place. There are other drives but none of them come up with the usb. Why is this? Also, ive
 tried many times to wipe the computer fully clean of its data and accounts and start fresh but when i do it just boots up again with the Message “There was an error and your computer did not reset”. So i already have a drive with the correct details of the
 computer in the media. I dont know what to do at this point.</p>

<p>So i tried to system restore but there was two options, both named Windows 10 Volume 4. Both of them came up with a window saying that there was no restore points on the computer which i believe is true sadly.</p>

            Ok, I was trying to fix it and then at one point I restarted the computer and for like 20 minutes it was saying Starting or something. Then the basic "Welcome to Windows" thing happened. I was expecting that and I thought that after the start up turtoial
 with Cortana, I would just go off and start using the computer normally again. But for some reason it I just so slow, except this time it can actually run applications, just very VERY slowly. I reinstalled Epic Games from their website and download Fortnite
 on the launcher and when it was finished, it just went back to down to 0%. I waited again for It to finish and then I got an error message saying that the installation had an error. Now prior to the original error, it download fine and then I was playing.
 I don't know why this is happening and Im pretty sure that's because it was a quad core. For some reason I think the computer Is now dual core. I need help!

<br />The two links above are to the Windows 10 iso, and how to build the bootable usb.

<br />You could also use these apps I like to build the media:

Watch out for ads on the sites that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />I'd back up your data, and make note of your apps before proceeding. Once you build the media, you’ll boot your laptop to it. you’ll elect to install windows. It’ll then go to a page where it shows you all your partitions, highlight and delete them all, ***This is important, I’ve posted a pic of what it should look like, and you’ll click “next”*** you have 1 unpartioned drive, then click “next” and the install process will start.

<br />Let me know!

When I send messages I get this: &nbsp;Your SMTP has not responded in 120 seconds, would you like to wait another 120 seconds for the server to respond? &nbsp;I also get an error msg: &nbsp;The msg could not be sent because the server rejected the senders email address. &nbsp;The
 senders email address was: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Subject: &nbsp;Test again</div>
<div>Server Error: &nbsp;553</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I send a msg, it goes to my "Outbox" instead of my "Sent" box . &nbsp;Then sends the msg multiple times (1-30 times) until I delete it from my Outbox. &nbsp;This has been going on for many months, very frustrating. &nbsp;I called Suddenlink and they checked my settings
 and everything was correct and they said it was a Microsoft issue.</div>

<div>Please tell me how to solve this long on-going problem. &nbsp;I have read some of your on-line comments but none have solved this one.</div>

<p>Sorry to bring this thread back up but I am currently wondering the same but I don't believe any of the answers given are a suggested answer, If I am right, the guy is asking how he can add funds to his account to sit there and build up for when he is ready
 to buy something he likes. I am also looking for an option that I could do this i.e. pay so much per month and when I see something I like I can just buy it with the funds on there rather than all the money coming out my bank at the one time.</p>

<p>Buying a prepaid card is not only a suggested answer its the correct answer. You can go to a local retailer and buy a prepaid card in $5-100 i do believe and use them when you want.</p>

<p>Hi there CurranDJ,</p>
<p>As 24 said you can buy currency cards in different denominations at the store and add them to your account so it's there when ready to use. &nbsp;Currency cards will stack and accumulate in your account.</p>
<p>You can also join Bing Rewards (www.bing.com/rewards) or Xbox Live Rewards (www.xbox.com/rewards) if they are offered in your region. Keep in mind when rewards are deposited into your account, they will expire if not used within a specific timeframe.</p>
<p>But there is currently not an option to do a monthly purchase/deposit to your account so it accumulates like a bank account deposit.</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>

            Hi. I don't think I ever had this issue. Did you create a backup data for this situation? Also, have you tried to reinstall Gears 2? That could refresh it. You could also try a hard reset or just redownload your profile. Hopefully by doing this, Gears
 2 functions would be refreshed when downloaded properly.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As mentioned above, f</span><span>or this particular issue we recommend uninstalling the game,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">removing
 your profile</a><span>, power down your console, unplug the console and router for five full minutes, adding your profile again, and see if the issue persists if you log in first.
</span></p>
<p><span>These steps should help you with this issue by clearing the cache and refreshing your profile on the console.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>From what I have been seeing on the forums, there seems to be some type of driver issue with one of the recent updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might check in Device Manager for your USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller...</p>
<p>Select Update Driver...&nbsp;Browse My Computer... Pick From A List...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check to see if you are using USB xHCI Compliant Host Controller or something else...</p>
<p>If something else, try the USB xHCI Compliant Host Controller driver..</p>

            Hello Sir, hope you haven't deleted the pictures from recycle bin but if its done then some third party softwares would help, one of which I remember EaseUS data recovery software. The Free version has limit to recover 2GB of data but you can also purchase
 it online for amount of&nbsp; data to be recovered to unlimited.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Noah.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See if you can plug in a monitor and get it to display anything.  If so then the problem is the laptop monitor which you can attempt to reconnect in  case it's wire harness has come loose, or replace.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise you need to try to get it to display anything on the screen because otherwise there isn't much you can do since boot or repair mode will not show up on a monitor.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it may remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

            I see it's still for sale on Amazon.  If it's within a year of purchase (or you can convince them you bought it within a year since their information is often provided by you) you may still have Support, Repair and Replacement warranty, so I'd contact them.

<li>windows store trouble shooter</li><li>running DSIM.exe to verify windows install</li><li>running sfc to verify windows image</li></ul>
<p>None of the above have solved the issue, I can download other games no problem, the issue is with FH3 only.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Your game installer's components </span></span><span><span>may have something to do with the error message that you are getting. Below are some ways to resolve issues with error code:

<h2>            Notification Sound Not Working Anymore</h2>
                    
<p>Nothing too serious, but was just curious if anyone else had this problem where the achievement notification, welcome notification when I get signed in, the clip being recorded notification, and or all of the other notifications are no longer doing the good
 ole Xbox chime when they are supposed to. The notifications are working and popping up when they are supposed to, but they just are not making the sound they used to anymore. Everything else with the console is working just fine and I really think that Xbox
 One is awesome. Just was unsure on how to bring that sound back for notifications haha. Thanks!!</p>

<p>I have a Plantronics CS60 wireless headset with the base connected to my Windows 7 (64bit) PC by USB.&nbsp; Every so often,maybe every two days or so, the PC refuses to recognise the headset.&nbsp; I have discovered that if I disconnect both USB and power cables to
 the device and immediately reconnect them, the PC at once recognises the headset - at least until the next time.&nbsp; Plantronics says it is a known issue with MIcrosoft and indeed I actually bought a new headset and the problem was replicated, indicating that
 the problme lies wth the PC.&nbsp; Any help greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello Preacher87,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I wanted to find out if the new headset was the same make/model as the original.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, there are some steps that we can take. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Often we see&nbsp;odd behavior&nbsp;as the result of a program loading on startup.</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this, we use clean boot troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>The following article describes this process:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in

<br />
<div>Good to see I am not preaching to the choir alone, in all seriousness I'm really sad that another individual got lumbered with this pathetic product.</div>
<div>I had exactly the same problem, exactly, the first headset was bought by my university as part of a package to support a disabled student as I have no hand use.</div>
<div>But all of a sudden the headset would disappear and stop working.</div>
<div>Believing it was either a issue with the base or the headset I bought another set on eBay same problem.</div>
<div>It is definitely not a Windows problem either it does exactly the same thing on a Mac. !</div>
<div>Plantronics know about the issue but frankly don't care.</div>
<div>So I'm Saddled with two sets of headset and a replacement battery which i purchased along the troubleshooting way.</div>
<div>Never touching a Plantronics product again, what a waste of money and time.</div>

<p>Follow advice already given in your other Threads herel;</p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />

<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />

<h2>            Cannot move or copy files&#58; The requested resource is in use.</h2>
                    Hello, I encountered this error about a month or two. I was attempting to fix this myself before posting and asking the question in Microsoft Answers. I was trying to move and copy some pictures and videos from my phone to my Windows 7 x64 Ultimate PC.
 I have tried moving some files from my old phone to the PC, I still encounter this. I have noted that everytime I have to wait until the preview window has generated the thumbnail or preview whatever then I can open or copy to my PC's desktop. I have also
 tried copy to another directory, but I still encounter the same. I dont wanna waste time on this and wait for the preview comes everytime to open or copy the file. Ive also tried to cancel or hide the preview pane to stop generating the preview. But I still
 got the same result. So here I am asking for advices and help. Thank you.
                </div>

    <title>USB Flashdrive Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> casperw84  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Flashdrive Issue</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried every which way to configure my PNY 8 gig FD for my Xbox Arcade. I just cannot seem to make it work, I have tried to format on the Xbox, and I have tried to put the update needed on the drive using the update online using my computer.</p>
<p>When configuring on the Xbox everything works fine and the prompts tell me the FD meets requirements, however when I shut off my Xbox and go to turn it on again it asks me to reconfigure.</p>
<p>When I try to configure the FD on my computer and then use it on the Xbox I get an error and cannot even reconfigure the FD.</p>
<p>Has anyone been able to successfully complete this with a PNY FD? I am trying to get off cheap and not have to purchase an external or a Xbox FD because I already have 7 FD's from other uses I've need them for previously.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Note: I have tried all trouble shooting steps provided by Xbox (i.e. all of the links and suggestions from
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Storage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Storage/</a>).</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>While the 360 supports flash drives, there are some compatibility problems with some makes and models.&nbsp; Either your FD is not completely compatible or it's faulty.&nbsp; If it's giving you this many problems I would think about getting a new one.&nbsp; The old forums
 had a sticky about what brands worked and which did not, unfortunately I don't think this has been transferred to the new forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only FD I've used on my 360 is a 16GB&nbsp;SanDisk Cruzer which has been working flawlessly.&nbsp; It's pretty much the same as the official one, but a third of the price!</p>

<p>I also bought a PNY 8 gig Flashdrive. After the dashboard told me it had been configured and ready to use, I moved my profile and a few gamesaves to it. Then, after an overnight powerdown, or anytime I unplug the flashdrive, it needs to be re-configured.
 I lost all my saves.</p>
<p>I should have avoided PNY</p>

<h2>            Country is not supported </h2>
                    
<p>I'm from a country called Oman and I first bought my Xbox 360 from here, as soon as I created my profile I realised my country is not listed. After a while I created my Xbox Live account and didn't really think that this could be an issue later so i just
 randomly choose another country, after that I bought a few Microsoft Points to get a map pack for Call of Duty Black Ops it keeps showing up a message saying that I can't download the content since it's not available in my location. I tried to do everything
 but since my country is not supported I still can't download it. I think it might be not fair since I wanted the map pack for a while now and i can't download it because of this and after looking up in a few websites I saw that a lot of people has this problem
 and not just in my country, so is there any chance this might change? =/</p>

<p>In the account that i usually use it's set on Australia, then when i bought my Microsoft Points i had to use my other account which is set on the UK, i found some other solutions that can solve this but it needs tons of work but it's still the only way so
 i have to go throw it anyway i got no choice =/ but is there any chance in the future that this might change? as in my country can get supported?
