<h2>            Access denied to copy files into external drive</h2>
                    Within the past three days a problem has consumed my computer. Daily i move files from my desktop to an external hard drive or flash drive. On Monday when i did the same at the end of my day, the system popped up a message saying "Destination Folder Access
 Denied". While working and not trying to move files, I get a random message that says K:\ Recycle Bin is corrupted, Do you want to empty recycle bin. I've tried emptying the Recycle bin, but again "Access denied". &nbsp;I've gone online and searched various solutions
 all of which has not corrected my problem. The only thing new added to my computer is Google Chrome. I've tried my drives in other computers and they work fine, just as they use to work fine on my desktop. Anyone experiencing the same problem? Help!

                    <p>So I wanna get rid of at least&nbsp;one of these I got it because I launched explorer during setup ._. I know don't&nbsp;say it. When my laptop restarts and when I log in, it tries to log in the built-in admin account and it, of course, fails to and if I try to log
 in manually, with no password it says it is disabled and I can still log in my main account, thanks if you can help.</p>

<p>Let me ask you a question. If you have two house keys, do you think it would be a good idea to throw one of them away and keep the other? What then if you mislay this one key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same with Windows. Having a single admin account is risky. Lots of people get into deep trouble because of this. To set the preferred logon account, use the command&nbsp;<em>control.exe UserPasswords2.</em></p>

<p>I am not entirely sure what you're trying to say, and running your sentences together without any full stops in between makes it even harder. Here is some general advice that might help:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a System Restore point (to be used in case things go wrong).</li><li>Log on under an admin account.</li><li>Open an <strong>elevated</strong> Command Prompt (cmd.exe).</li><li>Type these commands and press Enter after each:<br />
net&nbsp; users<br />
(to see all account names)<br />
net&nbsp; user&nbsp; "Jayden"<br />
(to see if this account is active)<br />
net&nbsp; user&nbsp; "Jaden"&nbsp; /active:no<br />

<p>You can, of course, replace "Jayden" with any other account in my commands. This is why I gave you an extra command, to check the spelling of each name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the "Jayden WDAGUtilityAccount" is already inactive then I would keep it in this state for a couple of weeks, then delete it if all is well. Did you check what files are stored in its profile folder?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You must distinguish between&nbsp;<strong>User Accounts</strong> and <strong>User Profile Folders</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A newly created account does not have a profile folder. The profile folder gets created at first logon time. You obviously never logged on as "Administrator".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible to have a user profile folder without an associated account. This happens when you delete an account but retain its data.</p>

            <p>Since there is no charging feature @ the SP4, the USB port will only be powered if the SP4 is running (operation or standby), while the battery condition of the SP4 does not matter (full, empty, charging). Since the USB port is a normal USB 3.0 one, it is
 specified to deliver a maximum rate of 0.9 A while the port is running with data (i.e. not be switched into a charge mode). Any USB device must not exceed this value at any time. Just think of a hard disk running an the USB port, which has to be powered during
 operation. Some PC will power in standby, some not. </p>
<p>This is what the spec says. If there's a special charge mode, it has to be designed at all. Maybe there's a way to switch it in the UEFI. But I do not know how to get there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, my SP4 charges a Samsung S5 with 0.42 A (which is what a USB 2 device should do when connected to a computer) in working and standby mode.

<p>If you have data you do not want to lose make sure you take a backup to removable media before trying to fix the problem.</p>
<p><span>Select Start, Run, type cmd and press ENTER. Type "chkdsk c: /f /r" without the quotes and hit ENTER.&nbsp;Make sure you include the spaces indicated. Enter Y when asked whether you wish to run chkdsk on restarting the computer. Exit and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Marking off bad sectors on a hard drive takes time so be patient. Marking off does not repair a bad sector. It places pointers on the drive telling the system not to read or write to those sectors which have been damaged.</span></p>
<p><span>If the number of bad sectors continues to increase after you have run the procedure above several times then you should replace the drive. If an important system file is written to a bad sector you can corrupt registry hives and lose the whole contents
 of the drive.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand if having run chkdsk you see no more new bad sectors then the drive can work for you for years.</span></p>
<p>What is your computer make and model? Do you have a Windows XP CD? Is it a retail. generic OEM or branded OEM copy. Often branded computer suppliers give users a copy of&nbsp;Windows in a recovery partition. Which applies to you?</p>
<p><span>Have a look in the System log in Event Viewer for Errors and Warnings and post copies here. Don't post any from more than 48 hours ago.
</span></p>
<p><span>You can access Event Viewer by selecting Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, and Event Viewer. When researching the meaning of the error, information regarding Event ID, Source and Description are important.
</span></p>
<p><span>A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. You will see a button resembling two pages. Click the button and close Event Viewer. This places a copy of the report into your Clipboard. Paste
 into the body your message. Make sure that this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade has broken the Microsoft Print To driver for both - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> completelyuseless2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade has broken the Microsoft Print To driver for both XPS and PDF</h2>
                    Two days ago in Windows 8.1 Pro&nbsp;I was happily printing to XPS and PDF.&nbsp;Since I've been upgraded to 10.0 Pro I cannot print to either file type. If I try to print to either PDF or XPS, the created document cannot be opened in IE, Reader, Adobe Reader or
 any other document that read these files -- they all report that the file is invalid. And it would appear they are correct because anything I print to file creates a file that is&nbsp;0 byte size even though the file&nbsp;has been created. Another thing I notice, if
 I try to print&nbsp;&lt;= 6 pages then the print dialog dismisses and the file is created. If I try to print &gt; 6 pages then the print dialog is not dismissed, it stops when trying to print page 7.

            <p>Upon a little more investigation, I see the following events have been created for these devices:</p>
<p>
</p><div>Device SWD\PRINTENUM\{207E9F9A-8DD6-4D9B-BCF8-016EB634FE9D} was deleted.</div>

<div>Class Guid: {1ED2BBF9-11F0-4084-B21F-AD83A8E6DCDC}</div>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't delete anything and I have no idea what they are referring to... Windows reports both devices as functioning fine and System File Checker says no system files are missing so... something is lying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Turn Windows Features On/Off. I deselected the Microsoft Print to PDF -- it appeared to uninstall fine. I then re-selected it and it says it installed fine. However, no change; the problem still remains despite Windows reporting device is working
 properly and the troubleshooter says no problem.</p>

            <p>Same here.</p>
<p>Tried printing to PDF from word today, 108 pages. It quickly counts from 1 to 108 in the status bar ("printing..."), but the resulting file is zero bytes small.</p>
<p>Thankfully Word's F12 (Save As) option works with PDF files. Other applications however, don't have this option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I'm on Windows 10 Developer preview, <strong><em>Build 11082.1000</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2: Renaming the file to a.docx fixed the problem. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
The problem must have been a comma in the file name.</span></p>

    <title>Using NotePad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gary&#39;s student  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using NotePad</h2>
                    
<p>I have a folder containing shortcuts to a variety of file on various drives.&nbsp; The shortcuts are all .lnk files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to edit some of the shortcuts.&nbsp; If I right-click the shortcut and select Open With NotePad, Windows attempts to open the destination file rather than the shortcut itself.</p>
<p>My current workaround is to open the shortcut'sProperties and edit the path there.&nbsp; If I can get NotePad to open the .lnk, then I can write a script to automate the process.</p>

<p>I would hesitate to use Notepad to edit any shortcut as its text capabilities simply will not handle the binary and unicode entries within a .LNK shortcut.</p>
<p>If you are going to write a script, then perhaps writing a proper .VBS script would be the way to go. The following snippet enumerates a folder called<em> C:\Shortcuts</em> for<em> .LNK</em> files and displays their filenames and shortcut target paths. Any
 file with out an .LNK extension is displayed within brackets. I'm supplying this simple code snippet so you can get an idea of the VBS scripting capabilities. You were not very specific on what you intended to do with the shortcut beyond a path edit. A VBS<em>
 Replace</em> command should be able to handle general editing like that.</p>
<p>objStartFolder = "C:\Shortcuts"<br />
Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")<br />
Set objFolder = objFSO.GetFolder(objStartFolder)<br />
Set colFiles = objFolder.Files<br />
For Each objFile in colFiles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Right(objFile.Name, 4) = ".lnk" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set sh = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set shortcut = sh.CreateShortcut(objStartFolder &amp; "\" &amp; objFile.Name)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wscript.Echo objFile.Name &amp; Chr(10) &amp; shortcut.TargetPath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shortcut.Save&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wscript.Echo "(" &amp; objFile.Name &amp; ")"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End If<br />
Next</p>
<p>To run this simply copy the code into a blank Notepad text file and save it as<em>&lt;something&gt;</em><strong>.vbs</strong>. Edit the<em> C:\Shortcuts</em> entry for your own purposes. Double click to run it or from a command line. For more information see,</p>

<h2>            XBox One X &#40;Scorpio Edition&#41; Error E105 and after OSU1 - Update Error E102</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to get some helpfull support here..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today my Xbox had Startup Issues and send me to troubleshoot to restart or reset the xbox.</p>
<p>I tried a few times to just restart but didn't help,<br />
so I chosed to reset (delete everything) and this still didn't solve the problem neither.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was looking online for help and found the OSU1.zip Recovery-Update.</p>
<p>Did that, the system updated well and was starting with Welcome and First-Setup-Screen where you have to enter your Region and Language.</p>
<p>The System then found a miniupdate, about 38MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, I'm stuck in the Error E102 and I can't find a way out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any help for that error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Actual Version is: 17763.3062.amd64fre.rs5_release_xbox_dev_1811.181109-1527</p>

<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>please see the steps for E102 on this trouble shooting page, it has all the steps to try regarding this error code:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution</a> </p>
<p>For 102 it will have specific steps to factory reset the console again to try and solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all fails you will either need to set up a repair or contact Xbox Support like mentioned on that troubleshooting page.
</p>
<p>When contacting Xbox Support use either the Phone option or the Microsoft Support Chat option on

<p>Ok, here's an Update, maybe someone has the same problem one day..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the OSU1-Update again,<br />
the miniupdate, by the way, is just a Language Pack - Update, nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for information: For the connection this time, i disconnected wired connection and chosed wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that whole precedure the system came up well and First-Setup could be completed completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have to install again some missing Apps (the most Games where on external HDD which I disconnected in the whole process and connected first time when system was up completely).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem seems solved, so Good Luck for the next Guy with that Issue.</p>

<p>Aaaand I'm here again..</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few minutes just watching with the Netflix-App the issue came back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stuck at E105, the Update is not possible any more, just receiving Error E101.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So seems I need to create an Repair-Request-Ticket at Microsoft.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very strange behaviour of the console :( </p>
<p>
</p><p>After a bunch of hourse later this problem was gone (almost),<br />
but the whole system was very unstable, even the settings app couldn't be started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But some time later the error E105 appear again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I will send it in to xbox support, I'm almost sure I won't get back my Scorpio Edition :*(<br />
and will receive any refurbished Device. </p>
<p>I hope this won't take much time 'cause even a temporary Device i won't receive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you know when I have a new Status and what finally happened then :) </p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to boot the computer in Clean Boot mode and check if the issue persists.
<span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or
 when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>* Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the link to view the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> &nbsp;Start the computer in normal mode refer the section,
<strong>"How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"
</strong>from the link above.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then perform a complete system scan using Windows Defender or any other antivirus software installed (if any)&nbsp;in your computer.&nbsp;You can also use the Microsoft Safety Scanner from the link provided below:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope this&nbsp;helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Refurbished XBOX One Console&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Controller</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased one of the Refurbished XBOX One consoles that were available on microsoftstore.com. I recently received it and all is well except for the controller.</p>
<p>The main XBOX logo button isn't able to be pressed. It's completely suppressed. I thought maybe it was touch sensitive or something as I had never used on before, but looking up videos of it's use it seems very similar to the 360's controller. The only way
 to get it to turn on is to pop the batteries in and out.</p>
<p>What are my options here? I've tried tweeting the XBOX support twitter handle and they are very poor/slow with their replies and haven't help me out yet.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Constantly having party chat issues</h2>
                    
<p>Every time I use my xbox one I have major trouble trying to communicate with my friends. Always though the problem is caused by my router or by my modem or by my ISP. NO. It is Microsofts *** service and their *** xbox one. I get on my PS4 and everything
 works 110%. This is starting to just be laughable, just turn on the xbox one and see what problem i will run into today, oh that sucks. Power off. Power on PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** you Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have your mods with nothing better to do in life strip my post when you advertise games like COD AW 17+ to 10year olds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same here. &nbsp;Myself as well as all of my friends. &nbsp;We have only been able to play online together a handful of times. &nbsp;Most of the time we spend an hour trying then give up. &nbsp;It's pathetic and I'm glad we are not the only ones, though it doesn't seem to matter
 since MS isn't doing anything about it. &nbsp;I wish I could get a refund. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried to party up with a friend tonight and play some Halo. After an hour trying to get the party to workout we both just gave up. Xbox live and party was great for the 360, simple, clean, easy to use. Ever since I got the Xbox One on day 1 it has be nothing
 short of pulling teeth to try and get a party going with your friends and enjoy the games. Its been over a year and we are still having the exact same issues from day 1. Awful just awful.

<p>I'm having similar issues as well. &nbsp;For a few WEEKS now, I have had a problem, 100% of the time with party chat. &nbsp;That's when I'm even able to get into a party. &nbsp;Within a minute or two, no one can hear each other. &nbsp;The same can be said for everyone I game
 with. This is a service we pay for. &nbsp;Co-op play and party chat are supposed to be fundamental components of XBL, aren't they? &nbsp;</p>
<p>The party system for the 360 worked fine. &nbsp;Now, it has become an over complicated abomination that has been broken in one form or another for far too long. &nbsp;This is a case of the provider miserably failing to deliver.</p>
<p>Specifically, what is being done to address this issue? &nbsp;Why is it taking so long to resolve? &nbsp;As a customer, it isn't unreasonable to expect an answer.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 reset crashes</h2>
                    <p>Hello so I have recently been experiencing some software/network issues that I was not able to resolve and decided it was time to maybe reset my computer.</p>
<p>And so I did,or at least tried to do,and while it all went smoothly,at exactly 28% I noticed my computer making a strange and loud noise like it suddenly froze,and I went to check up on the reset(I was AFK when I heard it).But instead of finding it at a
 much bigger percentage(the reset went on for quite a bit) i found it stuck at 28%.Image froze,nothing worked anymore and so I gave it a bit of time to get back to normal.Half an hour later the same frozen image was displayed on the monitor and i came to the
 conclusion that the reset crashed.With no other option i manually tried to reset my pc and now whenever it boots it just randomly restarts/freezes on its own.</p>
<p>I would really love if someone could find a way for me to fix this,I need my computer desperately in the next weeks.</p>
<p>,Robert</p>

 no responding. </p>

<h2>            OEM COA Certificate is there but product key code is worn off.  Is there any recourse&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As a repair shop, we are seeing an increase in the number of recent 1 to 2 year old laptops that have COA certificates that are so worn off that we can't even read what operating system was installed much less the key code.&nbsp; Do we have any option outside
 of having to apply a brand new license from a OEM install?&nbsp; The customers purchased the laptop complete with the license and it really sucks for them to find themselves in that position after being hit by a nasty virus that requires a system reinstall.&nbsp; In
 this case, the OEM was Lenovo and they claim to only record technical specifications for each serial number and not the COA Product Key Code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past, Microsoft COA's used to be sealed with a clear coat and would easily last 10 years with perfectly legible entries.&nbsp; It almost feels like they want this to happen now since the recent change has been for the worse.</p>

<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Reinstall Windows Preinstalled On Computer</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition
 on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks. ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ -
 check your manual if you're not sure how to. Or if you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process.

            <p>If you are reloading Windows 7 using the OneKey Recovery button on the laptop, then there won't be no need to reference the product key on the COA sticker. OEM licenses that come preloaded on the new laptops are self activating.

    <title>How to merge wireless network locations in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karstenspang  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to merge wireless network locations in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I live in a place with Wi-fi on public transportation. All the trains have the same network name, but of course each car has its own SSID. Now I ended up with networks train, train 2, .... train 113.</p>
<p>I would really like to have just one profile, no matter which car I am riding in today.</p>
<p>Under Windows 7, I would merge the SSID into "train" whenever I used the wi-fi in a new car by clicking the "bench" icon in network and sharing center.</p>
<p>How do I do the same thing in Windows 10?</p>

<span>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry
 incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs</span></p>
