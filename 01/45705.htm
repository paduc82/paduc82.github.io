<h2>            BSOD - Memory_Management in Windows 7 Starter 32 Bit</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone. I cannot access my old Microsoft account, thus prompting me to make a new one especially when I really badly need help in some technical matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just an hour ago, while I was browsing the internet, the computer then suddenly entered BSOD (blue screen of death). From what I have had read, it has the problem of MEMORY_MANAGEMENT. As far as what I knew about BSOD, the system restarts itself after that.
 However, the computer (or the laptop) that I am using right now got stuck in the blue screen for almost forever that I need to take off the power just to start the system. (I haven't installed anything on the system recently. Last one was weeks ago)<br />
<br />
As what the blue screen told me, I utilized the Safe Mode option of the System. The Diagnostics sent this information about the blue screen, which I really do not understand:</p>
<p>
</p><p>----</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem signature:<br />
&nbsp; Problem Event Name:<span> </span>
BlueScreen<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:<span> </span>6.1.7600.2.0.0.768.11<br />
&nbsp; Locale ID:<span> </span>13321<br />

&nbsp; C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\WER-44132-0.sysdata.xml</p>
<p>
</p><p>------</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had read several tech sites connecting the memory management issue to the RAM of the laptop, whether it is faulty or causing problems to the motherboard. There are also sites that state that Overheating is a factor to the problem (laptop overheating
 has had been already an issue for me whenever the system strains itself to demanding graphics of games, and I haven't checked out the ventilation system of the laptop since I am really not an expert in computer systems by which I might cause more problems
 to the hardware). I really do not know what to do with what has had been happening to the laptop. It is not as old as my father's notebook (almost 6 years); we've been using this for only 3 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me with this? I would really appreciate all the help.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*Note: I also used the Memory Diagnostics Tool in Control Panel as suggested in one of the discussions in the Microsoft Community. Sadly, it didn't work. The laptop shuts down whenever the Memory Diagnostics reach before 10%.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the link to the dropbox by which the minidump (DMPs, since there are 6 files.) and the system information of the computer.<br />
<br />
https://www.dropbox.com/s/to6kufcdumufr2l/Minidump%20and%20System%20Info.rar?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I zipped the files, all of the DMP files say "Access is Denied". I didn't tweak that much anymore.<br />
<br />
Later today I would possibly try to update the laptop to Windows 7 SP1. Thanks for the help.</p>

            Thanks for debugging the problem (though I really hadn't understood the terms), but I would to take your suggestion of updating the system.<br />
<br />
With regards to the SP1 download, it sems that the Download Center is experiencing a server error (Error 404). It would take time before I can finish downloading it once the Download Center is up (due to poor internet connection in the country).<br />
<br />
I have a concern on the BIOS though. You suggested to update the BIOS in the latest version, so you mean that I download only the latest or all of those revisions? I have my doubts though if I can really update it since a wrong move an do harm to this computer
 (which I do not own).&nbsp;

    <title>The infamous &#34;Internet Connection Sharing VIRUS&#34;, as I like to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cosmingurau  say:</h3>
<h2>            The infamous &#34;Internet Connection Sharing VIRUS&#34;, as I like to call it.</h2>
                    <p>OK. Hello, folks. </p>
<p>My original post was here. http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-networking/internet-connection-sharing-just-wont-work-really/f86c80f2-0eab-462f-a7eb-2154ec378ad5</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, I repeat, once again, in my last desperate effort to solve this agonizing problem.</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms: </strong>All of a sudden you <strong>cannot connect to the Internet.</strong> You realize the
<strong>ethernet adapter doesn't work anymore</strong>, it's driver is bashed. So you uninstall the device, and then reinstall it. You have Internet access again.
</p>
<p>But <strong>suddenly ICS doesn't work anymore</strong>. It prompts the<strong> ICS Error of Death</strong>, which is
<strong>"Error 0x80004005, UNSPECIFIED ERROR"</strong>. When you see this, you know it's really, really<strong> bad</strong>. Trust me.
<strong>Starting the ICS service is impossible</strong>, it says that it started and then stopped.
</p>
<p>Some said that enabling the Windows Firewall service solved this. Well, the <strong>
Windows Firewall Service is impossible to start</strong>. So there's a major problem there too. And not because I have the Eset Smart Security firewall on, because I did uninstall the whole thing just to check.<strong> In safe mode with networking, I am not
 even able to connect to the Internet</strong>, using my PPPoE connection, because it says the Remote Access Service cannot be started. Or another one, I'm not sure.
</p>
<p>The point is, the computer has clearly<strong> suffered a virus problem.</strong> But now,
<strong>5 antivirus and antimalware softwares found my PC 100% CLEAN</strong>. All have nice shiny Green icons in the taskbar! :D But how come basic services cannot start? How come
<strong>my Internet connection lags and freezes, starts and stops</strong>? In the sense that
<strong>sometimes</strong> it will connect, sometimes it will give me the <strong>
651 error</strong>. Sometimes, even other programs lag and freeze, for no reason.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>So</strong>, <strong>after two years</strong>,<strong> I get this problem AGAIN</strong>.
<strong>But first. What happened then, two years ago, after I didn't post anymore on this USELESS site</strong>. I completely
<strong>lost the ability to connect to the Internet</strong>. <strong>Vista didn't let me CREATE a PPPOE connection anymore, whatsoever.</strong> It was THAT bad.
</p>
<p>So I had to <strong>reinstall everything.</strong></p>
<p>But I hated Vista for doing this to me. So I installed the<strong> all new Windows 7.</strong>
<strong>I was sure this problem, this weakness was solved in W7</strong>. But today, guess what.
<strong>The ICS ERROR of DEATH</strong> appeared once again, same and exact symptoms.<strong> I cursed Microsoft once more</strong>. How is this possible?!
<strong>The same problem, all over again?!</strong></p>
<p>I checked the Internet AGAIN on solutions to this horrible problem, and <strong>
all I found were a few unfortunates like me, with no real answers, and a lot of so called tech savvyies, that consider that we actually don't know how to configure the computer.</strong> No,
<strong>the problem is caused by a malware, or a virus</strong>. But the virus scans with multiple antiviruses and antimalwares with up to date definitions turn out to be clean.<strong> CLEAN</strong>. So the virus is probably no more (<strong>though I cannot
 be sure of that at all</strong>), but <strong>the damage is still there</strong>.
</p>
<p><strong>No sfc/scannow fixes it, no other tricks like this work, at all.</strong> I am
<strong>facing reinstalling everything over again</strong>, with <strong>no promsie that this won't happen again</strong>, but<strong> rather whith a promsie that it WILL happen again.</strong>
</p>
<p>I hate how <strong>the tech people from microsoft don't HELP</strong>. They just don't help. They ask all sorts of useless questions
<strong>to see if your PC is on</strong> or <strong>your cable is inserted in the computer</strong>. Yes, I know how to configure my computer, I need you to help me fix it.</p>
<p>Over the forums, there are a few people like me, who went through this horrible mischief, who probably just ended up reinstalling everything each time this had happened. I was searching the Internet for this problem, and<strong> I stumbled upon a guy</strong>
 who was really mad over this issue, and really spoke to me, I could totally see his pain and understand his frustration, and then I realised it was...<strong> me</strong>.
<strong>Two years ago, same problem. And STILL NO ANSWER. Microsoft, GIVE ME AN ANSWER.</strong>
<strong>A clear one. How do I fix this, WITHOUT reinstalling.</strong><strong> I ask AGAIN, AGAIN and AGAIN. No real hotfixes? No way to repair the registries or whatever was affected?!</strong>
<strong>If the specified system services cannot be started, what can be done, what files have to be replaced?</strong> You're the guys that built this OS, not me.
<strong>You SHOULD know, and SHOULD help us.</strong> </p>
<p>And don't give me the FixIt speech. 'Cause the fixit stuff is <strong>really pathetic</strong>, it's just for people who don't know anything about computers, it's not really a fixing engine, it just tries to configure stuff. Proof is, in my case it just
 said that <strong>it couldn't &nbsp;FIX IT</strong>, and then<strong> ASKED ME IF MY PROBLEM WAS FIXED!!!</strong> :))
<strong>Take it from me. It's VIRUS damage. How DO I REPAIR IT?!?!?!?!?!</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bottom line. In two years, both in Vista and on Windows 7, I encountered this problem twice. So it means that others did too. I need a real professional answer as to what to do. I know my way around computers very, very well, but this is too much
 for me.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I want a real answer.<br />

 or AV product out there will solve the problem.&nbsp; Therefore, we'll skip all of those steps (which is what you're requesting) and go directly to the experts who can help rid your system of the infection for free (assuming it can be identified and done even by
 them using some means other than a clean install - which they usually can do if it is an infection but there's no guarantee).</p>

Really? That's the answer? Ignore the fact that my computer has a really, really big problem, and just get a router?!  Wow... WOW. I won't even try to explain why I use ICS, because it's really NOT the point. Trust me, there is a good reason why I chose this and not a router. But really, this guy's answer shocked me. AS for the other guy, he provided me with nothing more than other places to ask the same question. Which I probably will do, I'm actually in the process of doing that, but still doesn't really count as an answer. I'm  waiting for a REAL answer. Surely there were others in my situation. For Pete's sake, it happened to me TWICE, on different Windows OS's. Surely there is SOMEBODY that knows what to do. It's a VERY, very specific problem.  



I bet that a real developer would know what the problem is. Like "oh, so if ICS and the windows firewall services are affected and cannot start anymore, that means that you should replace the X file with a clean version" or "use this tool, it wi

            <p>Hi cosmingurau,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you go to your family doctor and he thinks you have a serious lung problem, he doesn't try to treat it but instead refers you to a Pulmonologist who specializes in such things so you can get the proper answer from someone who is an expert in that field.&nbsp;
 Even if it isn't a true answer, it's the best recommendation because it will in the long run get you to someone more likely to be familiar with the most recent treatments and tests to diagnose and cure your condition.&nbsp; If it resolves the problem or leads to
 a resolution in the long run, then it was the best "answer" you could get from that family doctor.&nbsp; In essence, that's what my recommendation was.&nbsp; We don't have the skills of these malware-removal experts and so they are who you should be consulting if this
 is actually an infection-related problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You indicated you don't want to run troubleshooting tests or anything because you've tried it all before and it didn't help.&nbsp; Given that, there isn't much we can do because no, it's not a simple of matter of "if XYZ, do ABC."&nbsp; There's almost never only one
 cause of any problem (and we don't have the results of "everything" you did before so we don't have the information.&nbsp; It's like asking the doctor for a diagnosis without&nbsp;allowing blood tests or radiology tests or a physical exam&nbsp;or even providing a historical
 chart, but expecting&nbsp;a working treatment based only a&nbsp;brief explanation of symptoms by the patient.&nbsp; The doctor usually can't&nbsp;do that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're convinced it is an infection (or the result of an infection).&nbsp; I'm inclined to agree - so the solution is to determine what infection and then the treatment for it.&nbsp; Rather than guess and try various options to try to find out (like a family doctor),
 I referred you to specialists in infections (like the Pulmonologist)&nbsp;who can use the best tools to identify it and the best tools to eradicate it.&nbsp; That must be done before anything can be fixed or it will just break again almost immediately.&nbsp; Once that is
 done, assuming doing that doesn't fix the problem on its own, then we can address whatever problem remains KNOWING FOR CERTAIN that an infection is not involved and anything we do will not be undone by that infection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if&nbsp;malware-removal techniques&nbsp;don't fix the problem on&nbsp;their own (but eliminate the cause so fixes may now actually work), there's a good chance we'll need to do some troubleshooting first.&nbsp; That means that unless the malware-removal experts resolve
 your problems entirely (and that might work), that no there still isn't someone who can say "if XYZ, do ABC" because the fact is that we don't really know enough about what "XYZ" is to do that.&nbsp; We just have a superficial explanation and that simply may not
 be enough.&nbsp; If we REALLY knew what "XYZ" was it would mean we WOULD know what files or programs or settings or hardware or whatever was affected (like a doctor might who had a complete chart with not only the patient's explanation but all the lab and other
 detailed tests run in the meantime) and then maybe we would be able to come up with "ABC."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you say SFC /scannow doesn't fix it.&nbsp; OK, I accept that.&nbsp; Sometimes it works great, and sometimes it doesn't do the trick.&nbsp; That may be because of the infection at the moment or it may be because SFC cannot repair the damage.&nbsp; But even if it
 doesn't fix the problem, the report may help identify the problem (even if we need to use the detailed report in the log and not the shorter txt version) and that gets us closer to "ABC".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of&nbsp; the time, error <strong>0x80004005 </strong>means "Access is denied" somewhere which generally means some DLL file or something like that (or more than one something) needs to be re-registered (it could be worse than that or a bigger registry problem
 too - but I don't know that from the information we have at the moment).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This needs to be done not only as an administrator but using Command Prompt run in elevated mode (meaning right click on Command Prompt and click "Run as Administrator" even though you are logged in as an administrator because despite that, some functions
 won't work unless you do that).&nbsp; But that's just an aside.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The point I'm getting at is that it suggests, at least to me, that one or more of your system files is not properly registered and is therefore being denied access and THAT is what is causing the problem.&nbsp; It could also be permissions-related, but that we
 should be able to fix that if we discover that to be the case.&nbsp; You would like me to magically know which files those are so they can be re-registered or have permission problems and fix the problem (or possibly have them replaced from somewhere else on the
 computer or from the installation disk if you have one or from another similar computer with exactly the same OS and the same hardware if the file is hardware-related - assuming any of that is possible) - but I don't know because I have no access to reports
 that tell me which files are affected.&nbsp; If the error had been nice enough to provide which file or files were affected, then we'd know.&nbsp; But perhaps it was.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a fair chance that this error resulted in an Event being recorded in Event Viewer and details of that event (or those events - there may be more than one) may give us a clue about which files are affected or which systems are affected - but you don't
 want to consider running tests or providing us with results&nbsp;(since we should somehow know this) so we are missing the key facts needed to possibly resolve the problem (no guarantees - but it's a possibility).&nbsp; Note though that it could be any number of different
 files (one or more) and without testing or seeing logs, we simply don't know which ones.&nbsp; Even if we encountered an almost identical problem on another computer, the files affected might be different in each case.&nbsp; In fact, to be perfectly frank, after the
 infection is resolved,&nbsp; this may or may not resolve the problem even if we identify those files as the damage may be too severe or too extensive or the files cannot be simply replaced for a variety of reasons and it may come to a clean install - but I'm not
 ready to give up on it yet.&nbsp; But it's also a possibility that can't be determined because we lack enough information about the details of the problem(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned the winsock xp fix.&nbsp; I know of one like that for Vista but don't know if it applies with Windows 7, so I hesitate to suggest it until I can confirm it works there.&nbsp; But that fix doesn't normally address a problem that causes error
<strong>0x80004005 </strong>- still it may be worth a try when we get to that point and if I can confirm it applies to Windows 7 (or find a Windows 7 version).&nbsp; FWIW, here's where it is for Vista so you get the idea (but I strongly suggest you don't do it unless/until
 it is validated for Windows 7): <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/network-sharing/284688-network-posting-tips-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/network-sharing/284688-network-posting-tips-2.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I recommend you make sure your system if completely free of infections which may be causing this at the above-linked sites.&nbsp; Once the experts pronounce it "clean", if the problem still exists, then we can work to try to&nbsp;find the cause and
 fix it or you can take it to a computer repair shop for service (or return it to the manufacturer for service if you prefer - but they both will probably just do a clean install and then charge you for it) or you can gripe and keep searching the forums for
 someone who&nbsp; magically knows "the answer" without needing any troubleshooting or tests or anything.&nbsp; We're more than willing to help you here but we aren't that good&nbsp;-&nbsp;we need your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should also keep in mind that this forum is NOT Microsoft.&nbsp; Microsoft designers&nbsp;rarely if ever&nbsp;post here and we do not have access to them.&nbsp; Most of us are unpaid volunteers who come here to help people and are not associated at all with Microsoft (with
 a few exceptions - but those are generally support people and almost never developers).&nbsp; We do the best with the information we have available to us and based on our experience.&nbsp; But we almost always need your help.&nbsp; While we may be able to find "ABC", without
 you we cannot determine "XYZ".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; No, it's not the answer but may help explain why locating "the answer" based on what we have might be difficult and suggests some steps that may assist us once the infection issue is resolved, though I'd rather provide a clear step-by-step
 troubleshooting procedure at that time than jump around like I did here suggesting different possibilities without any real pattern&nbsp;(if you're willing to work with us to seek a resolution - that's the key once the infection issue is completely removed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            I can now tell you that I've tried everything and STILL nothing. I cannot be sure I am free of infections, I have used tons of antivirus, antispyware and etc, and it seems I have no infections, BUT somehow emsisoft guard detects some rather suspicious
 behaviour from time to time, especially when I open IE. The abose sites require registration which seems to take a lot of time, because I haven't received my activation mail... So yeah, I'm proud to say that I have discovered a really big windows problem /
 security weakness, but without any way to solve it... To be honest I have had a lot and I mean a lot of problems over the years, but I have literally solved them all... I was kind of waiting for a real challenge. I surrendered in 2009, hoping that I will never
 meet the "ICS/Win Firewall daemon virus". &nbsp;But here he is, again. As I have previously stated two years ago, on the same forum... it's more of a curse than a computer problem... I challenge those of you who also went through this to f

            Hi Martin,<br />
first off what file type was the music saved to? MP3, Wav? MP4?<br />
Can you play the files directly from windows Explorer?<br />
As for WMP, try this:<br />
<p><b><span>Uninstall Windows Media Player 12</span></b></p>
<p><span>Note that uninstalling Windows Media Player 12 also disables Windows Media Center because WMC uses WMP12 for it’s operation.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click “Start” button, type “windows features” in the program search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the “Windows Features” dialog box, look for “Media Features” and expand it.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Clear “Windows Media Player” check box.</span></p>
<p><span>4. As soon as you clear the check box, you will see a pop-up saying that “The following Windows features will also be turned off because they are dependent
 on Windows Media Player.” The listed program is “Windows Media Center”.</span></p>
<p><span>Go ahead and click “Yes”.</span></p>
<p><span>Windows will now begin uninstalling WMP12.</span></p>
<p><i><u><span>You to restart Windows for the uninstallation to complete.</span></u></i></p>
<p><b><span>Reinstall Windows Media Player 12 and Windows Media Center</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow step 1 and 2 from same as above.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Check boxes “Windows Media Player” and “Windows Media Center”.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click “OK”.</span></p>
<p><span>Windows will take some time in reinstalling them. Wait for the process to finish.</span></p>
Hope this helps,<br />

            <p>Thanks Eddie B,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately this did not do the trick. I still cannot play in media player.</p>
<p>I downloaded CD's by copying them onto the album in player&nbsp;as I have done for many years without a problem, but this has suddenly crashed and will not play anything.</p>
<p>a cross in a red circle comes up next to the item i want to play, and the error message"windows media player encountered a problem while playing the file" comes up.</p>
<p>Also I cannot delete any files.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

Did you use all the methods in my reply above - including those in the links?<br />
<br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
If so try a Repair Installation which allows you to keep the programs and data<br />
though redundant backups are always a good idea.<br />

OK so after reinstalling Windows Media Player you click on a mp3 and it shows you that WMP can't play that file?<br />
Have you checked to make sure those music files are not write-protected?<br />
Have you tried opening mp3s in another program? What happens?<br />
Try playing a file from a memory card or cd...what happens?<br />

    <title>Headset Mic Too Sensitive&#33; Why can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t we change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> got prolapse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headset Mic Too Sensitive&#33;  Why can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t we change sensitivity&#63; Or is my microphone broken&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Is my mic broken? &nbsp;During Ghosts multiplayer, it's constantly turning on, even though I'm not saying anything. &nbsp;(note: I'm not a fat breather, so don't suggest that). &nbsp;In fact, if I just sit in a lobby, with the headset on the couch beside me, NOT EVEN ON
 MY HEAD, it continually goes on and off by itself. &nbsp;The room I play in is not excessively noisy. &nbsp;Never used the MS brand before, used Turtles on my 360, which didn't have this problem. &nbsp;But as most of you know, no aftermarket headsets until February!!! &nbsp;This
 doesn't seem to be going on with other players that I notice, unless they cough or sniffle...&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Start Menu and Edge problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu and Edge problem</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp; I recently upgraded to Windows 10 Pro (from Windows 7 Ultima)&nbsp;and installed all required software from adobe reader to my printer's software. I also installed Age of Empires II. But, after playing the game for one time, my Edge&nbsp;went invisible and
 the start menu did not work. I contacted customer support&nbsp;and one Ms. Joan efficiently resolved the problem by creating a new user and migrating all my stuff.&nbsp;Again, when I played the game, I had the same problem. This time, I thought the game was not compatible
 and so, I reset&nbsp;the pc myself. It was working fine until this yesterday. I left the system on for a few minutes and suddenly it said it could not find the hard drive. I found it was a loose contact and fixed it. When I started the&nbsp;system, I faced the same
 problem again.&nbsp;Again, I reset my pc. As of now, it is working. But every time I reset, I have to completely reset it without keeping my files. Although I have a external back up, it is tedio

<p>Hi Sayan,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all three solutions that you have given. Still facing the same problem. And now the Microsoft Store icon also gone invisible. Unable to access start menu, Edge and store. For that matter of fact, I am unable to access any of the icons in the taskbar.
 There was no error found with the sfc and DISM. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the message I got with the third solution : </p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>'Get-AppXPackage' is not recognized as an internal or external command,</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>operable program or batch file.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a solution (permanent), it would be great. If not,&nbsp;I want to roll back to Windows &amp;, without losing my data; what should I do?</p>

<p>I'm 20 years old, yet somehow my Xbox Live account is blocking me from changing my payment information so that I can't purchase from the game marketplace because of an 'Age Restriction'? lol wtf? I tried as hard as I could to follow the procedure, but when
 I tried to link a 'Parental Hotmail' (which should be MY own email) it tells me the information I entered was wrong. Can someone please fix this for me, it's frustrating, and I would very much like to invest in this service. However- It's impossible to do
 that at the moment. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-39.gif" /></p>

            <p>Thanks for the update, Pete.</p>
<p>However, there are still some details we'll need. </p>
<p>The error <strong><em>0x80070057 parameter incorrect</em></strong> could be due to a corrupted file, a network connection problem, or a file path is too long. To investigate on this issue further, kindly verify these situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the issue occur when transferring other type of files?</li><li>What about when transferring smaller files?</li></ul>
<p>Please include a screenshot of the error message on your next response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we suggest checking both your drives for system errors:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1. Right-click on drive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2. Go to <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">3. Select the <strong>Tools</strong> tab.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">4. Click <strong>Check</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
<strong><em>administrator</em></strong> to be able to run a scan to check a drive for errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how that went.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            <p>Were you trying to create a backup of the User folder that's why you were trying to move it from your SSD to HDD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If File Backup fails with the error "<span>The parameter is incorrect (0x80070057)", it is caused by a bug in File

            yes, i already &nbsp;tried troubleshooting,but still the problem is there. aside from that downloading problem i also experience the "blue screen display" &nbsp;with a message prompt error "system service exception" and i notice when i used google chrome this blue
 screen always popping- up and &nbsp;eventually causing my pc restart again and again. so because of that i decided to not to used the Google chrome &nbsp;instead i use the opera browser, well &nbsp; in opera i can't experience that blue screen but problem in downloading
 and streaming videos are still there. please help me about this. i'm so tired of these problems, i can't enjoy the features of windows 8. and one thing &nbsp;also, downloading a apps in windows store also interrupted.

                    <p>Original title: Problems using Leapfrog Connect in Windows 8</p>
<p>I have been trying to use the Leapfrog Connect program for a while now with no usable help from Leapfrog. They just keep telling me I need the correct version of Adobe Flash player. I have tried everything they suggested and nothing works. I am wondering
 if this is a Windows 8 compatibility problem. When I start the application, it does recognize the my pal violet and scout toys are connected. The problem is that the visual display to the right of the tabs in the Leapfrog connect window are not showing up.
 There is just a blank white screen. Therefore, I am unable to use the program for anything. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the programs&nbsp;and restarting the computer several times using all different methods. I've tried installing the "correct" version
 of Adobe Flash Player&nbsp;as suggested by Leapfrog but&nbsp;the problem persists. I hope someone can shed light on this situation. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello Musty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As turtle beach is a third party headset as well s others. That is why the agent was having you try an Xbox one chat headset or stereo headset. These are made by Microsoft so first party headsets. With third party there is only so much troubleshooting&nbsp; we
 can do. Updates that come out I have noticed affect a lot of third party headsets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also if the headset plugs directly into the controller via 3.5mm jack you can purchase an adapter. This way help with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Musty is correct about there being a lot of reports about headset mic issues since an update a few weeks ago. All the posts in these forums should be the first clue that something is going on especially for ANY headset that plugs into a controller via the
 3.5mm plug. There is nothing special about a headset whether Microsoft or 3rd party that plugs directly into 3.5mm plug so that likely indicates that something is happening with either the controller or the connectivity between controller and console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given some of the reports I've read, it sounds like the design/manufacture of some of the Microsoft controllers may be inadequate with respect to the 3.5mm plug components and internal controller assembly.</p>

<p>Have you tried connecting the new controller(s) to the console via mini USB cable to see if the firmware is up to date (Sytem - Settings - Kinect &amp; devices - Devices &amp; accessories and click on ... button)? If not, then update the firmware and check to see
 if that then fixes the headset mic issue.</p>

            I haven't connected via USB but that is my first thing to try tomorrow.&nbsp; Have also ordered an adapter as suggested above to see if this will resolve the issue.&nbsp; It's pretty bad that so many people are having this issue yet the staff I spoke to were unaware!

            Hey John.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I don't think you can limit Dark Mode to Explorer only.  It covers all apps at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors &gt; Choose Default App Mode. 
<br />
<br />See illustrated tutorial:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-dark-mode-file-explorer-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-dark-mo...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums, I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your headset plugs into the 3.5 mm audio port, you can managed the audio settings and mic options by pressing the Xbox button and then scrolling all the way to the right then select "Audio". There should be an option to switch your mic on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also go to the Xbox accessories app and press the three dots and then "Volume".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this helps!</p>

    <title>Windows Live 2012 - TLS support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drsmiggles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live 2012 - TLS support</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to set up access to OWA via Windows Live 2012. The settings I am supposed to use in Windows Live Mail according to the OWA help is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IMAP setting</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Server name: outlook.office365.com<br />
Port: 993<br />
Encryption method: SSL</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SMTP setting</strong><br />
Server name: smtp.office365.com<br />
Port: 587<br />
Encryption method: TLS</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, Windows Live Mail 2012 only has the option for SSL. You get the following error:</p>
<p>
<strong>The server does not support a SSL connection.</strong><br />
<strong>Subject 'test'</strong><br />
<strong>Server Error: 250</strong><br />
<strong>Server Response: 250 XXXXXXXB</strong><br />
<strong>Server: 'smtp.office365.com'</strong><br />
<strong>Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC7D</strong><br />
<strong>Protocol: SMTP</strong><br />
<strong>Port: 587</strong><br />
<strong>Secure(SSL): Yes​</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have searched the web, this forum etc. and not a single useful answer that works has been suggested so far to allow emails to be set from Windows Live 2012 via OWA with the required TLS encryption method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So many have logged the same issue and it seems Microsoft is just playing deaf and dumb...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I've wasted enough time on this. I found a client that works, is free and much more feature packed than Live Mail....</p>

<h2>            Unable to load user profile &#40;XP OS&#41; and lost files</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I tried to log into my using my profile on XP last night and message box came up saying that my profile could not be loaded.&nbsp; I am currently in the temp profile that was created automatically by the system for that profile.&nbsp; It appears that files on a different
 profile are missing now and I am unable to get my original profile back.&nbsp; This profile was my administrator profile that I created to replace the system provided admin profile.</p>
<p>I checked the event log and I see an error related to Event ID: 7026 "The following boot-start or system driver failed to load:&nbsp; Lbd."&nbsp; I recently used the "remove" feature to get rid of one or two programs but was able to successfully log in after deleting
 those two programs so I do not believe that caused my profile issue.</p>
<p>I've seen some postings on the forums but they are mostly for non XP OS.&nbsp; Is there any way to recover the profile and files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>I have seen this many times.&nbsp; I have no explanation for why it happens.&nbsp; I just know that every time I see it, I do the same thing, and so far nothing bad has resulted.&nbsp; I know you are not supposed to do this, obviously, but what else are you going to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hold the ON button in for 7 seconds to force a shut down.&nbsp; Then turn it back on.&nbsp; It will ask if you want a normal startup and you do.&nbsp; Then it will go through some strange looking stuff that will actually finish installing the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, start WU again and check for updates and continue until there are no more.&nbsp; Some of those 197 will have been updated and others not, but they will appear again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Works for me.&nbsp; I hope it works for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I make no guarantees!</p>

<p>Is the harddisklamp lightning constantly? If yes, then, it's on hard work, so I will suggest you to let it "run"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when there is many updates, it's never a good idea to take them all in one time. ALL too much for the computer.</p>
<p>Take them in groups - e.g. 4 - 5 updates, the smallest, get them installed, restart and go for the next 4 - 5 updates, again the smallest, and so on until there isn't anymore updates to get</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of them are quite BIG!! Take these one by one.</p>
<p>Do it the same way with the optional updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do it this way, when reinstalling Windows, AND when the "Tuesdays-Patch" hits the PC.</p>

<h2>            Problem booting up from a memory stick</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 8.1 on my Gateway computer and it allowed me to bootup to Boot Manager using my F12 key to select what I wanted to boot to such as DVD or memory stick. Then I upgraded to Windows 10 and it took that capability away from me. In fact, it looked
 like I couldn't boot up to a memory stick at all. I even tried a bootable one and it completely bypassed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do when I upgrade to Windows 10 so that it won't bypass a bootable memory stick?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Windows ten Power Options has a feature called 'Fast Startup'&nbsp;&nbsp; basically a partial hibernate when you shut down the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When its in any hibernate state you don't see the available options to enter bios or alternate boot device choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Win10
 you can Restart the computer and then it doesn't use that 'Fast Startup' hibernate and you will see the key press options that will work to enter bios or your F12&nbsp;boot device selections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can disable 'Fast Startup in Power Options / Choose what the power buttons do / Change settings that are currently unavailable ... scroll down and you will see a check box to enable or disable 'Fast Startup'</p>
