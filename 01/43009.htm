<h2>            cannot assign IP to network device after Windows 10 1803 update</h2>
                    <p>I struggled installing the April update 1803 on my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which was an obvious fix after all if you find it obvious that you have to uninstall the Windows Media player on Windows build 170x before updating to 1803 on your Windows 10 N Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>After I finally got it to work I know am in the uncomfortable situation of having no network connectivity what so ever.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither the build in ethernet card which is connected to my local router as it was before, nor the added USB WiFi card can be assigned an IP.</p>
<p>The WiFi card connects to the local WiFi just fine, but <strong>wont get an IP from the DHCP server and when I assign a static one it just wont show up
</strong>when I call</p>

            As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>It may be unrelated, but after updating to 1803 on my machine I was unable to connect to my corporate wifi...eventually found a setting in&nbsp;network settings, &nbsp;'manage known networks' settings for 'use random hardware addresses' - switched this off and I was
 able to connect straight away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know, but I assume the default for this setting was changed from off to on, and my corporate network doesn't like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verified this by disconnecting, switching the setting back on and trying to connect again - got the same error back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps someone!</p>

<p>I have a problem with no fix solutions as I've searched for hours with no luck.... here it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the 1803 update the desktop comes up with just the bin logo,&nbsp; the start button is red and none responsive with left or right clicks,&nbsp; the internet is off completely with a red x so I can't troubleshoot search or do anything other than turn off and
 on again, I've tried the PowerShell command and it says there's no issues found, I don't have the cd so I can't reinstall the older version..... nothing works what so ever 😣😣</p>

<p>Hi NiteStryker,</p>
<p>Are you able to connect to the internet by booting your computer in Safe mode with networking?<br />
To boot the computer using the option: Safe mode with Networking<br />
1.&nbsp;Use F8 while restarting the computer.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select Safe mode with networking under Windows Advanced Boot Options and hit Enter.</p>
<p>Login to windows in Safe mode and check if you’re able to connect to the Internet using Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>If you’re able to connect to the Internet, then try performing a clean boot to eliminate any conflicting software.</p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></a>
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Do not forget to put the computer back to normal startup once you’re able to get rid of the conflicting software.</p>
<p>If you’re not able to connect to the Internet in Safe mode with Networking, then I would suggest you to re-register the following dll files in Safe mode itself.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Click the Start menu, in Start Search, type "cmd" (without quotation marks), right-click on cmd.exe and click Run as Administrator.<br />
2.&nbsp;Run the following commands pressing Enter after each one.<br />
<strong>regsvr32 Netshell.dll<br />
regsvr32 netcfgx.dll<br />
regsvr32 Netman.dll</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;Once all the dll files are re-registered, check if you’re able to connect to the Internet by booting the computer back to the normal mode.</p>
<p>If this did not work, then you need to remove all the network adapters in the Device Manager and re-install the latest driver for your Network Card.</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. <br />
Post your results back.<br />

    <title>Popup windows under Windows 8 always happen in upper left corner. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Popup windows under Windows 8 always happen in upper left corner.</h2>
                    <p>Popup windows under Windows 8 always sometimes happen in upper left corner.&nbsp; I am using the desktop mostly.&nbsp; Can this be changed back to Windows 7 style where they popup in the middle of your screens?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I running a&nbsp;triple monitor setup.&nbsp; Often you don't even see the little confirmation window popping up way over to the upper left of the left monitor!&nbsp; You think the program has locked up!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Maybe it needs to popup on centered on your primary monitor.&nbsp; Obviously with a double monitor setup you don't want it popping up in the Bezels all the time!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This really gets annoying!&nbsp; I have to always grab the popup window over to the middle screen to ready and act upon it.&nbsp; Then next time it pops up way over there again!&nbsp; If it remembered where you moved it that would be OK.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Edit / More Info:&nbsp; I think this popup in the upper left corner thing is an AMD video card driver issue that sometimes occurs when the computer comes out of sleep.&nbsp; Logging out and back in fixes it for several more sleeps.&nbsp; No solution yet...</p>

<p>Or is there a way to ad the ID3 information to the files so Media Center would&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;them. I can basically decode what my system was of ripping</p>
<p>Please Help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thinking about using LinuxMCE which seems very powerful, but there is no support for the CableCard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi DevonSprings,</p>
<p>Based on my research, Windows Media Player and Windows Media Center uses the same library.</p>
<p>To answer your question on “<strong><em>Is there a way to add the ID3 information to the files so Media Center</em></strong>” is
<strong>yes</strong>. You’ve an option in Windows Media Player and not in Windows Media Center.</p>
<p>Windows Media Player 11 in Windows Vista reads and writes media information in the ID3v2 format. It can also read media information in the ID3v1 format. I would suggest you to visit the link below for more information on how to add or edit media information
 in Windows Media Player.</p>
<p><strong>How do I tell the Player to automatically fix the media information in my files?<br />

<p>If you want to write a program to populate the Windows media Center database with the ratings, then I would suggest you to post your thread in the following link.</p>

<h2>            Sleep Timer</h2>
                    
<p>Is it just me or does nobody else use their Xbox One to watch Tv at night... How nice would it be to be able to say "Xbox, sleep in 60 minutes" then that shuts down Xbox like you have set in the settings... So TV goes off... Cable box goes off... XBOX GOES
 OFF.... ect. I have seen old posts but why isn't there a bigger movement?!? I can't be the only one who want to see this! I mean I see threads from 2013 and still no results!!! Come on Microsoft! I can deal with the 15w when Xbox is inactive, but the 150-160w
 with xbox on and having no sleep timer is wasteful! The Xbox sees the open TV app as a running program; it won't shut down from inactivity! I'm one to fall asleep with the white noise.... So I'm ready to disconnect my Xbox from my cable until Microsoft fixes
 this issue of a sleep timer... Or what Xbox views as "inactivity".</p>

<p>I believe the options are "1 Hour" and "6 Hour". They don't work if you have a open app such as Netflix; who would want Netflix to shut down one hour into a movie. A sleep timer would be a great idea.</p>

<p>Yes, the issue is that even if you set it to shut down after 1 hour of inactivity, the Xbox recognizes the open TV app as a running program so even though the TV is off with a sleep timer that app is open and Xbox recognizes that open app as activity so
 it will stay on for days and days regardless of what settings you have on your Xbox. Very frustrating!!! If the TV is off that is inactivity right??? With Xbox, no!!! &nbsp;I don't care what your doing, if the TV is off that is inactivity. Thus why I say add a
 sleep timer setting or change what Xbox views as inactivity.</p>

<p>This is not true. I watch Neflix every night and I fall asleep after a few hours. When I wake up both my tv and xbox have powered down.</p>
<p>I have my Xbox set to turn off after 1hur of inactivity and my LG turns off after 1 hour of activity.</p>
<p>If you manually select the next episode it considers the xbox active.</p>
<p>If you don't select the next &nbsp;episode it will start automaticly and &nbsp;after about the third o fourth episode it will pop up with you have selected to watch "Family Guy" do you wish to continue watching yes/no</p>
<p>It even shuts down if it is on the Netflix home screen as I have watched many movies and fallen asleep as well.</p>
<p>Give it a try and let me know if it works for you guys.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm more of a TV watcher then Netflix. Though I do watch Netflix from time to time. But even still, if you fall asleep during the first episode and let's say your watching Supernatural which runs 1 hr per episode... 4 episodes is 4 hours plus 1 hour
 for in inactity time to run down on Xbox. That's 5 hours of wasted Xbox life and 5 extra hours of 150-160 watts of electricity over the 15 watts in standby. Wouldn't it be better to just say "Xbox, sleep in 60 minutes."? Everything shuts down, no wasted power.
 It may only add up to an extra 80-90 per year... But you put that total across the board to people who would use it... It could be very beneficial in not wasting electricity!</p>

<h2>            System Stability</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would like to know why windows suddenly kills my program,i think its because not enough RAM but it doesn't show any warnings,it just kills it,and from task manager,i could clearly see the memory usage by the program is not that big.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;And i would also wanted to know why,when every time i load a program or the program is in a loading state,System will use the disk more than the program does,slowing the loading process,sometimes freeze it.For example,i am loading a game,i observe task
 manager, game disk usage... 5 MB/S,a few moments later,System... 15 MB/S,the game freezes,if the loading is done the system will no longer use the disk,why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you,have a good day.</p>

<h2>            Canon imageRUNNER iR1023iF scanner install problem on Win7 64bit</h2>
                    This printer has a network (LAN) connection for printing, but for the scanning function it must be connected via USB.<br />
<br />
OS: Win7 64bit Ultimate.&nbsp; Using the latest install app from Canon<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/office/b_w_imagerunner_copiers/imagerunner_1023_1023n_1023if/imagerunner_1023if#DriversAndSoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">(Canon site)</a><br />
<br />
the 1023 installed just fine for network printing.&nbsp; However, when I did the install for the USB connection (to access the scanning function), Windows does not recognize the scanner.&nbsp; It will print via USB, but the Canon scanner software reports no scanner installed.&nbsp;
 ALso, Device Mgr shows the device with the proper name (1023) but otherwise with a yellow caution mark, and no driver installed.<br />
<br />
BTW, this all works just fine in WInXP Pro 32bit.&nbsp; But, I would rather not install the scanner in an XP virtual machine, since both Canon and MS claim the device is Win7 64bit compatible.<br />
<br />
BTW, I was using the latest Win7 64bit URFII driver.&nbsp; There are two DLs listed and it is not clear which or both to use, or in what order to install them:<br />

            How to install the USB scanning function for the:<br />
Canon 1023 and 1025 family of MFP<br />
<br />
For anyone using a Canon imageRunner iR1023iF multifunction printer with Windows 7 64 bit, who can’t get the scanner function to work, here is how I did it.<br />
<br />
Special thanks must go to Pascal Rudnik who pointed me in the right direction.&nbsp; Also, this should work for the three printers in the Canon iR1023 family, and may also work for the Canon iR1025 family. (They all seem to use the same drivers.)<br />
<br />
The iR1023iF MFP has both a USB connection and a wired LAN connection.&nbsp; The device will print and fax via either USB or RJ45.&nbsp; But it will scan only via the USB port.&nbsp; And, herein lies the problem.<br />
<br />
When one runs the latest driver setup for Win7, at one point in the install, the dialog asks if you are installing for LAN or USB.&nbsp; The LAN branch of the install goes off just fine.&nbsp; However, when one re-runs the install for the USB port to enable the scanning
 functions, it fails.<br />
<br />
Here is the solution:<br />
<br />
Go to the Canon site:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/office/b_w_imagerunner_copiers/imagerunner_1023_1023n_1023if/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/office/b_w_imagerunner_copiers/imagerunner_1023_1023n_1023if/</a><br />
<br />
and pick your variant: the 1023, the 1023N, or the 1023iF<br />
<br />
then drill down to Windows &gt; Vista 64 and then pick Drivers and Software<br />
<br />
Then find this driver (latest as of this writing: April 9, 2012):<br />
<br />
(Clicking on the file names will open up a description)<br />
<br />
***************************************************************<br />
iR1023_vista_2003_xp_x64_Setup.exe &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;02/08/08 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;36,039 KB<br />
<br />
File Name: iR1023_vista_2003_xp_x64_Setup.exe<br />
<br />
PCL5e/6-FAX-UFRII LT Printer Driver Setup Installer for Microsoft Windows XP/2003 Server/Vista 64-bit editions. These drivers are for Microsoft Windows 64-bit Operating Systems only. (36,039)<br />
***************************************************************<br />
<br />
Download the driver and DO NOT run it.&nbsp; Use your favorite un-zip program to unpack the driver set into some convenient folder.<br />
<br />
Next be sure the printer is not connected via USB, and the following steps are done with Admin rights.<br />
<br />
Then go to the Device Manager:<br />
<br />
Click on the Start Orb, then RMB (Right Mouse Button) on Computer &gt; Manage &gt; Device Manager<br />
<br />
In the right pane of the window, RMB on the top most icon which should be the one with the computer’s name.<br />
<br />
Click on <span style="font-style: italic">Add legacy hardware</span>, then click on
<br />
Pick the Radio Button for manual install and click <span style="font-style: italic">
Next</span>.<br />
<br />
Click on <span style="font-style: italic">Imaging Devices</span> and click <span style="font-style: italic">
Next</span>.<br />
<br />
Be sure none of the displayed devices (if any are listed) show selected and click
<br />
Then click on <span style="font-style: italic">Browse</span> in the next dialog and steer to the folder where you unpacked that downloaded driver set.<br />
<br />
The drive dialog should already be filtered for *.inf files and you should see a file called:<br />
<br />
IR22SCN.inf<br />
<br />
Select that file and click <span style="font-style: italic">Open</span>.<br />
<br />
If all has gone well, this should install the drivers for the scanner.<br />
<br />
Let it all finish, and then turn on the 1023 printer and selected Scan on the panel.&nbsp; Plug the printer into a USB port, and Windows should report installing.<br />
<br />
Let that finish, and to be on the safe side do a reboot and try it out.<br />
<br />
BTW: Once the scanner is installed then you can use the Canon iRToolbox to do your scanning.&nbsp; It is a decent scanning utility. (As of this writing it is v4.9)<br />
<br />
BTW#2: Canon claimed to me that the 1023 would not work with Windows7 64bit for scanning!<br />
<br />
BTW#3: If you have tried installing this printer for scanning and failed I suggest that you uninstall any previously installed attempts and try it fresh.<br />
<br />
It is a very sad note that Canon, a respected technology company, can not write an install routine that could accommodate Windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp; Especially since they already have WHQL cert drivers that work.<br />
<br />
enjoy...<br />

            <div>Hi Arbe,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I appreciate your interest in windows 10 and . I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will certainly help you with this.</div>
<div>I need more information about this issue so that I can assist you better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model of your computer?</div>
<div>2. Do you get any error code?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since this issue can be caused by software conflict or system file corrupted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the below methods to fix search issue.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Try to run search and indexing troubleshooter.</p>
<p>Follow the steps. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Go to Start</span></strong><span> button, and then clicking Control Panel.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the search box, type </span><strong><span>troubleshooter</span></strong><span>, and then click
</span><strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong><span>. Click </span>
<strong><span>View all</span></strong><span>, and then click </span><strong><span>Search and Indexing</span></strong><span>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Clean boot.</strong><br />
If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to boot the computer in a clean boot state and check. Booting the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue. You can refer to this article for
 more information:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Disclaimer:
</span></p>
After troubleshooting, reset the computer to start as usual. Refer to the step How to set the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting under more information.
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong>Method 3:&nbsp;Try to follow the below steps.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step A.</strong> &nbsp;Run SFC scan&nbsp;Tool.<br />
First, I would suggest you to run the System File check scan and check if it resolves the issue. System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Refer to these steps to perform a SFC
 scan: <br />
&nbsp;1.Press Windows key + X, select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt<br />
&nbsp;2.In the command prompt type the following command: sfc/scannow and press enter<br />
&nbsp;3.Now, restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step B. </strong></p>
<strong>Windows corruption errors by using the DISM or System Update Readiness tool .</strong>

            What's the point in solution one when the problem in the forst place is not being able to do that?<br />
So the first solution before obliterating the system so there is no personal files is the only option.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the backstory.&nbsp; I use Box.com for file storage/replication cloud services.&nbsp; My box.com sync for windows ceased working, after having worked for months.&nbsp; I attempted to "Repair" using Control Panel/Programs, but upon completion of the Repair, the application
 still failed to work.&nbsp; I decided to completely uninstall and reinstall the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Box Sync for Windows uninstalled fine.&nbsp; Installation, however, failed. (giving an error similar to the error message above).&nbsp; On the Windows help pages, I found the Fix-It Troubleshooter and attempted to run it.&nbsp; I was unable to run it directly from the
 website download.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then downloaded the .msi version of the Fix-It Troubleshooter and it, too, failed to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting that some of the error pop-ups had mentioned .NET errors, I completely uninstalled and reinstalled .NET 4.0 and .NET Client.&nbsp; These installed fine... and I don't know why.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem today, attempting to run Windows Update. This is the update with Internet Explorer 10. The update downloaded, created a restore point, and got through about 80% of the install status bar before it failed. It gave an error code of
 Error Code 9C59:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry to have not responded.<br />
<br />
A clean boot didn't work.&nbsp; I ended up fixing it the hard way: completely wiped it slick and reinstalled.&nbsp; This problem no longer exists, although the wifi still doesn't work reliably (which I'm gathering is a very, very common problem with new Win8 laptops
 from this forum).<br />

Thanks for your help,<br />

<h3> bambig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Manager&#62;click &#39;show processes from all users&#39;&#62;yes on UAC prompt&#62;nothing happens</h2>
                    OS using: vista 64 bit.<br />
<br />
I recently tried the Elevation PowerToy from TechNet http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.06.utilityspotlight.aspx, I thought it would be nice to have some extra options in a rightclick e.g.<br />
<br />
However this Vista got some sideeffects, e.g. the reason why I uninstalled it: I open the Task Manager and click on the 'show processes from all users' button.<br />
This gives an UAC prompt which I acknowledge. But then nothing happens.<br />
And that !@$%?§ worked fine!<br />
<br />
So I ran the uninstalled cmd file from the PowerToy package but, still the same. Task Manager doesn't swith to elevated rights. I can start it manually, like rightclick on a Task Manager shortcut and select 'Run as Administrator', that works.<br />
<br />
Also, on a rightclick of a file/folder, I have options from the Elevation PowerToy still present, annoying.<br />
<br />
<br />

            I considered System Restore for a second. Yet my experience with System Restore is that this would remain resident as problem. Talking about the Task Manager issue. Moreover, I've met this issue before as mentioned below.<br />
<br />
For the still apparent right-click options.. I know the tools from NirSoft yes. Just like Sysinternals. Powerful and useful indeed. Now if some Anti-Virus scanners would learn to make a difference between false alerts on his tools and real viruses. If some,
 more then some actually, of Nir's tools <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
are</span> a virus then arp.exe, cmd.exe, format.exe, ping.exe and a load others might as well be... There's a difference with a file actually being (part of) a virus and what a file can do.<br />
<br />
There's a difference between a picture file and that same picture file with viral code woven in to it so that even most verifying codes will be the same. There goes my avatar.<br />
<br />
<br />
For something like this right-click... regedit.exe<br />
No reboot..<br />
<br />
<br />
However, encountering this Task Manager thing again (!) and still, no solution to be found on the web... Other related effects. I start up another application elevated, and it takes quite a while once I acknowledge the UAC, especially when I am using a program
 in the background which can use all memory, as a pure 64 bit application can these days.<br />
<br />
I have had this problem before. And I apparently forgot what causes this Task Manager not switching to elevated status: Aero. When using all memory... things can occur, even running non-beta stuff 'stable', like this.<br />
Somehow the operation vanishes in Aero. Seeing what happens when I start some other programs when the Core2Duo is working and how long it takes when eventually another elevated program does appear. It started as a sort of side-effect when using all available
 memory, happens afterwards when even there is a lot memory/cpu activity free for a longer time, system having been shut down e.g.
<br />
<br />
Solution: turn off Aero by switching to Vista Basic theme e.g. Apply, and reactivate Aero.
<br />
No reboot..<br />
<br />
Task Manager responding amazingly faster instantly.<br />
<br />
I've been able to repeat this apparently, met the same issue two years ago when trying Vista and all it's bells and rings together (thus the load of issues with that). And for the same issue I had to apparently finetune Aero but it had no finetuning. Also I
 met this on my old 3,4 ghz hyperthreader laptop when trying a Vista beta, that was 32 bit, and even longer ago.<br />
<br />
Another way is what I have done to avoid that from coming back: make it easier for Windows to operate, meaning I disabled some features. That's what I did each previous occasion.<br />
I sure do miss a tool like 98Lite or XPLite,&nbsp; something for today properly configuring a Windows (Ultimate even) after setup. And not talking tools like vLite, once a solid update occurs a vLited Windows can get other issues.<br />

<h2>            Videos Massively Magnified in Windows Media Player</h2>
                    <p>Hi There all of sudden all of my videos have become massively magnified in Windows Media Player. The same videos play perfectly in Qick Time and the Windows 8 app (which I hate). I assume that this must be something to do with a missing codec I have the
 following codec packs installed. K-Light codec pack ( the videos are also magnified in windows player classic) and Xvid.</p>
<p>

    <title>Airport express only sees Apple devices - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Airport express only sees Apple devices</h2>
                    <p>I can't figure this out at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, ever since "upgrading" to Windows 10, my computer (Asus D550MA), which still can see and works fine with other WiFi networks, cannot see my Apple Airport Express (2nd generation) router. &nbsp;It can connect fine if it's a wired connection, but cannot
 see the network as an option on the WiFi network. &nbsp;Similarly, my Moto G android phone cannot see the WiFi network. &nbsp;My wife's Macbook and iPhone 6, are totally fine. &nbsp;Thus far I've tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Reverting to Windows 8 (which my computer, purchased new in April 2014 came with)</p>
<p>-Updating/uninstalling/reinstalling network adapter drivers</p>
<p>-Contacting ISP to make sure that nothing is off on their end (it's not)</p>
<p>-Soft reset of the router/hard reset of the router</p>
<p>-Switching off "allow computer to turn Atheros wireless card off" option in the network adapter settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add to the confusion, every once in a while I can see the network and it works without any problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? &nbsp;My patch cables are cat5 and will soon be cat6 (in the next few days, but the fact that the Macbook works fine may imply that there's just something sneaky in the Airport that prioritizes Apple devices over non-Apple ones.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Reinstall the Network driver in compatibility mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue could have occurred due to the drivers installed not being compatible with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;In order to use the drivers which are designed or developed for a different Operating System, we need to install them in compatibility mode. &nbsp;Please follow the steps below to uninstall the network driver:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows Key + R.</strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong><span>and hit Enter<strong>.</strong></span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the<strong> Network adaptor</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> and select
<strong>Uninstall.</strong></span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To install the drivers in compatibility mode, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><span>Right click</span></strong><span> on the setup file of the driver and select
<strong>Properties.</strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Compatibility Tab.</strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the
<strong>operating system</strong> accordingly from the drop down list</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>OK</strong> and run the setup.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you to refer to the following Microsoft article for more information.</span></p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in my original post, I have already tried uninstalling or reinstalling or updating all network drivers. &nbsp;None of this seems to work. &nbsp;Apparently Atheros never made a driver that functions with Windows 10 and Apple Airport Express routers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I reverted back to Windows 8 again, and suddenly it works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for nothing Microsoft "support".</p>

            Similar issue; except my Assus laptop running Windows 10 upgraded seemlessly. Then, a dreaded Windows 10 update. Now my machine can't see the airport express. Yet, all the apple devices can still connect to it. Need to check if the&nbsp; desk stop can still
 see it.

<h2>            When I backup I get error 0x8078005D</h2>
                    <p>I am running windows 7 ultimate 32-bit on a Dell dimesion E520 with intel Core(TM)2 CPU with 4GB mem.</p>
<p>I have been backing up on an external 500 GB Western hard drive. I do keep deleting back up to free space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am now unable to complete a back up. I get the error message that windows was unable to find the backup location.</p>
<p>When I look at the external hard drive there is a backup?</p>
<p>I have formated and scandisked the hard drive and all is OK.</p>
<p>Still get the same error.</p>
<p>Any Ideas?</p>

            <p>How to reset the Backup and Restore’s Action Center:<br />
</p>
<p>After the backup failed the Action Center display needs to be reset to clear the error message and the failed backup folders and files deleted from the destination drive in order to perform a successful backup with the correct backup status results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Start by creating a ‘System Restore’ point before you make any registry changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Updating the registry:<br />
The following registry changes need to be made to the action center status DWORD values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsBackup\Status\ActionCenterState&nbsp; DWORD=0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsBackup\ValidConfig&nbsp; DWORD=0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsBackup\ValidSystemImageBackup&nbsp; DWORD=0</p>

<h2>            W10&#58; Print Management missing from Adminiostrative Tools</h2>
                    <p>I want to create mulitiple queues for each printer like I had in W7.&nbsp; It appears this is done with the Print Management Administrative Tool, but it is missing, so I can only have one queue for each printer.&nbsp; How can I get it?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb84f986-7f5f-44e2-9032-9b614acad97d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb84f986-7f5f-44e2-9032-9b614acad97d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it perhaps that I only have Windows 10 Home (which is what I ended up with after upgrading W7 Home Premium) and that that doesn't include Print Management?</p>
If so, what is the lowest version upgrade that would include it?

<h2>            Typing in Arabic Language</h2>
                    I activated the on-screen keyboard and changed my input language to Arabic (101). This helped with typing Arabic letters. However, I need to be able to type Arabic numbers&nbsp;also but the on-screen keyboard still shows english numericals. How do I type Arabic
 numbers?

About a month ago I was on my PC when my headset malfunctioned and then a minute later my keyboard and mouse were unresponsive and my computer screen froze. It will stay frozen for hours until I reset it. Upon restart sometimes the PC will receive power (All
 fans, lights, etc working) but no lights or response or image on monitor, keyboard, mouse and headset. I have replaced the RAM, CPU and GPU and still nothing works (CPU replacement worked for about 2 weeks). The ONLY way to fix my pc is to restore it to a
 previous restore point VIA the windows advanced options menu.</p>

            Hi Tim, this seems to be a common enough problem with Windows 10, it seems to be related to Power settings in Windows 10 rather than a hardware issue with your PC, whereby different hardware components goes to sleep and do not wake . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Run both these troubleshooters:
<br />
<br />Power
<br />
<br />Hardware and Devices
<br />
<br />When that completes, restart your PC

            Hi TIm, sorry, I did not realize you were having that much difficulty, please try the options below to see if you can get up and running . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get my PC into safe mode and begin file backup when my PC then blue screened and everything went black and no response (Lights etc) on mouse or keyboard. What should I do? I have already replaced my CPU,GPU and RAM. Maybe its the Hard drive?
 Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: When I try to reset my pc (Keep and remove files options both) it says that it failed to reset my pc.</p>

                    Hi I just recently re-upgraded back to windows 10 and I like it so far but I dislike the photo app since i can't control slideshow features (loop, shuffle,speed,etc.) however when I try to run my pictures through the windows photo viewer slideshow feature
 the pictures become off center to the right and enlarged. I only ever had this problem when running photo viewer through windows 10.
