<h2>            Installation of Windows 10 on my Inspiron 5570</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I need some urgent help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Dell Inspiron 5570. I want a clean install on my newly installed Samsung 970 evo nvme SSD. I have consulted many articles and videos but could not find an agreed method for clean installation using USB. I want information about how the BIOs settings
 must be changed for install on SSD from HDD options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi , 
<br />
<br />On that laptop you will have UEFI BIOS, make the following changes (if available)
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS (F2 on the Dell logo screen) 
<br />
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi Asadsultan,
<br />
<br />You may or may not have that CSM option in your BIOS
<br />
<br />Compatibility Support Module (CSM) is a part of the UEFI firmware that provides legacy BIOS compatibility by emulating a Legacy BIOS environment

            Hi Asad, 
<br />
<br />Yes that would be a good guide to follow, especially if you are replacing a standard HDD with an NVMe SSD.
<br />
<br />If your system already had an SSD or NVMe drive, I would expect SATA Mode would already be set to AHCI . . .

            Currently my SATA mode is RAID on.&nbsp; I have to set it to Ahci after SSD installation. And keep at that? I want both drives to run on.

<h3> n_ebrahim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows media player won&#39;t play music from external hard drive</h2>
                    Hi. I'm asking this question on behalf of my dad who loves listening to actual CDs since he prefers the sound quality of them. He often likes to make his own mixed CDs and has a lot of music saved on an external hard drive. We've noticed that if we select
 a music file on the external by double clicking in File Explorer the file plays fine, however if we open Windows Media player all of the files on the external are displayed but don't play when we click on them and also cannot drag and drop into the pane to
 create a playlist. My dad first has to copy the music to the laptop (Windows 10) itself and then it plays from windows media player. Is there a reason for this or something we supposed to do? Thanks in advance

            Hi N_Ebrahim ... I would recommend using VLC Player.
<br />It is what i use to play my media files.
<br />Most reliable and user friendly.
<br />See link.

    <title>Forced gamertag change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> getsomehoe1320  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forced gamertag change</h2>
                    
<p>I have had my gamertag getsomeho1320 for over 12 years and have recently been forced to change it 3 times already. I don't feel that my gamertag was forced to be changed because of the tag itself, I'm never offensive online and I treat each player with the
 utmost respect.&nbsp;I really feel that the problem is occuring because I recently purchased a new xbox for my bedroom&nbsp;and have been using my profile on two seperate consoles, of course never at the same time. I always completely log off of one and then go to the
 other.&nbsp;With that said why allow anybody to load their profile on another console if they are only going to be forced to change their gamertag. I would truly love to have my original gamertag back! If you could please help me with this I would gladly appreciate
 it, I have already called and contacted support in this matter and they feel the same way I do and have asked to go this route to help solve my problem. Thank you!</p>

<p>Xbox live service is a little under 10yrs old.</p>
<p>Just so happens it was reported and now you have a FNC.</p>
<p>The account can become Ban for multiple FNC.</p>
<p>So really think out that next change b.c it might be your last.</p>
<p>If it was the same GT for X years; what did the 3 prior FNC not take effect?</p>
<p>Were you able to win on further investigation?</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Don't create a gamertag</strong>, profile content, Avatar action, Avatar content, or in-game content that other users may be offended by. This includes, without limitation, anything related to or suggestive of: profane words/phrases, <strong>topics or content of a sexual nature</strong>, hate speech (including but not limited to racial, ethnic, or religious slurs), illegal drugs/controlled substances, or illegal activities.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>You should post in the suspension forum if you want an official answer from the XBLPET. But it is most likely due to the sexual reference in the tag. If you continue to create GTs that are offensive you are likely to receive a perma ban. Keep it clean.</p>

<p>yeah the part without the numbers is the reason why it got the forced name change, just making another tag with the same profane phrase but with different numbers will still get it changed. &nbsp;and if you get too many forced name changes you will get perm banned
 and loose everything. &nbsp;just be smart and make your tag rated E for everyone and you will not have any problems. &nbsp;oh and LIVE has only been around 10 years this fall I believe not, 12.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">It matters not how long you have had the offensive content but rather that the content is offensive. It clearly violates the XBL Code of Conduct. Just an fyi, MS will only allow an 'x' amount of FNC's before they make the decision
 to permanently ban the account from their service. Honestly, does anyone really need more than one chance to correct something they should have already known if they had just simply read the contracts they were agreeing to? With that said MS really isn't obligated
 to give anyone a second chance since they clearly give a warning in their Code of Conduct, just because people don't read it doesn't mean it doesn't apply..</span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 can&#39;t boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phongishere  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 can&#39;t boot</h2>
                    <p>I was doing my usual, everyday thing when my computer started making clicking noises( straight from the tower) and windows froze. So I manually shut it down and turned it back on again. I got this Windows Boot Manager saying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:</p>
<p>1. Insert your windows installation disc and restart your computer.</p>
<p>2. Choose your language settings, and then click next.</p>
<p>3. Click Repair your computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have the disc, contact your system administrator or computer manufactor for assistance.</p>
<p>Satus: 0xc000000e</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Info: The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I thought it was a hardware issue and I opened up my computer. Nothing seems wrongs. So I did what it told me. I inserted my windows installation disc and went on repair computer. For some reason, I couldn't access Repair Your Computer because it wasn't
 compatible. After that, I googled it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;After disabling my hdd because appearantly my windows cd and computer were not compitable, i finally got on to the "Repair your computer" from my windows installation disc. I
</p>
<p>So now Im on the System Recovery Option from my windows installer cd. </p>
<p>Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically.</p>
<p>System Restore has an error saying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There was an unexpcted error:</p>
<p>The parameter is incorrect. (0x80070057)</p>
<p>Please close System restore and try agian" </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have a system image saved and windows memory diagnostic and command prompt I don't know what to do or if that would work. I think my only option would be to get the system restore to work.
</p>
<p>I can't reinstall windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now if I don't have the windows installer cd inserted, it comes up with:</p>
<p>"Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Bood device and press a key"</p>
<p>This is happening because I have disabled some boot preferences in the bios so I can acces the "Repair your computer" from the windows installation cd. And if I put my bios back into normal defaults, I can't access "Repair your computer" because of compatibality
 issues...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am seriously troubled and don't know what to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello HollyAnn W,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will do my best to assist you to help resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, Windows 10 will only be free to upgrade to for the first year of its release. So maybe you would want to reconsider. I understand why you would like to stay in Windows 7 but soon MS will stop support for Windows 7 like they did for XP a couple
 of years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, now that I have said that to make you aware, I would try this below if you're still getting the pop up asking if you would like to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're sure that you do not want to upgrade then please copy the following text that I below that is in italics and paste it into notepad.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Gwx]"DisableGwx"=dword:00000001</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have that then go ahead and save it onto your desktop and save it as 'Block 10' or something like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to your desktop and locate that file and change the file extension to .txt to .reg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save this then double click on the file. This is alter the registry to block the Windows 10 upgrade. I use this quite a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now as far as your issue is concerned, please follow this guide. It is one of the best ways to solve your issue.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Vikrant,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the replies to the questions you have asked:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased a Windows 8 pro update disc from an Electronics&nbsp;retailer in Mumbai, India (Reliance Digital). There are no questions about the authenticity of the disc and I am not running a pirated edition. I first tried to update my Windows XP SP3 edition
 by clicking on Setup after inserting the disc in the DVD drive. After keying in the product key, the system became unresponsive. I had to shut it down and subsequently I booted from the DVD directly and installed Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time after keying in the same product key, the installation went smoothly. I reformatted my
</p>
<p>partition to do the install. The reformatting was done from within the Windows 8 setup process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsequently, from within the OS, I purchased Windows Media center pack which I paid for using my credit card. To make sure the entire installation was correct, I rebooted and was checking the system details by using the Windows key+X and viewing the system
 details. The specific details I am getting under product activation is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows is activated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows currently running on your PC is activated.</p>
<p>Current edition</p>
<p>Windows 8 Pro with media Center</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current Product key</p>
<p>*****-yyyyy (Shows five alphabets here, I am not sure if I should publicly post it here)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Activated on</p>
<p>27/04/2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, after installation I noticed that my date, time and location where incorrect. I have corrected them now. The PC has been restarted on numerous occasions but it does not help and the date remains at 27/04/2013.</p>

            <p>Hi Mary,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, after install, I noticed that my date, time and location are incorrect. I fixed that subsequently. It is not correcting the error in the date in the activation details.</p>

</p><p>It scans automatically. It is intended as a support tool for users own security arrangements.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this
 tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal
 mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Please upload a copy of the report on what it found as a shared file to your OneDrive and a post a link here.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and run ADWCleaner and upload a copy of the report produced to your OneDrive. Remove all that it finds.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Before running ADW Cleaner close all open programmes. When ADW Cleaner is run four options are offered. Click
<strong>Scan.</strong> You can review the results by clicking <strong>Log File</strong> or each or any of the Results tabs. To remove all items, click
<strong>Clean</strong> and reboot the computer. On restarting an ADW Cleaner window opens. Select Log File, and click File, Save As to create a report of what has been removed.</span></span></p>

            Thank you for your reply. I also found a good malware scan/removal tool with surfright.net called Hitman Pro. It is only free for 30 days but good enough to scan the computer and pick any bugs.<br />

<h2>            Destiny 2 Verifying content</h2>
                    I bought Destiny 2 less than a week ago and it failed to load up, as I kept getting frozen on a white loading screen, I uninstalled the game left it 24 hours and reinstalled it, and repeated again another 24 hours later as it still wasn't loading. It fixed
 the problem, I've played less than 6 hours on the game, and it keeps putting me on a verifying content screen that takes hours to complete, and occasionally will freeze, and it keeps putting me back to that screen every time I load the game up. Is there anyway
 to fix it or can anyone tell me what's happening with it? Its not the first game I've bought digitally, but its the only one that has this issue.&nbsp;

            No, I have not resolved this problem yet. I am doing more research trying to gather as much info as possible to be sure I cover all my bases. It seems to be set in DataStoreAndWULogFiles.zip and Background Intelligent Transfer Service, Package Versions
 1.2.1.20140627 and 8.1.1.20140627. &nbsp;I'll keep you posted on my progress but, other problems that might exist in this "OLD" computer might just force me to replace it altogether... &nbsp;

    <title>Sony Vaio vpccw21fx overheating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gunscoffeesushi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sony Vaio vpccw21fx overheating</h2>
                    i have been having this problem for a couple of months now, and i got a laptop fan that plugs in via usb thinking that would help. but it isnt. i have a sony vaio vpccw21fx, only about a year old, and it will run for about 30-45 mins, and then shut off.
 the left side of it is&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;hot, and ive tried waiting 5 mins, 30 mins, 1 hr, and even leaving it off overnite and then turning it back on the next day, and it still does it. i tried finding where it says what the tempature is, but&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;find it, and
 i found an update to the driver on the windows website that was supposed to rectify the problem, but that didnt work either. im not sure if i need a different update or my computer is just crapping out. im hoping not because as i said its only a year old,
 and i really like it. anyone else having this issue or know if something to try??

            i did try that update, and it didnt do anything, but that wasnt the issue anyway. i appreciate the input, but the problem has been solved. i just took it all apart and sprayed some canned air in there. it was caked up with dust. now however, my sound doesnt
 work. im afraid it open it back up and mess around with it sense im not sure what to do anyway.&nbsp;

    <title>Error 105 DNS problem on Google Chrome - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error 105 DNS problem on Google Chrome</h2>
                    I have Windows Vista on a Toshiba Satellite laptop. My web browser is Google Chrome. I am getting frequent "Error 105" messages telling me that the DNS server cannot be found. &nbsp;The solution is always to restart the laptop. Then it runs ok until the next
 incident. Two other computers run off the same router, so the problem is the Toshiba and not the router. What is the fix for this problem?

Instead of using the Start Points and End Points...<br />
try splitting the movie and delete the unwanted portion.<br />
<br />
Also be certain that you are running the most recent <br />

</li><li>What is the file type of the raw footage or video that you are having issues with?
</li><li>Did you make any changes to your system before you encountered the issue? </li><li>Does the issue occur to all raw footage or on a specific raw footage? </li><li>Does the second product is the first end product that you've edited before?</li></ul>

<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>What is the build version of your Movie Maker? (Press Alt + F and then click About Movie Maker)</li></ul>
<div>version 2012 (Build 164.3508.0205)</div>
<ul>
<li>What is the file type of the raw footage or video that you are having issues with?</li></ul>
<div>.MTS</div>
<ul>
<li>Did you make any changes to your system before you encountered the issue?</li></ul>
<div>no. It's a brand new computer. I've had it for about 4 months with no issues</div>
<ul>
<li>Does the issue occur to all raw footage or on a specific raw footage?</li></ul>
<div>all raw footage</div>
<ul>
<li>Does the second product is the first end product that you've edited before?</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not sure what you are asking here, but I think it's about the nature of the footage. The footage is undamaged because &nbsp;when I attempted to edit the same footage on a 3-year-old Dell laptop, I was able to edit with no problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also I did take the suggestion from poster above you (Volunteer J) the the jumping stopped. &nbsp;I suppose I could edit that way but it seems awfully silly.</div>

            Interesting, I did exactly what you said and the problem stopped. &nbsp;I can certainly edit this way but it seems kind of odd. Wonder why the start and end options are now causing issues.

<p>Thank you for your reply. Sorry to hear that when you use the start and the end points, the issue persists. To investigate, can you provide us log files for Movie Maker? I provided the link below for the steps:</p>

Thanks for the feedback.<br />
<br />
Just guessing...but I would suspect system <br />
resource issues...possibly the video driver.<br />

            <p>With one app on the display, you simply swipe in from the side and "pull" the other app onto the screen from the left. You can drag it until the app display is as big as desired, and "drop" it alongside the original app. You are then free to reference material
 in one app while working in the other. </p>
