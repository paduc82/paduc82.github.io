                    <p>I shut off my wireless network connection because it's much slower than my landline.</p>
<p>Overnight the computer always goes offline and I have to shut down and restart to get back on line.

    <title>Upgrade Assistant says active partition is compressed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davec-nzx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade Assistant says active partition is compressed</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have an MSI Netbook running Windows 7 Starter and wanting to go to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I run the Upgrade Assistant which tells me <em>the current active partition is compressed.</em></p>
<p>I've checked in Computer Management - I have:</p>
<p>Recovery Partition - 8.35GB</p>
<p>Active, Recovery Partition - 100MB</p>
<p>Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary Partition - 173.79GB - OS_Install (C:)</p>
<p>Primary Partition - 115.86GB - Data (D:)</p>
<p>All are listed as Simple - Basic; C: and D: are NTFS; the other two have no file system listed.</p>
<p>None of the partitions are indicating as 'compressed'. In Explorer, I have the option to make compressed (therefore, taken as currently 'uncompressed').</p>
<p>All sitting on a WD 320GB disk (289.1GB in use by the partitions).</p>
<p>I don't have access to any partition other than C: and D: And I would imagine neither would the upgrade.</p>
<p>So why am I being told that the current active partition is compressed.</p>
<p>I note I could make C: partition Active - but what effect would that have on the boot/operation of the netbook?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Edge browser mis-identifying sites as phishing sites - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david ziffer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edge browser mis-identifying sites as phishing sites</h2>
                    <p>After the Windows 10 update of 2/10/2016 I visited my own two web sites with the Edge browser and got this message on each:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">This might not be the site you want<br />
&lt;website URL&gt;<br />
Some devious or potentially harmful websites<br />
impersonate the URL or content of legitimate sites.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 30px">Does this address look correct?<br />
Yes it's correct.<br />
[Button: Report as safe]</div>

<div>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">No, this isn't the URL of the site I want to visit.<br />
[Button: Report as unsafe]</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my sites has not changed in years. After reporting both sites "safe" using the appropriate button (which redirected me to a web page where I had to enter an obnoxious CAPTCHA code) I called Microsoft. The technician convinced me to buy a support package
 otherwise he could not help me, insisting that this was probably a problem with my machine. So in frustration I agreed to this (the purchase was refunded later). After spending a half hour remote-controlling my machine and discovering nothing, and after visiting
 two other W10 machines of mine and finding the same problem, they ended up transferring me to some higher technical support level. After an hour of rigamaroll they ended&nbsp; up sending me a link that I could use to report the specifics of this problem (IP addresses,
 URLs and such). I submitted both my sites and in the end it turned out that these links were for reporting other types of problems entirely (being unable to send emails from Outlook.com) and not for reporting false phishing warnings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then later in the day I visited some other non-mainstream sites that are just hosted by individuals like me and found the same message on them. Apparently something has gone totally nuts with this at Microsoft, and nobody there or anywhere else (like at
 my IPP) seems to know about it.</p>

            <p>I thought I'd post some images here. The first one is one of my own two web sites, both of which exhibit this problem. Today I also just happened to visit for the first time the web site of a musician named Wayne Hawkins, and I saw that his site has been
 flagged too. It made me a little less sad; misery loves company.</p>

            <p>This is a very serious defect in two ways.&nbsp; First, the verbiage implies that there is a probability there is a problem with the website (rather than just safety unknown), and second, there is no way to report it as safe as implied on the first screen.&nbsp; In
 fact if one is not careful on the second screen&nbsp;they could read the first option that reports as a phishing website and assume (without reading it)&nbsp;that the second option is reporting it safe and click it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

    <title>Photoshop CS3 not working with Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thebigphill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photoshop CS3 not working with Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit.</h2>
                    Have installed Adobe Creative Suite 3 Design Premium onto a full retail edition of Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. &nbsp;All components have installed fine (no errors etc). &nbsp;All other applications seem to work fine (Bridge, Falsh, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, etc,
 etc). &nbsp;Just Photoshop won't work. &nbsp;It will attempt to start, but fails during it's startup routine (ie where it shows the various adobe items being loaded up). &nbsp;Comes up asking if I want to close program, or look for solution online. &nbsp;I've tried solution online
 several times, but nothing happens. &nbsp;I note that on Windows 7 compatibility site this products shows as running fine on Windows 7 ult, 64 bit....
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried uninstall and reinstall a few times. &nbsp;Also tried running in compatibility modes (Vista, XP) several flavours (ie service packs). &nbsp;Nothing works.</div>

                </div>

            OK,
<div><br />
<div>So I've been looking at this for quite a few hours over the last few days and good news! &nbsp;My thanks for your suggestions, but whilst trying multiple uninstalls of various software/services/drivers I noticed that when Photoshop fails to open it stopped
 at the same point. &nbsp;Before clicking "Look for solution online" or "Close program" I noted down that it was at the TWAIN loading screen. &nbsp;TWAIN is for scanners (took me a few moments before I remembered that). &nbsp;A search for "CS3 TWAIN problem" gives a few results
 but about third on the list for me was:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/330/330344.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/330/330344.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>This is a link to an Adobe tech note that explains the exact problem I was having. &nbsp;Just in case the link stops working, here are the very simple steps:</div>
<div><span>On Windows:
<ol>
<li>Go to Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS2\Plug-Ins\Import-Export (Photoshop CS2), or Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\Plug-Ins\Import-Export (Photoshop CS3).
</li><li>Right-click the Twain_32.8BA file and choose Rename.
</li><li>Add a tilde (~) in front of the name and press Enter.
</li></ol>
<div>Note that Photoshop will no longer talk direct to scanners, but to be honest who cares. &nbsp;You can scan whatever you want using your scanning software and open the resulting image files in Photoshop.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps others. &nbsp;Plus GREAT news, CS3 really IS compatible with Windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note, here's another link that may be useful if you're running 64 bit, you may get an error when installing CS3 (I didn't get the first 7 times I tried, but on number 8 I got it). &nbsp;The steps are easy and it works. &nbsp;It's for the error "can't find adobePDF.dll".</div>

<p>I have the same problem. I start the process every evening after work and when I come back in the morning the update is only at 18% so I have to shut off my computer and wait for the previous version of Windows 10 to install. I get reminders every day to
 complete the process.</p>

<p>The latest updates keep failing and I was told that is because MS wants you to call them, so they can get access to your comuter and do the update.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, when I contacted them, they wanted to do remote access to my computer and I say no way.&nbsp; I
 was also told if you have any other virus protection on your computer it will not allow the updates to process.&nbsp;&nbsp; My virus protection ask if I want to allow the change and I say yes, but it still fails.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Prior to Windows 10, I never had any issues with updates.</p>

<p>I have had the same problem since yesterday.&nbsp; I went through all the options above as well as chatting with Microsoft Support.&nbsp; They repaired files, updated Windows with an Update Driver and reinstalled Windows 10.&nbsp; With all of that, the problem still exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem appears to be a Microsoft Store issue.&nbsp; When I try to install a Microsoft Casual Game, I get the same error when the app tries to acquire a license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only hope Microsoft Support are reading these posts.</p>

<span>Hello there&nbsp;Ticky</span>
Error 80153021 occurs when making a purchase on Xbox LIVE
<div>
<p>You see the following error code and message when you try to make a purchase on Xbox Live;</p>
<p><b>Purchase pending.&nbsp;<br />
Status code: 80153021.</b></p>
<p>This may mean one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Xbox Live purchase is blocked because of a pending previous purchase. </li><li>There is a problem with the billing information for your Microsoft Account. </li><li>Your account is locked. </li></ul>
<p>Please follow the&nbsp;<b>Solutions&nbsp;</b>To resolve this problem, try the following solutions: &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Solution 1: Delete your Xbox LIVE profile, clear the system cache, and re-download your profile.&nbsp;</b>Here’s how:&nbsp;<b>Solution 2: Verify the billing information for your Microsoft account.&nbsp;</b><b>Solution 3: Try your purchase again later.&nbsp;</b><b>Solution
 4: Contact us.</b></p>

<div><span>Now you might be trying to&nbsp;</span><strong>update your account info</strong><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><strong>replace an expired card</strong><span>. Now normally the</span><strong>"glitch in the system"</strong><span>&nbsp;message will start to appear when your&nbsp;</span><strong>card
 on file has expired</strong><span>&nbsp;and can no longer be charged.&nbsp;</span><strong>Unfortunately that will also restrict access to your account</strong><span>, even preventing you from&nbsp;</span><strong>replacing the card</strong><span>. The best thing to do is&nbsp;</span><strong>contact
 support</strong><span>&nbsp;and speak with a</span><strong>&nbsp;billing agent</strong><span>, they will be able to&nbsp;</span><strong>access your account</strong><span>&nbsp;and replace the card for you.

<p>Solution 1 - I'm not trying to purchase anything, I'm trying to change my Music Pass subscription. &nbsp;In trying to figure out why I'm getting the message "This action cannot be performed at this time. Please try again later. For more information, go to
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/support&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com/support"</a>, I was told by xbox.com/support that my account is "blocked" and that I should post to the forum to find out why (which seems odd).</p>
<p>Solution 2 - I have verified my information and I have not been blocked from purchasing items or having my current subscription auto billed so I have my doubts this is about my billing information.</p>
<p>Solution 3 - I have been getting this message for two days.</p>
<p>Solution 4 - I have tried to contact you, xbox support chat, the phone number on support.microsoft.com, and the xbox support number that was provided by xbox support chat and have gotten nowhere.</p>
<p>Suggestions?</p>

    <title>Blue Screen &#40;Stop 0x50&#41; after applying update KB2982791 to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen &#40;Stop 0x50&#41; after applying update KB2982791 to Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I ran all the updates of the August patch day. Installation went smoothly. After rebooting everything worked fine. But when I shut down my notebook and switched it on a little later it came up with a blue screen with a Stop 0x50 in Win32k.sys.
 I could not even boot into safe mode as Windows failed to start no matter which mode chose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I restored from a backup, installed the updates again and... same effect. After restoring again I went through the updates and found update
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2982791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB2982791</a> which relates to Win32k.sys and fonts. I also found this KB article (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2908190/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Stop error 0x50 in Win32k.sys</a>) which says that a Stop 0x50 occurs because
 Win32k.sys crashes when the font cache is not correctly maintained. Quite a bizarre behaviour to crash the whole operating system because a cache seems to be invalid. A decent programmer would have just cleared the cache and continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since security update KB2982791 relates to fonts, as well, I guess that MS has once again messed up an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my experience with MS "support" I know that MS does not care about bug reports. So I just post this to inform people which may have been bitten by this bug. If possible, restore your OS or boot from CD and uninstall update KB2982791. Then things should
 work again. Oh, and after that switch off automatic updating...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Frank</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem on two computers, both win7 64bits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could solve it by booting from a DVD and removing the following file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>c:\Windows\System32\FNTCACHE.DAT</p>
<p>
</p><p>For sake of completeness, I first removed the files</p>
<p>c:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\FontCache3.0.0.0.dat</p>
<p>c:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\FontCache-System.dat</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that didn't solve the problem. Then I removed the file I mentioned first. So, in the end all 3 files were removed, but I guess the first one is the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I can confirm that removing fntcache.dat fixed the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>My dad had this issue on his win7 x64 PC after the update that he received on 15-08-2014.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Checking the update history, He only received&nbsp;</span></span>KB2982791, not the other mentioned suspects.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Removal of fntcache.dat via command prompt via de recovery disk solved the problem.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>For anyone having issues removing the file with commandprompt, here is my quick guide:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>1. Insert the recovery disk/windows installation disk.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>2. Boot from disk by pressing F12 or whatever key is shown when your PC turns on that says "BOOT MENU" or something alike.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>3. Select CD/Disk Drive<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>4. Let the windows files load, select a language and then select the restore option on the bottom.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>5. Then select the top option to get a list of all the repair tools.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>6. Click on command prompt on the bottom.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>7. You'll see a letter, for example X:\. This is your windows CD. We need to get to the windows installation on your hard drive, but even though this might have been C: when your PC was still
 working, it could very well be another letter now, so to try this out, first type:<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>wmic logicaldisk get name</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
to get a list of all your drives. Then access every disk you see in that list by typing:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
cd /d A:<br />
cd /d B:<br />
cd /d C:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>and so on, each time checking what's on the drive by typing dir.<br />
<br />
If you see a list that contains folders like "Windows" and "Program Files", you're most likely on your harddrive that contains your windows installation.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
8. Now go to the system32 folder by typing:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
cd windows</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>cd system32</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
9. Now check if the fntcache.dat file exists, by typing:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
if exist fntcache.dat ( echo yes ) else ( echo no )</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
10. If you see "yes" below that line, this means that the file exists, and your problems will most likely be fixed very soon.<br />
<br />
11. Type the following command to remove the file:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
del fntcache.dat</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
12. Press &lt;arrow up&gt; twice, to repeat the "if exist fntcache..." command. This should now output "no".</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
13. If that's the case, reboot your computer and keep your fingers crossed. This worked for me :-)! Good luck. If it still doesn't work, I suggest you follow the steps to remove the entire faulty windows update by following the instructions elsewhere in this
 topic, that I'll also post below (my own version, for your convenience):</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>1. Once you know the letter of your windows drive (see my tutorial above), type the following command (replace C: with the letter of your drive that contains your windows installation):</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
dism /image:C:\ /get-packages</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
2. Search the results for the faulty security update KB2982791, and just to be sure, find KB2976897 and KB2970228 as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
3. Write down the exact package names, and remove them with the following commands (replace drive letter again to fit your system, and replace the package names with how they're named on your system):</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
dism /image:C:\ /remove-package/PackageName:Package_for_KB2970228~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.2</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">dism /image:C:\ /remove-package/PackageName:Package_for_KB2982791~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.1</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">dism /image:C:\ /remove-package/PackageName:Package_for_KB2976897~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.0</span></p>
<p>4. You'll receive messages that state that the uninstallations were successfull.</p>
<p><br />
5. Restart the computer into normal mode.</p>

<h2>            I can only scroll up or down by clicking on top or bottom arrow or left clicking while pointing cursor on the scroll bar...what&#39;s up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>HI, Today all of a sudden my scroll bar would not work when clicking on it and moving it with the cursor. I can move it if I click above it or below it in the open space or click on the arrows at the top and the bottom or left clicking on my laptop and holding
 the cursor on the &nbsp;gray bar and moving it that way. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this? Thanks for any help...Pam</p>
<p>&nbsp;PS I use Google Chrome browser but it does the same in IE</p>

                    <p>I updated from Windows 8.1 to windows 10 and activated it last month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I tried to reset PC (cleaning all drives) and windows 10 complains about activation with&nbsp;Error code: 0xC004C003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows 10 was activated and after resetting, it no longer is activated. Any ideas as how can I proceed?</p>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What it means and how to fix it</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are a few reasons why you might see this error:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You performed a clean installation of Windows&nbsp;10 instead of first upgrading from your previous version of Windows. When this happens, we aren't able to register your entitlement with the activation servers because you aren't upgrading to Windows&nbsp;10. To fix
 this, you'll need to go back to your previous version of Windows, make sure the previous version is activated, and then upgrade to Windows&nbsp;10. For more info about how to go back to a previous version of Windows, see the section in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recovery options in Windows 10</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You upgraded to Windows&nbsp;10, but the activation servers were busy. If you upgraded from an activated copy of Windows&nbsp;7 or Windows&nbsp;8.1, your copy of Windows&nbsp;10 will be automatically activated, or you can wait a while and then select Activate now. If you performed
 a clean installation instead of first upgrading to Windows&nbsp;10, see the info on how to fix this problem in the previous item.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You might also see this error if you're using an invalid product key. For example, you can't use a Windows&nbsp;7 or&nbsp; Windows&nbsp;8.1 product key to activate Windows&nbsp;10.</p>

<h2>            When I try to install windows photo gallery in won&#39;t download because Micrsoft says photo gallery is already installed&#33;</h2>
                    I am running win 7- I loaded Photo Gallery about a month ago. It seems to have UNINSTALLED ITSELF??? I use Photo Gallery for my screen saver slide show-&nbsp; I noticed the slidshow had stopped working so I went in to setting s to make sure everything looked
 alright and appears that Photo Gallery is GONE! When I do a global search in the Start box I get a prompt that tells me "go online to download Windows Essentials (Photo Gallery)". So when I try to re-download Photo Gallery microsfots site tells me Photo Gallery
 is already installed??? But it's not working and I can't find it on my computer???

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting. I understand that you cannot install your Photo Gallery due to the previously installed one. What I can suggest is to reinstall the whole Windows Essentials by following these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Note : If you are using Mail, I suggest that you back up your emails through this

<p>2. Delete the Windows Live folders (if any) found on the following directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\Program Files\Windows Live</li><li>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Windows Live</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>3. Install Windows Essentials using this

            Thats the problem - I can't find Photo Gallery any where on my computer to un-install it. I'm thinking there might be some left-over bits in the registry that makes the microsoft website think Photo Gallery is already installed???

<div>The answers to your questions, as best as I can give them, are as follows:</div>
<div>My computer is a Toshiba laptop, bought in 2016, I think.</div>
<div>I have no idea what my computer's version or "build number" are.</div>
<div>When I <em>tried</em> to update it, I got the code 0xc1900200</div>
<div>The screen that gave me that code also told me to look at the Microsoft support centre, but I could not see there anywhere that it was asking me to to supply an error code.</div>
<div>I was then directed to install an update to fix the problem whereupon it told me my computer "can not run Windows 10" - which is
<div>I went to "fix issues" in the "Settings", and it told me it "couldn't update the system reserved partition". I did load an app called "MiniTool Partition Wizard", but it didn't seem to help.</div>
<div>So that is where I am up to - running Windows 10 home, version 1511, OS build no 10586.1176 (which I "can't" be doing!!) with 8Gb of RAM, 768 Gb of free disk space - and no more recent update to WIndows 10.
 I have been allowing all the usual occasional updates, which have all gone smoothly.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I tried to send the above in an email (replying to the email I was sent) I was told that it could not be delivered because the remote server was "misconfigured"!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So no further forward, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error indicates that the device on which the update is being applied doesn’t meet the minimum requirements for the update to be installed. This could mean that the CPU speed or available RAM or free disk space aren’t good enough for the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>System partition is a space on the hard disk that is always kept free for moving files during installations. In some cases, the system partition can become full of old log files, but the update can’t clean it because it doesn’t have enough system permissions
 to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To increase the size of the system partition, we suggest that you use Disk Management. Disk Management has the ability to shrink volume and extend volume. In the Disk Management screen, just right-click on the system partition that you want to extend, and
 select <strong>Extend Volume</strong> from the menu. Then specify the amount that you want to increase the partition size. Using Disk Management to extend Windows 10 system partition, there must be contiguous space behind Windows 10 system partition, otherwise,
 you cannot extend system partition. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out. </p>

            When I click on any of the partitions shown, I get either just "Help" or a number of greyed-out options, one of which is "Extend partition". And which one is the system partition? It doesn't call it that on that screen. And, they all say they have 100%
 free space bar one, the main C drive, which is 83% free.

<p>You should see a partition titled System Reserved. It really need to be 500MB otherwise it may be too small for windows to update to the latest version.</p>
<p>Can you provide a screenshot of Disk Management.?</p>
