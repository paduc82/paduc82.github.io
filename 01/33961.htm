            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you are able to access only run command.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let‚Äôs try the simple troubleshooting steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue. Follow the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 1: </span><span>Let us run System Maintenance troubleshooter which helps to find and clean up unused files, shortcuts, and perform maintenance tasks.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and&nbsp;R&nbsp;key together and type&nbsp;Control and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on&nbsp;Troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on&nbsp;View all option&nbsp;on the left side of the Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on&nbsp;System Maintenance&nbsp;option.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click on&nbsp;Next&nbsp;and follow the onscreen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 2: I suggest you to perform clean boot and check if it helps to resolve the issue. Clean boot process will help you determine which third party program/app that is causing this issue. It could be some other application or programs, which runs
 on the computer at the background, leading to this issue. Please visit the below link on how to perform Clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let‚Äôs boot the computer into clean boot state through the run command, </span>
</p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press ‚ÄúWindows key + R‚Äù to open run command.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Now type ‚Äúmsconfig‚Äù without quotes and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Now once you open msconfig, follow the below article to boot the computer into clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: The above link also applies to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above method does not fix the issue try the below provided steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 3: </span><span>If a computer is infected by a virus, lots of resources will be taken up to greatly slow down computer performance. I suggest you to run virus scan (Microsoft Safety Scanner) and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note</strong>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p><span>When in clean boot make sure that you have&nbsp;all the Updates installed&nbsp;on your computer successfully. Follow the steps given below to install all the updates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;Press&nbsp;Windows Key.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;Select&nbsp;Settings, Click on&nbsp;Change PC settings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;Update and security&nbsp;and click&nbsp;Check now.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;Follow the prompts to&nbsp;install all&nbsp;recommended and optional&nbsp;updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Creators Update Hangs on Reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmdervin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creators Update Hangs on Reboot</h2>
                    I have 3 nearly identical Lenovo laptops, two with Windows 10 Home and the third with Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; The two with Windows 10 Home successfully upgraded to the Creators updates without problem.&nbsp; The laptop with Windows 10 Pro has failed to upgrade to
 either Creators update, and has failed the same way on every attempt.&nbsp; On the reboot after the update, the system hangs showing a screen with a blue Windows logo and a processing circle (not a blank screen so presumably the video adapter driver is not the
 problem).&nbsp; In that state I periodically see the disk access LED blink. &nbsp; I've left the system in that state for days, and it never gets out of it.&nbsp; Thankfully, when I power off, the system always successfully reverts to the Windows 10 Anniversary update installed
 previously.&nbsp; I have tried everything I have read in various forums (disabling all malware, uinstalling all third party applications, disconnecting all peripherals, disconnecting the ethernet connection before the reboot, disabling the WIFI adapter), and the
 result is always the same.&nbsp; I have even tried to perform the update from a USB flash drive created using the Window Media Creation Tool, but had the same result.&nbsp; Does anyone have any thoughts of what I might try next.<br />

            You have one of a few options to consider here:
<br />
<br />Option 1: 
<br />
<br />Backup and perform a clean install - you have exhausted everything thats reasonably possible. Sometimes, your system has some unknown underlying issue that creates a blocker for upgrades. Save yourself: time, frustration and just perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />Yes, its a chore, but this man made stuff and it ain't perfect and it will never be. 
<br />
<br />Its better for you to have your data and go through the annoying convenience of reinstalling apps and drivers. 
<br />
<br />Backup:

<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2: Don't bother with the upgrade.
<br />
<br />My recommendation to users going forward is not to pounce on every new Windows 10 Feature Update that is released. If your system has been working just fine with the current version, wait it out a while or skip it all together. If there is some specific feature in the update you want, then thats an exception, but these feature updates are becoming more difficult to install on older devices; and it sometimes makes you wonder if the inconvenience is worth the hassle just to keep doing the same thing. 
<br />
<br />If you look at whats considered the flagship features of Windows 10 1709, they are aimed at newer generation devices like the new Surface Book 2. Otherwise welcome features like Story Remix, which you have to upgrade to 1709 to get, could be supplanted with third party alternatives. 
<br />

<br />
<br />Option 3: upgrade to another release such as Windows 10 1703 
<br />

            I attempted a "clean" install of Windows 10 1709 by running setup from the thumb drive I created using the Windows Media Creation Tool and selecting preserve my personal data only.&nbsp; Unfortunately the same problem occurred;&nbsp; the system hung on the first
 reboot.&nbsp; I'm reluctant to try an install that preserves nothing because it seems unlikely it will change the result, and then I will have to restore all my data in addition to reinstalling all my third party apps.&nbsp; At this point I think I'm forced to not bother
 with upgrade on that particular system&nbsp; It is frustrating since that upgrade worked on all the other&nbsp; Windows based systems in my household, and I really prefer all the systems be running the same version of the operating system.<br />

<p>I finally worked up the courage to do a truly clean install.&nbsp; I did it with the 1703 bootable flash drive I had created earlier.&nbsp; That install did work, and it also successfully updated to 1709 afterwards.&nbsp; Now I just have to restore all my data and apps.&nbsp;
 With luck this system won't cause any more problems with future upgrades.</p>

    <title>Managing payment options - status code 83820070 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Managing payment options - status code 83820070</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Everytime I try to edit or change the payment options when I access my account over&nbsp;live.xbox.com, I cant save the new credit card or add a paypal account, ti keeps saying to try later.</p>
<p>When I try to to the same thing using my xbox 360, I get the error status code 83820070, and sometimes it says my account got suspended and that I must update my payment options... but when I try to update, it gives me the error 83820070.</p>

<p>Is there any solution for this? I want to become a gold xbox live member and I am not able...</p>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Hey Andrefil, I'm afraid that if you're not able to change any payment options on the website or on your console, you'll need to call our billing experts at phone support for more information. Please let me know if you need the number! :-)

<p>I already did, called twice, spoke with so many xbox support members on the webpage (chat) and they didnt find or solve my problem... do I really need to create a new account just because of this? I am not really in the mood to create another "hotmail" or
 "live" email account and start all over again...</p>
<p>83820070...</p>
<p>If I knew I would have ths kind of "bugs" when I would like to play online, I would keep playing on my PS on the PSN, even if not perfect, I could actually play my games online..., and for free... with my actual and old email.</p>
<p>I gave up already. Thank you for your answer and support. :)</p>

<p>Hey there Andre, thanks for the reply. I'm sorry you've had to spend so much time working on this already. Did you change your GT or WLID before this issue happened? Were you ever able to add or edit payment methods? When was the last time you were able
 to do that?<br />
<br />
Regarding the instruction to create another account, was this something that one of the phone agents told you to do? Did they mean to create a new GT or just a new WLID for this account? Please let us know, thanks!</p>

<p>The same thing is happening to me. It says I have to update my payment options. Mine was because the card it was on got cancelled. we put a new one in and it said to wait. I waited for like a month. Nothing happened. Now every time i turn on my 360 it says
 i need to update it. When I sign into my accou8nt online it says I've found a glitch in the system. When i click on payment options it says you've found a glitch in the system. So now the new card won't transfer my account on there and I can't play. And I
 put in a new card. I have the same problem you guys do. I think whatever microsoft uses to suspend, activate, accept payment options, and etc is broken. It even says the site has a glitch, and here's the code for it: 25012B220523785</p>
<p>and here's the code for when I try to go to manage payment options: 25012B25368BEB6</p>
<p>so we don't have the problem, microsoft does. I don't own a PS3 so this is the only way for me to play online with a console game. Right now all i have is steam games to play online. MICROSOFT FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>i am very sad right now</p>

<p>That file is a trojan and your computer is infected. Fixing this depends on whether you can get into Safe Mode and the level of your computer skills. If you can get into Safe Mode, go through the very thorough malware scanning steps described at the link
 below. If you can't get into Safe Mode, then from the same diagnostic menu try Last Known Good Configuration. If you can't do that, then you can try booting/scanning with one of the antivirus rescue CDs or pull the hard drive and scan it from a working XP
 machine.</p>

<p>Hello Malkeleah,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your advice. I can get into safe mode but cannot get beyond the same&nbsp;blank desk top which appears after the user log in screen. I get the same error message described above, so I can't get to the start button to &nbsp;run any of the anti-malware
 programmes you mentioned. I tried the LaST Known Good Configuration but arrived at the same point of impasse.&nbsp;I burned the Avira and Bit Defender Rescue CDs but they won't run from safe drive if I ask the PC to boot from CD. Am I perhaps doing something wrong.
 I could open Task Manager but don't really know what I am looking for as I'm no PC expert- just an average end user. I wondered about System Restore but can't get to it. Any further guidance appreciated- otherwise it's an expensive trip to a computer shop.
 Can I buy a rescue CD that might do the trick?</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Andy</p>

<p>You need to boot the computer from the antivirus rescue CD, not be in Safe Mode. Leave the CD-R in your optical drive and restart your computer. When you restart the computer you will see messages:<br />
<br />
1. Possibly a message that says something like "Press F12 for temporary boot menu". If you have this message, press that function key. Use your arrow key to select the CD/DVD drive and the computer will boot from the rescue CD you made.<br />
<br />
2. If you don't see a message about a boot menu you will need to go into the BIOS to change the boot order. This message will say something like "Press F2 to enter Setup". Press that function key and you will enter the BIOS. Find the section about boot and
 change the boot order to CD/DVD drive first, hard drive second. Save your changes and exit Setup. The computer will boot from the rescue CD you made.</p>
<p>If that doesn't do the trick, you will need to either back up your data (see below for how to do this when you can't get into Windows) and do a clean install/factory restore of Windows or take the machine to a reputable local professional. Don't use a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad
 type of place.</p>
<p>1. Pull the drive and put it in a USB drive enclosure or use a USB drive adapter. Attach this to a computer running a working install of XP/Vista/Windows7. Use the working Windows Explorer to copy the data to the rescue system's hard drive and then burn
 the data to cd or dvd or copy it to an external hard drive. I prefer not to do this if I know the drive is infected because there is a chance of infecting the host system. In these cases, I use #2 below.<br />
<br />
2. You can boot the target computer with a Bart's PE (XP only) or a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix or Ubuntu and retrieve the data that way. Here is general information on using Knoppix for data retrieval when you can't get into Windows:<br />
<br />
You will need a computer with two cd drives, one of which is a CD/DVD burner <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> a USB thumb drive with enough capacity to hold your data <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> an external USB hard drive. Download the Knoppix .iso and create your bootable CD*. If you are doing this in an older operating system (XP or Vista), you'll need third-party burning software like Nero, Roxio, or the free
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a> (Windows 7 can burn .isos natively). Burn as an image, not as data. Then boot with the CD you created and Knoppix will be able to see the Windows files. If you are using the USB thumb drive or the external hard
 drive, right-click on its icon (on the Desktop) to get its properties and uncheck the box that says "Read Only". Then click on it to open it. Note that the default mouse action in the window manager used by Knoppix (KDE) is a single click to open instead of
 the traditional MS Windows' double-click. If you want to burn CD/DVDs, use the K3b program.<br />
<br />
*If your computer only has one optical drive and you want to use that drive to burn data or need to test the drive, you can create a bootable USB thumb drive running Linux instead of a bootable CD. This website will show you how to do that -

    <title>Can the color contrast on the Windows Live Mail 2012 be increased&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frustrated_687  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can the color contrast on the Windows Live Mail 2012 be increased&#63;</h2>
                    I have searched through responses to questions similar to the above and everyone seems to go off on a track of changing the font and other modifications to the Emails.&nbsp; That totally misses the point!&nbsp; There are those of us who are "more mature" who don't
 have the eyesight of a 25 year old and find that the highlighting of the individual Email subject could be improved somewhat, but the real issue comes when one is dragging an Email to a sub - folder in the left hand panel.&nbsp; The highlighting in that area is
 so poor that one almost has to have their nose against the screen to be sure which sub - folder has been selected.&nbsp; During my many years of use of OE and Thunderbird, I have never encountered this problem.&nbsp; So, the real question is whether there is a mechanism
 in the Windows Live Mail 2012 Program running on a Windows 7 Professional platform where the highlighting/contrast can be adjusted to make the viewing screen easier to use?

<p><br />
Short answer - no. This has been a recurring complaint for years, but all development on the program ended more or less in 2010.<br />
<br />
You may find that Windows High Contrast display settings help. If you do find a combination of settings that suits, you could use the keyboard shortcut to turn HC on and off as needed. Type
<strong>high contrast</strong> into the start search box to find where to configure HC.<br />
<br />
As regards not being able to spot the active folder in the folder pane, you could instead use right-click &gt;
<em>Move to folder </em>to be able positively to select the right destination folder.</p>

    <title>SCAN fails to &#34;scan to scale&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mg116  say:</h3>
<h2>            SCAN fails to &#34;scan to scale&#34;</h2>
                    <p>ISSUE: How can I scan an 8.5x11 paper document and convert it to pdf without blowing it up to 23x32.5??</p>
<p>
</p><p>BACKGROUND: When I open my pdf files after using the SCAN app for windows 8.1, acrobat reader says that when I go to print the file that it has had to shrink the file by 33% in order to print it.&nbsp; When I select "Actual size" it tells me that the document
 is 23.0 x 32.5in.&nbsp; My scanner is not equipped to handle documents of that size.&nbsp; In the SCAN app I chose the following: Scanner: HP 7020, Source: Feeder, File Type: PDF, Color Mode: Black and White, DPI: 200(Default), Page size: Letter.</p>
<p>I have attempted multiple file types (TIF, XPS, OXPS) and they are all converted into enormous sizes.&nbsp; I have also used the feeder and the flatbed.</p>
<p>How can I scan an 8.5x11 paper document and convert it to pdf without blowing it up to 23x32.5??</p>
<p>
</p><p>EQUIPMENT: </p>
<p>OS - WIN 8.1 64-bit</p>
<p>Scanner - Brother DCP-7020 (connected via USB)</p>
<p>Motherboard - MSI 970A</p>
<p>CPU - AMD FX 8320</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!</p>

            Hi Robert.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unfortunately Video Editor like many features in Windows 10 is not  fully reliable.  You can reset the Photos app in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br />

    <title>Flatron L192ws monitor on Dell Dimension - I can no longer set high - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blondiecapped  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flatron L192ws monitor on Dell Dimension - I can no longer set high resoltuions past 1024 X 768 once upgraded to Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a Dell Dimension 4600 with an LG Flatron L192WS monitor - 19 inch widescreen.&nbsp; Under XP, the graphics/videos/DVDs all looked fantastic and I've never had any issues.&nbsp; Yesterday, I upgraded to Windows 7 and now I can't select anything larger than
 1024 X 768 and all graphics look horrible.<br />
<br />
I've reinstalled the display drivers and the LG192WS driver with no change in symptoms.&nbsp; At one point I did get an error message saying that my video card does not support Directx, but since the video card hasn't changed and the monitor was working with XP
 just fine, I'm having a hard time believing that my video card is the issue.<br />
<br />
Is there any other solutions other than buying a new video&nbsp;card?

<h3> mrjcjones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where are windows 10 reset files&#63; What happens to the original recovery partition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I factory reset my desktop to windows 7.&nbsp; Some weeks later I accepted the update to windows 10 home edition.</p>
<p>1. If I need to refresh/reset my pc to clean up windows 10,&nbsp; where are the windows 10 files that do this?</p>
<p>2. Is the manufacturer's (Dell) recovery partition now redundant?</p>
<p>3. Can this partition be safely removed and the space added to the usable C drive?</p>
<p>

                    I've linked my Yahoo Mail account to Windows Mail App. Last night I did activated "Two steps" verification i.e. Text SMS before login. Now my yahoo account giving me an error; Fix Account or Dismiss. I do enter my password but because of two steps verification

            <p>No your information didn't help.</p>
<p>There is no error. This is because of Yahoo's two steps verification. Please read what I asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can link Yahoo account when two steps verification is NOT on. When two steps verification is on Yahoo supposed to send me a code via SMS which I've to enter to proceed further. But this Mail App is, I think, lack of this feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't receive any SMS. I don't receive any field to enter code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not about Microsoft account. This is about Linking Yahoo Account to Mail App when 2 steps verification is on.</p>

            <p>usually you'll receive a sms to your phone which will give you the password or key to enter into the account as normal.</p>
<p>Sometimes with 2-step verification there's a way to create an app specific password which you enter instead of the normal account password.</p>

<p>Are you in Windows 10 Preview Insiders Program? If you are, that file can be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ESD is for electronic software delivery. Microsoft uses it to deliver OS install files to pc from internet connection. It is compressed file. It can be converted to ISO file. Windows users can use ISO files loaded on DVD/USB to install OS.</p>

            <p>I think Windows will automatically delete it after a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reference to what Jmarco0921 , the C:\ESD\Windows\Sources\install.ESD file (I think) can be used for creating a bootable USB so I copied it elsewhere for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am migrating my Windows 10 to a new SSD and I think I can use USB memory to boot Windows to swap the drive letters. If so then that will make migration to SSD easier than any other method I have seen.</p>

            <p>I want to go back to 7.&nbsp; 10&nbsp; boots really slow, has added a TIME screen that does nothing, it goes to sleep for 10-20 sec then wakes up, etc. It does have a faster response when working.</p>
<p>I will come back to 10 when and if Microsoft fixes more bugs. I use my PC for lots more than an email processor.</p>
<p>So went looking for how to go back.&nbsp; I found they deleted by WINDOWS.OLD so cant go back that way, but found the ESD that looks like Windows 10, is it?</p>
<p>And if is, HOW do I burn&nbsp; it to a DVD or FLASH drive so when I am ready, I can use it to give me the STARTER for Windows 10.</p>
<p>And, anyone know how to DISABLE THEY KEYBOARD IN WINDOWS FROM SHORTCUTS? </p>
<p>I spent about 5 minutes typing this only to hit the WRONG KEY and it ERASED all the text. When creating text, these shortcuts are a real problem.
</p>
<p>WE should not have to create a NOTEPAD to type text and then CUT and PASTE because Microsoft will not allow us to disengage the shortcuts on the keyboards permanently or temporary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I have this file as well on a Desktop&nbsp;PC upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; However this file does not exist on the Laptop&nbsp;PC I performed a clean install on?</p>
<p>Why wouldn't it be required on the clean install PC as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted it thru Disk Cleanup.&nbsp; If I encounter problems on the Desktop&nbsp;PC (for whatever reason, nothing to do with deleting this file)&nbsp;I will just perform a clean install instead of messing around with Refresh or Reset.</p>

            <p>365You need to keep only if you do not want to go back to Windows 7/8, then go back to 10 AFTER they FIX all the ERRORS it has.&nbsp; I burned mine to DVD before going back to 7 (had to, 10 hung up on a disk retrieval ever 110 secs) as Windows 7 does/did not
 hang.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is that the same as saying "you don't need to keep it if you do&nbsp;want to go back to Windows 7/8"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you are referencing the <strong><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">C:\$Windows.~BT</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>C:\Windows.old</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>folders.&nbsp;
 C:\Windows.old can be safely deleted after the upgrade to Windows 10 if you don't plan on going back to a previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>C:\$Windows.~BT is where Windows 10 is installed from when you upgraded to a new build.</span></p>
<p><span>Both of these can also be deleted thru Disk Cleanup.</span></p>

 in this community.</p>

<h2>            connection to nintendo wii&#47; error code 51330</h2>
                    Hi<br />
I cannot seem to connect&nbsp;my nintendo wii to the internet from my tv, however much i try... I am trying every password and code that I know, looking up all wireless connection help topics. i have tried my administrater password, key code etc, still no joy. I
 am wondering if it wants the original keycode as I have exhusted my lot of passwords I know. How do I bypass this, or find out the correct key or password needed? It only gives my one access point, which is my protected account name, and then wants&nbsp;an WPA-PSK
 (TKIP) password/key. Yes I have looked this up to, knowing what it is now, still can not find anything which it will except....frustraiting. :/<br />
Hope you can help<br />
I currently have a year old lap top on windows vista and a wireless rooter via virgin media<br />
thanks<br />
Lianne

<p>The site you recommened was useful, as it was a wireless connecting problem. At the back of my wireless rooter, is a default password and http:// address. when i typed this&nbsp;address into my http:// bar at top of my computer, it directed me to my personal
 wireless rooter webpage. There I typed in&nbsp;the default&nbsp;password and it came up with&nbsp;the tech&nbsp;details,&nbsp;which had the key password which I was looking for. This key password was all in ****** , so&nbsp;I thought, I still don't know it!!&nbsp;I deleated the ***** &nbsp;and&nbsp;typed
 a&nbsp;new,&nbsp;fresh pass word,&nbsp;then clicked enter.&nbsp;It told me that it was&nbsp;applying new settings so I tried it on the nintendo wii. It worked!!<br />
Hope this may help someone else.<br />
Thanks&nbsp;again<br />
Blessings<br />
Lianne :)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface and Skype</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Skype on my Microsoft surface tablet for a few years, why now will it not work. I uninstalled and now it will not allow it to be reinstalled. It says the app cannot run on my pc which seems wrong since it was already on it previously. How
 do I get Skype to work on my surface? </p>

</p><p>If you are using Surface with Windows RT then unfortunately the reason why you can't run Skype on it again is because it is no longer supported for your device version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to use Skype for Web instead&nbsp;on your device. The supported browsers are the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 10 and higher, latest versions of Chrome and Firefox,&nbsp;Safari 6 and higher.&nbsp;</li></ul>
