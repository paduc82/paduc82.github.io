<p>
</p><p>Are you unable to install a particular update or all the updates?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Using Explorer, if you take a look in c:\documents and setings\shancey\application data, do you see the file called crobco.dll or do you not see it?<br />
<br />
Since it does not get any hits that make sense in a Google search, that makes it suspicious.<br />
<br />
I would use Autoruns to locate and Disable the startup item.&nbsp; Disabling a startup item does not delete or uninstall anything - it just disables it.<br />
<br />
Reboot and see how things look.<br />
<br />
Run for a while until you are comfortable that all your stuff works without it, then you can use Autoruns to delete the offending startup entry.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
<br />
<div>
<div><span><span>
<div>It is sometimes easy to get rid of the error message by doing something like disabling the startup item in msconfig (if you can&nbsp;even find it), but I suggest you fix the problem and not just fix the symptom of the problem by merely eliminating the&nbsp;startup
 message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would also not recommend that you start poking around in the registry to try and find the startup item and remove it unless you have a backup of your system or at least a backup of your registry since there is no&nbsp;"undo" or "quit without saving" option
 in regedit. &nbsp;If you make a mistake, that's it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Those ideas offer "quick" and sometimes risky relief of the symptom if they even work at all, but they may not actually fix the problem. &nbsp;I would&nbsp;also be wary of ideas that begin with the words "try". &nbsp;You do not need to try things, you need to fix things.
 &nbsp;You don't need to try ideas that might work, you need to do something that is always going to work all the time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here are comprehensive instructions that will keep you safe and resolve your issue the "right" way.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are very few .DLL files that should be loaded from the C:\WINDOWS folder and that is not one of them.&nbsp; If you can't find a good explanation for the file name in a Google search, chances are good that your system is now or has been infected with malicious
 software.<br />
</span></span></div>
<div><br />
<div>A "Cannot find...", "Cannot start..., "Cannot load...". "Could not run..." Cannot run" "Error loading..." or&nbsp;"specific module could not be found" message at startup is usually related to malware that was set to run at startup but&nbsp;the referenced file(s)
 has been deleted after a malware scan leaving behind a registry entry or startup item pointing to a file&nbsp;that does not exist. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It could be from a malicious software removal or an uninstalled application. &nbsp;The entry may have a curious&nbsp;looking name since it was probably generated at random when the malware was installed. If you search your system for the referenced file,&nbsp;you may
 not even find it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows is trying to load this file but cannot locate it since the file was mostly likely removed during a scan&nbsp;for malicious software. However, an associated orphaned startup parameter or registry entry remains and is telling&nbsp;Windows to load the file
 when you boot up or login.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You need to remove the referenced entry so Windows stops trying to load or run the file. It may or may not be&nbsp;in the registry but you can find it. &nbsp;Autoruns (see below) will find the item no matter where it is.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You need to be sure to fix the problem and not just fix the symptom of the problem by simply relieving your system of the displaying message - that is not a fix (there is a difference).<br />
<div><br />
<div>If you just locate and uncheck the item in msconfig, that disables the item but does not remove the reference to&nbsp;the bogus startup item from your computer. &nbsp; The msconfig program is not a startup manager, it is a troubleshooting&nbsp;tool. &nbsp;Disabling things
 in msconfig to put a stop to the messages and thinking your problem is resolved is short&nbsp;sighted and leaves behind a sloppy XP configuration. &nbsp;Merely disabling the display of a startup error message should&nbsp;not count as a "solution" to the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are comfortable editing the registry you can search for and remove the reference directly from there or remove&nbsp;it using a popular third party tool called Autoruns. &nbsp;The problem may not always be found in the registry though.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Before making any changes to your registry by hand or with third party tools, be sure to make a backup of the registry&nbsp;first. There is no undo or quit without saving option in regedit.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is a link to a popular registry backup tool:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>You can also use Autoruns to find the leftover startup item no matter where it is hiding. &nbsp;Autoruns does not install anything&nbsp;on your computer. &nbsp;It will display all of the startup locations where the reference might be so you can disable it or&nbsp;delete it
 completely. &nbsp;Here is the download link for Autoruns:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Launch Autoruns.exe and wait for it to finish populating the list of entries.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When Autoruns is finished scanning your system, it will say "Ready" at the bottom left corner. &nbsp;Autoruns can be a&nbsp;little intimidating at first if you have never see it before since it displays a lot of information. &nbsp;You are really&nbsp;only interested in a
 couple sections.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem item is usually in the system startup or user startup entries so click the Logon tab&nbsp;and see if the startup item is there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Scroll through the list and look for a startup entry related to the file(s) in the error message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you don't find it in the Logon tab, look for it in the Everything tab.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can also click File, Find to search the Logon or Everything tab for all or part of the name of the item.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Right-click on the offending entry and choose to delete it. &nbsp;If you are not sure what it is, you can just disable it (uncheck the entry),&nbsp;reboot and if the issue is resolved and things are running normally and everything is working okay, then delete the
 offending entry. &nbsp;If you don't see it in Autoruns you may have to edit the registry and remove the item from the Startup folder there. &nbsp;Autoruns should display the same&nbsp;information though.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since your system has or has had an infection, follow up with this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:</div>
<div><br />
No matter what else you are using for malicious software protection, do this:<br />
<br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a quick scan (not at the same time) with these free malware detection programs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<div>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
SAS will probably just report a bunch of Internet tracking cookies, but you can delete those.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You can do the quick scans in the future to save time and save the full scans for when you have more time or are really suspicious of a system infection.<br />
<br />
<div>They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
In 1985, there were 11 known computer viruses.&nbsp; Today, there are more than1,122,311 and new threats are detected every day.&nbsp; Always update your virus definitions before performing a scan.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Reboot your computer and troubleshoot remaining issues.</div>

 sigue igual. Por lo que me da la sensación de que tengo una latecía alta con los servidores de xbox live. Juego bf v y a veces me muestra lagueado, lo mismo con rocket league.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alguien me puede ayudar con alguna dirección a donde le pueda hacer ping al menos para saberlo.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's see what these procedures tell us, if anything.&nbsp; Everything suggestted here can be done from the disk (as I know you
 can't boot normally or into any safe mode option).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Keep me informed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

<p>I've seen SFC fail before and I've seen it freeze up, but I've never had it refuse to start the repair service before.&nbsp; This is probably another symptom of the overall problem.&nbsp; That removes a valuable tool because we might have been able to determine if
 system file corruption (hot alll system files, but a lot of them) was the issue and which files were involved.</p>
<p>We've now tried every option available from the disk, can't boot into any safe mode, and can't boot nornally.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only solution I see at present is a clean install of Vista.&nbsp; The only other option is to take it into a reputable computer repair shop for
 diagnosis, repair, and/or replacement.&nbsp; They will probably wipe your hard drive during their troubleshooting so make sure you backup your data before taking it in (if that's what you decide to do).&nbsp; If a backup is possible, the proc</p>
<p><span>You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way and it seems you can't) to backup your important data (if even this process works - but if you want to save your data this is the only way I&nbsp; know how to
 do it at this stage).&nbsp; If it doesn't work, we may have another option depending on how you do the re-installation (if you have a choice).&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or
 the Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 140 updates pending,...</span></p>

            well i just answered my own question...replacing that file made no difference either way, sfc /scannow still does not work, chkdsk /f/r still calls it an orphaned file along with wups2.dll which i also replaced, windows still does not boot into any mode,
 and start up repair still finds no problems thats what it says found no problems

<p>Just because chkdsk found and reported two corrupt files doesn't mean that's all that's corrupt.&nbsp; That's why I so wanted to run the SFC which is more specific for corrupted system files (though even it doesn't check all the system files).&nbsp; And actualy it
 looks like you have at least two files because there is also that .dll file.&nbsp; Incidentally, that exe file is associated with the WMi reporting system and I've read instructions on how to remove it from the system - so it seems unlikely that it would be the
 cause of this problem (but I don't know for sure - so I have to admit it is possible).</p>
<p>But to answer your question directly, it can be done if you have a <strong>genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk of the same bit-size as that on your system</strong> &nbsp;(it will not work with an OEM Installation Disk or a manufacturer's Recovery Disk).&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/261616-extract-files-vista-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/261616-extract-files-vista-installation-dvd.html</a>.</p>
<p>Usually when there is corruption, there are lots of files affected - it isn't only one or two (though that is certainly possible).&nbsp; I'm just saying that while you can certainly give this a try, I'm not at all sure that it will fully resolve the problem because
 I honestly believe there is more corruption than just those two files.&nbsp; Most corruption identified by SFC never even shows up in CHkDSK even though they are run back to back in the process.&nbsp; In fact, this is one of the few times I've seen CHKDSK even identify
 specific files - normally it only provides a general summary.</p>
<p>The choice is yours.&nbsp; I suppose given the alternative, it's worth a shot.&nbsp; Maybe replacing these two files will at least get SFC to work and then we can really learn more about the status of the system files.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good lluck!</p>

<p>I;m sorry to hear that.&nbsp; We are again back at the point where we have no options left to try.&nbsp; We know (suspect strongly) there is file corruption (or perhaps malware) but cannot locate it because we essentially have no access to the system and what little
 we do have isn't going to be able to help us resolve this problem because it is too limited.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but you have to decide between a clean install (as explained above) or taking it in to a computer repair shop for service.&nbsp; I personally would do the clean install as it doesn't cost any money.&nbsp; I don't know if you'll be able to salvage your data
 but I hope so (and that would be an issue with a computer repair shop as well so it isn't like your choosing whether or not to protect your data because as i said they will probably wipe the drive clean when they are doing their work so you're in the same
 boat in that regard).&nbsp; Further, we don't even know if a clean install is going to work&nbsp;- so it's probably best to check that out first.&nbsp; We can always bring it to a computer repair shop later if even that doesn't work.</p>
<p>I wish there were other options or things to try but there just aren't.&nbsp; You can't install the entire OS from the disk like you did the individual files because there are entries you can't just move over and that need to be created and modified during&nbsp; the
 installation (like the registry as a prime example).</p>
<p>It's time to stop&nbsp; searching for alternatives and choose one of the only two you really have remaining.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            Hi Jon Gregory, this is an input language problem . . .
<br />
<br />If on your Keyboard the @ symbol is above the 2, then you have a US English keyboard, 
<br />
<br />If the " is above the 2 then you have a UK English keyboard
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel, go to Language
<br />
<br />Click 'Options' on the right hand side of your current language
<br />
<br />If the appropriate language (UK or US English) is not listed, click 'Add an Input method'
<br />
<br />Add the required language
<br />
<br />Then make that the default language and remove any other languages not required
<br />
<br />Restart your PC       
        </p>

<h2>            Turn on wifi for Lenovo tower&#63;</h2>
                    I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or if I need to buy a wireless router. We just bought a Lenovo H50 Series tower for out desktop. I was asking the man if it had its own wireless connection and he said yes. He said that I would see a wireless symbol
 at the bottom right hand corner. The desktop is set up and everything but I have no clue how to connect to the wifi. How can I change that? Also, I'm sorry if this is in the wrong category!

 file.&nbsp; Is there any other way to trim a video without buying a video editing app or program?&nbsp; Why does it have the trim option if I can't use it to trim my own video?&nbsp; Thanks for any help!

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you would like to trim a video that you’ve uploaded on your PC running Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to know a few information:</p>
<p>1) Does the issue occur only with .mov file?</p>
<p>2) What happens if you try to edit different video format file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>You may get permission issue if media file is copyrighted or if the folder where you have stored the video doesn't have full permission.
<p>
</p><p>Also, I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right-click on the file or folder and go to
<strong>Properties</strong> Windows. Under Properties click on “<strong>Security</strong>” Tab.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>click on “<strong>Advanced</strong>”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Next, in the windows that appears, you have to click on “Change” and enter the object name.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type Everyone and click Ok</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on “<strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and object</strong>” and click
<strong>Apply</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Next again&nbsp;click on
<strong>Advanced</strong>.Now under the Advanced permissions, you will see a change and you will see the option to add Multiple Objects. To add multiple object and to inherit permission you can click on “<strong>Change</strong>
<strong>Permissions</strong>”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>inherit permissions, click on “<strong>Enable inheritance</strong>”. To add a new object click on “<strong>Add</strong>” and click on “Select a Principal” and type Everyone.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click Apply and OK.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run App Troubleshooter from the link mentioned below:</p>

                    <p>The updated was in process -- had arrived at the point where you restart the PC -- when the PC restarted it says that there is a problem and needs to restart .. bad pool header -- it restarts and we have been going around and around with this for hours now!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want my PC back PLEASE!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are videos on YT to show how to repair this BUT that can't be done since the forced restart takes over within seconds!?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>10:46p - Well made the Windows 10 USB so could reinstall on the PC but guess what -- if I can't get it to stay open I won't be able to open the USB for installing!?!?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forced updates .. forced restart .. is there anything such as a forced repair?

<p>I just want Windows to give me my PC back so I can get back to work!&nbsp;</p>
<p>It won't stay on long enough for me to get to do a system restore -- it goes into another restart!?!?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi See if you can get into the Advanced Startup mode!</p>
<p><a href="http://pureinfotech.com/access-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-troubleshoot-fix-pc/#advanced_startup_automatic_repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pureinfotech.com/access-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-troubleshoot-fix-pc/#advanced_startup_automatic_repair</a></p>
<p>
If your PC isn’t loading Windows 10 and you don’t have the operating system installation files, you can use the following trick.
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Start your computer and follow the POST, when Windows should begin loading, press the power button to shutdown your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Repeat the previous step twice, and in the third restart the operating system should enter into the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), where a number of diagnostics will be performed to try fix any booting issues, but you will also get an option
 to access the Windows Startup Settings</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Hi If you're not able to get into the Advanced Startup with the on-off trick I posted, you can create a media creation tool. Always good to have a USB flash with W10 media on it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>Once you get your PC back up and running, I suggest you see this link and create media thay allows you to repair your PC.</p>

<p>Awesome! I am disabled .. sit here at my PC ..actually PC's.. and just pass my day trying to chat with this one and the other. My main PC, the one I am writing from, went through the update a few days ago .. no problem. The other happened this morning and
 didn't complete. I only use it for news and NetFlix in the evenings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway .. if I can get someone with better abilities to understand more than the on and off switch, maybe I can make that USB from number one here and pass it to number two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concern or question .. will I lose what I have on number one?¿?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Achievements not popping up</h2>
                    
<p>Hey&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not a big issue but an annoying one nevertheless. Whenever I unlock an achievement it is not popping up on screen like it used to, the achievements unlock okay but doesn't display it at the time and I don't know I have it unless I actually go and look, how
 can I fix this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the same problem, and I have my notifications turned on. I have turned them off, restarted console, and turned them back on again, yet still no pop. The achievements ARE however popping in time on my linked Windows 10 PC. Confusing and annoying.</p>

<p>Achievements on Xbox One are broken and Microsoft needs to fix it. I agree it's super annoying because I have the same issue. Any achievements I unlock rarely ever pop the notification on screen. I have notifications turned on, signed into Live, hard reset,
 all other "solutions" I've read online. &nbsp;Nothing works. I know the achievement unlocks because it shows up instantly in Smartglass or in achievements hub. It's the notification that's broken.</p>

<p>Had this myself &amp; a hard reset seems to have sorted it.</p>
<p>Hold the power button on the front of your console until it turns off.Unplug from the mains for 5 minutes then plug back in &amp; restart your console.</p>
<p>It may not sort out the issue for you but that's what worked for me so worth a try.</p>

<p>The most recent patch fixed the game breaking glitch many of us have been stuck with for months now, some since release. Just turn your game on and accept the patch and presto. I'm posting this here so any people who don't check the ME3 forum/Bioware tech
 section know they can now play their game again. A big thank you to Arkham99 for giving me a heads up about this, you don't know how much I appreciate you right now ;)</p>

 be.</strong></em><em><strong> Thanks in advance for being cool.</strong></em></span></p>

<p>It's corrupt profile files caused by EA/Biowares verification system that runs invisibly at certain points during gameplay. It makes the game freeze at start up. There's a 115 page support topic about it on biowares site, started 7 months ago. You only hear
 me talking about it because I am very outspoken about it and you don't read the ME3 subforum.</p>

<p>[quote user="LostKauz"]Well I've had some weird things with EA but I would have never waited till an Update came out. Most of the time I could get the problem resolved by contacting EA Support.[/quote]There was nothing EA support could do about the problem
 as the fix requires the modification of system files.<br />
<br />
There was a fan fix for the problem but as we know Microsoft don't like people to do that and so playing Mass Effect 3 wasn't worth risking a ban for most people with the issue.<br />
<br />
So folk like Unyobro had no choice but to wait for the official fix.<br />
<br />
Also Unyobro for the love of all that is holy, download the Extended Cut before reaching the end. I would wish the pain of the shipped endings on nobody.</p>

<p>[/quote]Because Bioware Is run by EA now and as yet EA has not released a patch for the Army of TWO chapters of Deceit DLC but people found a work around for it 2 or more years ago now. EA probably saw that sales of Microtransactions were dropping and figured
 that if they released a patch the small number of people affected by the problem would now be able to buy Spectre packs again.</p>

<h2>            Attention Please Windows 10</h2>
                    I have followed all instructions regarding getting rid of previous versions of windows (windows old). It does not delete after the 30 days passes. Disk cleanup whether running as Administrator or typing disk cleanup in the search box also wont delete the
 files. Something needs to be done as this takes up a lot of space that is no longer needed. I hope a solution that works will be found.

            I am not computer savvy. What I do know is I have over 800 MB that are still sitting on my hard drive. In system cleanup it shows the previous windows installations which is how i know there is 800 MB still sitting there.

            Hello Jeff, my name is Alexander. I'm an Independent Advisor and I'm happy to assist you! 
<br />
<br />This type of issue might be due to the missing boot files MBR and BCD or they are corrupted or not configured properly. Thus, I recommend that you try to rebuild these files manually.
<br />Please, refer to the following article to get information on how to create a bootable media and use it to repair the Windows startup
<br />
<br />Create installation media for Windows 10 <a href="http://aka.ms/W10CreateMedia7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/W10CreateMedia7</a>
<br />
<br />Once done, boot your PC from the installation media. 
<br />
<br />Note: refer to the motherboard manufacturer’s manual to get information on how to change the boot priorities and boot the computer using installation media.
<br />1. Go to the initial Windows set up screen to click on Repair your computer.
<br />2. Go to Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced options and run the Startup Repair.
<br />
<br />If the Startup repair does not work, please boot back into Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced options -&gt; Command prompt and run the following commands one by one.
<br />Bootrec /rebuildbcd
<br />Bootrec /Fixmbr
<br />Bootrec /fixboot
<br />
<br />Once the commands completed successfully, exit the command prompt and reboot the computer.
<br />
<br />Best regards, 
<br />Alexander B.

<h2>            Office 365 A1 plus vs A3 license</h2>
                    <p>Hello Support,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have just implemented Microsoft Teams direct routing with a certified Ribbon SBC and local SIP trunk using Office 365 A3 for faculty and Microsoft Phone system licenses - everything is working good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we have now tried testing the same setup with Office 365 A1 plus for faculty license - it is working good too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we confirm that we can change all A3 for faculty license with Office 365 A1 plus for faculty?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings between two look same - but there is so little info for A1 plus licenses in Office 365</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Rachael,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Which application are you using to play music?</p>
<p><strong>Disable the sound enhancement in Vista.</strong></p>
<p>1. Click Start, and type Sound into the Search field.<br />
2. Under the Programs list, click Sound.<br />
3. On the Playback tab, click the default sound device, and then click the Properties button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp; The default sound device has a green circle with a checkmark.</p>
<p>4. Use one of the following procedures depending on the sound hardware and that tab name that is shown:</p>
<p>• SoundMax: Click the Advanced tab, remove the checkmark next to Enable Audio Enhancements, and then click OK.<br />
• Sound Blaster/Audigy line: Click the Sound Blaster tab, select Disable Sound Blaster Enhancements, and then click OK.<br />
• Realtek: Click the Enhancements tab, select Disable all sound effects, and then click OK.</p>
<p>5. Play music or sounds to determine if the sound problem is still occurring.</p>
<p>Also check the link “Change bass, stereo, and other audio effects in Windows Media Player”&nbsp;

<h2>            No Internet in Hyper-V VM&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have Windows 10 Enterprise and just added Hyper-V. I had 3 VM's on VMware Player and deleted and uninstalled Player. I have 3 Vm's on Hyper-V. My problem is I get no Internet on my Vm's. I am new to Hyper-V and would like to know how to connect these
 to the internet. I have "Virtual switch (automatic)" selected. They show no connections available in the VM's. How do I connect to the internet? (I'm on wifi.) I'm attaching a screenshot. Thanks</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Third-party application is a software that is provided by a vendor other than the manufacturer of the device.<br />

            Hi, thanks for the reply. I got internet working. I had to create a wifi connection in "Virtual Switch Manager" and then go to the settings for each of my 2 VM's and tell it to use the wifi connection I created. Along the way I had to tell it to "share"
 connection with the Host. One of the VM's has a problem connecting and disconnecting but I will work on that and figure it out. If anyone has this problem try searching the internet and youtube has good videos explaining how to setup Internet in Hyper-V Manager.
