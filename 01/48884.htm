<h2>            Network connections fail when I tr to transfer large files...</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Sorry if this is a double post (I originally posted under the File and Folder section - but I believe this section may be more appropriate)</p>
<p>Whenever I try to transfer a large file from my Win 7 x64PC to any other PC on my LAN the Win 7 network connection fails. I receive the message "<em>The connection between your access point, router, or cable modem and the Internet is broken</em> ". In order
 to re-establish connection I have to run the network trouble shooter. All other PCs on the LAN (2 XP Home, 1 XP Pro) continue to work fine and their internet and LAN connections stay stable. Only the Windows 7 PC loses its connection. It does not matter whether
 or not I initiate the file transfer from the Win 7 PC or from one of the XP PCs. If the file is large (a gig or greater) it will fail and Win 7 will lose all of its connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea what is causing this and How I go about fixing it?</p>

<h2>            Ambassador page appears broken, unable to sign up or access anything on the website</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I had a similar issue to this a couple of weeks ago, in which I was unable to sign up for being an ambassador as it was not recognizing my Xbox Live Gold membership. Since then, it has picked
 up on my membership, and for a brief time it stated that I had successfully signed up for the Ambassador program. However, I was still unable to access any of the resources on the site. Now, when I try to log onto the website, all of the content pages do one
 of two things: either they state that I am not an ambassador and that I should apply, or they throw the following error message:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">"<span>There was an error checking your account. Please try back in 24 hours."</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I have been seeing this error message for close to a week now. I would love to get started in the Ambassador Program, but I need to get this issue resolved before I can use the website
 properly. Is there anything I can do to alleviate this issue? Thanks!</span></span></p>

<p>Now the issue has changed somewhat. The webpage is no longer providing me with errors, although when I go to the "Apply" section of the page, it states that I am already signed up as an ambassador. However, when I try to access Ambassador resources, the
 webpage informs me that I am not an ambassador. I have not yet received any communication regarding the status of my application (whether it has been accepted or rejected, or is still pending) and I am unsure what the timetable or procedures are for this process.</p>

<p>Are you able to locate the folder which uses the "lost" space ?<br />

                    Hey how's it going. My girlfriends aunt has been using Windows mail which is linked to her verizon email account. She went on vacation, brought her laptop, everything was working fine. She comes back home, and she can receive mail, but can not send it. The error message is something along the lines of "error code 0x8000ccc0e port: 25, secure (ssl): no" along with a socket number and specifying the email address and message that was being sent. First, I go on the verizon page and tried changing the POP3 and SMTP server names and ports through Windows mail to what Verizon specifies on their website, it then comes up with it can not find the servers so that wasn't it. I then tried deleting and recreating the account in Windows mail, still won't work. I logged onto the verizon website with her mail account and the emails send just fine. So I decide to take her computer home with me since she was getting frustrated and wouldn't leave me alone to work on it haha.   I bring the computer home to m

            It is @verizon.net, I already did the POP3 account settings and that didn't work, and the configuration that is already set up is correct, like I said it sent automatically when I brought her laptop home.<br />
<br />
Im not sure I understand your question about my mail server, I was using her laptop with her verizon account through her Windows Mail. So I guess the only answer I can think of is my ISP is mediacom.<br />
<br />
Also I think the error message was something along the lines of:<br />

            <p>You clearly have the wrong settings.&nbsp; I have no idea how it worked at your house, but it will not work the way you have it set now.&nbsp; See here:&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The settings are identical in Windows Mail.&nbsp; SSL should be checked and you do not have that checked and the port number is wrong and&nbsp;you need to specify that outgoing mail requires authentication under Tools | Accounts | Mail | Properties | Servers.</p>

<h2>            how to email a windows live mail folder to another person</h2>
                    <p>I have an email folder filled with a lot of specific emails.&nbsp; Now I need to send the entire folder to someone (would take forever to send email by email).</p>
<p>Just would like to click and send the entire folder via email (as attachment or whatever possible).&nbsp; Anyone know?&nbsp; I cant seem to find the answer</p>
<p>and I have looked and tried suggestions but they didn't work ( one said to R click the folder, rename, make a zip file then open new email and send zip file as attachment....sounds wonderful but step #1 didn't work....R click&nbsp;on the folder didn't give any
 useful options).&nbsp; HELP?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can't send <em>folders</em> by email, only <em>files</em>. <br />
<br />
Open a new message compose window (Ctrl-N), then arrange the windows so you can see both the new message and the message list for the folder you want to send. Select the messages you want to send and drag them to the
<em>Subject </em>box in the new message window. This will attach each message as an .eml file to the new message.<br />
<br />
You can use the standard Windows key combinations to select multiple messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><font>Click on an item to select it;
</font></div>
</li><li>
<div><font>Click on an item to select it, hold Ctrl down and click on another to select both;
</font></div>
</li><li>
<div><font>Click on an item to select it, hold Shift down and click on another to select both and all in between;
</font></div>
</li><li>
<div><font>Click on an item to select it, hold Ctrl down and press
<em>A </em>to select <em>A</em>ll items.</font></div>
</li></ul>
<p>Note that both your ISP and your mail service provider will impose limits on the number of attachments and the size of message you can send at once. Make sure you're within these limits
 before trying to send. Split the attachments between a number of messages if necessary.</p>

                    I have this problem with my desktop. Automatic repair doesn't work and I set the computer to boot from the DVD drive and put in a DVD&nbsp; with Windows 10 on it, but it went to the same error. Looking at a previous thread, the response was to try different
 methods to repair, but when all it does is tell you automatic repair didn't work shut down or more options that tell you that this is your error have a nice day, without offering a solution. Cannot start in safe mode, will not boot from a DVD (even though
 changed boot order), and no access to files on HD to check.

<br />  1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.
<br />       If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />   2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.
<br />   3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.
<br />   4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
<br />   5. Click OK.
<br />   6. When you are prompted, click Restart.
<br />   7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.

            It just goes straight to a blue screen stating that automatic repair couldn't fix the problem and to shut down or try something else. Cannot get to safe mode, cannot get past the blue screen when I go to try something else it says I have a 0xc000135 error
 and that is it. I downloaded windows 10 and put it on a dvd and changed the boot order in the bios to boot from the DVD drive and it still went straight to the blue screen.

            <p><span>Hi V</span><span>onalmen</span><span>, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>

<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>If<strong> </strong>you<strong> </strong>don’t<strong> </strong>face<strong>
</strong>the<strong> </strong>issue<strong> </strong>in<strong> </strong>safe<strong>
</strong>mode<strong>, </strong>you<strong> </strong>may<strong> </strong>perform a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>clean<strong>
</strong>boot<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>check<strong> </strong>if<strong>
</strong>it<strong> </strong>helps<strong>.</strong></span></p>

            What fixed my problem was deleting Bitdefender Antivirus.&nbsp; I installed a single user Norton Antivirus and immediately after rebooting my computer, I was able to view hidden folders.&nbsp; Bitdefender also kept me from doing weekly cloud backup's.&nbsp; Plus smaller
 items.&nbsp; Caution - Stay away from Bitdefender.

<p>Hi Franz,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Svchost.exe </strong>(<strong>Service Host, or SvcHost)</strong> is a system process that hosts multiple Windows services in the Windows NT family of operating systems. It is essential in the implementation of so-called shared service processes,
 where a number of services can share a process in order to reduce resource consumption. The error that you're receiving might be connected to the Internet connectivity issues. For us to provide the suitable solution, we need the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How are you connecting to the Internet?</li><li>What type of connection are you using? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response. </p>

<h2>            Windows Store won&#39;t load after 8.1 upgrade nor can I log in to Xbox or any games</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to 8.1 back a couple of months ago, I haven't been able to open the Windows Store or be able to log in to any Xbox game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything I've found online, from wsreset.exe, scanning, running powershell commands to re-register the app, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing has worked, which was creating another user on the machine, and accessing the app store from that account. &nbsp;However, it doesn't work in my normal account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Short of deleting my user account from this computer and then re-making it, what could be wrong?</p>

            <p>Thank you, Jayant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've worked through all four methods previously, but I did it again. &nbsp;None seemed to make an affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that did work was creating another user on my machine, and access the store through that user. &nbsp;The store worked just fine in that user login, but when I came back to my login it still doesn't work. &nbsp;Somehow it is tied to my user login.</p>
<p>I'm thinking it may be the same issue that is stopping me from being able to log in to Xbox games and so forth. &nbsp;What's interesting is that the live tiles for both the store and games show that it can connect, but when I click on them it doesn't connect.</p>

            <p>Still having the same issue. &nbsp;I've now upgraded to Windows 10, but the problem still persists. &nbsp;The store won't open and I can't login to Xbox. &nbsp;Xbox recognizes my username, but then says it can't login at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had hoped upgrading again would have fixed whatever happened when I originally upgraded to 8.1, but now the problem continues. &nbsp;Very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only say that the issue is within my user account. &nbsp;I'm thinking of deleting this account, and then making it again, but I'm afraid of settings I'll lose. &nbsp;However, I can remake those again quickly.</p>

            expanded? Do they have bigger size? Or maybe they have wrong proportion: width vs height?<br />
<br />
Try to press and hold ctrl and use a mouse scroll button to change their size. If they are not proportional you should try to change the resolution.<br />

            You tried resizing the icons with the scroll, but have you tried changing the resolution of the screen? Right click on the desktop &gt;
<strong>Screen resolution</strong> &gt; try to choose something else from the <strong>
Resolution</strong> list. Not every resolution works fine with a specific monitor, when the monitor is wider and you choose inappropriate resolution you will stretch the content.

            <p>I had this problem with Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened Windows "Settings" from the start menu and typed in Bluetooth to open the app..</p>
<p>When trying to Send music onto a phone, the error occured "An address incompatible with the requested protocol was used".</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5eb02e24-0313-4426-bccf-8f9ca178749b" height="341" width="417" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I updated all my drivers first:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">To download and update the drivers for all chipsets I used a volunteer-developed updater software "Snappy Driver Installer Lite"</p>
<ul>
<li>this software is very useful and quite easy to use, </li><li>volunteers rely on donations to continue to provide this software</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">A possibly other software to use to do this could be a paid one like "Driver Easy"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Then the next step to the solution that worked for me was from Salam Roben Singh:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Windows start button</li><li>Type 'Command Prompt' </li><li>Right click the 'Command Prompt', click 'Run as Administrator', and click 'Yes' in 'User account control' window</li><li>Type '<em>netsh winsock reset</em>' and press Enter</li><li>Restart windows</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/532e079d-578e-4543-bc85-6070f37b24fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/532e079d-578e-4543-bc85-6070f37b24fe" height="181" width="381" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was then able to send files from Windows to device</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I can't recieve using bluetooth</p>

<h2>            NumLock Default to Off&#63;</h2>
                    Why is NumLock set to OFF by default? It would seem more logical to set it to ON for login, as many people use numbers in their passwords. (I know how to fix it - just wondering why).

this thread.</a>&nbsp; <strong>Problem with mail</strong></blockquote>
<p>Hi Bruce, Sorry about the delay, I'm using Outlook.com. as my main mail program. What I have found out up to this time! &nbsp;OS is Win 8.1 and does not support POP which my ISP uses, but there is a method to install POP mail programs in Outlook Express in 8.1.
 I did this a year ago and now have forgotten how, works great for sending and&nbsp;receiving mail but that's about all.&nbsp;When you do this there is no association with the 8.1 mail program. That means the things you would normally do in a mail program, like attaching
 a file or a picture,&nbsp;are not available because there is no link to them in 8.1. MS has a solution to this as follows; "&nbsp;Create an association&nbsp;in the Default Programs Control Panel" I have attempted to do this several times without success. That is because
 the associations consist of a few programs and several hundred file extensions, which one will be the right one to use to get the association is unknown at this time. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Regards, Jack Collins.</p>

Hi to All, especially those of you that have replied to me. I am still a newbie on this thread and am feeling my way and probably making many mistakes. If you think my replies are slow be aware that I have never learned to type and the keyboard method I use
 is very time consuming. That said my previous post on this page tells it all. I am at the point of creating that association as recommended by MS but have too many variables to find the right file/program.</p>

            Because computer manufacturers bundle extra apps, many users are unaware that after Windows XP, Windows Vista was the last OS to come with a full email program. Windows 7 and 8 do not come with any successors to Windows Mail. Instead, you can get it as
 an optional download from the <a href="http://get.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows Essentials</span></a> page. Windows 8 did later come with a bare-bones basic email app that you’ve probably discovered, but it’s designed for tablets/phones
 and light finger-friendly use. If you want something that compares to the Mail program and Outlook Express before it, you’re going to want to get the free Essentials download at that link.

    <title>Change date of activity report email&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Change date of activity report email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have activity reporting with email summary set up on my Microsoft family account. The weekly email always comes on Thursdays and includes activity from Wednesday to Thursday. Is there a way to change this so the email shows activity for the week starting
 on Monday?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rich&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the same question, except mine applies to having two children's accounts, that were created on different days of the week. Can I change them so the report arrives on the same day?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you add your child to your Microsoft Family and turn on Activity reporting, you'll get weekly activity report emails that show you a summary of their activity on Windows 10 and Xbox one devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email gives you a lot of info about your child's activities on their devices, but to see even more detail- or to change their family settings, you can go to their Activity page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the article on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12441/microsoft-account-see-child-device-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>This doesn't answer the question at all. I want to know if there is a way to change the date range in the email so it shows the week starting on Monday instead of starting on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Hi Naveen</p>
<p>thanks for the quick reply and all the general information.</p>
<p>However i agree with Rich, it does not answer the question?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we alter the date we recieve the family report or not?</p>
<p>

<p>I also agree it is a rubbish answer... because it totally ignores the question we all have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW DO YOU CHANGE THE DAY OF THE WEEK THE WEEK OF REPORTING STARTS ON?</p>
