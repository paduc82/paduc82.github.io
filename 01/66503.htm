<h2>            Sorting conversations based on online status</h2>
                    I just upgraded my iPhone to the XS, on my old iPhone 7 the conversations were sorted based on who was online at the time, but on my new phone the conversations are sorted by who I last chatted with, so I now have to scroll through all my old chats to
 see who is online. Is there a way to change how the conversations are sorted?

<h2>            Halo Wars 2 DLC problem</h2>
                    A friend recently bought me Halo Wars 2 Ultimate edition and after i downloaded the game i used the code for the season pass and definitive edition for the first Halo wars but i never received anything related to the season pass except one leader i think
 her name was Kinsano. Does anyone know how to alleviate this problem ?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Ocean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. Have you checked <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/view-downloadable-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
under the game itself</a> for the content. Go to my games and apps&gt;highlight the game&gt;hit the start(menu) button&gt; go to manage game&gt; see if there is anything under ready to install here. Most times when season pass content is purchased or released it shows
 here to be installed.</p>
<p>

<p>Here's the closest I could find after close to an hour searching: CrazyCam <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/News-Newsgroups-Blog-Tools/CrazyCam.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/News-Newsgroups-Blog-Tools/CrazyCam.shtml</a>.&nbsp; Note you also need Adobe AIR (but the link is on that page and it's free too).&nbsp; Unfortunately, all I had to go on were the descriptions as I've used neither program (and don't
 really do that kind of thing).</p>
<p>As you know, Photobooth is not available for Windows - but the above free program was the best I could find to do some of what PhotoBooth can do (but you must realize that all of these alternatives are going to be disappointing in some way because they aren't
 the real thing and will all be missinng some of the&nbsp;features you treasure - but you just need to select one and learn to live with its limitations).</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Trying to unlock BitLocker encrypted drive for first time, wont open - not responding.</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/db00febc-f5d1-4d7a-8b47-307f70358d08" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Team - Trouble here!! Have ~730 GB of data on my 1TB iOmega HDD. Turned on BitLocker on my Windows 7 system, set password, created and saved recovery key file, and i saw it started encrypting (very slowly, which i think is normal). Left it there for hours
 and when i came back I saw it is asking me for my password for my unlocking... which i entered and it just wont open. Goes "NOT RESPONDING". I did not lose power during the initial encryption and neither did i pull out the HDD (to my knowledge) even though
 I read in the MS content that encryption should resume the next time a drive is plugged in, it it got interrupted the first time or whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, started my research and was shocked to find several people have had similar problems. Also references that data must be backed up before encrypting (may be common sense). Well, i have not done that, did not know that a simple of act of encrypting
 could be such a crime, especially when you are encrypting what you have just taken a backup off - before proceeding towards a formatting of my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the following manage-bde commands and the results are in the pic. Interestingly, i find that the "manage-bde -status" command shows "conversion status" and "percentage of encryption" as unknown. Is this normal? I do not really remember seeing any screen
 (when i came back after hours to check the status of the initial BitLock'ing) stating "hey i am done" sorta. Also the little light on my HDD keeps blinking when i enter the password - giving me hope that its trying to read, so its not really dead. How do i
 know whether it is even in an "expected state" or something worse? Or if i should plan on getting another empty 1 TB drive for the repair?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short - I need help. I have a lifetime worth of data in here - pro and personal. MS geeks - please do something and help me. And yes - i am just a "common man", not very high on tech skills but i can read English :-). I know there is a way out,
 there has to be, please help. {hands clasped, on my knees}</p>

<p>The references were wrong. Anyone how has irreplaceable data must maintain at least two versions on two independent media at all times. This is completely independent of any action he might take such as encrypting, upgrading, restoring etc. Unfortunately
 lots of people ignore this rule until they face a disaster.</p>

<p>Thanks Frederik, a lot. I have a few questions, some of it may sound a bit persistent - but it is only because this is my first time with BitLocker and i do not know what is usual or unusual:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Is it established that the disk has "<em>partly</em>" encrypted/decrypted data?</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;In properties it shows 0 bytes free and 0 bytes used - is this expected &nbsp;for a properly encrypted drive or is it a sign of faulty/partial encryption?</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;What does the blinking light mean when i key in the BL password (besides that something is trying to read the disk) - could that be remaining encryption/decryption taking place in the background, and that it is a matter of time (i have tried up until
 20-24 hours for 730 GB of data - FYI)?</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Original query - What does UNKNOWN mean against "<em><strong>conversion status</strong></em>" and "<em><strong>percentage encryption</strong></em>" when I run "<strong>manage-bde -status H:</strong>" command?</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;"<em>BitLocker recovery tool</em>" threw up results related to the "repair tool". My research showed that it is the "<strong><em>last resort</em></strong><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;when
 you were unable to decrypt or unlock the encrypted drive using either the&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/21522-bitlocker-password-change-reset-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">password</a></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">,&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/21818-bitlocker-recovery-key-back-up-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">recovery

 Recovery</em></a></strong></span>". So how do i know that i have reached the stage of last resort? I mean - is there anything else i should have tried? See my supporting artifacts which show exactly what i am seeing in terms of this drive. How do i decide
 it is "un-decryptable" now and that it will NOT open using manage-bde/recovery key/whatsoever? Evidently i am wondering if i may not have tried something that is still out there, i am yet to try opening it via command prompt in the administrator mode)?</p>
<p>6. Last but not the least (thinking different), could this be a malware issue? I ask because i found that somehow my antivirus had been turned off, running a scan now and finding some detections - not sure what those are yet though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, knowing the answer of #1 and #5 will probably tell the most - as in whether its time to call in the forces, or not. Nevertheless, I am willing to try anything that is needed to retrieve the data. I know for repair, i need an equal sized drive which
 i need to procure. Keeping my hopes up here!</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thanks Frederick and thanks all.</p>

 wipe and re-install from scratch, and then reload your data.</p>

    <title>MBR - Volume does not contain a recognized file system - after bootrec - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willem w  say:</h3>
<h2>            MBR - Volume does not contain a recognized file system - after bootrec options</h2>
                    
<p>I was unable to install Vista SP2 (as it later appeared, because of a Grub-bootloader installed by Linux). I tried to reconfigure the bootloader and partitions (enabling to start straight to Windows), but after several bootloader configurations (load from
 different partitions as well as from MBR) and some resizing of partitions (incl. resize of NTFS partition). Windows does not boot anymore.</p>
<p>I tried Windows Rescue Disk:</p>
<p>bootrec /fixmbr was successful</p>
<p>bootrec /fixboot did not work until I first did /scanos (which iedentified, after having unmounted the NTFS-partition in Linux and having put the bootloader flag in the MBR and the default grub option on Windows, that there is 1 Windows installation on C:\windows).</p>
<p>If I then repeated bootrec /fixboot it gave the message that the volume does not contain a recognized file system.</p>
<p>I also did bootrec /rebuildBCD (after renaming bcd), ultimately without the desired success.</p>
<p>Altogether, the 'best' situation I achieved was either a boot to Windows with a cursor blinking for something to happen (apparently finding the partition but not any bootfile or OS); or the rescue disk arriving at identifying that there is a Windows Vista
 partition but (pursuant to the first option to simply repair the system) "no errors found". The second option here, "Restoring to a previous point" returns that no such previous restore point exists.</p>
<p>It has been taking me about 24 hours now to finally get the SP2 installed but obviously with only more trouble.</p>

<p>There are several ways, some of which you've been told in other replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's another way--my personal preference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Find the Word.exe file and right-drag it to your desktop. Release the mouse button and choose "Create shortcut here."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do the same with Excel.</p>

 program cannot run without the driver but it's just annoying that I can't remove the program. I can't find it in the program files, and I'm running windows 10. Thank you Wally Wallis.</p>

<h2>            Skype Preview for iOS&#63;</h2>
                    I've been a Skype Insider for iOS for months but the latest build says February 7? I know TestFlight is wrong because my app looks nothing like the new one on the blog post today. Is there a reason I don't have it?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for iOS has a limited number of spaces and as a result we are operating a waiting list system. If you have not got an invite by now then you are on that waiting list and we will add you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were previously in the Testflight program and have not had an update pushed to you in a while its likely you became inactive and were removed from the program, to keep the program fresh and to ensure we get maximum feedback from the program anyone
 who has not installed the last 3 builds or a build in over a month (depending on which is a longer period of time) will be removed from the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@rychu I will reach out to you via DM to confirm if this applies to you.</p>

<p>Halo 4, yes.</p>
<p>Minecraft on Xbox 360 (Kinect...how that's gonna work...)</p>
<p>And more Kinect games than you could shake a stick at, although a Kinect game where you merely shake a stick is surely on the cards...and was probably announced when I was holding my head in my hands wondering where the hell Alan Wake 2 was...</p>

<p>Check to see if MAC filtering is enabled on your Jensen Airlink. &nbsp;If so, try disabling it.</p>
<p>Also you need to know if your Airlink requires a password to connect to it with wireless. Most routers need that.</p>

    <title>XBOX Live - Gamertag history lost on renewal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahughes200  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX Live  - Gamertag history lost on renewal</h2>
                    
<p>The XBOX Live subscription lapsed on my sons account this week and could not access certain services such as the online games requiring membership, netflix (yes I do have a netflix account). I got an online renewal code and when he tried to enter it via
 the xbox the system was giving an error code and not taking him to the screen to enter the product key. I renewed it online instead of via the xbox and when he tried, he still could not access the services or even see the subscription status as it was not
 available. Went on live chat and the support person did something at their end to resolve the problem. After they applied their fix he could log on but there was no gamertag history so he had lost everything on Black Ops, Forza, all friends had disappeared
 and it looked like he had been reset as a new gamertag. Probably spent about 4 hrs on chat today trying to resolve it and tried the usual, remove profile and re-added via download, reset the XBOX (not to factory settings though as that won't do anything extra)
 etc etc. The account does not show any history prior to the renewal this morning so it looks like instead of renewing and carrying forward the 2 years worth of history, it has reset the account as a new user and started again from scratch!</p>
<p>The help team have exhausted all their checks and have asked me to post in this forum as the moderators have a lower level of access to the systems than they have. As everything is driven by on-line these days I can only assume it is a problem with the backend
 servers or someone has made an update to the renewal process and it has *** some accounts up when the renew. I work in IT so when someone tells me that cannot happen I know it is not true, anything can go wrong, it just may not happen very frequently or a
 new software release has not been tested properly</p>
<p>So basically has anyone encountered this previously and can help or am I just going to have to live with a hacked off son for weeks / months as the renewal process has a bug ?</p>
<p>Help would be very much appreciated</p>

<p>Are you sure he is signing in with the same e-mail address that was used to previously set up the account? &nbsp;When he signs in is he seeing the same gamer tag?
</p>
<p>If you are using the credentials here that you use to sign in on your xbox it is not showing up as gold.</p>

<p>Hi, I am using the same credentials. When I log onto the account online it is showing as registered as pre paid 12M XBOB Live Gold. I only have the single account and gamertag. I l also have the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email to confirm the Gold activation.
 Could the servers be out if sync and not replicating the renewal across all services?</p>

<p>one additional thing, I have asked the &nbsp;chat team, twice what change they made to activate the renewal to get it to work but got no response. This is the first logical step to check what the root cause could be so can you look at that</p>

<p>This is a support forum monitored primarily by users like yourself we don't have access to that type of information. &nbsp;When you first posted your account was showing as silver but now it is showing up as Gold. &nbsp;Has your experience online changed? &nbsp;If not
 again try removing the profile from the console and re-downloading it. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

<p>Sorry but I am confused, looks like I have mistaken your feedback to be from the Forum Administrator. I was told the following by the Microsoft on-line support team - 'I would like to refer you to our Managing my XBOX Live Account on XBOX ONE Forum. Inform
 them to check your account for possible history since they are the only one who has direct access to the server'. They then posted a link to this forum</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to escalate this to the appropriate person who has access to the serve and can see the transactional history ? Looks like the online chat support only have the standard checks to make from their knowledgebase and all have been tried,
 so the next step is to attempt to get in touch with someone with a lower level of access to the system to check. I can't find a help desk telephone number for the UK, so if anyone has that it would also be a great help.</p>

<p>We have steps to correct that. Can you tell me what console do you use, is that Xbox one or 360?</p>

<p>@ahughes200, one possible issue that I'm seeing here is that your console can be outdated. Is there any chance that you have tried signing-in a different Xbox Live Profile to your console?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Replace the keyboard. Either the key is damaged or the electronic circuitry is, there's not much you can do to fix it other than replacing it.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<br />If it is, select it and click 'Disable' 
<br />Close Task Manager 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter 
<br />When the System Configuration dialog opens, click on the Services Tab 
<br />Check the box marked 'Hide Microsoft Services' 
<br />In the remaining list look for Logitech Download Assistant,, uncheck it if you find it 
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />CLick your Start Button, type Regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to:
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
<br />Find Logitech Download Assistant, then right click and choose delete

<p>The only people that handle suspensions are the Xbox enforcement team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They do not follow these forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to contact them is through their website enforcement.xbox.com and the case review process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it seems like you feel that you were suspended unjustly this would be the way to appeal your case to them and they would then reinvestigate the report that got your account suspended and determine if they can lift the suspension sooner.</p>

    <title>Italian to English - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel frieka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Italian to English</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>When I made this Xbox account, I think that I put either my live account or my xbox account to Italy. And even though I had the Preferences set to English Language, whenever I connect to Xbox Live or I come on the xbox website, everything is in Italian.
 What's more, I did a lot of offers and got some Redeem Codes that don't work just because they don't work in Italy region.</p>

<p>How do I change this to UK? Is it from the live account or is it from Xbox?</p>
<p><br />
Help would be gratefully appreciated. Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Microsoft has finally opened the gates and now enable users to change the region of their Microsoft Account (formerly known as Live ID or Live Account).</p>
<p>Be warned though. Changing the region will have consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the services and content that you are currently benefiting from in the country originally registered may not also be available in the country you are willing to migrate to.
</li><li>All of your current subscriptions, except for Xbox Live Gold if you had any, will be cancelled. You may lose the ability to re-download some, if not all, of the content in your download history.
</li><li>Any content that you will subsequently download after the account is migrated will be subject to any applicable geofencing rules of your new location.
</li></ul>
<p>Microsoft also informs:</p>
<p><strong>Please note that the migration process can take up to 6 weeks.</strong>&nbsp;During this time your account will not be available. No refunds will be given for any content that is lost during the migration.</p>
<p>So in order to change the Microsoft Account region, reach out to&nbsp;phone or chat support:<br />

<p>Thank you for your answer, but I'm kind of a noob on this... I see my accounts.live is set to United Kingdom. So do I have to change it from someplace else?</p>
<p>Can I please have some steps of how to change the region?</p>

<h2>            Gears of War 4 Error Code 0x80070057</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys, you are my last chance to fix this problem. I bought Gears of War 4 Ultimate Edition in&nbsp;August. I installed it, it worked very well. After 2 months I tried to update it.... error code&nbsp;0x80070057 appeared. I tried to reinstall the game but now I can't even download it. When I press Install and the download starts error: code&nbsp;0x80070057</p><p><br /></p><p>I had many discussions with Xbox and Microsoft, but they weren't able to help me. Tried several stops via Powershell, reinstall Windows Store, Login and logout from my account... nothing helped. I'm really really desperated...</p><p><br /></p><p>My System is a PC Windows 10 NOT the XBox.</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm looking forward to helpful answers...</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
