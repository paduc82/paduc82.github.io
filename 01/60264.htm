<h2>            Windows 7 security update KB 4019264</h2>
                    After install in this update, my USB 2.0 ports stop working. Windows 7 64 bit. I have to uninstall for USB ports to work. Anyone with the same problem? Cannot find answer in Windows support.

<p>Hello!<br />
</p>
<p>Since you have updated, it is likely that your USB drivers have become outdated, try the following:</p>
<p><strong>Start -&gt; Type in Device manager -&gt; Find your USB drivers -&gt; right click -&gt; Update Driver software.</strong></p>
<p>If that does not work, let us know.</p>
<p>

            Thanks, but I did that procedure. The only way to get my USB ports to work again is to do a system restore before update and stop windows update from automatically updating.&nbsp;

<p>It is odd that a security update would result in a USB malfunction but it could be that some USB related security hole was patched and now your USB drivers are out of date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You DO NOT want to follow the suggestion to get driver updates from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should tell us more about your system and we can see if there are driver updates from the manufacturer available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your system make and model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a Dell what is the Service Tag number?<br />
<br />
Do this so we can see what you have (two things to paste back in your next reply):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For USB driver information, expand the Components, Click USB, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>

    <title>inappropriate advertisements - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> solidersumo69  say:</h3>
<h2>            inappropriate advertisements</h2>
                    <p>I usually allow my 6 year old daughter to play solitaire on my laptop while I am sitting right next to her to make sure she doesn't accidentally click on any advertisements or make any purchases. This past week I have had to quickly shut the laptop/turn
 off the screen because of an advertisement for Scatter Slots (I think). There is a small "18+" badge of sorts that appears in one corner of the screen, and while that is great to know so that I don't allow my daughter to navigate her way to something awful,
 the ad itself is still not something I am okay with a 6 year old girl seeing.&nbsp; Is there any way to make sure that this ad (or similar ones) does not appear again?&nbsp; Most of the ads are harmless but...this one is going too far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>help!</p>

<p>I have provided the link below to the Microsoft Solitaire Website. At the bottom you will find the link to Report this game to Microsoft. When you select it, it then pulls up a webform to complete. From the drop down you select why you're reporting it (the
 most approriate category seems to be offensive content). And then you just explain it the same way you did here. Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Is your daughter playing on your own "adult" account, or did you set her up with her own separate child account? The machine can't know who is sitting in front of the laptop, and only knows the age of the user from the account that is signed in. So while
 your daughter is using your adult account, she appears to the system as a fully grown adult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If she is using your adult account on your laptop, you should try creating a Microsoft Account for her with her real birthdate entered when you create the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then add her child account to your own parent account via <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.microsoft.com/family</a> and add her child account to your laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then she should be able to play Solitaire, and according to her birthdate should not see age-inappropriate content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also set up restrictions on her account so she technically can't do purchases and stuff. So you don't have to watch her that closely and fear that she might click on a purchase by accident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, another point worth considering is that these adverts are using your search history, from your web browser "targeted advertising". If you clear all the search history and cookies it should solve the issue. I am in no way saying that it is you who searched
 for this material but occasionally "rogue cookies" from 3rd parties can be added from sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An add blocker may help but the safest way is to set up a child account with content restrictions.</p>

<h2>            Windows Photo Viewer crashes after a few seconds after opening</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This post is
 not about the "Photo app", it's about "Windows Photo Viewer", the old application already available on Windows 7 and even earlier versions I guess. I've checked other Microsoft Community posts on the subject and no solution coming from them works for me.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I'm somewhat attached to the old Windows Photo Viewer and prefer to keep using it on Win 10. Nevertheless, just a few days ago it started
 freezing after a few seconds. So, say, in any folder, I manage to view image 1, then "next" image 2, and then it won't move. If I just open the first image and won't use arrows to get to the next one, still the viewer will freeze, so the problem is not depending
 on moving to next photos or not. When I try to close Windows Photo Viewer I get a warning asking if I want to wait or not, but waiting won't help, so I close it. It takes some seconds to finish. Restarting the system won't change the situation.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It was working perfectly a few days ago, now it's not working anymore. I didn't install new apps, I didn't install new softwares, and there
 was no Win10 update (the update was maybe a week before the issue, so I don't think we can blame it). Whatever happen seems to have happened out of the blue, alone by itself.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I'm now using as default the other native option, the win 10 "Photo app", but that one is working all right, whereas Windows Photo Viewer is
 not. Everything else on the system seems to be working right. I have no indication there's something more serious going on.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Things I've tried that didn't change the situation:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SFC
 and then DISM. SFC found no integrity violation, DISM stated something like "Restore Operation Successful". On that, everything seems to be OK. But issue persists.</span></p>
<p>I use Panda antivirus free, but even if I close the antivirus the problem occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance</p>

            Did the OS come preinstalled or the shopkeeper installed that?
<br />Right click Start&gt;Command Prompt-Admin and type in the following command:
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />If you have Powershell instead of Command Prompt Run these in order:
<br />cmd.exe
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />You will get a window, take a screenshot using snipping tool and paste it it next reply.

            If you are getting expiry notification, it basically means that it is a volume edition. 
<br />Type cmd in Windows search
<br />In command prompt, type followng
<br />slmgr -dli
<br />After few seconds a window will be opened which will tell you whether it is volume edition or not.
<br />Follow the steps given by Andre to reinput you keys.

    <title>Computer randomly switching between 2 internet connections - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonibus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer randomly switching between 2 internet connections</h2>
                    <p>I recently did a factory reset of my Acer Aspire laptop which came with Windows 8 installed. &nbsp;When Windows 10 came out, I upgraded to 8.1 and then to 10 flawlessly. &nbsp;When I factory reset my PC, I had it keep Windows 10 as my OS, however I've noticed that
 I keep "flicking" between 2 internet connections that I can connect to - mine and my neighbors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be troublesome when doing things such as gaming and streaming videos, and I was wondering if there are any obvious fixes or if its a software problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all help is appreciated!</p>

                    <p>Well said! We are given company laptops with Widows 8 and I added my Yahoo email account. I have been trying to logout of Yahoo account for the past few days and cannot do it. I only wonder who hires these geniuses at Microsoft.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 - Desktop Icons Keep Moving When Docking-Undocking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jgreg7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - Desktop Icons Keep Moving When Docking-Undocking</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 7, when I re-dock the computer, or attach an external display such as a projector, the desktop icons keep re-arranging from one side of the screen to the other.&nbsp; This in itself would not be that bad, but it re-arranges them at the same time.<br />
</p>
<p>My procedure is that when I undock, or re-dock, I put the computer to sleep, and wake it up in its new state (docked or undocked).&nbsp; Upon waking up when re-docked, the icons scatter lining up in a jumble at the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way it seems possible to save the icon configuration is to shut down the computer and re-start when docking.</p>
<p>I have gone through the multiple process to try to save the configuration (uncheck auto arrange, aling to grid, etc.).&nbsp; Nothing seems to make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configuration: </p>
<p>Dell Precision M 4800:<strong> </strong>Windows 7 Enterprise (64-bit) SP1 &nbsp;- laptop alone, screen resolution 1920x1080</p>
<p>Docking station with two monitors, screen resolution 1920x1080</p>
<p>Projector, In-Focus 800x600</p>

<p>While I did not receive a response on this, in several posts from around the communities, I did find mention of a great little utility that seems to work very well:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.midiox.com/index.htm?http://www.midiox.com/desktoprestore.htm</p>
<p>
</p><p>This utility installs into the shell and is accessed by the right-click menu. &nbsp;It works very well for correcting the weird variations you get when connecting to docking stations, projectors, etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the configuration you like for a particular set up, you simply right-click and save it. &nbsp;Then the next time you use that same configuration, you simply right-click and restore it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is much easier than fighting the desktop jumbles each time you change between monitors / projectors / docks / etc.</p>

    <title>on-screen keyboard got smaller with upgrade to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brucegreaves  say:</h3>
<h2>            on-screen keyboard got smaller with upgrade to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>The on-screen keyboard on my surface pro 2 is smaller having upgraded to windows 10 today</p>
<p>only a bit smaller, but enough to significantly increase my typing error rate</p>
<p>i've written over 200,000 words on the screen keyboard on my surface pro 2 and i love it, but now, having upgraded to windows 10 as advised, its worse for me and my fat fingers</p>
<p>certainly any benefits windows 10 has over the windows 8 i had are irrelevant compared to this loss of keyboard size</p>
<p>can i undo the upgrade? this is an unexpected and very negative feature of windows 10 for me</p>
<p>any clues anybody????</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Scanning and repairing loop C&#58;&#92;WINDOWS&#92;System32&#92;Logfiles&#92;Srt&#92;srtTrail.txt.</h2>
                    For some reason, my computer did not want to boot yesterday, and i have been struggling to fix it since. My pc starts up with the ASUS screen and it says Scanning and Repairing C: then the percentage goes to 100% but it doesnt repair anything. it just
 keeps going back to the blue recovery screen. Start up repair is not working either. it fails and says Log
<span>C:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\<em>Srt</em>\<em>srtTrail</em>.txt.</span><br />
<span>C:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\<em>Srt</em>\<em>srtTrail</em>.txt.</span><br />
<br />
How can i get my computer out of this loop and be able to boot up ?<br />

            <p>Hi Edward,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lock screen wallpapers/pictures you are referring to is the <strong>Spotlight</strong> feature in Windows 10. Refer the link below suggested by
<strong>Simon Mattes on May 2, 2015</strong>&nbsp;to go to location of all spotlight pictures.
</p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_personal/windows-10041-windows-spotlight-lock-screen/5b1cddaf-7057-443b-99b6-8c3486a75262"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_personal/windows-10041-windows-spotlight-lock-screen/5b1cddaf-7057-443b-99b6-8c3486a75262</span></a></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems like you are facing a hard time trying to make the computer detect the partitions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Since Device Manager is unavailable, do you receive any error while trying to access the same?</li><li>Have you tried to accessing Disk Management?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply so we can look for further options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>PC shutdown during update &#40;WIN10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordan ap  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC shutdown during update &#40;WIN10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So I shutdown my PC whilst it was still updating Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel asleep, though, during the installation at the start (I was tired and my eyes were getting very heavy) and was woken up by my sister who came in to tell me something (I don't know when, but the update was still going). Anyhow, I woke up and saw my
 PC still turned on, and my monitors were on standby. I clicked them on and got a non-responsive from one of them and a blank, black screen (though it was the kind of black screen that meant it was still on, if you know what i mean) on the other. I just sort
 of assumed it was done in my sleep-deprived brain and shut it all down and went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
Well next morning it was <em>toast</em>.<br />
<br />
It started up through my BIOS manufacturer screen, then went to the Windows 10 logo with the spinny spin spin dots spinning about. Then, my other monitor would turn on and also have the same spinny dots, (as per normal, my main monitor starts up later) but
 suddenly come up with an error message that said something along the lines of:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>'Windows update did not install correctly. Reset to re-install/update Windows'.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It was pretty obvious what would happen; it would do this in a loop. And it did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted up from a DVD that had Windows and I am now writing this on a fresh install of Windows. I tried repairing Windows with the DVD but it came up with some error and it just led me back to my BIOS manufacturers screen. I also didn't want to lose anything
 on my main HDD when I did a fresh install, so I got a spare HDD and installed Windows onto that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to recover my old Windows? This HDD is much smaller than the one I used to have Windows on, and has a lot of my data on it that would be much simpler to keep using than transfer everything over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any reply.<br />

            <p>I have the same hardware. The fingerprint scanner worked perfectly under Win 7. Since I "upgraded" to Win 10, the fingerprint verification does not come up, either on boot, restart, login after sleep... Just one of many problems with Win 10. :-(</p>

<h3> drn24  say:</h3>
<h2>            No USB Devices work - Can&#39;t access computer</h2>
                    <p>It is very rare that I come across an issue I can't fix or find an answer online, but this one has me stumped...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a recent update, all my USB devices stopped working. Since I have no other plugs to use, I can't access my mouse or keyboard to do anything. I am using a SSD, and I was able to boot up on a backup drive, where all USB devices work fine. So I can access
 the SSD drive, but not as a bootable drive. This makes it hard to implement any fixes that involve using windows since it's not the boot drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming I can remove the USB drivers, reboot and let the computer install new ones (please tell me if this is wrong). But I have no idea where they are so I can remove them. Alternatively, I can download new ones and manually install them, but that
 seems more problematic. Can anyone offer a solution to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I cannot even access the BIOS. The SSD drive boots up too fast, and the keyboard shuts off within seconds of a boot. I have also read that you can turn off the fast boot option to let drivers load, so that may be the issue. But I need to boot from this
 drive to make that change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to clarify a few information first for us to better assist you on your USB concern. Kindly answer these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How did you boot to the backup drive? Is the back up drive a separate hard drive?</li><li>You mentioned that you're unable to use the mouse and keyboard because the USB slots are not working. Can you please tell us how are you navigating to your apps and files when using Windows 10?</li><li>What was the last update installed on the computer?</li></ul>

<p>Thanks for the response. Here are your answers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have 2 drives, both with operating systems. The old one is a standard Seagate drive that I no longer use. That is the one I can boot to and the USB works fine. My primary is a SSD clone that I made a month ago that has been working fine and been through
 several updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I boot the primary SSD drive, it boots fine to the welcome screen where I enter my pin. But because none of the USB ports work, I can't use my keyboard or my mouse. The clock changes, so it's not frozen. And when I unplug and plug back in my keyboard
 they light up, but turn off quickly and do not respond. So I can't get past that screen on the primary SSD drive. I can on my backup though (which has not had a recent system update BTW)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The last update I am sure of was 4 days ago. The system updated automatically. It may have auto-updated since then, because when I turned it on this morning it was at the Welcome screen instead of the log back in screen. It was working fine last night.
 I don;t turn it off at night, I let it go to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best solution might be to tell me how to update or delete the bad USB drivers on the SSD drive. I can turn the SSD on and access it as a secondary drive, just not as a boot drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>I don't know if this makes a difference or not, but I just noticed that the power option "Turn On Fast Startup" is checked on the old Seagate drive. Since the SSD is a clone, it likely the drive has this enabled as well. I read that the SSD drive can sometimes
 boot up faster than the devices. So this may solve the issue. The problem is that I cannot access the SSD as a boot drive to make that change. I can do it on the old Seagate, but I don't think it would make a difference, would it? Is there a way to adjust
 this setting on the SSD drive if it's not the boot?</p>

<p>We started seeing the same problem (ALL USB devices stop working after an update) last week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning we narrowed the problem down to an update (KB04074588) on or around 2/14.&nbsp; We did a test on one of the affected systems and as soon as we rolled back the update, the USB devices all started working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to tell you with your setup since you need to boot from your SSD in order to get in and roll back the update.&nbsp; And since W10 wont recognize ANY USB device its kind of hard to get into the system in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully MS will get whatever is wrong with KB04074588 fixed soon and rolled out.</p>

            This is great information Mike, thank you very much for sharing. I am hoping I can go in and manually remove the specific files that are causing the issue, as I do have access to the SSD drive files. But I really appreciate you giving Microsoft the specific
 update number so they can fix it.&nbsp;

<p>I'm not sure that just removing some files is going to resolve this for you since these updates typically also update the registry.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem as best we can tell is NOT bad drivers, its something else within Windows that is preventing the drivers from loading/working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest doing some searches about how to boot your machine into recovery mode.&nbsp; Its been awhile since I've had to do that but its a key combination when the machine is booting.&nbsp; I am also pretty sure that the key combination varies between manufacturers
 so you may have to do some experimenting. Dont worry about trying to time it just right, start the boot process and hold down the appropriate key combination.&nbsp; Unless you have something else going on, the keyboard will work until Windows starts loading up
 drivers and recovery mode happens before that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion, I will look into the recovery startup to see if I can roll back the update. I'll have to look up the keystrokes for my HP desktop. I really appreciate the extra help so far, I need my computer back as soon as possible since

<p>This is an update for the Microsoft team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to access the bios and choose F11 to go into recovery mode. However, every time I do it the computer just shuts down after about 10 seconds. So I can't even get into recovery mode to address the issue. Very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I'd be fine just wiping the SSD drive and starting over, as it would be quicker than waiting days for an eventual solution. But I do not have an original Windows 10 disc (I upgraded from Windows 8.1, which came with the machine). So far Microsoft
 has been very silent in offering help. It would be nice to get a response in some form.</p>

            We apologize for the late response. Just like <strong>Mike Smith (Mike.Smith)</strong>, we need to boot your computer to the recovery page of Windows 10 so that we can further troubleshoot the issue. If you're unable to access the Windows Recovery (WinRe)
 environment of Windows 10 by pressing F11, you can perform a hard reset to force the computer to load the recovery page. To do this, follow these steps (Please take note that you may need to perform the instructions below three times until your computer loads
 the recovery page.):
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold down the power button of your computer for 10 seconds.</li><li>After turning off the computer, turn it back on.</li><li>Check if the computer will load the Advanced Recovery page. The page will look like this:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0595b428-3192-4820-97a6-14622c4b0d9b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0595b428-3192-4820-97a6-14622c4b0d9b" height="285" width="425" /></a></li></ul>
</li><li>If the computer did not load the page, press and hold down the power button for 10 seconds again.</li><li>Turn on the computer and see if it will load the page.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know of you're able to load WinRe.</p>

<p>Thank you for the recovery suggestion. I have tried that options several times and it will not boot up to the recovery screen. It just keeps booting up to the welcome screen.&nbsp;Is there another option for forcing the recovery screen? Or maybe create a bootable
 recovery USB drive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is related, but one possible reason is the error screen (see attached image) that comes up every time I boot the machine. There is in fact no hard disk error, and oddly enough that screen has carried over to the boot up process with the
 new SSD drive. I don;t seem to be able to eliminate it, so I usually just press F2 and then immediately exit diagnostics.&nbsp;</p>
