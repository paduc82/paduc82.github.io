<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It seems to be connected to this...</div>
<div>"If you create desktop shortcuts to removable storage places such as NAS the icons will disappear from time to time because Windows 7 has a built in task schedule to clean up broken and
 unused links. <br />
<br />
To prevent the task from running you need to disable the task in the task scheduler: start-programs-accessories-system tools-task scheduler<br />
Expand the tree in the left hand pane until you get to Task Scheduler Library-Microsoft-Windows-Diagnosis.<br />
In the right hand pane, right click the task named Scheduled and click Disable."</div>

<h2>            Network cable unplugged</h2>
                    <p>Hopefully this is the right section to post this.</p>
<p>I have just moved into a new home and i am having issues connecting to the internet through a wired connection. Wfi works but id rather use the wired connection since i have it . The house is wired for Cat 5e. I have an ASUS MOBO with Cat 6 cables running
 from my rear Ethernet port to my wall connection. I have tried IPCONFIG/RESET, RENEW, no joy. I tried uninstalling the driver several times, no joy. (Intel(R) Ethernet Connection (2) I218-V). My dad thought it looks like there are two Ethernet drivers for
 some odd reason, could that be the why i cant connect? Local Area Connection indicate Media Disconnected and Ethernet 3 is indicating Media Disconnected as well. Please advise TIA.</p>

            Good evening, Victor. 
<br />
<br />So a couple of things we can do to start troubleshooting. 
<br />
<br />Do you have another PC, Mac, etc with an Ethernet port that we can try to connect? I’d like to make sure it’s your PC that is the problem, and not the cabling itself. 
<br />
<br />If not, can you bring your PC to your modem/router and hook it up directly to it. Again, this would tell us whether it’s the PC, or the cabling. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if you can do either of these, and what the results are, and we’ll go from there!
<br />- C

            Hi Victor.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help  ry Uninstall, restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update (which you can check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.   
<br />
<br />I would try another cable to be sure.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            No sound in windows store apps</h2>
                    I only tested this problem with games downloaded from the windows store. Even when i have my sound on, some games that are supposed to have audio dont have audio, for example asphalt xtreme. Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't. This happens with
 all my games downloaded from the windows store and i like playing with sound. sound for everything else works, only for the windows store apps.

            That is strange. Could you create another user account to check if the problem happens that account too?
<br />
<br />Please try the Playing Audio troubleshooter. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Playing Audio
<br />Select it
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if the apps are working.
<br />
<br />Right click the Sound icon in the Notification areas, click Open Volume Mixer
<br />Is the Applications System Sounds slider up?
<br />
<br />Check and let us know.

<h2>            Windows is not genuine</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i was using windows 7 ultimate and upgraded to windows 10 after it's released. however after using around one month with windows 10 i got back to windows 7 as i faced with numerous problems in 10 applications. however, this windows 7 ultimate version was
 genuine and was given with all the required updates all the time automatically. but now, two days back i am getting message saying that my windows is not genuine.&nbsp; I tried with few solutions which were given in the articles and i didn't get any good response
 on this issue. and here is my MGADiag results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i hope i will get assistance on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance</p>

            <p>The problem is that your system is unable to properly read the BIOS SLIC table that should be present in the system to be able to self-activate the OS.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>You need to change the Product Key to the one on the COA sticker on the machine's case (or inside the battery compartment),<span>&nbsp;
</span>using the Change Product Key link at the bottom of the System properties page.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may need to activate by phone.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>There is no such thing, but perhaps you have activated Tablet Mode, which means that your computer works like an iPad and everything is full screen (or split-screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn off Tablet Mode, go to the action center:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>With a touch screen, use your finger to swipe in from the right side to show the action center</li><li>With a keyboard, press Windows+A to show the Action Center</li><li>With a mouse, click the notification icon near the clock to show the Action center</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>However you get there, just turn off the tablet option at the bottom.</p>

<h2>            Mouse does not wake computer</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I am in mouse settings. I went to the hardware tab and clicked properties; then in the new window that appeared, I clicked the power management tab. It says the mouse is HID-compliant (whatever that means) and then there is a checkbox saying "Allow this device
 to wake the computer." However, wiggling the mouse does not wake the computer. It seems the only thing I can do once the computer sleeps is hit the power button. I would much rather wiggle the mouse, seeing as this computer is a desktop. What should I do?
 Thank you.<br />

            Hi,<br />
The power troubleshooter did not find anything. I am using a Logitech wireless mouse that came as part of a set with a wireless keyboard. The adapter is plugged into a KVM. I have noticed that when the computer sleeps, the indicator lights turn off, so I think
 that is likely part of the problem. I can't for the life of me understand why Windows 8 would shut off something connected to the KVM though, or how to stop it. Right now I have turned the sleep function off due to this issue, but I would like to allow my
 computer to sleep if I can.<br />

<h2>            Surface Pen Problems - Randomly Stops Working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface 3 running Windows 10 and a Surface Pen.&nbsp; I find that when using the Pen, even though it is connected, it will stop working for no apparent reason.&nbsp; Typically this will be when using OneNote, I'll make a few notes with the pen, then stop,
 and when I try to re-start the pen won't work.&nbsp; Minutes later it will work again.&nbsp; It has happened dozens of times - often in a meeting which is really inconvenient.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't work out exactly why it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pat</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us through the Microsoft Surface community forum. Sorry for the troubles with the Pen. Rest assured, we'll try our best and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went over your post and&nbsp;from&nbsp;what you've posted, it sounds as though the device loosing sync at times. This can be caused by a weak cell coin battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Pen is comprised of 2 different batteries each handling a specific function.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing, erasing, and right-clicking</strong> are powered by one AAAA alkaline battery you install in the bottom part of the pen.</li><li><strong>Opening OneNote and taking screenshots</strong> are powered by two pre-installed, size 319 silver-oxide coin cell batteries in the top of the pen.
</li></ul>
</ul>
<p>Try&nbsp;and replace the Cell coin battery&nbsp;by following the steps listed <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/touch-mouse-and-search/troubleshoot-surface-pen?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us posted.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really looks like your AAAA battery is approaching its end of life. When using it, the remaining available power is lowering below the operational needs and giving you these problems.</p>
<p>It is unlikely the two 319 cell batteries as they are only used to wake up the Surface at the top button press.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try replacing the AAAA battery, it should solve the issue.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi TechLfL,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found in the end that my Pen was faulty. &nbsp;I contacted the Microsoft service team by telephone and they sent me a new Pen which works perfectly. &nbsp;I have used the new pen almost every day, for over a year with very few problems - to the extent that I rarely
 make notes with pen &amp; paper anymore. &nbsp;I have had to change battery maybe once in that period.</p>

            Hi Gloria, yes that will be no problem, you can deactivate the original installation and install onto the new PC:
<br />
<br />On your New PC, go to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a> and sign in using your Microsoft account,
<br />
<br />Select Install
<br />
<br />Locate the computer where you want to deactivate the install
<br />
<br />Select Deactivate Install
<br />
<br />Then click Install to install Office on your new PC
<br />
<br />That's It!

                    <p>Original title: L2TP won't let me connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Workstation 9 and in each vm I have a AD-DC (2K8R2Enterprise), CA and RRAS (2K8R2Enterprise) and my last vm is a win7 (they are all trials). &nbsp;They all are not updated, but the PPTP and IKEv2 work without a problem. &nbsp;The second server that has
 the CA and RRAS is a member server of the AD-DC. &nbsp;The Win7 is not on the domain and I have issued the Win7 a client certificate. &nbsp;I have ensured that the Trusted Root-CA is in both the User and Computer Trusted Root-CA store. &nbsp;I have also ensured that the
 Win7 client certificate is in the User and Computer Personal store. &nbsp;I keep getting a 810 error message when I try to connect to the VPN while using the L2TP protocol. &nbsp;I have exhaustively researched this problem and I cannot find a solution to this problem.
 &nbsp;I have also raised the functional level of the domain to 2K8R2. </p>

 quickly shut down, but when I go over there to check it, and turn the computer back on, I don't want to "break" anything.<br />

<h2>            Problem with account credentials&#63; 807B01F4</h2>
                    <p>My Xbox 360 will not let me download my profile so that I can sign into Xbox Live. I have opened ports, turned off firewalls, reset routers and modems, restarted the console, formatted the console, and reapplied updates and so much more. The real kicker
 is that I have been able to download my friends profiles just fine. It always gives me the same error talking about how my credentials are the issue. Customer Support, like always, is absolutely useless. What even are the credentials in question? My gold subscription
 is active. My username and password are correct. What more do you need?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enter my username and password after selecting "Download my profile"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says "Hi Username!" And proceeds to download my profile just fine. Then it gets to downloading my game info, whatever that is, and it seizes up on me and the craps out the vague error message. Whats so bad about this "game info" that makes Microsoft want
 to ruin my day? Can anyone please help me? Why MY account? Not the 4 others on the console.</p>

<p>Hi, no that would not be possible. Skate 3 is not a next-gen game, and it is not possible to download it to your Xbox One. Also, Xbox 360 discs will also not work on your Xbox One.

<p>You won't "loose" your info if you back it up first.&nbsp; Microsoft no longer sells Windows 7.&nbsp; You'll need to find an OEM version of Windows 7 Pro on the web.&nbsp; Amazon is usually a good source, but be careful because as you've found out, there are lots of non-genuine
 copies and keys out there.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 DVD Maker problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently updated Windows 7 Movie Maker.&nbsp; My HP computer was bought new in Spring of 2011. Its says in my properties that&nbsp;my new updated version of &nbsp;Movie Maker is 2012. However , there doesn't seen to be an update for DVD Maker. I've been working on a
 rather long video in Movie Maker for months and wanted to burn it to DVD just to see how it looks on my LCD TV and see if I can see things I want to change. But DVD Maker is telling me it doesn't support the file. I noticed the file is no longer ".wmv" but
 is now ".wmvlp" or something like that. Im at work so not sure. My question is it seems obvious to me that the update to Movie Maker is not compatible with the older DVD Maker but I cannot find an upgrade for DVD Maker. I like Windows 7 DVd Maker and don't
 really want to install a different source to burn a DVd. Is there something I can do or install so that my DVd Maker will burn my videos? Move Maker was having some issues and that was why I updated it and it works well now. But now it doesn't seem to be supported
 by the DVd Maker. Can you help and let me know if there is something I can do to fix this problem? I would really appreciate it. I pray there is simply a patch or a download I need to try.

============================================<br />
You mention that you are working on a long video and I feel I<br />
should warn you that large complex projects tend to cause <br />
trouble and become corrupt. It is usually best if you create <br />
several small projects and combine them into a final video <br />
after they are saved in the .WMV format.<br />
============================================<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
Sounds like you are working with a .WLMP Movie Maker Project <br />
file instead of a .WMV video file. <br />
<br />
Another type of Project file is the MSDVD file from DVD Maker.<br />
<br />
.msdvd file extension<br />
<a href="http://www.cryer.co.uk/file-types/m/msdvd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cryer.co.uk/file-types/m/msdvd.htm</a><br />
<br />
(If DVD Maker will not import the .WLMP file...maybe it will import <br />
the .WMV movie file)<br />
<br />
The following steps should aid you in saving your project as .WMV:<br />
<br />
Originally Posted by&nbsp; Leonard_Su<br />

1. Open Movie Maker and open the project file you have (.wlmp)<br />
<br />
2. In the program window, press these keys on your keyboard ALT + F + select<br />
Save Movie and choose Recommended for this project.<br />
<br />
3. After that choose your preferred destination where you want to save the<br />
movie.<br />
<br />
4. Edit the movie file name and the file format of the movie. (You can<br />
choose .WMV or MPEG-4 if you are using the latest version of Movie Maker<br />
2012. If not you can only choose .WMV)<br />
<br />
5. Click Save button.<br />

<h2>            object already exists</h2>
                    i recently was having trouble with itunes working so i uninstalled it and when i went to reinstall got the object already exists error. Went searching all over the internet for answers and finally found one. I deleted the security keys that were instructed
 on the apple forums. However, a couple weeks later my itunes program disappeared from my computer. I then tried reinstall and got the object already exists error again. When i went back to delete the security keys the ones that every website has given me are
 not on my computer. How can i fix this?

            <p>Hello CollinThorogood,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My recommendation at this point would be to update the machine's drivers from Sony's website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would start with the touchpad and chipset drivers and move on to anything that is currently out of date on your machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Matthew_Ha</p>
        </p>
