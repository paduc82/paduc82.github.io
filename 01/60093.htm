<h2>            How to block certain sites</h2>
                    I recently upgraded our company's computer to Windows 10. Is there a way to block certain websites (Facebook, YouTube etc.)&nbsp;so that my employees can only access the program we use for doing business?

<h2>            WHY CAN&#39;T I JUST USE MY PC THE WAY I WANT&#63;</h2>
                    <p>THERE ARE JUST HELL LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH WIN 10 DAY BY DAY EVERYTHING THAT MICROSOFT ADDS, MAKES IT HARDER FOR USERS TO GET AROUND, D</p>
<p>I CERTAINLY MISS THE OLD UI, AND WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW ALL SETTINGS, AND MOVING THE CONTROL PANEL STUFF HERE, IS MORE LIKE COVERING&nbsp; UP ALL THE OPTIONS, INTO NOTHING</p>
<p>
</p><p>IN WINDOWS 7 EVERYTHING THAT YOU TYPE IN RUN, IT WOULD BE REMEMBERED, IN WINDOWS 10 YOU HAVE TO LET MICROSOFT COLLECT YOUR DATA, BY TICKING THAT OPTION, TO LET YOUR OS REMEMBER WHAT YOU TYPE IN RUN</p>
<p>
</p><p>CRITS ASIDE, I WILL BE MOVING BACK TO WINDOWS 7 IF MS RETARDS, SAVE MY TIME, BRAIN CELLS, AND "EASE OF USE"</p>
<p>
</p><p>FOR NOW I WANT TO USE HIGH CONTRAST IN MY WIN 10 (USING THE BLOODY&nbsp; 1803 17134.345 VERSION THAT DELETES YOUR FILES)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I JUST CAN'T DO IT, I SEE NO DARK BACKGROUND, AND WHITE TEXT THAT I WANT</p>
<p>
</p><p>EVERYTHING STAYS SAME, AS LONG AS I SWITCH THE OPTION IN "ALL SETTINGS"</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER IF I PRESS LEFT ALT+****+PRTSCR IT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING TO WHITE, BUT I DID NOT SELECT WHITE, THAT IS WHY I CLICKED ON HC BLACK</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT IT STAYS WHITE, NO MATTER HOW MANY RESTART OR **** YOU DO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHEN I CLOSE THE "ALL SETTINGS" AND OPEN IT AGAIN, I SEE THE UNSAVED THEME, NOW WTF IS THAT? WHO DID IT? AND WHY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>CAN'T THIS RETARDED OS UNDERSTAND WHAT I WANT TO DO? AND I EXPECT TO HAPPEN WHEN I CLICK ON HC BLACK?</p>
<p>WHY IS IT NOT SAVING? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'M SERIOUSLY KILLING MY BRAIN CELLS BY USING THIS OS</p>
<p>
</p><p>I FEEL LIKE ALL THE WORST DECISIONS TAKEN BY ME WERE STILL BETTER THAN USING AND STICKING TO THIS OS.</p>

</p><p>Perhaps you weren't aware, this forum is predominantly comprised of tech community users who come together to support each other - NOT Microsoft (although there are some Microsoft people on here too).&nbsp; As we're here to help each other out voluntarily such
 aggression as shouting in a post is likely to turn people off and you are less likely to get some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems aside for a moment - just bear in mind Windows 7 goes end of life January 2020 and will stop getting security updates.</p>

<h2>            Fixing wireless &#34;hidden network&#34; problem on Windows 7</h2>
                    I've read a post by a previous user who seemed to be having a similar problem as me, but the response he received didn't help solve the problem and I suspect this to be a genuine bug in Windows 7, but that remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7network/thread/0d9e680f-8025-4863-9242-f990c64ea8bd &lt;- a link to the aforementioned thread.<br />
<br />
Connecting to&nbsp; my wireless network (which has been online for years and served dozens of machines no problem), yesterday I attempted to connect running Windows 7 and received the following error message in my troubleshooting dialog: "Windows can't connect to
 the hidden network."<br />
<br />
More specifically: "This network is marked as a "hidden" network and is either not in range of this computer or the wireless settings saved on this computer do not match the settings of the network."<br />
<br />
My network is not hidden, SSID broadcasting is on, I am using a valid key and the network has full strength from my wireless connection utility. Does anyone know how to fix this problem or why it seems to be only happening on Windows 7, and only reporting that
 the problem is that the network is hidden?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Do you use WEP encryption?<br />
<br />
Maybe I will answer to your question using google results. When you get to the last page of results for<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1G1GGLQ_PLPL269&amp;q=&quot;This+network+is+marked+as+a+hidden&quot;&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"This network is marked as a hidden"</a> (you will find 3 pages - 24 results)
</li><li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1G1GGLQ_PLPL269&amp;q=&quot;This+network+is+marked+as+a+hidden&quot;+wep&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"This network is marked as a hidden" wep</a> (2 pages - 14 results)
</li></ul>
Do you see some correlation? Majority of results include information about WEP. Some of topics were never answered. Those one were the solution was found include suggestion about changing WEP encryption.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Try to set another security type in your router's settings and use it in your network setting under Windows 7. I'm using security type: WPA2, and encryption type: AES and everything works fine.

<h2>            Windows 8 MSDN MAK Key limit exceeded because of Dell issue with wireless drivers which causes freezing and instability of system</h2>
                    Hello!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I installed Windows 8 on August 15th via MSDN. I have Dell Inspiron n5110 notebook with Core i7, 6GB RAM and GeForce GT525m. I normally activated it with MAK key that I got on MSDN. But laptop suddenly started freezing. I was looking for problems and solutions
 and decided to downgrade to Windows 7. I thought that Dell will official drivers on October 26th and they did. I installed 8 again with original drivers but laptop still froze. I found that problem is caused by wireless drivers and that I'm not only with this
 problem. Dell support also confirmed. Dell didn't released fix yet even they released new wireless drivers on January 3rd, but I want to know how I can restore my license because I don't have more MAK keys avaliable (my cousins also use same account and I
 get mine via them). I didn't create backup of license and I have MAK key written in case somebody will help me. Is there any way to restore my license?</div>

<p>Who provides you with the MAK licenses, your employer or yourself? If its provided by your employer, you should not be sharing those keys with anyone else, including family. That behaviour is out of compliance with how MSDN licenses, especially volume license

</p><p>Hello! for problems with account loggin, internet and also Xbox Live access... (Console Power cycle)<br />
We recommend to perform a power cycle on your console, here in the following link are the steps...</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.xbox.com/es-MX/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console<br />
<br />
If this is too many steps for you, just do what i do, turn it off and unplug the AC cable for 30 seconds and plug it in again, this will do the same effect than power cycle...<br />
<br />
Let us know if these steps help, i hope this fix this inconvenient. Good Luck!</p>

<p>Hi, sounds like a filter issue. Ensure you have an ADSL filter on every socket where you have a device plugged in, including fax, Sky TV, Alarm system etc etc, basically anywhere you have something plugged into a phone socket.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/component/content/article/43-connecting-to-broadband/57-adsl-filters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/.../57-adsl-filters</a></p>
<p>If you have filters on every socket try replacing the filter that has the Livebox connected to it.</p>

<p>The game goes off by the language your XBOX Live account is set to and the region.</p>
Change the Xbox LIVE account language
<p>If your Xbox LIVE account is set to a country or region that supports multiple languages (for example, Canada), you can change your Xbox LIVE account language. Here‚Äôs how:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://live.xbox.com/Account/BillingAccountInformation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live.xbox.com/Account/BillingAccountInformation</a>.
</li><li>Sign in using your Windows Live ID. </li><li>If multiple languages are supported for your country or region, select a language from&nbsp;<strong>Preferred Language</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>Note&nbsp;</b>The Preferred Language option does not appear if only one language is supported (for example, the United States).<br />
&nbsp; </li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>.<br />
&nbsp; </li></ol>
<div>So to recap, if your account is set to Belgium you should have 2 options for preferred language which are French and Dutch. You can follow the directions above to change the language on the account. If your account is in another region than the one you
 are living in then that is a problem when downloading games from the XBOX Live Marketplace. You would need to create an account for the country you are living in to correct this sort of problem.</div>

    <title>what should you do to update your drivers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> francoisecoscarella  say:</h3>
<h2>            what should you do to update your drivers&#63;</h2>
                    I do update, and use different free apps, driver max, slim drivers, auslogic driver updater, etc. My problems are:
<div>1/different sites give me different updates for different drivers. I don't know which one to follow</div>
<div>2/some of the updates I tried do not work. For instance,the ATI mobility Radeon has a new suggested driver, but when I tried, t gave me a black screen and I had to roll back to the previous one.</div>
<div>3/device manager certainly does not help. It tells me to roll back half of the recent drivers I installed, without explanations, of course. Neither does the computer manufacturer site (Acer for me), nor the intel utility, nor the other manufacturers' sites,
 like ATI, AMD, etc.</div>
<div>Of course, I always create a restore point, but it can be a pain, like with no display (ATI as said before), or no mouse moves, you are happy the safe mode exists to enable you to access system restore.</div>
<div>So, my question is how to know which drivers are stable and safe, which updates are almost mandatory and which are superfluous and better to avoid? For now, &nbsp;am told I should update the ATI Radeon (won't touch it...), the Intel 5 Seres 4 Port SATA AHCI
 controller and the Intel 82801 PCI bridge, according to DriverMax. DriverGenius says Synaptics TouchPad drivers, Realtek high def audio drivers, Chicony USB 2 webcam drivers, Intel rapid storage technology, Intel hd graphic drivers and AMD catalyst desktop
 display drivers are out of date. According to Driver Robot, 4 drivers have to be updated. 2 PCI bus, High precision timer event and standard PS/2 keyboard. For Driver Finder, 18 drivers are outdated, whereas it is only 2 for Advanced Driver Updater... (PS/2
 keyboard and Realtek hd audio).</div>
<div>For Device Manager, nothing. That is almost reassuring.</div>
<div>How are you supposed to manage, install the proper ones and discard the other ones? I am lost.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>ps. I cut it short, but I could go on with 10 more sites and their advice.</div>

            <p>You should not use them because while they may identify a hardware device inside the computer, they take NO account of hardware revision levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most hardware manufacturers go to some lengths to provide the correct drivers for the EXACT make, model and revision level, and as the hardware manufacturers write their own drivers, they are in a better position to know what works than a sloppily written
 driver finder.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the manufacturer website does NOT have Windows # drivers for your particular device, they DON'T exist..

            ok, first the utilities are not that bad. I update, then check with device manager and click on update driver for anything I have touched. Windows "updated", actually rolled back 2 drivers out of 50. The other ones were all approved and accepted as the
 best driver -well, what windows says.
<div>Then, I don't know who are your pc manufacturers. Maybe alienware provides drivers' updates, but neither hp nor acer really does. You &nbsp;get a short and very unclear list with a few possibilities, and &nbsp;it is almost impossible to pick up the proper drivers.
 When I have been told by Acer that my audio hardware is from Realtek, it still leaves plenty of possibilities!!</div>
<div>The drivers updaters give you the latest drivers for your system, at least according to them. Check once, you will be surprised.</div>

            <p>You are lucky that only two drivers have had to be rolled back. Using the wrong driver can in some instances totally cripple a machine, making it almost impossible to recover.</p>
<p>I would sooner trust a device manufacturer which gives out the exact updates for free than trust a program which scans for device updates from whatever source and charges you to do it..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must do as you feel is best for you.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find out what devices are in a computer, you can use Piriform Speccy</p>
<p><a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/speccy/download</a></p>
<p>This will tell you what is inside and works well for desktops, but not so well for laptops because laptops have a lot of customized parts in them, and drivers should only be obtained from the computer manufacturer.</p>

            I have piriform and other ones. When you look for a driver for an ATI Radeon 5650, whether you find it here or there does not matter. Your driver will be the same, no matter where it comes from. The drivers you get from various apps are signed, Microsoft
 approved and so forth. Sometimes you have to go on with changes. They might be good!
<div>The drivers the device manufacturer offers are the very worst, because they put in stuff they have found compatible with - it never is.&nbsp;</div>
<div>OK, it gets to the point of not updating your drivers. And maybe that is the answer.</div>
<div>I know all of the devices on my computer, you get them on device manager just the same. You will get more info from belarc than from piriform.</div>
<div>Thirty years ago, it was said that basic was the only language non specialist will ever use with computers. And then came windows...</div>
<div>Today's apps are much more interesting than they were ten years ago. You speak from anther time.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>There is no single driver file for a Radeon 5650. It comes as part of the Catalyst Control junk. The driver finders I have seen look for the CCC version which may or may not be compatible with the 5650.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that one shouldn't update drivers. I just think that the manufacturer knows best
</p>
<p>If the latest Radeon driver for the 5650 from the ATI website is delivered via CCC version 12.6, installing CCC version 12.8 may not be a good idea, but driver finders would install it anyway..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the experience I have had within the last two years (hardly another time) of trying them out with older machines, but what you do is entirely your responsibility..</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is an old thread, but while I agree in principle to the fine old adage <em>
'I if ain't broke....'</em> , like many</p>
<p>things PC this does not always apply, and drivers that are not up to date can lead&nbsp; to 'broke'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- When not using a machine to play games, particularly high end (AKA - AAA titles) older graphics</p>
<p>and audio drivers are&nbsp; almost always good enough.</p>
<p>- When using an older graphics card (three or more series back from the latest series) older drivers
</p>
<p>are generally fine, with the exception of when the drivers address a bug in a specific game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when using a recent series graphics card from either Nvidia or AMD and playing recent</p>
<p>high AAA titles a newer driver (not necessarily the most recent) is generally best if you want the</p>
<p>best performance from a graphics card.</p>
<p>- Newer driver versions tend to focus mostly on optimisations for the current series graphics cards in</p>
<p>relation to recent games, so older cards often see little benefit from the latest drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically what happens is the new series cards are being tweaked to their best performance via</p>
<p>driver updates. For the most part this has already been done for the older series cards with drivers
</p>
<p>released in the year, or perhaps two after their release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Audio drivers are far less likely to require an update (and are updates are far fewer), but there are some games that will not run properly if the audio drivers are too old.</p>

<h3> kansasjay  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I set my pc to use the VGA monitor only rather than requiring HDMI&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I set my pc to use the VGA monitor only?&nbsp; I have a Win 10 HP pc that arrived with only HDMI for the video.&nbsp; I installed a VGA card in the pc to connect to my existing monitor.&nbsp; With only the VGA monitor attached, whenever I turn on the pc it beeps
 and will not start&nbsp;until I plug in an HDMI monitor (which is my tv and I don't want to use for the pc).&nbsp; Additionally, when I start the pc, it reverts to both monitors despite checking "Show only on monitor 2" in Advanced display settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't see an
 option to use only the&nbsp;VGA monitor always. The checkbox option to "Make this my main display" is grayed out.
</p>
<p>I'd like to: </p>
<p>- use only the VGS monitor</p>
<p>- Turn off the setting to require a HDMI monitor</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks heaps!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error may occur if the path to your temporary directories includes unusual characters, or if&nbsp;Digibook flash is unable to extract the components to your temporary folders due to insufficient space.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few ways this can be dealt with. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install the program using another account (e.g. "administrator") and choose to install the program for all users.
</p>
<p>2. Move your temporary folder. It&nbsp;determines the location to extract its temporary files to based on the "TEMP" and "TMP" system environment variables. The locations of the these folders can be configured from the Control Panel &gt; System &gt;Advanced &gt; Environment
 Variables dialogue box. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the "User variables for " portion of the dialogue edit the values for TEMP and TMP to point to an existing folder outside of your user profile (e.g. C:\TEMP or C:\TMP). If this folder does not exist then create it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In order to check if the issue might be caused because of software conflict, bo<span>ot your computer in a clean boot state.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer this link:&nbsp;</span><span> </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reset the computer back to Normal Mode once you are done with the troubleshooting by following the section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" from the same article.</span></p>

<p>Andre, thank you. I used your method and also i tried with another Win 10 disk. So i dont know which one worked because after new os installation i did your method. Anyway now it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But happend is that after that some languages like malay, malayalam media not coming. All other languages are there. We need malayalam language. Its available in phone and tab but not in PC.</p>

                    <p>14 Nov 2012</p>

<p>I downloaded autocollage 2008 from windows live. This is the trial version. Trying to buy the activation code &amp; registrar the trial version to get the full version
 is a nightmare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How can I activate this program; I get no sense from the Microsoft store or Microsoft help who advised they do not support this product? Are Microsoft going mad?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can anyone help?</p>

            This answer is no good for us in the UK, as the link is back to the MS stores and the UK store does not have this program listed.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Hi David,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 it only happen when you try to empty the recycle bin?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 was the last time it was working fine?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try the below steps and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Type the following command and press ENTER:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>rd
 /s /q C:\$Recycle.bin</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Close
 the Command Prompt window.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step fails thenI would suggest that you run SFC scan on the computer which would scan for corrupt
 system files on the computer and replace them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The scan may take some time, so be patient. Windows will repair any corrupted or missing files that it finds. If information
 from the installation CD is needed to repair the problem, you may be prompted to insert your Windows Vista installation disk.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For more information refer the below link.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step fails then check if the issue persists in the safe mode.</span></span></p>
