<h2>            Windows wont start - Registry Corrupt - System Restore wont work</h2>
                    My computer did not start this morning and it took me to Startup Repair. Startup Repair ran and said it could not fix the problem. Upon looking through the scan details i found "Registry is corrupt" error code = 0x3e7 and then "registry rollback failed".
 I tried system restoring but it said that there was no system restore point.&nbsp; I am at a loss as to what to do.&nbsp; I have read there are registry cleaners available online but with my computer unable to even enter safe mode I dont know how I would use them and
 I dont have a copy of Vista on CD so that brings me to my last problem. If i do in fact have to reinstall my OS would it be possible for me to simply buy windows 7 and install that instead of Vista? Any help on fixing the registry or insight into these other
 dilemmas would be greatly appreciated. <br />

            You do not ever want to use a registry cleaner even if you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>could</em> </span>get into Windows. Have you backed up your data? If not, this is the first thing to do. You can back up data even if you can't get into Windows. Let me know if you need directions.<br />
<br />
The next thing I would do is test the hardware to make sure it is physically good. Testing the hard drive and the RAM doesn't take long and is important because there is no point in trying to apply software solutions (reinstalling Windows) to hardware problems.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
As far as reinstalling Windows:<br />
<br />
Most laptops and many OEM (HP, Sony, etc.) desktop computers come with a factory restore image on a special partition on the hard drive. The factory restore process is normally invoked by pressing a Function key (like F11) at computer startup. There will be
 a message as to which Function key to press on the screen when you first start your computer. You can also refer to your computer manual, or the computer mftr.'s website, or contact its tech support to see how to restore your computer to factory condition
 since each computer mftr. does it differently - sometimes even between models.<br />
<br />
These machines also usually have a utility with which to create physical recovery discs in case the hard drive needs to be replaced or the factory restore image is somehow damaged. If you did not create the physical recovery discs and/or damaged the recovery
 image, contact the computer mftr.'s tech support to order a recovery disc set. This is normally very inexpensive, around $20-25.<br />
<br />
You need to look on Toshiba's tech support website to see if they support Windows 7 on your specific model computer. If they don't have Windows 7 drivers and laptop utilities, you need to leave Vista on the computer.

            Besides checking for Windows7 drivers if you're considering upgrading to Windows7, you should go to the Windows7 Upgrade Advisor and run it on your system to check both hardware and software.&nbsp; Here's the site:

<br />
<br />Since Microsoft removed support for Project Astoria it is not possible any more . . .
<br />
<br />However if you want to download Windows 10 Mobile Build 10240 and enable Project Astoria, you can still run Android Apps, please see the article below . ..

<p>Hi mayurpatel111,</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default the Pause/Break you cannot change the mapping of the Pause/Break keys. For you to change the mapping of the Pause/Break keys, it's best that you contact the manufacturer of your keyboard for assistance some keyboard manufacturers allow changing
 the mapping of their keyboards or install a third party application.</p>

 time you will get an option to create a new folder to save the attachment to that new folder.</font></font></font></p>

<h2>            Conectar o Kinect no Computador</h2>
                    
<p>Boa Tarde amigos do f√≥rum.</p>
<p>A microsoft j√° disponibilizou o kinect para pc.</p>
<p>Tamb√©m j√° foi lan√ßado o SDK para desenvolvedores.</p>
<p>Tenho o kinect para xbox 360, com data de fabrica√ß√£o de novembro/2011 e gostaria de saber se tem algum adaptador original disponibilizado no mercado que eu possa ligar o kinect no pc.</p>

<p>Obrigado.</p>

<p>Acredito que o kinect √© o mesmo sim. Por√©m o para pc (pelo que informei j√° est√° a venda) utiliza conex√£o USB. Achei que a existia um adaptador orginal da microsoft mesmo para fazer isso. Vou comprar esse do mercado livre e &nbsp;testar. Depois posto os resultados.

            <p>Hi Harvey, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this issue confined to a specific program? Are you able to uninstall other programs?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. This issue normally occurs when Windows Installer could not find the required components.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to run the <strong>Microsoft Fixit</strong> to try and
<strong>uninstall</strong> the software from the computer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the link to run the Fixit:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Click on <strong>'Accept'</strong><br />
b. Select <strong>'Detect problems and apply the fixes for me'</strong>. <br />
c. Select <strong>'Uninstalling'</strong>. <br />
d. Select <strong>'Encyclopedia Britannica'</strong><br />
e. <strong>Fixit</strong> will check for bad registry files and try to fix it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to perform the steps provided in the article and check.

            The Intel G620 is a CPU, and as such is not directly related to audio functions. Locate the audio device that you are having trouble with and look to your computer manufacturer's web site for any updated drivers governing its functionality.

<p>Hi Cody, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you've purchased the full game and you're getting a message saying that the game you're using is a trial version, it may be due to the Windows 10 PC still detecting the game's trial version which you've downloaded before. To resolve this, we suggest uninstalling
<strong>Minecraft Windows 10 Beta</strong>. Refer to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/how-to-uninstall-reinstall-game-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Extend System Drive but recovery partition is in the way. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> digitald  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extend System Drive but recovery partition is in the way.</h2>
                    <p>I just replaced my system drive with a bigger drive. Worked fine, but now I can't extend the partition because the free space is not contiguous. I have a System Reserved (350MB), C-Drive/healthy/boot/etc (297GB), Recovery Partition (450MB), Unallocated (167GB).
 So when I right click on C-Drive, expand partition is greyed out. I assume it's because the unallocated space is not contiguous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running windows 10. Anyone have any ideas how I can resolve this and make one single system drive?</p>

            I ended up getting 3rd party software which did allow me to "move" the partition to the end of the space, so then I could extend my C drive. however in that process, when I moved the recovery partition, it actually assigned that partition a drive letter.
 And when I looked at the properties for that drive, it showed that there was a chunk of used space (even though it previously had nothing). But then going into that drive, there were no files listed. So I figured I hosed it and just blew it away. Now it's
 sitting out at the end of the drive as unallocated space.

</blockquote>
<p>My problem is exactly the same: I upgraded from Windows 7 to 10 on a 250GB disk, cloned it to a 1TB disk and ended up with a 232GB system partition (C:), directly followed by a 450MB recovery partition, followed by close to 700GB unallocated space. I would
 like to extend C: to the unallocated space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recovery partition provides access to a few troubleshooting options when your system can't boot. I found a
<a href="https://www.sepago.com/blog/2012/07/25/windows-recovery-environment-re-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
blog entry </a>that explains that rather well and also describes a method to move the recovery partition elsewhere. Caveat: It covers Windows 7 and 8 only.</p>
<p>You'll find more details about the Windows 10 recovery environment at a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/manufacture/desktop/windows-recovery-environment--windows-re--technical-reference" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>I will post here should I succeed in moving the recovery partition out of the way.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Pritesh,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please provide more information to help you better:</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you made any changes to the pc prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you installed all pending updates on the pc?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In which user account are you facing this issue?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the pc and login to the Admin account or the Microsoft account to test if that helps with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also suggest you to install any pending Windows updates on the pc to check if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue still persists, I suggest you to check the issue occurs in safe mode if not perform a clean boot please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For example, if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know default settings and basic device drivers
 aren't causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please refer the article below:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Note: <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Ensure that you go with safe mode with networking, there is no net connection in ordinary safe mode.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Cleanboot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I also suggest you to do a clean boot and check if any third party apps are causing the issue.
</span><span>Placing the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer to the article below for steps to perform a clean boot.

    <title>Internet conection problems after visiting certain websites. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internet conection problems after visiting certain websites.</h2>
                    I have Window 8.1 and I use Firefox as my default browser. Lately, I have problems when I go to certain websties. The site doesnt load and when I try to go to a different site, it wont load either. It isnt just a problem with Firefox either. When this
 happens, Steam wont work either. I cannot visit the store page or download anything. When this happens, I am still connected to the internet. I have disconnected from my internet and reconnected and it does nothing. I have turned my network card off and back
 on through the Device Manager and that does nothing. The only way to fix it, is to restart my computer. Is there any way to reboot my network or card so that it purges whatever the issue is without restarting my PC? Like I said, it only happens when I visit
 certain websites and it happens everytime those sites are visited. It seems that something in my PC or in Windows freezes and I cannot do anything over my network. I would really appreciate any advice on the issue. Thanks.

You‚Äôll see your balance.<br /><br />Unfortunately Many users have reported having difficulties with the new version. Maybe this could be solved soon.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>NVIDIA GeForce4 MX 4000 is outdated graphic card. There is no graphic card drivers available even for Windows Vista and 7. You can find Windows XP drivers from this NVidia support link (<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_93.71_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_93.71_2.html</a>).
 You can try installing this drivers in compatibility mode, but it may or may not work with Windows 8/8.1.</p>

                    <p>Hello Microsoft community, sorry for asking once again, for some reasons i've issues about login into my Microsoft account and this is going to be a little bit different.</p>
<p>After installing windows 10, everything works just fine except my old game which "Wolfteam".</p>
<p>When I attempt to play this game as quick as possible once login it works correctly without an error.</p>
<p>But when i do try to re log the game *instantly after closing it* or after some work in other applications i get a BSOD&nbsp;</p>
<p>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (xhunter1.sys)</p>
<p>So when I figured out the .sys time i found out that this file size simultaneously getting resized from 63 to 31 kilobytes with the bsod
</p>
<p>Before crash*</p>

<p>
</p><p>The game works perfectly on another pc with windows 10, and i'm not intending to repair or flash back to windows 8</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also opened the BSOD Viewer and found those 2 files causing errors</p>

<p>******xhunter1.sys size gets reduced after every bsod when i replace that file after reboot with the 63 kb version it doesn't crash but i'm not going to do that everytime opening the game*********</p>
<p>I checked Memory test using memtest and windows memory diagnostic tools and found no errors in memory</p>
<p>and also my Hard drive diagnostic tool found nothing.</p>
<p>Driver verify found no error, aswell as scfscan or system health checker and scanning the pc for viruses didn't prove helpful.</p>
<p>Updated my drivers to latest versions aswell as graphic drivers and installed which related to even windows 8.1</p>
<p>This error is really annoying, i'd like to play the game i got used to on this laptop and on windows 10, it works on other but not this one.&nbsp;</p>

 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi, I have a (not that serious, but annoying) problem. The other day I installed the driver for a Vimicro USB camera, but it wouldnt work. So I uninstalled it. The problem is, whenever I start
 my computer, a big "Vimicro has stopped working" sign comes up when i uninstalled it like a week ago! Any help would be appreciated :)</span></p>

            Apparently the Vimicro installation wasn't clean and left a reference to it in your Startup. Remove it as follows:<br />
<br />
<span>Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: msconfig and when it appears in the Results box above, right-click and choose "Run as Administrator".<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue. Then see what is on the Startup tab.&nbsp;You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used the Utility.
 Usually this will be blocked by Windows Defender and you'll need to allow it so you can then tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />
<br />
The free Autoruns program is very useful for managing your Startup - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Microsoft does not supply Vista DVDs to OEM(Acer, HP, etc) branded Computers.<br />
<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://secure.tx.acer.com/RCDB/Main.aspx?brand=acer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.tx.acer.com/RCDB/Main.aspx?brand=acer</a><br />
<br />
Contact&nbsp;Acer at above link&nbsp;and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process<br />
Acer is normally Alt + F10..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by
 selecting the Repair computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the
 disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
