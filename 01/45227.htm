<h2>            Sudden Loss of Internet Conection</h2>
                    <p>For the last five days,&nbsp; I'll be on line, everything is fine, when internet connection is suddenly lost.&nbsp; I get&nbsp; a total blank white page.&nbsp; &nbsp;But it's&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> the wifi signal - it
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is</span> working. &nbsp;I know what screen I'd get if wifi was off or not working.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> that.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wifi signal is&nbsp;trying to get through,&nbsp;the wheels are spinning, but unable&nbsp;to bring up the web site.&nbsp; No web sites at all.&nbsp; None work.&nbsp; And it's happening in I.E and Firefox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While connection is lost, I am able to click on and open&nbsp;battery percentage, the clock, Notepad, etc., but&nbsp;I can not open my A/V software.&nbsp; I click the icon but&nbsp;it won't&nbsp;open.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to reboot to get internet and A/V to work again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've removed cookies and temp files, I spoke to my ISP who checked the connection - both after rebooting and before, while I couldn't access web sites - and they said there's nothing wrong with the connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; My printer can check for firmware updates
 so that signal is getting through. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it was the A/V update notification that might be triggering this, so I stopped that for a while (I could get them manually) but this&nbsp;still happened.&nbsp; So it's not the A/V.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did two command prompts, the "sfc scan now" and "netsh winsock reset."&nbsp;&nbsp; I went into Device Mgr., - the Network adapter - "Power Mgmt." and unchecked the box "to turn device off to save power."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;did a&nbsp;A/V and Maleware scan, checked the network adapter, searched for adapter driver updates, checked for Microsoft updates and downloaded some other updated drivers.&nbsp; But
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I'm still loosing internet connection!</span>&nbsp; Happens suddenly, every couple of hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to 8.1 about a year ago, had some issues and worked through them.&nbsp; Nothing since then...until now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:&nbsp; Instead of losing wifi one or two hrs after a reboot, I lost it after five minutes&nbsp;today.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the wheels were spinning I tried to get it back by turning wifi off, refreshing a page so I can click the button to "fix connection problems" and then
 turned wifi back on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn't find a solution.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, while the wheels were spinning, I did get a notification for an A/V update, so that is getting through.&nbsp; But the update never did, it was stuck at 0%.&nbsp; I eventually rebooted&nbsp;to knock everything back into place.
</p>

            Thank you for your information, but we only had this router two weeks ago, would EE need to look at this proxy error we are having now as this update states 2015? Sorry for all the questions.

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Intel and they did direct me to updated wifi software and driver.&nbsp; After installing&nbsp;it, everything was fine&nbsp;for a good five hours.&nbsp; So I thought the problem was fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp; But last night, my battery re-charging reached 100% so I pulled the power
 cord out of the laptop and immediately lost the web sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulling the cord out triggered it all over again.&nbsp;&nbsp; And what was odd, was that my battery percentage went down to 89% in that one second.&nbsp; When I put the cord back in, it was 100% (go figure).&nbsp;&nbsp; So
 I rebooted and when I got back to the desktop, I checked the battery;&nbsp;I think it was&nbsp;92%.&nbsp; So I recharged and when it got to 100% , pulled the cord out and everything was fine, I was able to accesses web sites.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But today, about five minutes after turning the laptop on, it happened again.&nbsp; Web sites weren't loading.&nbsp;&nbsp;I rebooted but&nbsp;five minutes later, lost connection again.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(I should point out that when all this started on Jan. 11, it was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span>&nbsp;because I pulled out the power cord.&nbsp; It happened on its own. &nbsp;Something else must have triggered it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the 11th&nbsp;I wasn't&nbsp;keeping track if the power cord was in or out when&nbsp;connection was lost - now about 15 times since Jan. 11 -&nbsp;although it
 is&nbsp;plugged in about 75% of the time.&nbsp; The battery was never any good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting last night aside, not once&nbsp;was&nbsp;connection lost due to&nbsp;putting in or taking out the power cord.&nbsp; &nbsp;I should also point out that I did change a couple of battery settings the other
 day,&nbsp;about six days after this problem started.&nbsp; So last night after I pulled out the cord&nbsp;and lost the web sites, I put the setting back to what I had.)</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I'm not sure what is&nbsp;triggering this, but I think the new software and driver that I installed probably did fix the issue; but for some reason pulling the cord out last night triggered it all over&nbsp;again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could uninstall and reinstall the software
 and driver&nbsp;and maybe turning wifi off before pulling&nbsp;out the power cord, although that probably won't make a difference.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I don't know what else to do. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>FWIW, two hours before this began on Jan. 11, I did install printer software.&nbsp; Even though I really doubt that's what's causing this, I did uninstall the software, but it didn't do any good.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still lost connection with web sites.&nbsp; So I reinstalled
 it. </span></p>

            <p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems odd that the pulling out the cord triggers disconnection of your wifi connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe if you can provide some other information, we can try to isolate what's going on.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When laptop lose the internet connection, were you able to check the "status indicator" of the Network Connection icon (lower right hand corner)?</li><li>When laptop lose the internet connection, go to&nbsp;<em>Start</em> &gt; Type <em>cmd
</em>then press enter &gt; On the Command Prompt, type <em>ipconfig/all </em>then screenshot the result and post it here.</li></ul>

            <p>Don't see any "status indicator."&nbsp;&nbsp; But the wifi is working, if that's what you're asking. And what is important in that command prompt?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd go hours without this happening.&nbsp; Then it'll happen twice within 10 mins. and a third time soon thereafter.&nbsp;&nbsp; No rhyme or reason. &nbsp;I've tried everything to fix this.&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel seems to think this is hardware related, the adapter.&nbsp; </p>

Where to get hardware drivers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people, including me,&nbsp;are in the same position - computer makers are not even testing older computers for compatibility.&nbsp; Getting the most appropriate drivers will give you the best chance of Windows 10 running acceptably but there is, of course, no
 guarantee that it will run at all let alone satisfactorily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might&nbsp;find further useful advice by looking for reports of the experiences of&nbsp;other users of your computer model - search for your make &amp; model by name
</p>
<ul>
<li>search for <em>computer make &amp; model </em>in this Windows 10 forum, </li><li>search for <em>Windows 10 computer make &amp; model </em>in your computer maker's user forum [if they have one] and
</li><li>consider doing a general online search for <em>Windows 10 computer make &amp; model</em> [but expect to waste a lot of time reading webpages that are of no use to you].</li></ul>

            Microsoft support looked at my machine and said the hardware is compatible but without updated drivers they can't do anything. &nbsp;For some reason not explained gateway has said they won't support this model which is only a couple of years old&nbsp;

            The install simply stalls at 70-80% and a message says the install could not be completed and the previous version will be reinstalled. &nbsp;Microsoft support says that gateway has not provided the drivers needed, gateway says won't support this model. &nbsp;Gateway
 support is non existent. &nbsp;I was wondering if there is any other way of identifying the drivers needed.

            If there were a way of identifying the problem drivers, where would you get new ones?&nbsp; The chances are that it's motherboard drivers that are the problem and by messing around with those you could trash your current working installation.&nbsp;

            I guess this means I won't be able to upgrade. &nbsp;This is frustrating because the PC is only a few years old. &nbsp;I don't think I would ever buy a Gateway or Acer ever again because of the lack of support

<h2>            Microsoft Office Click-to-run and Avast SecureLine service getting disabled after booting PC</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 is disabling 2 key services every time it starts up. The First is the Microsoft Office Click-to-run service which is needed to start Office 365 and the second is Avast SecureLine which is required for my VPN to run. Windows actually sets both
 of these as disabled. I have to go into the Services Module and reset them to Automatic every time the computer starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I prevent Windows from disabling these services?</p>

<p>Hi Prakhar</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Not aware of any changes being made to the PC</p>
<p>2 Windows 10 Home Version 1803, OS Build 17134.648</p>
<p>3. I set it to automatic but on reboot they come back as disabled. Also, the SecureLine service, even when I set it to automatic, after I have started the VPN it will run for between 30 seconds and 3 minutes before automatically disconnecting. I do this
 twice and then Windows has reset the Service to disabed. Very frustrating. I will try the Batch file a little later tonight and get back to you.</p>

<p>I tried the batch files as suggested. The only thing it achieved is to double the amount of time it takes for my PC to start. Still having the issue with Avast SecureLine. Will connect&nbsp; but disconnects itself after between 30 seconds and three minutes. On
 the third disconnect&nbsp; I get an error message stating Avast Secure Line service is not responding - restart service. When I go into the services module Avast SecureLine is now set at Disabled. I reset it to automatic and then the same thing happens, two connects,
 two disconnects and on the third disconnect the Service is again set to disabled. One temporary fix is to uninstall Secure Line, reboot the PC, reinstall secureline and then run it without restarting the PC. Will remain connected for about 48 hours then the
 whole 3 connects, 3 disconnects, restart disabled service happens again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the techs from Avast looking into it but so far they can't find the reason for this occuring. I have provided them with Log dumps using the Avast Support tool. Currently waiting on comment on the last log dumps I sent to them this morning</p>

    <title>Free disk space not updating after permanently deleting 200 gigs off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yuval roth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Free disk space not updating after permanently deleting 200 gigs off my drive in one time</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other day i noticed my C partition became almost full for some reason and i looked at all the files in the directory and it said there's only 175 gigs of files in it. My C partition has 488 gigs, so that's obviously not right. i ran a tool called WinDirStat
 as someone advised to me that it will tell me where is the biggest use of data. So did it do. And i also found out why didn't i see it; because it was in the ProgramData folder which is hidden. The folder was Kaspersky's folder, where the tracers logs are
 kept and they build up to be incredibly huge files without you even noticing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder was 199.8 gigs. The largest file was 38 something gigs and there were many 1.5 gig ones. So, i looked it up and kaspersky say that it is completely safe to delete those files, as they are just logs.
</p>
<p>So, did i do. I also wiped some more unused files with the tool in the anti virus... which cleared up like 20 gigs on its own. but i found that from all that, i regained only 50 gigs back from my occupied space, and that's it. it's like the free space got
 corrupt and the system doesn't know there's nothing there. In the tool, it shows 150 gigs of "Unknown" space - obviously another word of saying corrupt space; A space without anything behind it. I made sure that the recycle bin is empty, i did a restart and
 i even defragged my disk.</p>
<p>i thought, 200 gigs just got removed, there should be at least 20% fragmented.... it makes sense... like.. that's a pretty big slice of the disk. it said that the disk in only 3% fragmented. I have yet to run error checking on the disk, nor did i find any
 real solution on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help for this, because i really have no idea what happened.. i never erased 200 gigs off my disk like that in one blow, and i didn't even think that this big a hit could cause some problems...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't bother telling me to do a recovery because i don't keep back files. i found them absolutely irritating, and when i did keep them.. it occupied my whole D drive which was 450 gigs. I'd much rather simply not install **** from the internet that is filled
 with viruses than to keep my pc under tight backup. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if i don't get this fixed without a disk wipe, i'm pretty sure i can live with it... i've got 165 gigs free space.. that's more than i will need any time soon.. but i would really like to have my full 488 gigs worth of hard drive since i am recording
 a lot of videos, but that's on my D drive, but still i have a lot of free space there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a head if anyone knows what to do with this. </p>

 upgrade for the WINDOWS 10 and now they want us all to pay $14.95 for the stupid DVD/CD player in order for it to work! Wrong kind of business decision. Look at what I found when they say if you had Windows 8 they will not give you the free fix for their stupidly
 designed so called fix! I don't think I have ever been so stressed out in my life!</p>
<p>This is from their support board" </p>

            You can wait until Oct 17th when the new Fall Creators Update Version 1709 is released, install Media Creation tool to Upgrade Now which is the most stable method to change to the new version which you need anyway. Since it reinstalls Windows while avoiding buggy Windows Update, chances are it will repair the problem. If it doesn't you'll know that a program or setting conflict is the likely cause, since these are retained..
<br />
<br />Media Creation Tool here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If problems arise during Upgrade go over these steps which overcome most hurdles in Upgrades if you complete them all:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If problem persists after upgrade to new Version then I would go over this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>I also had endless reboot and managed to stop it by choosing the option to reinstall Windows (although I was going to loose all my apps). I now have the pre - update version in, but despite turning Windows updates off, I keep being threatened with this damn
 creator update every day I get a pop up asking me to reboot and update to which I say remind me later although I would rather there was a button saying go away forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today it started installing itself when I was away from my computer and I managed to stop it by rebooting, but at some point this is going to force me to do the update and then I won't have use of my computer. Microsoft, if you must force updates on us are
 you going to buy me another computer when you break mine?</p>

<p>I just posted on another <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/fall-creators-update-broke-my-computer/860acd5b-81fa-4f46-a66c-31a3081a575b?">
thread</a>:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>"I've been having the same problem since November. Finally I've gotten a straight answer. The hardware in my computer is old and isn't compatible with the creators update. It was running Windows 10 before but it flat out doesn't work with the creators update
 onward. And I wasn't able to remove the downloaded updates or disable the update process. I tried several times with support. Gonna install Linux on that machine and buy a new PC if I want to use Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I'm really upset that the possibility that it might be a hardware issue never came up. Everyone I talked to just tried walking through update and install procedures again and again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Eventually they suggested I talk to the manufacturer. The manufacturer immediately said it might be a hardware issue. Everyone from that point on agreed that with the hardware I was on, the Creator's Update wouldn't work, but older versions of Windows 10 would.
 If that's common knowledge I would have like to have known it months ago.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's been so frustrating trying to get my computer to work over the past few months, having it force shut down when I'm trying to use it, having to wait for it restore previous versions every time, disabling auto updates not working so the problem never went
 away.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There doesn't seem to be any information about hardware compatibility when troubleshooting the update. I hope relevant information somehow finds its way to anyone in the same boat as I am."&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Looks like the long awaited windows 10 update is a failure. I am willing to work with Microsoft for a while but I am in need of a new PC and if I can't update then I will be forced to go to the "other" folks for both the equipment and the software. Been
 a 20+ year windows user through thick and thin but this may be the straw that breaks my back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Downloaded the new OS from the website. Installed in about an hour. Seems to be stable and working well so far.

 revert back to Win7 to find a fix...<br />

<p>Yup... He's got his sources right. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, all that out of the table, Agarest War was placed into the Japanese marketplace on March 10 of 2010... And even the second game, its prequal, was set up there last month. So, it's not region specific.</p>
<p>All we really know is that it had its planned August 2 release at least up till the 26th of July--And this was either a large misnomer, or a plan which entirely fell through the cracks with not a word in under a week.</p>
<p>Just wanna know what's up. :P</p>

<h2>            Translating Instant Messaging in Skype 8.12.0.14.</h2>
                    <p>I have just updated Skype to 8.12.0.14.&nbsp; I am using Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite looking at the help pages I cannot work out how to translate instant messages received in Russian into English.&nbsp; I do not need voice translation, just text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously - in all other versions -&nbsp; I had clicked on the global translate icon and chosen Russian when I needed to, and the tranlation was available if I clicked on the text (at worst) - more often the translation happened instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How I do not seem to be offered that option at all.&nbsp; I cannot find the global translate icon.&nbsp; How do I do this in the new version? Help pages suggest a new group with Skype Translator as part of it, but that seemed to do nothing useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade failed &#40;C1900101&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to upgrade to Win10. Invariably, it restarts when it's at 75% (100% done installing features and drivers), says "your PC didn't start correctly", goes to "Auto Repair" then "Diagnosing" and leaves me no choice but to roll back to Win7.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">These are the error codes I found in Win Update History:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">8007025d, 80240020, and C1900101 (got this one for the past 5 times now)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My antivirus is MS Essentials. I'm not using TuneUp Utilities or any such software (except ASRock xtreme tuner and instant boot, which were delivered with my MoBo)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a similar problem in Win7 with updates KB3045999 and KB3068708. I had to use system restore to get my PC working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My configuration is the following:</p>
<p>Windows 7 x64</p>
<p>Intel Core i7-2600k</p>
<p>ASRock z77</p>
<p>16 GB RAM</p>
<p>Sapphire Radeon HD 6850</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to download Windows 10 from the following link and perform custom install. When it prompts for the product key you can skip that step and install Windows 10. To perform custom install you need to have qualifying operating system with activated.<br />
<br />
Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install</span></a><br />
<br />
<strong>Also refer to the link: How to: Troubleshoot common Setup and Stop Errors during Windows 10 Installation<br />

            <p>I had this same problem and was finally able to fix it after 5 failed upgrade attempts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a copy of my C: drive on a spare hard drive before I started and ran the upgrade on the copy just in case something went wrong.&nbsp; I'm going to list everything I did here since I can't be 100% sure the upgrade would have worked without all of the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Uninstall the virus scanner and any other real time protection software.</p>
<p>2) Set up Windows to boot without any unnecessary startup programs or services.&nbsp; Disable all non-Microsoft services and all startup items.</p>
<p>3) Disconnect all hard drives other than the C: drive.</p>
<p>4) Disconnect all USB devices other than the keyboard and the mouse.</p>
<p>5) AND I THINK THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE.&nbsp; If your hard drive is connected to a SATA3 port on the motherboard, move it to a SATA2 port for the upgrade process and then you can move it back after the upgrade has completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created an upgrade DVD and did the upgrade from there but I don't think that made any difference.</p>

<h2>            ms security essentials windows security center discrepancy</h2>
                    XP Pro 32 with SP3<br />
<br />
Windows Security Center status is red on the task bar and when Security Center is opened it states that I have no virus protection.<br />
<br />
MS Security Essentials status is green on the task bar and when Security Essentials is opened it states that I have protection.<br />
<br />
I don't know which is true, which to trust, and there seems like the two don't want to work together.<br />
<br />
1st Question: Is there a fix for this?&nbsp; So the two agree always.<br />
<br />
2nd Question: Why is there no easy option to exit/stop MS Security Essentials on the task bar, then restart it that would allow it to alert the Security Center to sense that its back up and running?&nbsp; Other virus protection programs allow this selection and
 user control.<br />

            I managed to fix it.... what I did is when it reboots... press F8 F9 F10 F11 F12, I dont really know which is the one that will take you to troubleshooting, so just press them all haha. Once you are in there go to advanced options and go to the one that
 its in the bottom left.. I think it says fix sytem or something like that... It will ask you for your user password (if you dont have one leave it blank) and then it will fix it...&nbsp; hopefully

<h2>            Errors after Errors &#40;Black Screen, srttrail.txt, unable to refresh, unable to update&#41;</h2>
                    Hi there. i've had this problem since i first install windows 8. i ignored it and its really bugging me now since i need to open boot screen to turn on the system. Everytime i tried to turn it on, it turns into a black screen with only my pointer showing.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried following existing 'solutions' by googling it. I've done the <i>/scannow</i> and it shows that theres nothing wrong. i tried to diagnose with the repair thing and it leads me to my next problem. it says i got the
<i>srt/srttrail.txt</i> problems. and i cant automatically fix it. after another round of google and 'solutions'. i tried to do a refresh, yet i cant since my computer keeps saying that the media inserted is not valid.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>is there any other way for me to fix this problem without going to the store (which i doubt will help) or start a fresh install?i really dont want to lose all of my files and i dont want to go to the torture of installing windows 8 again (i had lots of
 rare problems installing it too)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Oh and some additional problems. everytime i tried to do a&nbsp;WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab</div>
<div>it tells me that Problems installing recent updates is Not Fixed all the time. and Check for missing or corrupt files is detected but nothing is done.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Carla,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your issue on Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error message when you connect the hard drive?</p>
<p>3. Is the hard drive working on other computers?</p>
<p>4. Does the hard drive work on other USB ports?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few methods which you can follow to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Hardware devices not detected or not working:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardware_device_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardware_device_problems</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Download and install latest drivers from manufacturer's website.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seagate.com/support/external-hard-drives/portable-hard-drives/goflex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.seagate.com/support/external-hard-drives/portable-hard-drives/goflex/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4:</strong></p>
<p>To disable and re-enable the USB controllers, follow these steps:<br />
a. Click Start, type device manager in the Start search box and hit Enter.<br />
b. Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers.<br />
Note: You might have to scroll down the list to find this item.<br />
c. Right-click the first USB controller under Universal Serial Bus controllers, and then click Uninstall to remove it.<br />
d. Repeat the above step for each USB controller that is listed under Universal Serial Bus controllers.<br />
e. Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.<br />
f. Check the USB device to see whether it is working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 5:</strong></p>
<p>Refer this link for steps on how to add a drive letter to the disk.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this resolves the issue.</p>

                    <p>After updating to Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, I noticed that the thumbnails for my folders and files keep refreshing or re-creating itself. I had the same problem with the previous version of Windows 10, but at least then it took days or weeks to refresh
 or re-create the thumbnails, but now it's constantly doing it. Really annoying! any help?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Corrupted thumbnail cache is one of the possible reasons why it keeps on refreshing or re-creating itself. To reset the thumbnail cache on Windows 10 using Disk Cleanup, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File </strong><strong>Explorer</strong>.</li><li>On the left pane, click <strong>This </strong><strong>PC</strong>. Right-click the C: drive where Windows 10 is installed, and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> button</li><li>Check the <strong>Thumbnails </strong>option, and uncheck all the other options.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Delete </strong><strong>Files </strong>to confirm and to complete the task.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest that you try creating a new local user account to isolate the issue. To create a new local user account, kindly follow the steps in this

<p>This seems to happening to a lot of us since the recent update to 1709. From what I've seen elsewhere a temporary solution is disabling the task which "cleans" the thumbnail image cache, which is obviously running far too often since the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>See here:<br />
https://www.tenforums.com/general-support/96198-after-creators-update-2-thumbnails-cache-keeps-auto-deleting-3.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>They suggest: ("To do that, run Regedit.exe and browse the following path:</p>
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\VolumeCaches\Thumbnail Cache</div>
<div>Modify Autoruns DWORD and set its value to 0 and reboot your computer.</div>
<div>Now Automatic Maintenance should no longer delete your thumbnails.")</div>

<p>According to another post:</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/after-fall-update-windows-10-puts-a-maximum-size/6ad0a1e7-38c0-4547-9b8b-f7f3906c3a12</p>
<p>Looks like the fall creator update puts a limit on thumbnail cache size, which result in "reflesh" all the time especially for users with lots of images/videos.<br />

<p>Hey all, I am experiencing the same issue. It seems completely random the times that the problem occurs, for the last 24hrs after using the disk clean up tool everything seemed fine, even after waking the laptop from sleep this morning. Then this afternoon
 I saved a new file from my browser to an existing folder and that immediately caused all the thumbnails to refresh???</p>
<p>I am not sure this is related, but the taskbar app icons preview of opened apps seems to stop displaying the pop up image of the opened app as well since the Creators Fall update. I have only just noticed this and am unsure if its at the same time as the
 File Explorer thumbnail refresh bug. Hopefully an update fix will be issued soon.</p>

<p>Thanks Eric for confirmation of Microsoft is on the case. This link is to feedback I posted a few days ago. I tried to capture the error but could not get my system to do it at the time of posting, It seems to happen completely randomly. Today I have spent
 all day trying to fix my system with a non functioning taskbar, unable to do anything other than force shutdown and restart. Numerous attempts from forums have finally got it going again, had enough of technology for today.</p>
