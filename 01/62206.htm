<h2>            Yahoo Home Page Front Size</h2>
                    I have Windows.&nbsp; Recently the font size on my home page and any links from emails is very small.&nbsp; Can you let me know how to increase hte size.&nbsp; For the rest of my computer I go to Start, Display, Settings...and I can increase the size (for example my
 Outlook and size of desktop icons), but it doesn't work for my Yahoo page.

Hello Deadhead312, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mention that you downloaded the Google app.&nbsp; Can you provide the exact name of the app that you downloaded? Was this downloaded from the Microsoft Store or from a website? Does the Google app use the modern UI, or does it run from the desktop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app was called Google Search and I downloaded it from the Windows 8 store.&nbsp; It's doesn't run from the desktop.&nbsp; It runs from the new Windows 8 startup screen (if that's what you mean by "modern UI".&nbsp; Many Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Virus preventing valid IP </h2>
                    
<p>I&nbsp;was running Vista&nbsp;with SP1 on a laptop that&nbsp;was been&nbsp;infected with a virus, but had no issue with accessign the internet.&nbsp;I loaded Eset NOD32 Virus protection software which identified&nbsp;several viruses and was correcting the issue.&nbsp;In the process&nbsp;I&nbsp;upgraded
 to SP2, and downloaded several MS security patches. Along the way, my internet access stopped working. I've attempted to connect both at the office and my home, LAN &amp; WLAN with no success. The IP address is invalid, and despite reseting the routers, I have
 no success. I've read numerous threads and followed several suggestions with no success. I've attempted the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabled bonjour &amp; reloaded the newest version </li><li>Removed the network drivers and reloaded </li><li>Attempted the use&nbsp;of a&nbsp;valid static IP </li><li>Loaded Firefox </li></ul>
<p>I have other computers on the same routers with no issues. Since I'm not receiving a valid IP, I'm assuming that it's not a browser issue. It feels like I'm searching for a needle in a haystack to find a setting that the virus changed to prevent a valid
 and internent access. I'm hoping to find a solution short of reimaging the hard drive and starting over...</p>

<h2>            Skype 8.x silent uninstall</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are using centralised deployment for last version of Skype (currently 8.14.0.10).
</p>
<p>I'm using automaticaly deployed script which removes all 6.x and 7.x versions of skype and installs the last version 8.x.x.x.<strong>exe</strong></p>
<p>I'm wondering if i need to update skype what should I do?</p>
<p>For Example:</p>
<p>Lets presume that the nex version is 8.14.0.<strong>12.<br />
</strong>Should I have to remove 8.14.0.<strong>10</strong>&nbsp;first or it is OK if I just run the 8.14.0.<strong>12&nbsp;</strong>insttall.?</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The new Skype is set by default to auto-update itself. However, there is no need to uninstall the previous versions as the new ones will just override
 them. </span></p>

<p>It is stupid and counterproductive decision to update anything without preliminary testing and approving from enterprise security department. Skype 7.40.xx has enough issues and vulerabilities to uninstall it from customer os.<br />
Where is the MSI for any Skype 8.xx version? Why we should install 12.xx for Windows 10?&nbsp; Where is version control?<br />
It seems that Skype team focusing on smiles and themes as essential project development strategy.<br />
Idea of forcing enterprise customer to use Skype for Business leads Skype prject to lose market (because Skype for Business is the same bull... as Lync). What are they doing with Skype Communications S.a r.l. legacy that costed Microsoft 8 bln?</p>

<p>Where did you purchase this MSDN license?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Product keys from MSDN subscriptions should not be sold separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN)
 or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided
 is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either
 giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The
 person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused
 and blocked the key from further use.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Sudden screeching audio and graphics lag spike in game and video watching</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I have an HP ENVY 15 laptop that I've been using for two years, and in the past few months, it started doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">So, for quite a few months now, when I am playing Dota 2 or watching youtube videos, my HP ENVY 15&nbsp;will suddenly lag and a screeching noise will come through my headphones. It essentially freezes
 up and I have trouble getting the mouse and keyboard to respond as well. After about a minute of screeching and intense lag, it slowly starts working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I searched the internet and found this archived thread about an ASUS laptop that was experiencing the same problem as mine. &nbsp;<a href="http://rog.asus.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-14960.html?s=d5a890ce396bc7d95eb5990f9123650a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rog.asus.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-1496</a></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">In that thread, they seemed to think the network drivers or Mcafee was causing the problem. I dont' have Mcafee, and I updated my Realtek LAN drivers, and the problem has not gone away. In that thread,
 someone posted a youtube video showing the lag, and it is exactly the same thing that is happening to me:</p>

            Hi Muhammad.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> File History, Windows file and Image backup are dysfunctional and may be phased out in a future version.  But they're not the best choices anyway because after ten years in forums I've seen countless times that files are lost trying to restore them, so  feel obligated to recommend choices that work much better and are 100% reliable.  
<br />
<br />The safest and most reliable method is to sort your files into their User Folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, etc) and periodically drag or copy them to external or another hard drive.  
<br />
<br />Then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  You can also choose to sync the Desktop, Pictures and Documents folders (only) in Settings &gt; Autosave.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br /> Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>.  
<br />
<br />There is an easy way to mount the System Image to extract files if needed.  Some prefer to move their User folders off of C to make the image smaller so they stay current if you need to reimage C.  Here's how:  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-change-the-location-of-user-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-syst...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Windows backup &amp; maybe in the future file history are being deprecated &amp; will eventually be removed, what you’re experiencing may be related to that. 
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/w8cookbook/windows-7-backup-and-restore-deprecated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deskto...</a>
<br />
<br />Microsoft recommend using third party software:
<br />“System Image Backup (SIB) Solution
<br />We recommend that users use full-disk backup solutions from other vendors.”
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034825/features-that-are-removed-or-deprecated-in-windows-10-fall-creators-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403482...</a>
<br />
<br />I recommend moving to third party imaging software now before it is removed permanently  if you prefer backing up your PC rather than using File history.
<br />Many users recommend Macrium Reflect free:
<br /><a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree</a>
<br />
<br />You can create a schedule to auto run the backup every so often (Monthly, weekly, daily), once the full backup is created (my 2 Tb HD take 4 hours to run a full backup &amp; verify), the free version can then run a differential image the other days (incremental images are a premium feature which only backs up the changes since the last backup).

</blockquote>
<p>If that's the case then you're doing something wrong. Reflect can do backups and restores in minutes, unless you have an unusually large C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should have a look at the Macrium Reflect knowledgebase, which has detailed instructions for creating backups. Here is an excerpt:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Reflect also has its own community forum, which you can find <a href="https://forum.macrium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Dedicated Graphics Card Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adityajhanjee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dedicated Graphics Card Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP-Pavilion 15 N007AX laptop PC and I have AMD Radeon HD 7620G+8670M dual graphics configuration. Windows 8. I think that games like Dying Light, Grand Theft Auto 5 do not recognize the AMD Radeon HD 8670M graphics card and the games only run on
 the integrated chipset. If they ran on both the graphics cards, surely it wouldn't give me 15 fps. I have heard that games don't run well on integrated chipsets but I do have a dedicated graphics card. So, it should run fine like 20+fps. What I did was I first
 disabled the integrated chipset, the game lags. When i disable the dedicated chipset, it runs on 1 fps. And I have the 14.4 drivers for my graphics card. When i try to install other drivers e.g 15.7 then it doesn't get installed. So, should I upgrade to windows
 8.1 and then try to update the drivers and play these games again or is there any solution to my problem i.e low fps in games because I am pretty sure that on a dual graphics configuration, games do not run on 15 fps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Counting on your reply,</p>
<p>Aditya.</p>

    <title>Volume controls on keyboard not working, and battery charging icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jourdankile  say:</h3>
<h2>            Volume controls on keyboard not working, and battery charging icon missing</h2>
                    <p>Okay so this started happening a few days ago. The control volumes on my keyboard (at f6 and f7) have stopped working. It used to be that I would just press the button and it would work- now I have to type fn before pressing it. The bug/glitch or whatever
 only occurs after my laptop sleeps and I turn it back on. Usually, when I restart my laptop, it's fixed and I don't have to press fn. This wasn't a problem until I also noticed that my battery charging notification stopped working - the battery icon itself
 is still there, but it won't show if it's charging or if the battery is depleting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not changed anything. I tried to do a manual update on windows to see if that would help but to no success. When I try to go update my laptop after it's been woken up from sleep mode, the update gets stuck and it won't "conclude" so to speak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to anyone reading this. I know it's a lot, but it just seemed like everything happened at once.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If needed, I have a HP 15 Pavillion Notebook PC with intel i7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading this!</p>

            <p>If suddenly a function key that doesn't require FN in Windows changes to require the FN key reserved for triggering Boot functions, it likely has a bug that's toggling it.&nbsp; Normally the FN keys are enabled or disabled for function keys (or vice versa for
 BIOS keys) in the BIOS.&nbsp; That model has UEFI firmware so you'd enter it via the Recovery Settings to look for it.&nbsp;

            <p>Okay so I reinstalled my BIOS and I'm waiting to see if that would fix it. Started my laptop in safe mode, and the only thing with a yellow caution sign next to it was the generic pnp monitor (tried updating it, already updated). All of my devices are updated.</p>
<p>While restarting my computer, windows went into the blue screen and stated that there was a "driver power state failure".&nbsp; Not sure if that has something to do with what is/was going on with my laptop.</p>

            <p>1. I did not do a clean install of windows. I went to the manufacturers website and installed the bios from the website because I read on another forum that it could've possibly been corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The BIOS setting for the function keys were already enabled. I knew that wasn't the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I booted my laptop into safe mode, looked into device manager, and saw that the generic pnp monitor had a little ! by it. Went into normal mode, it was solved.</p>
<p>

            <p>Okay so I reset windows like Greg had recommended. It was working fine. I updated windows (using windows update) all the way to the most recent update (that comes with the windows 10 creator update reveal thing) and I updated all my devices. Left my computer
 for a few minutes, came back, woke it from sleep, and it was doing the same thing again (slow to respond to battery being plugged in and unplugged, unable to troubleshoot, windows update stuck, unable to attempt to update drivers).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried restarting to see if it would give the driver state failure BSOD screen again, but after 30 minutes I just manually turned it off (held down the power button). No minidump yet (the previous ones got lost when I reset windows) but I'll upload one
 if I ever get it. So... I have no idea what it could be. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>

<p>Hey there Redstone, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with connecting the Xbox One controller to PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the PC does not have Bluetooth capabilities, there are 2 things to try:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1: USB</strong>
<p>Plug a USB charging cable into the front of the controller and plug the other end into your PC.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Option 2: Xbox Wireless (with Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows, sold separately)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>On your PC, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices</strong>. </li></ol>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Add Bluetooth or other device</strong>.</li></ol>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Everything else</strong>.</li></ol>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Xbox Wireless Controller</strong>.</li></ol>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Done</strong>.</li></ol>
</li></ul>
<p>If the problem persists, try a different controller to help isolate the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this and let us know the results. </p>

<h2>            Help Wanted&#58; How to re-install Wordpad &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello--</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My Wordpad program&nbsp;has gone missing. I am able to locate wordpad.exe under Program Files. All the icons on the taskbar/Start Menu are also still there. But when I try to start Wordpad directly (by double-clicking wordpad.exe&nbsp;or by clicking on an icon) nothing
 happens. No error messages, just a whole bunch of nothing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Wordpad has worked before...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone please help me to get it back or tell me&nbsp;how to&nbsp;re-install it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for all your efforts.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tink</p>

While I dont think re-installing it will work here is how&nbsp; http://www.ehow.com/how_5087979_reinstall-wordpad.html<br />
<br />
I suspect it is something amiss in the system which you can check in event viewer\application<br />

eventvwr&gt;&nbsp; WIn + "X"&gt;event viewer<br />
<br />
(or type eventvwr in run)<br />

            <p><strong>Why was the file name changed?</strong>&nbsp; I am assuming that a MS Update made this change and it messed something up when changing the file name.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Write.exe can be found in the obvious following locations:</span></p>
<p>(there are probably more locations that I can't be bothered to do a search for)</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows</p>
<p>C:\Windows\system32</p>
<p>C:\Windows\SysWOW64</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an attempt to restore access to the file by re-pinning it to my Start Menu, it is now listed as
<strong>Windows Write</strong>.&nbsp; MS also knows that people are going to search for WordPad to no avail.&nbsp; Also, when you open 'Windows Write'
<strong>the Title and Info sections still display 'WordPad' as the Program</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing that it is a ploy to get more people to sign up for Office because they won't know to look for the new write.exe or Windows Write nor will they recognize the new thumbnail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system states that write.exe is an original file that was created on October 28, 2014 which indicates to me that wordpad.exe was deleted and replaced with write.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for letting me know to look for write.exe!</p>

<h2>            Code&#58; 0x00000001 whenever I attempt to play Graphically-intensive MSFT Store games &#43; Classic games&#39; video output freezing</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c2bbc4d-d92d-4ab0-9d6c-4ab39e7c07b0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c2bbc4d-d92d-4ab0-9d6c-4ab39e7c07b0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>At random intervals when playing games downloaded from the Microsoft Store, I receive the error '0x00000001' in a pop-up box with the header 'Fatal error'. This usually appears when playing World Of Tanks Blitz, as it's the only vaguely graphically-intensive
 game that I've downloaded from the Microsoft Store. However, a similar issue also occurs when playing 'Classic' games (downloaded via Steam, the Epic Games Launcher, etc) yet they merely freeze all video output (audio etc continues to function) with no error
 of any kind. Please note that I can play both Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (the UWP version).</p>
<p>I attempted to fix this myself by reinstalling Windows 10 and afterwards installing mainly UWP apps over Classic apps, but those didn't help.<br />
</p>
<p>Thus, I searched the web and found two possible solutions:</p>
<p>- Install a more beefy power supply</p>
<p>- Check cooling stuff on CPU</p>
<p>Any of these sound like they might help? I'd rather not take apart my PC but if it's necessary I shall.</p>
<p>

            Hi, I´m Douglas M. 
<br />
<br />I would like to help you, let's try the following:
<br />
<br />Verify that all your hardware is compatible with the Vista operating system.
<br />Verify that all the software updates are installed for the current Operating system as well as on all device drivers and external third party software on the system.
<br />If this error showed up when the computer was restarting, go to Step 8. If the computer was operating normally when this error occurred, then continue to Step 4.
<br />Check the “Problem Reports and Solutions” page or VISTA. Click on Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System and Maintenance-&gt;Problem Reports and Solutions. This facility searches online for device driver updates and solutions to problems caused by external hardware or software.
<br />If the error appears during restart (and the restart is successful in spite of the error) , set the Windows Memory Diagnostic to get more details about the problems during restart. Then go to Step 8. 
<br />
<br />a. Click on Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;Accessories. Right-click on Command-Prompt and choose “Run as administrator”
<br />b. Enter mdshed.exe at the command prompt. Schedule the tool to run at the next restart.
<br />Run the Memory Diagnostics Tool on Vista to see if the memory is corrupted. This is a very useful application that can detect memory errors during restarts. To configure this tool:
<br />
<br />a. Close all applications.
<br />b. Click on the Start button and in the Search field, type “Memory Diagnostics Tool”. 
<br />c. Choose what type of tests you want to run from the options provided.
<br />d. Choose the cache setting for each test and the pass count ( number of times to repeat each test)
<br />e. Set it to run immediately and follow the prompts. Computer restarts.
<br />f. If the tool finds memory errors, it reports it immediately.
<br />Try to restore the system to a previous restore point. Click on the Windows Start button and type “System Restore” into the Search field. The System Restore application comes up. Choose a restore point and continue to restore system.
<br />Try to restart the computer again. If you cannot restart it using the mouse or keyboard options, shut down the computer by pressing down the manual Power button for a few seconds. When the computer has completely shut down, press the button again to restart the computer.
<br />As the computer restarts, press and hold the F8 key before the Windows Logo appears.
<br />Use the arrow keys to select “Repair the computer” in the “Advanced Boot Options” menu.
<br />Choose a keyboard layout and login using username and password. You will need administrator password if it is set on the system. If you have never set it, then just click on “Continue”.
<br />Choose Startup Repair from the menu for “System Recovery Options”. The Startup Repair process will try to repair the computer.
<br />If this does not solve the problem, check the CD-ROM driver and try to install another one. Open up the chassis and check the motherboard. Reseat the memory chips. Check the power supply. If you have testing equipment for the hardware, use them to detect any hardware malfunctions
<br />If none of the above works, you may have to reformat the drive and re-install the operating system.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />kinds Regards       
        </p>

<p>There's no picture of your Device Manager in this thread. Looks like your GTX460 with 768MB VRAM is getting too stressed to run the new games. I recommend upgrading your GPU.</p>

<h2>            Nvidia Graphics Card Does Not Show Up In Device Manager, Unable To Update Drivers, No Signal On The Monitor, Using Intel HD Graphics</h2>
                    <p>This problem has been persisting for 3 moths now on my Nvidia GeForce GTS 250. One day I restarted my computer because I was updating drivers but as soon as the PC opened i received a No Input Signal on my monitor (I am Using A VGA Chord). Then I switched
 the PCI bus to Open My PC where I can see things so I was stuck using my Intel HD Graphics. But not permanently sometimes the Intel Driver would not output any signal and I would switch it into the other PCI Bus and I am back on my Nvidia Graphics. Last month
 though the Nvidia did not ouput any signal and I switched to the Intel HD Graphics now but is is still working and when I plug it back into my Nvidia it doesn't output any signal. Now I can't Update Drivers And can't see my Nvidia Driver until I do these steps</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Command Prompt(Admin)</p>
<p>2. Type "devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1" and hit enter</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Type Start "DEVMGMT.MSC"&nbsp;and hit enter.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Once in Device Manager hit the View menu and select show hidden devices.<br />
<br />
And When I Click On My Nvidia GTS It Says It Is Not Connected And When I Do Connect It On The Right PCI Bus It Outputs No Signal.<br />
<br />
So Can Someone Help Me Without Opening My Computer Case And Only Doing It Through Software?</p>

<h2>            activate&#47;deactivate interface command-line</h2>
                    
<p>I am using Windows XP Pro 2002, sp2, German.</p>
<p>I often have to connect to several different VPNs, whose software rarely work well together (when one is started, the one one won't work etc).</p>
<p>I need to be able to activate/deactivate one of the "pseudo" network interfaces listed in the settings/network connections, and would like to be able to do that using a command file (.bat,.cmd).&nbsp; The "netsh" utility allows many similar things, but apparently
 not that particular function.&nbsp; What I would like is to do the same via a command-line, as the "activate/deactivate" which I can do by right-clicking on one of the "connections".</p>
<p>Any idea ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the response and the idea.</p>
<p>But I looked at "rasdial", and that seems more appropriate for establishing/disconnecting a dialup connection.</p>
<p>The "network interface" I am talking about in my issue is not a dialup connection, it is more like a "virtual network interface".&nbsp; They are not the ones which appear in the "RAS" or "dialup" section, they are the ones which appear in the "Local Area Network"
 section.</p>
<p>These "connections" appear under names such as "Cisco AnyConnect virtual miniport adapter", "TAP-Win32 Adapter V9" etc..</p>
<p>To re-phrase my original question differently :</p>
<p>In my "Network connections", the main Ethernet interface of my laptop appears under the label "Local Area Network 1" in my list of connections.&nbsp; When I right-click on this item, I get a popup menu which gives me the option to "activate" or "deactivate" this
 interface.&nbsp; If I deactivate it, I lose my Ethernet network connection.</p>
<p>Is there a way, from the command-line, to do this "activate/deactivate" thing that I can also do with the mouse ?</p>

    <title>Black Screen in Safe Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomaschen_395  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen in Safe Mode</h2>
                    So I have windows 8.1 and I wanted to boot in safe mode. I went and typed in everything in run and just to tell you safe boot worked before. I went and clicked ok and I restarted. The next thing I knew was the computer had a black screen and occasionally
 at all of the corners there would be safe mode. &nbsp;There was nothing else. I tried to go and restore, but it would tell me that it failed and I need to disable antivirus program. How can I even disable it without Bing able to see anything except for a black
 screen and the words safe mode at the corner? I really need help, and I don't want to delete any of my programs because I have some that cost money. Can any of you help?

<p>
</p><p><span><em>Why were you trying to boot the computer in safe mode? Were you facing any issues prior to booting in safe mode?</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>What happens when you restart the computer, are you still getting a black screen?</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could be caused due to an incompatible display driver or due to some corrupt files. You should be able to boot in normal mode when you restart the computer. Restart the computer and let us know if you are able to boot normally
 so that we can assist you with this issue further.</span></p>

            <span>I wanted to go in safe mode because I had this game that would not load, and I thought booting in safe mode would help. Oh yeah, on the first time, it worked for a reason that I forgot. For some reason if I restart, even if
 I shutdown, &nbsp;I still would be in safe mode to answer your question. Now I finally figured out that the game would not work because it was not compatible. &nbsp;So I am stuck with a still in safe mode not working computer. I had no problem with my computer before,
 and I thought for the second time, it would work, but sadly, &nbsp;it did not. I think the reason was I clicked OK and restarted instead of eating for it to say that you have applied changes and need a restart or something like that.</span>

            <p>You probably used an incorrect method for entering Safe Mode which has changed dramatically in win 8.1. Explain what you "typed in" and where you typed it. Safe Mode in 8.1 requires opening PC Settings. Update and Recovery, Recovery, Advanced Startup, Restart
 and then the computer restarts and then you select Troubleshoot on the Choose an option page. Look up Windows Startup Settings for more.</p>

            I typed in msconfig in run and I got startup settings. Then I choose the safe boot minimal. I also tried safe boot in advanced settings, but still black screen. I am pretty sure that it is in safe mode because it says safe mode at the corner occasionally.&nbsp;
