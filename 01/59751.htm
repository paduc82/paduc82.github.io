<h2>            Age of Mythology - Strange problem when trying to play the game</h2>
                    
<p>I own AoM &amp; AoM titans expansion and I used to play online with a friend a few years ago. Recently we both reinstalled AoM to start our online sessions back up again.</p>
<p>The problem I am having is that now whenever I enter a game, single or multiplayer my "people/workers/units/buildings" when selected have no options to do/build anything at all! The whole left bottom panel where the options to build would be is blank! All
 other panels are fine.</p>
<p>I have reinstalled the game 3x now, even copying the CD to the HD to check if it was a problem reading the CD, which it wasn't/isn't.&nbsp; I have run a full memory check, hd check and other hardware checks, I even upgraded my video drivers to the latest from
 nvidia to no avail.</p>
<p>Error happens with version 1.0 and 1.10</p>
<p><strong>My System:</strong></p>
<p>Windows XP pro sp3</p>
<p>Dual Core 2 duo cpu</p>
<p>Nvidia geforce 7900 gs video card</p>
<p>2 gigs of ram.</p>
<p>Age of Mythology Game (titans works fine) ESO</p>
<p>No error messages at all.</p>
<p>EDIT: ALL Microsoft forums for games point to this forum, so that's why this XP question is here!</p>

                    <p>Hi. Since some days I am facing this annoying issue with my Windows 10 64 bit laptop. A rectangular shape appears around every link in the UI of the OS. sometimes, because of that even the relevant text is not properly visible. Please refer to below screenshot
 where the rectangle is appearing around the link to open "Network &amp; Internet Settings". Please help me to remove this.</p>

I have already tried turning off the narrator feature. It doesn't work.

<h2>            Phone Contact or Skype To Skype</h2>
                    In this latest version of Skype how do I tell (left column ) whether the contact is a phone contact, skype to skype or combination of both;&nbsp; used to be that these two important distinctions were separated and all those who were on line were listed at top
 of contact list.&nbsp; What happened ???&nbsp; I don't want to call a contact phone number because I forgot he or she doesn't use skype to skype.

            1. This might be an issue with latest Skype which is v8. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype...</a>
<br />
<br />2. As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

    <title>Windows 7 desktop background is pixelated no matter what - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe_bob222  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 desktop background is pixelated no matter what size&#47;resolution source file is</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I am experiencing a very annoying issue with Windows 7 after having upgraded from Vista. No matter what I do, I cannot display my desktop background under the "Personalize" menu without it looking like a badly compressed jpeg with horrible compression artifacts
 throughout the image. The source files I use are the exact same size as my desktop resolution and are lossless png's that look fine when opened in an image viewing program. I have tried using every lossless file format (bmp, png) but the result is the same.
 Oddly enough, I found a fix in a forum that states if you open the image you want to set as a background image in either IE or Firefox, then right click and select "Set as desktop background", it does so and the same image is shown without these horrible compression
 artifacts.<br />
Is Microsoft putting in a fix for this, or at the very least providing an explanation of why images set as a desktop background through the "Personalize" menu are horribly compressed but are fine if you do extra steps and 'Set as Background' through an internet
 browser?

            Hi Joe_bob222, <br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Forum! <br />
<br />
In order to troubleshoot your issue, first I would like to verify that you are able to use a saved picture on your computer and use as wallpaper at full screen with no issues. In order to perform these suggest you to change a pictureâ€™s file type/file format
 and verify if it helps. Though digital pictures come in a variety of file formats, most of the pictures on your computer probably use the common JPEG format. Most digital cameras save pictures in the JPEG format to maintain good visual quality without creating
 large files. In addition, many programs can only open pictures that are saved in the JPEG format. If you have a picture stored in another file format, such as TIFF or bitmap, you can make a copy of it in JPEG format. It's also possible to save a copy of a
 JPEG picture in a different format. When you save a copy of a picture in a different format, the original picture is not replaced. Please let us know if this helped!
<br />
<br />
To save a picture in a different file type <br />
1.Click to open Windows Photo Gallery. <br />
2.Click the picture you want to change. <br />
3.On the toolbar, click Open, and then click Paint. Paint will open with your picture displayed.
<br />
4.Click the File menu in Paint, and then click Save As. <br />
5.Click the Save as type list, and then click the file type you want to use to convert your picture.
<br />
6.Click Save. <br />
Notes: If you want to protect a JPEG picture from additional loss of visual quality, you can save it as a TIFF, which, unlike a JPEG, does not lose small amounts of visual quality every time it is edited and saved. Paint does not work with all file formats.
 For example, you cannot open a picture in RAW format by using Paint. For file types that Paint does not support, you should use a photo editing program.
<br />
<br />
In addition, suggest you to visit the below mentioned link, where the customer had similar issue and the problem was resolved. http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaappearance/thread/72a12053-67ce-455b-9ea4-cb9d94faa823
<br />
<br />
Also, you can change the Desktop background by typing change desktop background in the search box in start menu.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps resolve your issue! <br />
<br />

<h2>            Xbox One Controller Wireless PC adapter shows up as ethernet connection with no internet access, disconnects me from primary ethernet adapter.</h2>
                    This has been an ongoing issue with me but since I just recently purchased Forza Horizon 4 with intentions of playing primary on PC, I can no longer deal with this happening. Whenever I have the xbox one controller wireless adapter for PC plugged into
 my pc, every few minutes I will lose connection to the internet. It took me a long time to notice that while this is occurring, if I click on the network icon in the taskbar, it will show me as connected to "ethernet 3" with no internet access. If I open up
 network adapters, ethernet 3 and its MAC address belong to the xbox one controller wireless adapter. So essentially, my Windows 10 pc keeps thinking the xbox one wireless adapter is an ethernet adapter and will disconnect me from my primary ethernet connection
 to try and use it. This will happen repeatedly until I unplug the xbox wireless adapter. This is extremely frustrating and hope someone has also dealt with this and knows how to fix it. Before microsoft copy/paste spams me to unin

            These fixes don't help and dontd even describe the issues I am having with my controller wireless adapter. I have tried removing the the driver and reinstalling multiple times, but the controller adapter still shows up as a network adapter and disconnects
 me from my primary network adapter at least once a minute.

<p>Hello Sean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that the Wireless Adapter is reading inaccurately on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A suggestion here, uninstall the drivers for the wireless controller adapter, and move/plug the adapter into a different USB connection, i.e. if connected to the back of a tower, connect to the front of the tower and then reinstall the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give this a shot and let us know if this works, please get back to us with the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
How many do you have pinned so far?&nbsp; Perhaps there is a limit?&nbsp;&nbsp;There are weird, arbitrary limits for other stuff (e.g. only 10 tabs), so why not one for pinned sites too?&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankly, I wouldn't want my Start Screen cluttered with Pinned Sites anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, what&nbsp;I do is save them as Internet Shortcuts using the Desktop version, e.g. with Ctrl-d...&nbsp;&nbsp; Neat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ctrl-d works in MUF IE mode too?&nbsp; Who knew?&nbsp; So can you add your
 Favorites that way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can still add Favorites to Favorites you may at least be able to find them again with a sufficiently precise search expression.&nbsp;&nbsp; A problem is that instead of showing us everything that matches, the UI stupidly limits itself in the same way that&nbsp;Desktop
 AutoComplete for Address bar matching limits itself to showing only 2.&nbsp; The difference is that the Desktop version then has a chevron that we can click to expand our list of matches (perhaps giving us the one we want or at least jogging the memory sufficiently
 to make us try a different search expression.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead what would be so useful and I imagine easy to do is give us all of the matches scrolled out to the right forever--just the way it uselessly lists all Favorites when a search expression is
<u>not</u> used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hmm...&nbsp; I think&nbsp;my real problem (as usual) may be Search, not the UI.&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g. search is not even letting me find stuff using that tiny 2 item window that I
<u>know</u> is there!&nbsp;&nbsp; YMMV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You have to remove some shortcut you do not use to make some places for other shortcut you want to pin..
</p>
<p>there is a limit you can pin to the start menu... once the limit is reach you cannot add more.. even though to place shortcut in the appropriate folders.. as to say that windows is looking over many folders to make the start menu shortcut appear</p>

    <title>Taskbar and desktop changed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tyej  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar and desktop changed</h2>
                    <p>I recently attempted to adjust the "view" settings in my Quicken program.&nbsp; When I was done my desktop and taskbar had changed in the following ways:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Desktop</strong>-I get no choices when I right-click on the desktop. My applications, which used to appear above the windows start button in alphabetical list , are now distributed across the middle of the desktop. I now have a start button icon
 in the upper left corner of my desktop along with a "pin tiles button" and an "all apps" button which distributes my applications icon to the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Taskbar</strong>-When right clicking the taskbar I get a whole new set of choices none of which I have much use for.&nbsp; I can't unlock the taskbar with this or any other command. I don't have the start up programs that used to be accessible from the
 bottom right area with access to things like my virus and malware software.&nbsp; I do get a whole set of choices when I right-click the start button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run sfc and DISM utilities<span> with no result</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some controls like "minimize" have disappeared from application window, especially those associated with Windows products like Microsoft Edge and some options in the settings menus don't appear to be there.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>LAN Connection settings keep changing back to proxy server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ralphadelman  say:</h3>
<h2>            LAN Connection settings keep changing back to proxy server</h2>
                    <p>Reference IT Technician Enterprise Network answer to the above from 2013.&nbsp; This issue happened after I upgraded to Windows 10 on my HP computer.&nbsp; We also have another older Dell computer, which this issue did not occur after upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; I followed
 his advise including editing the registry (Internet Settings and Default Connection Settings) and have no trouble accessing the internet.&nbsp; However, after every day or every other day (at most after three days) turning my computer on after being off overnight,
 the internet connection settings revert back to the proxy server.&nbsp; This keeps happening even though I go back and reedit the register.&nbsp; What can be done to fix this problem?&nbsp; I am currently using&nbsp;Internet Explorer&nbsp;11 instead of Edge until Microsoft comes out
 with their update in early November that allows extensions.&nbsp; I use Norton 360 and cannot use this program with Edge until extensions are allowed, because of security on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this does not happen with the Dell computer, I checked the settings mentioned by the IT Technician&nbsp; and found that the following Internet Settings were not present in the registry: ProxyHttp.1 (or ProxyHttp1_1) and ProxyServer.&nbsp; Will it harm my HP
 computer if I delete these two from the registry so that the Internet Settings will be the same as those on the Dell computer, which as pointed out above does not have this problem?&nbsp; Also, for ProxyServer the technician indicated that there&nbsp;should be&nbsp;no value
 for this in the registry.&nbsp; Will it have any effect or hurt if a value of 0x00000000 (0) is entered?</p>

<p>Original title: Cursor problems</p>
<p>How do I stop the cursor from constantly changing the font size as it moves around the page?&nbsp; A little rectangular box shows up and I cannot get rid of it.&nbsp; No matter how much a change it, the cursor either moves the page around or changes the font.</p>

<h2>            Has anyone else experienced an audio security scam&#63;</h2>
                    Went out for dinner. Returned home to an audio voice recording. Thought I had left TV on but it was coming from the PC speaker. A male voice saying â€œInternet Security Alert! Call Windows Technical Support. This computer may be infected by a harmful virus.
 Do not use, shutdown or etc, etc, etcâ€. Found referenced to security scams on the web involving pop up windows or email but not audio messages. Also, it was not typical because it did not provide a phone number or web address to contact. I spoke to Tech Support
 at Costco and confirmed the likelyhood of a scam. Turned PC off then on. Ran security scams (I have Norton Security protecting PC). All appears OK. Others must have encountered this, right?

            Hi Legovf718, yes I have heard of that before and as you have realised it is a Tech Support Scam . . .
<br />
<br />Like Tech Support Emails, Web Popups, we just have to ignore these, though you would be surprised how many users do fall for this . . .

</p><p>There should be an option to allow auto-answer in this version from its settings. Below are the steps for you to enable it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Skype.</li><li>Click your profile icon.</li><li>Select <strong>Calling</strong>.</li><li>Enable <strong>Answer incoming calls automatically</strong>.</li></ol>

<h2>            0x80080207 error when installing app from store.</h2>
                    <p>I have two apps (HP Printer Control and Fotor)&nbsp;that are giving me the 0x80080207 error when I try to install them.&nbsp; This stared after I had a really slow connection on a wireless 3g hotspot when I first tried to install these apps.&nbsp; I am now back a proper
 fast internet connection and still cannot install these two apps.&nbsp; I have tried all the steps listed in similar questions like running the app troubleshooter and resetting the store cache.&nbsp; I can successfully install any other app from the store except for
 these two that seem stuck in some corrupt state.&nbsp; How can I get these installed?&nbsp; The windows store should be able to recover on its own from poor internet connections or connection dropouts during a download and install. This type of error on a new machine
 is unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Major Bug error &#34;Class not registered&#34; under the title &#34;explorer.exe&#34; and file icons don&#39;t show properly black Screen</h2>
                    <p>Today I was using my laptop on which I have Windows 10 Home version 64 bit, and suddenly have lost the ability to open the start menu and search bar, seeing my icons on the tool bar and opening them (the last of which seemed to appear only after I tried
 to restart the computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, trying to create a LibreOffice file gives me a black window, file icons don't show properly (e.g. Firefox shows a white sheet) and trying to go to Personalise or Display Settings through desktop leads to the error and stops response on desktop
 until closing it (showing a loading cursor):</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this&nbsp; action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run a system scan (typing "sfc /scannow") and it said "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations".</p>
<p>I've tried to search the control panel (to which I can get only through my computer properties' "See also Security and Maintenance") for an option to reset, but finding one that says "if you're having problems with your PC, go to Settings and try resetting
 it", I've got the error "Class not registered" under the title "explorer.exe".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The control Panel seems to look different from the normal one, and it says "Back up and Restore (Windows 7) under System and Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some info that might be relevant:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I'm using an HP laptop</p>
<p>-I've upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 about a month ago, while keeping my files</p>
<p>-I've been using Avast Free Anti-virus</p>
<p>-My graphic drives show:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. "Intel(r) HD Graphics 5500</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. NVIDIA GeForce 940M</p>
<p>-My processor is Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5500U CPU @ 2.40GHz 2.39 GHz</p>
<p>-My RAM is 12.0GB</p>
<p>-I haven't installed any new apps or programs in the last few days</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help would be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp;I don't know if this is relevant, but I've stopped the Process named "Cortana" not long before this bug happened, I just didn't connect the two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original title: Windows 10 Major Bug</p>

<p>Sir/Ma'am,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I logged onto halo reach and for some reason I am banned from gaining credits. I looked at reasons for being bannedon bungie.net and have not done any of the following that would get me banned. This is very inconvient because I am playing and getting one
 credit for an unexplainable reason making me lose out on credits I should be acquiring toward my next promotion. Please fix this error as soon as possible, or please email me a way to go about doing this myself. Thank your for your time.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi wandaamos,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Were you able to get volume before?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to enable the HDMI device settings device as default in sound settings.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>c. In Playback tab, right click on the window select â€œshow disabled devicesâ€ if itâ€™s not checked
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Click Apply and OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If it doesnâ€™t help, there is possibility that the drivers have got corrupted by some reason. Download and
 install the latest drivers from the manufacturerâ€™s website.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Type devmgmt.msc in start search box and hit Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. In device manager, expand the Display adapter listed in the device list.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Right click on the driver and click Uninstall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Reboot the computer and install the downloaded drivers.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Print To HP LaserJet 4050 - &#34;Printer Driver Was Not Installed. Unable to find a Core Driver Package that is required by Printer Driver Package&#34;</h2>
                    Running Win7 32 bit.&nbsp; Have had HP LaserJet 4050tn printer installed for 2 years.&nbsp; It is on the network and can still be accessed successfully from other PCs on the network.&nbsp; I was printing to it from a web based billing program when my PC froze. &nbsp; Re-booted
 and was no longer able to print to it.&nbsp; Tried removing the printer, clearing the spooler / cashe', and re-installing the printer with drivers downloaded from HP (tried both the standard and the Universal drivers).<br />
<br />
When I try to install the printer I get a message "<u><i><b>Printer Drive was not installed.&nbsp; Unable to find a Core Driver Package that is required by the printer driver package"</b></i></u><br />
<br />
I have a Brother MFP 2820 that is USB and it works fine.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated<br />

<h2>            Make PLAYABLE DVD in Windows 10</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;Making a playable DVD in Windows Vista and 7 was a breeze. In windows 10 it is impossible. I want a function BUILT IN to burn a DVD like DVD maker did. Is it really too much to ask to not have to dual boot 7 and 10 ONLY to burn a DVD? I tried "DVD Flick"
 and I don't want to spend 7 straight hours for every individual DVD, especially when you have to make 12 of said DVDs. Microsoft needs to make a new version of DVD maker that works with 10.

            Hi tecatefil! 
<br />
<br />My first course of action in dealing with such an issue is to visit your original manufacturer's site (Lenovo, Dell, HP, etc) and go to their Support tab, then look for the driver for that particular device. I would recommend that you go to Run (Windows key + R), then type in devmgmt.msc to enter Device Manager. 
<br />
<br />From there, find the device in question, and remove it (read more at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/using-device-manager-to-uninstall-devices-and-driver-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a>). After you do that, attempt to install the driver. Best of luck!

            1. Head to following and go to the section - Bluetooth doesnâ€™t appear and there are no unknown devices listed in Device Manager. How can I fix this?
