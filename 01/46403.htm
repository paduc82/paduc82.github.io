            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Check with the game maker's support and forums if they are still in business. Also
<br />
check in the major gaming forums.<br />
<br />
Here some Game forums for those with ATI or Nvidia hardware - the users there can<br />
probably direct you to other good game forums.<br />

<h2>            Mouse button functions reversed</h2>
                    <p>I have seen answers to what appears to be the same question as this, but my problem is unresolved.&nbsp; The left and right buttons on my
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>mouse only</strong></span> are reversed.&nbsp; I am using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The left and right buttons on my touchpad work as they should, it is just my mouse.&nbsp; I have tried using a second mouse, but the issue remains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the instructions as per a similar post, and this just switches the button functions on my touchpad, the problem remains on my mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest a fix.&nbsp; It's the mouse only, not the touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Cooling fan stays on after resume from sleep or hibernation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cooling fan stays on after resume from sleep or hibernation</h2>
                    
<p>I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit on an HP Elitebook 8440p.&nbsp; I've just updated to all of the latest drivers and BIOS revisions.</p>
<p>If I put the system to sleep or to hibernate, when it comes back on the cooling fan spins at full speed.&nbsp; This happens regardless of temperature.&nbsp; But it only comes on if the system is on AC power.&nbsp; If I unplug and run off battery, the cooling fan spins
 at normal speed.&nbsp; But the instant I plug it back in, the fan is on at full speed.&nbsp; If I reboot the system, the fan also spins at the normal speed.</p>
<p>I've tried all of the power profiles.&nbsp; I've also changed the A/C power settings to be identical to the battery settings, and still have the same effect.&nbsp; This makes me suspect that there is a hidden registry setting that differentiates between a/c power
 and battery.</p>
<p>I've already contacted HP support, and they have no answers but instead want to send a tech out.&nbsp; I thought I'd see if there might be a Windows-based solution to this problem before I go through that hassle.</p>

<blockquote>Hi there.&nbsp; I've booted into safe mode, but I no longer can put it into hibernation or sleep.</blockquote>
<p>Display drivers are the key to <strong>sleep and hibernation</strong> . In safe mode, neither function and hence you didn't find the options.</p>
<p>Did you install the latest chipset drivers? Display drivers? <br />
<br />
What's your laptopn configuration BTW?</p>

Hello dear, I have Dell Latitude D 620. I was also facing the same problem, I discussed it to online dell support engineer. He suggested me to update all the drivers from the website, I have updated all the drivers and BIOS as well. This solved my problem,
 Now my laptop is running fine. There is one thing that some times HT [ Hyper threading ] technology causes this errors. Please make sure you have a HT based processor or a normal one.

<h2>            Getting Error code 0x80040155 when updating to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 8 having some problems after cancelling Windows 8.1 update</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was trying to download the Windows 8.1 update from the Store, but I got an Error&nbsp;0x80040155 halfway through the download. I cancelled it and tried fixing it. Since then, whenever I click a tile/app within the Windows Store, it doesn't respond. I searched
 for fixes online but none of them helped. Some time after trying all the fixes, Windows suddenly needs to be activated. I knew something was wrong since it never asked for it for since we bought it last year. Can anyone help me solve this issue?

            <p>Hi Paul, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration when things don't work as expected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Error <strong>0x80040155</strong> may be caused by Windows system files damage and sometimes it could be because of corrupted drivers on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unplug any external devices connected to the PC expect mouse and keyboard at the time of installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong><strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You need to make sure that all the drivers are updated before you try to install Windows 8.1</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><br />
To update driver follow these steps.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>a.</strong><span> </span>
Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>and click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>b.</strong><span> </span>
Expand all the devices on by one.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>c.</strong><span> </span>
Right-click on the device driver and click on Update.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong></span></span></span></span>If that does not help, place the computer in a Clean Boot state and then try to install Windows 8.1<br />
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows Update policies set without my consent</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I got this message in Windows Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f810497-e3dc-4f9a-93cd-6af107a68085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f810497-e3dc-4f9a-93cd-6af107a68085" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since I am using <strong>Windows 10 Home</strong> and I have not set these policies, may I know:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) who set it (Microsoft...?)</p>
<p>2) why it has set it</p>
<p>3) What does it mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have been a Windows Insider for a few years now, but it's the first time I see this policy enforced on my PC.....</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this doesn't resolve the problem (I was on Full Diagnostics already):</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do you happen to know if this change is initiated by Microsoft as part of Insiders Testing? (I am on the release channel)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, I can try to check my security settings.</p>

<p>Please note that I have used O&amp;O ShutUp10 just now <strong>specifically to disable</strong> all potentially conflicting settings, basically allowing anything Microsoft wants to collect from me. RED means I am allowing data collection:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Even with all telemetry enabled and all data collection settings and to Full Diagnostic, I still get the message in Windows Update - so it's not something on my end that I have prevented. Maybe there is a global Policy set by Microsoft and pushed towards
 selected computers - even those with Home version - Again, if this is the case, I think it's problematic.......</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my home PC that I've configured from scratch, with a genuine Windows 10 Home (Full) version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) <strong>Windows Version</strong>: Windows 10 Version 1709 Build 16299.98 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) <strong>No large system-level changes</strong>. Recent changes involved installing an app from Microsoft Store (TouchVPN), which is not being used very often, upgrading Firefox, Auslogics Disk Defrag and Wire to versions 58 beta 10 ; 7.2.0.1 ; 3.0.2828
 respectively, upgrading GeForce Driver to version 388.59 on 7.Dec.2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) <strong>What I have tried</strong> - mostly trying to see if this change relates to me being Windows Insider (despite only choosing final builds, as this is a production machine), trying mostly to search online about any test or preview features that
 Microsoft is trying to push to random groups of Insiders (no news of this kind found yet). This message appeared out of the blue and I cannot trace it to any Windows Update - message appeared on 9.Dec and the last Windows Update was
<em>November 30, 2017‚ÄîKB4051963 (OS Build 16299.98)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I admit that besides this last update I did get a strange <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709</span>,&nbsp; on 2.Dec that <strong>did nothing</strong> and my OS build remained the same - see below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e80bc3a9-20ff-45ad-8e0b-584d148211c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e80bc3a9-20ff-45ad-8e0b-584d148211c9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0249c8d8-e7f5-42fb-aafa-80ad0a606770" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0249c8d8-e7f5-42fb-aafa-80ad0a606770" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4) I am using a <strong>local admin account</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>5) This is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> a company owned computer - it is a home laptop which I own. I also own a full retail license of Windows 10 Home, which is installed on this laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) <strong>Location Service</strong> status:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ca38cd5-9814-4778-a49f-03f57e1837f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ca38cd5-9814-4778-a49f-03f57e1837f8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>6) No other programs have had issues with Windows update, everything appears to be running normally, no viruses found, all drivers installed, no recent BSODs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to not change default system-wide settings as much as I could. I did customize my experience and selected the components I wanted. In fact, that's why I tried the program above in the first place - O&amp;O ShutUp10 - to reset my settings to default first
 and see if that changed something, which did not. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Linux Subsystem activated, with Ubuntu installed</p>

    <title>Why does W10 media creation tool always have to redownload to use - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does W10 media creation tool always have to redownload to use it&#63;</h2>
                    I noticed it keeps having to redownload every time I run it to make new bootable USB medias. Why? Shouldn't it already have everything downloaded since it was completed earlier?&nbsp; W10 installers are huge! :(

<h2>            Surface Pen Checker Tool unable to work</h2>
                    <p>I use the latest Surface Pen (with no clip) on my Surface Go (WiFi version).</p>
<p>I download the Surface Pen Checker Tool from https://aka.ms/PenFirmwareVersionCheck, but it can't work.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08ad8d15-0b70-4305-8053-619ae252a15d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08ad8d15-0b70-4305-8053-619ae252a15d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>It seems that some registry key settings are missing.</p>
<p>I've already updated the drivers and firmware of Surface Go through Windows Update and manually downloaded file (from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57439), and I've also used the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit, but nothing works.</p>

<h2>            Line-in disappeared from windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to record on Audacity through the dual headphone/microphone jack on my ASUS S200E. This is something that I have previously done without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, the 'line in' option has completely disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6943aad-7dea-431a-9dfc-797940a4cc9b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6943aad-7dea-431a-9dfc-797940a4cc9b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all updating the drivers. I have also tried uninstalling the drivers. Neither of these have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated - none of the other forum questions have provided me with a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your quick response. Here are the screenshots from running the troubleshooter:</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I clicked on 'view detailed information', it says 'issue not present' for each area checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of uninstalling the audio driver and manually re-installing it from the manufacturer's website - the only Audio drivers available for my laptop (Asus S200e) from the Asus website are for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Mine is runnning on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your earlier response - I hope there is a way around this!</p>

<h3> raylewis86  say:</h3>
<h2>            Viewing DNG Files in Windows Photo VIewer w&#47; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Ok first, I would like to use windows photo viewer.&nbsp; I just bought a new dell computer and discovered (like many others) that windows photo viewer had issues. I have scoured the internet with no final solution. &nbsp;I did get windows photo viewer on the new
 computer and can view almost any format of photo, other than DNG.&nbsp; Now here is the weird part.&nbsp; If I put one of the files that you can set the default to windows photo viewer in the folder with DNGs I can thumb through the DNGs. Without a JPEG or TIFF (for
 example) photo viewer is not an option.&nbsp; SO while I have a work around I feel like I am so close. Maybe its stubbornness but I would like to open a DNG through default with windows photo viewer. Its just super weird that if I put a JPEG in the folder with
 DNGs I am able to view all the DNGs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to set defaults through right clicking the photo as well as under the control panel and there is no visible way for me to select windows photo viewer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ray</p>

<h2>            Get a message &#34;A system image backup is in progress&#34;.</h2>
                    In the Control Panel/Windows 7 File Recovery, I clicked on "create a system image". &nbsp;About one-third of the way, I (the user) was logged off (not sure why) and the login screen was presented. I logged in again (as the same user) - the system image creation&nbsp;progress&nbsp;bar
 was gone. When I went back to&nbsp;Control Panel/Windows 7 File Recovery and clicked on "create" - I received the following message:&nbsp;"A system image backup is in progress. Please wait while it completes".&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No further information is made available. I have no idea if the system image creation is indeed still in progress or if the process is hung. Is there a way to find out? If it's still in&nbsp;progress&nbsp;- is there a way to get back &nbsp;the progress bar? If it's hung
 - is there a way to stop it and start again?&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            .NET framework 4.0.30319 will not install</h2>
                    I am running windows 7. I am trying to run a program called SIX Launcher. It is a server application for ARMA on Steam. I have tried installing it several times. It tells me that I must install one of the following versions of .NET framework. In the case
 v4.0.30319. Which i have done, but the problem persists. I run a small program that is supposed to fix it, but the program wont detect version 4 at all.

<h2>            paperport 14 with windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I found the problem!<br />
In the registry there is an option that cause the crash:<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ScanSoft\PaperPort\PaperPort User Preferences<br />
look for BrowserSelected <br />
my registry had "Mozilla Firefox"<br />
I changed it "none"<br />
PAPERPORT 14.5 STARTED WITH NO PROBLEMS<br />
NOTE: if it contains "Mozilla Firefox" it will not start.<br />
Also please note that this problem started with PaperPort 14.0 which was working with Windows 10 64bit with no problems.
<br />
I upgraded to 14.5 w/patch 1 thinking it would correct the problem. Being 14.5 w/patch 1 is Windows 10-compliant, with the upgrade.

                    Ok.&nbsp; I just installed win 7 64&nbsp; on my computer for the second time due to somehow becoming locked out of changeing to home network vs public/work.&nbsp; I had this problem before and believed it was nortons firewall since the os reprted that was the culprit.&nbsp;
 I spent over an hour with tech support to no avail.&nbsp; I then reinstalled the os and set the networking up along with the updates.&nbsp; I set the network to home and adjusted the settings in advanced.&nbsp; I then changed the updates to notify me.&nbsp; I continued reinstalling
 all my other software without problem.&nbsp; I even mapped my network drives with no problem, sort of.&nbsp; I discoverd that i hadn't changed the network name form mshome to mine.&nbsp; So i did and that correct the computers not showing up issue.&nbsp; Now I check the network
 settings and I am back to public profile and automatic updates with absolutly no input from me.&nbsp; I was able to fix the automatic updates back to notify me but

<p>One possible solution to this issue that&nbsp;I have found via Google&nbsp;is to make sure you have a default gateway configured in the network properties for your LAN adapter. Go to&nbsp;<strong>Start &gt; Run</strong> and type
<strong>cmd /k ipconfig</strong> and see if a default gateway is defined. If not go into the LAN adpater properties and temporairly configure a static IP, mask and default gateway address. The default gateway address should be your router's address.</p>

<p>Once Windows 7 indentifies your network you should be able to go in and change the network type.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>In addition of following Al's essential suggestion about Network hardware configuration.</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>You can further solve issues like this by configuring the Network aspects manually.<span>&nbsp;</span> The wizards are Not so full with "‚Äúmagic‚Äù" as suggested by the name.</p>
<p>It is essential is the name of the Work Group would be the same on all Networked computers, and each computer has a unique name.</p>
<p>This is achieved through the configuration in the OS‚Äô System Window (Control panel, System).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p>Then look at the Network Sharing Center.</p>
<p>Click on Icon under the, view you active networks</p>
<p>Double clicking on the Icon at the beginning of the red arrow (as seen here),</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/delete-net.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/delete-net.jpg</a></p>
<p>Click on Merge or Delete, and delete all the irrelevant entries.</p>
<p>Then click on the Network name next to the Icon, and choose your type of <span>
&nbsp;</span> Network. Make sure that all the computers on the Network are configured in the same way.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_type.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_type.jpg</a></p>
<p>Some of the naming trouble can come from 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party Network managers (like Bonjour, Netmagic, etc.), or from unneeded Router software that runs in the background on any of the Network‚Äôs computers.<span>&nbsp;</span> There is usually<span>&nbsp;</span> No
 real need for any of them, if One knows the basic manual<span>&nbsp;</span> configuration of the OS‚Äô Network aspects, it is wise to get rid of the ‚Äú‚ÄùMagical‚Äù‚Äù software.</p>

<p>Jack, if it were that simple, I wouldn't be here. I have pics and they clearly show I don't have those choices and that I am not connected to any network.&nbsp; Thesed pics also show all my networked drives connected and accessable, not to mention I am online.&nbsp;
 There is a setting somewhere that needs to be reverted back.&nbsp; I also restarted my network just to see if that was it.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; I cant figure out how to post the pics or I would.&nbsp; Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You can also open a free account with Windows Live Sky Drive. Upload the pictures ato your public space, and post here the link them.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to have such capacity regardless of the issue at hand.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>There is always something new in life. I never saw such a Network Center screen.</p>
<p>I also see a Norton Drive.</p>
<p>Did you install the Norton suit after the Re-install?</p>
<p>If there is still something of 3rd party security running, uninstall and clean it out (Uninstall per-se sometimes still leaves processes running.</p>

<p>Hey Jack,</p>
<p>I have 2 threads open, one for this and one for MS "updates".&nbsp; If you would take a look at this thread</p>
<p><span>Win7 update error "WindowsUpdate_80070005" redo</span></p>
<p><span>I have broken down everything for him, since, to me, he doesn't appear to get it.&nbsp; I have determined that this issue is directly related to the MS "updates".&nbsp; The listed thread discribes in detail exactly what I did and how I determined it to be MS
 related.&nbsp; I would greatly appreceate it if you would look over it and give me your opinion.&nbsp; You can skip the the log part, its irrelavant at this point.</span></p>
<p><span>To answer your question, I know better than to install more than 1 sec app, and Nortons has served me well.&nbsp; Granted they have had rough issues in the past, but they did address them.&nbsp; The norton drive you see is actually the installed on line back
 up which is standard, it doesn't go away.&nbsp; I don't use it due to I have enough space here to do my backups.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>

            Jack, just an update, you can disregard the last statement.&nbsp; I discovered the update issue and it was MS related.&nbsp; I hadn't activated it due to not getting this resolved, which incidently is still not resolved.&nbsp; Upon every install it works initially, then
 for no apparent reason switches me to the "public" profile with the same issuses listed above.&nbsp; I had a theroy that since it now shows "not connected"&nbsp;that somehow it may be using wireless without consent from me since I am wired and plugged in, or maybe something
 else?

<p>I already told you Robear, I don't want your advice and I surely don't want you tainting others advise.&nbsp; I told you through out the other thread its not a virus nor was it hijacked.&nbsp; Since you are still on that hijacking/virus stuff by your partial post
 (thats why I asked him to read it, cause you didn't even read the whole thing, so he can't get the story from you).&nbsp; Since I know your type and can't possibly be "wrong" I am going to list again in detail what I did on this last install, just because I can
 see your not going to over the fact you were WRONG.&nbsp; So your going to check all my threads to see what I am asking or giving so you can make me look stupid.&nbsp; FYI-- I have been working with computers (building/repairing/networking) for close to 16 years, so
 I am not an idiot and don't appreciate your continued insinuations.&nbsp; SOOO I will explain it for YOU again, since you obviously want to iritate me.&nbsp; Jack, if you do read this, read my other thread to fill you in correctly.</p>
<p>1. Fully disconnected from all local hdd's, turned off all other computers on the network.&nbsp; Downloaded all drivers and Nortons from my connected computer, which has never had a virus (been up and running for close to 2 years) on to my usb key.&nbsp; Robear, if
 your usb key was infected and you plugged it in your work computer and it infected your work network, what would your sups say?&nbsp; I know what would happen to me, as I said before it too is clean.&nbsp; Robear, that means only 1 hdd attached, not connected to the
 internet or network, again I have to manually install the nic driver due to it not being native in the os.&nbsp; Does this sound familer to you?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Took a 3rd hdd (never had a virus or other on it either, EVER)&nbsp; full reformat, de-partioned, re-partioned, formated 10 times then installed win7 64.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Installed all drivers with the exception of the NIC to which everything appeard to go well (finally).</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I then installed Nortons.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; installed all my other programs from DVD or usb.</p>
<p>6. Ran Nortons with out updates, and as expected, CLEAN.&nbsp; Robear I am still not connected to the internet or network, still no nic driver.&nbsp; Rebooted.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Installed the NIC and ran Nortons Live Update until it was fully up to date, that means 3 or 4 reboots.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; updated windows through the control panel.&nbsp; Several reboots.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Up to this point all is well.&nbsp; It seems my problem is gone,&nbsp; but I run Nortons again and reboot.&nbsp; Upon reboot I am back on the "public" profile.</p>
<p>Now, before you go and say "it must be nortons, its the firewall".&nbsp; On the previous installs it did it on MS Office 2007, MS Digital image suite 2006, Nero, and Adobe.&nbsp; Not to mention after MS updates.&nbsp; So its clearly not Nortons or any of the other programs.&nbsp;
 This happend before and after Nortons, along with the listed.&nbsp; And just so you know, I blamed them all too.&nbsp; On each occasion, then it rotated programs on differant intervals.&nbsp; It went from 20 minutes up to almost 9 hours (which was on the last install).&nbsp;Everything
 is running smootly with the exception of this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now after all that was done, I then went on line and updated Quicktime, reader, java ect.&nbsp; I even uninstalled the NIC drivers and rebooted.&nbsp; After the system came back up i reran Nortons, which of course came back clean.&nbsp; I reinstalled the NIC driver and
 it connected to the "home" profile for 1 second then went to "not connected" and placed on the "public" profile.&nbsp; Its something in the system and I don't know where its at.</p>
<p>Jack, I would really love to solve this, because like Robear there, its starting to really iritate me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>

<h2>            Unable to cut, copy and paste folders as the folders are locked by other program.</h2>
                    <strong>Original Title:</strong> Windows 8 locks folders intermittently in explorer when cutting and pasting<br />
<br />
When I move folders in explorer it will complain that the folder is locked by another program and won't let me cut and past it. It a random, if I deselect the folder and reselect it, it will sometimes let me cut and paste it. It's frustrating, and I never experienced
 this with previous versions of windows. Does anyone know why Windows 8 is different?
