<h2>            Windows 10 update on bootcamp bluetooth issues fix</h2>
                    <p>My bluetooth stopped working once windows 10 upgrade was installed. I found this simple fix:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Open Device Manager, open the Bluetooth Radios subtree, right-click the "Apple Broadcom Built-in Bluetooth" icon, and choose the "Update Driver Software..." menu item.</li><li>Choose "Browse my computer for driver software"</li><li>Choose "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer"</li><li>Select "Apple Inc." for Manufacturer, and "Apple Built-in Bluetooth" for Model, and click Next.</li></ul>
<p>After the driver installed, The device list sows "Apple Broadcom Built-in Bluetooth" had been replaced by "Apple Built-in Bluetooth" and "Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator" in the Bluetooth Radios subtree of Device Manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was then able to use the <strong>Add a device</strong> wizard to set up my Bluetooth mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<p />
                </div>

<p>@joesej thanks for posting&nbsp;this work around.&nbsp; It worked a treat for my apple Bluetooth card in Windows 10.&nbsp; I have been able to pair my iPhone and keyboard&nbsp;via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I just need to get a wireless driver that works reliably in Windows 10 with my Broadcom&nbsp;(BCM943602CS) Wi-Fi combo card.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Yes I have both the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules for this card working under Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I downloaded the latest Apple drivers using Bootcamp Assistant under OS X.&nbsp; The BC Assistant wizard allows you to save the latest Apple drivers to a FAT32 formatted USB stick.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The previous drivers that have been hosted in various locations on line were v5 drivers,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The latest Apple drivers are v6, which I understand have been written for Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have downloaded the latest drivers, navigate to \Bootcamp\Drivers\Broadcom
</span></p>
<p><span>There you will find the wireless and Bluetooth drivers for this card.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Install these and both should be ready and waiting to be used.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have attached a screenshot of the Device Manager tree from my PC, which shows the Apple Bluetooth and Broadcom 802.11ac wireless elements are correctly installed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The tree also shows a couple of 'Other Device' items, which are part of the combo card and Apple specific I think.&nbsp; Anyway the card&nbsp;works without drivers for these other two elements.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 freezing&#47;stuttering after update due to Wifi card being enabled solved&#33;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello everybody I am thankfully posting this in hopes of helping you guys out with this huge problem with a random Windows 10 update causing freezing and stuttering issues because of a conflict with the Wireless card which causes the PC to freeze when
 data is being transferred. After many days luckily I came across one reply in a post that was from 2008 and the user state that he had a similar issue with Windows 7. Reboot Pc and enter the motherboard BIOS then go to chipset and disable the Onboard LAN then
 save/exit and reboot. That solved a huge issue for me and I hope it does you too. I changed stuff in regedit, rolled back to previous builds, tried different drivers and multiple other things. This is not what I expected seeing how this pc has worked fine
 with this card and hardware from XP-Windows 10 until the Anniversary update then I got that problem. So I don't know what the issue is coding wise but this fixed it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stand corrected I found the base of the issue and quickly solved it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I did countless trial and error task for a few days and as luck would have it were all being fools. Some problems might be a driver or registry error/ malware but after tons of research and experimenting
 I found my problem occurred due to using a 2.4 ghz mouse along with a 2.4ghz wireless card around combined with being in an area that had a crap ton of 2.4 ghz gadgets being used in the same area. Soon as i changed to wired mouse everything was fine. I took
 my PC to two different locations and everything is fine using my wireless mouse and other configurations. So just try a wired mouse or try and turn off some devices using that frequency. Hope this helps the struggle come to an end!</span></p>

<h3> feelfeline  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 pro 1803 update shows wrong folder sizes</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 pro 1803 update shows totally wrong folder sizes. same problem is reported by other users here. Same problem is posted here by other users too, as early as May 2018. I wonder what has been done about it by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is two fold</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you select a folder directly from left pane of the file explorer by right clicking it, it shows totally wrong total size.</p>
<p>2. If you left click the folder in the left pane to see listing of subfolders and files in it - in the right pane, and then select everything in the right pane by control +A and then right clicking it to see total size of all folders and filess, the folder
 that is just underneath the cursor is selected and shown at the top of the box that opens to show the total size. Here too it shows wrong size information. I wonder why windows selects name of the folder underneath the cursor to show at top of the box even
 when you select all folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft will take care of this on urgent basis and not sleep over it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Windows since windows 3.11. Every time there is a upgrade, some old problems disappear and totally new ones crop up in the most unexpected places.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP. thanks</p>

<br />
I have a folder that shows 47,3 GB of data, but if I go into the folder and select all subfolders and check the size, it's 99,9 GB.

            I have just copied from a flash drive a 3 GB folder onto my HP computer drive C (SSD) and the folder size displayed on the computer was like 150MB. The subfolder sizes were also wrong but all files were copied and could be opened. If it is a bug it is
 quite bad.

<h2>            How to fix a corrupted temp file from Media Creation Tool</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I just get my laptop upgraded to Windows 10 by using Microsoft Media Creation Tool. Since there a function to create installation media for another pc thru DVD ISO files, I have tried to download it. Unfortunately, during the downloading process,
 my laptop power off and downloading process unsuccessful. Due to this a +/- 2.2GB temp file has been created in the folder called:&nbsp;$Windows.~WS. And, I not able to get rid of the temp file even I have deleted it by stop running the BITS. The temp file keep
 rolling out once BITS resume running status. May I know how to resolve this issue since this temp file take up quite a number of space for my HDD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for further reply.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for prompt reply. Yes, I've tried out treesize but the problem still persist including remove the empty folder as well. The temp file is called&nbsp;BIT1EA7.tmp. I think the culprit might due to BITS keep rolling the corrupted file. Is that anyway to refresh
 the 'memory' of BITS in order for it to 'forget' the downloading process of&nbsp;BIT1EA7.tmp?</p>

            Hi Tonya,<br />
<br />
<br />
Inasmuch as we'd like to help you with your concern, it would be best if you contact your software manufacturer for better assistance.<br />
<br />
We also encourage you to send your query as a suggestion to the Windows Feedback Hub since you can only encrypt CDs using a third-party software.<br />
<br />
We're just a post away if you have further concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

            Just an aside, and not knowing what you are going to do with the CDs, but CDs are very poor long term storage media. Just keep that in mind.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
BitLocker is a professional&nbsp;level encryption program and should not be used unless one<br />
really understands that it is&nbsp;secure and can not be broken by any&nbsp;usual or inexpensive<br />
methods IF AT ALL. Only those with superior backup strategies should even consider
<br />
its use.<br />
<br />
BitLocker is more frequently used and supported by those&nbsp;in the TechNet IT Pro Forums.<br />

            <p>I second Rob Brown's caveat about using Bitlocker unless you are aware of the dangers of using encryption and rigorously follow best practices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although "Bitlocker to Go" can encrypt removable storage media such as USB flash drives and SD cards, it can't do the same for optical media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to encrypt optical media, you'll have to use a third-party tool.&nbsp; Some are suggested here:&nbsp;

<p>.</p>
<p>To clear cache</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1. Go to the system blade on the dashboard</p>

<h2>            Error code 0x80070057 when checking for performance issues</h2>
                    I just got a new Acer Aspire with Windows 7 pre-installed in July 2012.&nbsp; My computer is running slow and something is running in the background.&nbsp; I don't have a bunch of junk installed - other than what came with the computer and MS office home.&nbsp; I use
 ESET only.&nbsp; My problem is that when I went to "check for performance issues"&nbsp;&nbsp; I got an error code 0x80070057 and couldn't check.&nbsp; I have already ran a virus scan thru ESET (online).&nbsp; I have noticed other people have come up with the same error code with different
 problems than mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very frustrated because I have tried so hard to keep my computer issue free and now this after only three months! &nbsp;

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            This issue can be caused by the following factors:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. The Windows Update service has been stopped.<br />
<br />
2. Corrupted Windows Update Temporary folder.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;In order to narrow down the cause of this issue and resolve it, please refer to the following steps. After finishing each step, please check the result again on the Windows Update website.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Some third party programs can affect the Windows Update service. If you are running any third party applications such as Spyblocker, Internet or web accelerators (programs designed to boost the speed of the Internet connection), security or anti-virus
 programs (Norton, McAfee, Norton Internet Security 2008 etc.), I recommend we temporarily disable or shut them down and then try accessing Windows Update later. Please understand that we are disabling these programs only for the purpose of troubleshooting
 and we can re-enable these programs after we finish troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Step 1: Verify the relevant Windows Update services<br />
<br />
=======================================<br />
<br />
1. Click the Start Button, in Start Search box, type: "services.msc" (without quotes) and press Enter. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
2. Double click the service "Windows Update".<br />
<br />
3. Click on the "Log On" tab, please ensure the option "Local System account" is selected and the option "Allow service to interact with desktop" is unchecked.<br />
<br />
4. Check if this service has been enabled on the listed Hardware Profile. If not, please click the Enable button to enable it.<br />
<br />
5. Click on the "General" tab; make sure the "Startup Type" is "Automatic" or "Manual". Then please click the "Start" button under "Service Status" to start the service.<br />
<br />
6. Please repeat the above steps with the "Background Intelligent Transfer Service" service.<br />
<br />
You can also temporarily stop these services, restart the computer, and then start these services again. If any service is missing or cannot be stopped or restarted, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Step 2: Rename the Windows Update Softwaredistribution folder in Normal Mode.<br />
<br />
============================================================<br />
<br />
This problem may occur if the Windows Update Software distribution folder has been corrupted. We can refer to the following steps to rename this folder. Please note that the folder will be re-created the next time we visit the Windows Update site.<br />
<br />
1. Close all the open windows.<br />
<br />
2. Click the Start Button, click "All programs", and click "Accessories".<br />
<br />
3. Right-click "Command Prompt", and click "Run as administrator".<br />
<br />
4. In "Administrator: Command Prompt" window, type in "net stop WuAuServ" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Note: Please look at the cmd window and make sure it says that it was successfully stopped before we try to rename the folder. However, if it fails, please let me know before performing any further steps and include any error messages you may have received
 when it failed.<br />
<br />
5. Click the Start Button, in the "Start Search" box, type in "%windir%" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
6. In the opened folder, look for the folder named "SoftwareDistribution".<br />
<br />
7. Right-click on the folder, select Rename and type "SDold" (without the quotes) to rename this folder.<br />
<br />
8. While still in the "Administrator: Command Prompt" window, type the command "net start WuAuServ" (without the quotes) in the opened window to restart the Windows Updates service.<br />
<br />
Note: Please look at the cmd window and make sure it says that it was successfully started. However, if it failed, please let me know before performing any further steps and include any error messages you may have received when it failed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, to clarify the issue and provide more accurate troubleshooting steps, please assist me in collecting the following information.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How to capture a screenshot<br />
<br />
======================<br />
<br />
1. Press the Print Screen key (PrtScn) on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
2. Click the Start Button, type "mspaint" in the Search Bar and Press Enter.<br />
<br />
3. In the Paint program, click the "Edit" menu, click "Paste". Then click the "File" menu, and click "Save".<br />
<br />
4. The "Save As" dialogue box will appear. Type a file name in the "File name:" box, for example: "screenshot".<br />
<br />
5. Make sure "JPEG (*.JPG;*.JPEG;*.JPE;*.JFIF)" is selected in the "Save as type" box, click "Desktop" on the left pane and then click "Save".<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Please send this saved JPEG file to my email account at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
<br />
&nbsp;How to collect the WindowsUpdate.log file<br />
<br />
================================<br />
<br />
1. Click the Start Button, type "WindowsUpdate.log" (without the quotes) in the Search Bar and Press Enter. We will see a file named "WindowsUpdate.log"<br />
<br />
2. Now click on the "File" menu and then click on the "Save As".<br />
<br />
3. From the left panel, click "Desktop" and click the Save button.<br />
<br />
The file will be saved to your Desktop. Please send the file as an attachment in an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.<br />

<p>You're now FOUR months behind on critical security updates. See...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleaning a Compromised System<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc700813.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc700813.aspx</a></p>
<p>Back-up any personal data (none of which should be considered 100% trustworthy at this point) then format the HDD &amp; do a clean install of Windows.&nbsp;<strong>Please note that a Repair Install (AKA in-place upgrade) will NOT fix this!</strong></p>
<p>HOW TO do a clean install of Vista: See the "If you want to reinstall Windows Vista by performing a clean installation..." section of<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-Vista</a></p>
<p>After the clean install, you will have the equivalent of a "new computer" so take care of everything on the following page before otherwise connecting the machine to the internet or a local network (i.e., other computers) and before connecting a flash drive,
 SDCard, or any other external drive to the computer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 steps to help protect your new computer before you go online<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pypc.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/pypc.aspx</a></p>
<p>Tip: After getting the computer fully-patched, download/install KB971029 manually before connecting any external drive to the computer:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971029</a></p>
<p>NB: Any Norton or McAfee free-trial that came preinstalled on the computer when you bought it will be reinstalled (but invalid) when Windows is reinstalled. You MUST uninstall the free-trial AND download/run the appropriate removal tool BEFORE installing
 any updates, Windows Service Packs or IE upgrades AND BEFORE installing your new anti-virus application.</p>

<h2>            Windows installation error</h2>
                    <p>First i have installed windows 10 pro then later after few days i have the windows startup problem then i thought of removing the RAM and placing it again but even though its not working so i thought of repairing the OS even the repair doesnt work then i
 thought of re installing windows and inserted the removable disc then gone through the installation process and i got an error saying that "the upgrade option isnt available if you start your computer using windows installation media&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a copy of windows is already installed on this computer and you want to upgrade, remove the installation media and restart your computer. After windows has started normally insert the installation media and run windows setup"then i thought of going into
 the custom installation process which does not keep the files and formated my system reserved local disc then i went back to the upgrade option and it was showing the same error and now i restarted my computer it is saying that "An operating system wasnt found
 try</p>
<p>disconnecting any drivers that dont contain any operation system i have no idea what to do further&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi akashsmashki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that your post has been idle for days now. Were you able to resolve the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A bootable USB or DVD with Windows 10 is needed to bring up the Command Prompt to resolve this issue. I suggest that you create an installation media. Check out the steps found<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a><span>
 on how to create one. Once done, bring up the command prompt by doing the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Boot from the Windows 10 installation media.</li><li>Once you have reached the <strong>Windows Setup</strong> screen <em>(where you select the Language, Time and Keyboard settings)</em>, press the
<strong>SHIFT </strong>+ <strong>F10 </strong>keys to bring up the <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Find out whether your disk is set to <strong>GUID Partition Table (GPT)</strong> or
<strong>Master Boot Record (MBR</strong>):<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>diskpart</span>and
</strong>press <strong>Enter</strong><span style="font-style: italic">.</span></li><li>Type<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>list disk</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Look for your disk and see if the GPT column has an asterisk (*) – this will indicate the disk is<span>&nbsp;</span><span>GPT</span>. If no asterisk is found, then the disk is set as<span>&nbsp;</span><span>MBR</span>.</li><li>Type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>exit</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the type is MBR:</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From the <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, type<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>dir a:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.
<ol>
<li>If <strong>drive A:</strong> is found and a directory is displayed, check for the<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>\Windows</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>folder in the directory. If it is there, that is the System Drive. Skip to step 2.</li><li>If the drive is not found or it doesn’t contain the <strong>\Windows</strong> folder, type
<strong>dir b:</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Continue through the alphabet until the drive with the \Windows folder is found, but skip the
<strong>X:</strong> drive. That will be the install files from the USB or DVD you are using. The most common location is the
<strong>C:</strong> drive, so that example will be used in the rest of the article.</li></ol>
</li><li>Once it is found, type:<span> <strong>bcdboot</strong><span style="font-style: italic"><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>C:\Windows /S C:</strong></span></span>
<ol>
<li>In this case,<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">C</span><span>&nbsp;</span>is the drive where Windows folder was found. If the Windows folder is on a different drive, use that drive letter instead of “C” in the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>bcdboot</span><span>&nbsp;</span>command
 above.</li></ol>
</li><li>The message<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Boot files successfully created</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>must be shown before you can continue.</li><li>Type:<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>diskpart</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type:<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>list disk</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type:<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>sel disk C</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.
<ol>
<li>In this case,<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">C</span><span>&nbsp;</span>is the drive where Windows folder was found. If the Windows folder is on a different drive, use that drive letter instead of “C” in the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>sel disk</span><span>&nbsp;</span>command
 above.</li></ol>
</li><li>Type:<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>list vol</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type:<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>sel vol C</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.
<ol>
<li>In this case,<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">C</span><span>&nbsp;</span>is the drive where Windows folder was found. If the Windows folder is on a different drive, use that drive letter instead of “C” in the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>sel disk</span><span>&nbsp;</span>command
 above.</li></ol>
</li><li>Type:<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>active</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.
<ol>
<li>You should get a confirmation that the volume has been successfully set as active. If you don’t get the confirmation, it means that either the disk is set to GPT (not MBR), or there is a problem with the disk. Make sure you are working with the right disk.</li></ol>
</li><li>Type:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>exit</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Reboot the device - you can do this quickly from the command prompt by typing:<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>shutdown -f -r -t 00</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the type is GPT:</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From the <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, type<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>dir a:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.

<li>If drive A: is found and a directory is displayed, check for the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>\Windows</span><span>&nbsp;</span>folder in the directory. If it is there, that is the System Drive.

</li><li>Type:<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>list part</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span>and press

If the letter<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>R</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is already taken, you can choose any unassigned letter. To assign the
 letter type:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>assign letter=r:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and press

<h2>            &#34;Fatal error&#34; Message pop-up inside Game App</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my situation -&nbsp;I previously opened a Windows store game app and after clicking "Continue" on the Main Menu inside the app&nbsp;a message popped up reading as follows,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Fatal error at ..\Gear\Win8\AudioSampleMixer_Win8.cpp(147):l_xa-&gt;CreateMasteringVoice(&amp;I_master)88890017:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; The pop-up did not offer me any options other than just simply clicking 'Ok' and then it closed. Because of this I am afraid to do
<em>anything.&nbsp;</em>The game is 'Jewels East of India' and it has been played multiple times with no problem.&nbsp;I would greatly appreciate any&nbsp; help with this issue. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regards</p>

            <p>Hi Leon, </p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums. <br />
</p>
<p>Is this issue confined to this specific app? </p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like Jewels of East India Company game app might be corrupted. Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. I would recommend you to run the app troubleshooter and check the results.

<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, you may <strong>uninstall and reinstall </strong>

<p><span><span>Make sure that you are using and signed in with the correct Skype account. Also, clicking the phonebook icon on the top right side of the account page
 will show all of the contacts and bots. You will only see the recent activities you had on the first page. You may use this FAQ Article below on Skype for Windows 10.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows Panoramic Themes Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> etrnlflame  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Panoramic Themes Not Working</h2>
                    I'm having trouble with the panoramic themes. I've gone to "Personalize" and "Get more themes", and many of the regular themes have worked, but every time I select a panoramic one (I have dual monitors), I get a message stating "Windows can't open this
 file" and it tells me that it cannot select a program to open the file.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help with this problem would be much appreciated.</div>
