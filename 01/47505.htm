    <title>Windows 10 wont update or install drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> milan vuksa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 wont update or install drivers</h2>
                    <p>Hello, So i reset my windows last night and now i cant install my Nvidia video card drivers as well as other drivers because it says its not compatible with the current version of windows. So i try to update, but most of the updates wont install. I keep
 getting the error Updates Failed to install. I got the windows update assist or whatever it was called and i spent a few hours downloading the huge update just to be hit with a "Failed to update" when it finished downloading and started installing. So i reset
 windows again this morning and it still wont update or install drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC also keeps freezing and crashing with the error code CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT. Ive researched and its probably due to a faulty driver, thats why im trying to update my drivers and windows.. not working out..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Help?</p>
<p>

<p>Ive opened windows trouble shooter. It keeps telling me Updates needed. So i press Apply the fix. Starts downloading update, then when it needs to install the downloaded updates, it says "Failed To Install 2018-4-15." or just simply "Error" I've updated
 most of the drivers, but i still cant update my GPU driver because it keeps telling me to update windows which it wont let me update..</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the error code, idk? everything should be compatible. Do i possibly have a faulty component? how do i know which component is the cause?</p>

<h2>            Is there anyway to get offline maps with GPS support on the Surface 2 &#40;or original surface rt&#41;</h2>
                    Is there any third party hardware/software that can do this? This would seem to me like an awesome idea! Is anyone at least working on this?

            Try getting in touch with Garmin. &nbsp;There is no way to get true GPS internally with the RT class tablets but it is not impossible to create an adapter kit and a driver for the RT class tablets to access the feed from a portable GPS unit.

            <p>Yea, Nokia is probably Microsoft's experiment for the next generation RT tablets.&nbsp; I hear that it is a pretty good machine and also is available with 3G (of course).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I checked with Garmin myself and you cannot contact them unless you own one of their systems and a customer.&nbsp; They do have apps for Android and iPad and connect with the GPS unit via Bluetooth.&nbsp; The RT has Bluetooth, does it not?&nbsp; Well, if somebody can contact
 them, maybe they will make an app for the RT class tablets.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Nokia HERE maps won't work on the Surface RTs because they don't have a cellular circuit.&nbsp; The software would work, but there is nothing for it to connect to.&nbsp; GPS works with the cellular towers which then connect to your phone.&nbsp; It goes by signal strength
 to "guess" where you are at.&nbsp; Garmin has come up with a way to get some of the tablets and laptops that don't have 3G/4G so they have "sensors" that they offer.&nbsp; Now, if they would an app for the RT, like I suggested, the RT can connect with a sensor and there
 you are!</p>

            <p>It's a matter of any manufacturer that has been building USB GPS adaptors to create the drivers and port the software. Unfortunately MS has lost the trust from the Manufacturers.&nbsp;They see&nbsp;RT&nbsp;as a very risky investment, they are expecting to see MS to drop
 the ball at any time. And on the other hand MS has repeatedly failed to transmit the to manufacturers that that is not the case this time. And lastly but not less important, manufacturers do not want to see MS has a competitor in the Tablet market, so they
 are doing the impossible to make MS to abandon this "adventure". This is my opinion.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We have this GPS situation but there are many other examples</p>
<p>1- Cisco says that there is not market for them to invest in a VPN client software for rt.</p>
<p>2- Toyota has not developed the Entune for RT because they don't see the market</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And I can keep going... The hope is in the sales numbers for this Christmas. So far MS is doing good. Best buy sold more Surfaces than any other Tablet and that's a very different picture to what we saw last year season.

            These tablets probably sold faster than anything on Earth. &nbsp;I was going to get a Surface 2 and could not even get on Microsoft's web site. &nbsp;I tried the other stores that had them and all of them are "out of stock".
<div><br />
<div>I even tried two local stores that had only a few delivered to them and even the demo models are gone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft only built 3 million 2nd generation machines and is unknown if it is each model or a combination of both. &nbsp;That may still not be enough in numbers to get manufacturers to start supporting the RT class machines "yet". &nbsp;It is a positive move forward
 though.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem with VPN is Cisco primarily. &nbsp;Cisco wants full control of the firewall and that doesn't fly with Microsoft. &nbsp;That is also an unsafe situation as well even though Cisco does have a pretty good, secure system. &nbsp;If the RTs where UNIX based, no
 problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It also looks like those 4 or 5 viruses made for ARM systems are making the rounds right now and at least one RT got hit with one just yesterday here on the forum. &nbsp;So now, Windows Defender is not going to be good enough for the security aspects of the
 system alone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So now, the idiot hackers are out there trying to target these machines. &nbsp;That can throw a wrench in the gears for support as well.</div>

            <p>Best bet is to get with Garmin or the other GPS makers to make a map app plus a driver for a USB GPS device in order for it to work.&nbsp; Don't hold your breath on getting it, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of software/hardware makers today will not support the ARM based Windows 8 RT tablets.&nbsp; If you contact them, they will plain tell you they won't.&nbsp; I and many, many, many others here on the forum and elsewhere have tried that and that is the response
 we get or get no reply at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The online GPS maps are not accurate since they go by IP address and in some cases, you can be 30 miles away from the plot point.&nbsp; You can try that with the BING Maps app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be able to dump the Surface 2 and get the Pro 3 i3 model ($799) which will run the software and drivers for GPS units.&nbsp; That would be the lowest priced, Intel based Surface tablet.&nbsp; That is what you need.</p>

            Thanks for the reply - like I said, I didn't do enough research. Along with touch problems with dropdown menus, I realize that I bought a bit of a dud product - a $500 mistake (ouch).

            <p>A lot of people did that.&nbsp; They saw Windows 8 on the screen and thought it was a regular PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can look at it as a secure backup machine.&nbsp; I have the RT and use it for that.&nbsp; I am currently on the Pro 3 (i3 model) and this particular model is pretty good and doesn't have the issues everybody else is posting about.&nbsp; Since it is a regular PC, a

<h2>            Blue screen&#58; &#34;irql not less or equal&#34; error on xps 15 9560</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's some days that 2 or 3 times per day I get a blu screen error "irql not less or equal" while I'm using my pc. It happens in very different situation of use, soft use or GPU intesive gaming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tested my RAM with mdsched.exe but everything is ok. I've tried to update drivers, especially GPU drivers but it these were not the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>Using&nbsp;eventvwr.exe I've found a recurrent critical error, "Kernel-Power 41 (63)". I've never overclocked my CPU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you suggest to do as next step?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking to reinstall window cause the error comes after no new installations of particular software/hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            Hi RiccardoArnaldi 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I am assuming you are able to get into your computer. If not, do let me know.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Riccardo
<br />
<br />The minidump file indicates your video card device driver is the cause of your system crashes . . .
<br />
<br />Windows 10 updates may have installed an incompatible video driver on your system, your best option would be to install a slightly older version of that driver . .. 
<br />
<br />Go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

            The dump file references the iaStorAVC.sys :
<br />
<br />BugCheck A, {ffffd80000000000, 2, 0, fffff8070475e780}
<br />
<br />Probably caused by : iaStorAVC.sys ( iaStorAVC!Wcdl::Allocator::freeContiguous+20 )
<br />
<br />The iaStorAVC.sys is the Intel storage driver so try installing the latest Intel storage driver from Intel - the following appears to be the latest for the chipset (HM175)

<h2>            Tablet mode windows 10 osk is too small</h2>
                    Well, this is the 3rd time I am trying windows 10 on my Xplore Bobcat.&nbsp; I thought the answer to my problem would be custom scaling, but I was wrong.&nbsp; So, before I revert to 8.1 for the final time, I am going to ask the community.&nbsp; I mostly use this device
 without a keyboard, so the tablet mode osk is vital.&nbsp; However, the osk&nbsp;is so much smaller on this display.&nbsp; Typing this has been soo much work!&nbsp; I just want it bigger!&nbsp; 3rd party solutions do not work the same and have given my nothing but problems.&nbsp; Any ideas
 on how to make this thing bigger?&nbsp; My resolution doesn't have any effect.&nbsp; Enlarging the app and text&nbsp;objects doesn't help.&nbsp; I feel trapped.&nbsp; Am I stuck using Win8.1?

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I play around with an Asus T100TA.&nbsp; The size of the screen might be similar to your device.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I undock from the keyboard and just use it as&nbsp;a tablet, in tablet mode, when I open the On Screen Keyboard, I can resize it and also move it to any place on my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get that keyboard by&nbsp;tapping on Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Ease of Access &gt; On-Screen Keyboard.&nbsp; Am I speaking about the same keyboard here?&nbsp; You can pin that OSK to your start menu, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I press and hold on a corner of the OSK and make it any size.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can press and hold the side of the OSK and make it wider.&nbsp; Do you use a stylus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brenda</p>

</p><p>The other osk is known to me, however it dies not provide the same experience.&nbsp; I would like to avoid using it if possible.&nbsp; Additionally, 3rd party solutions seem to behave in similar fashion to this keyboard, which does not serve my purpose.</p>

            <p>Dear Friends, the problem is not about extra OSK , the problem is at the proprietary touchsreen keyboard which went too small after upgrading to windows 10 (about 1/3 size ) and the size of it not adjustable, so it is not usable. It happened at my Allview
 WI7 tablet, too. Something to do at the registry or some fix from Microsoft is waited. If registry manipulation , please step by step , what to do and how to do ! Thank You !</p>

            <p>Absolutely right Joseph. &nbsp;I have a Lenovo Yoga 11S, no osk issue after upgrade. &nbsp;Also I have a cheap HP Stream 7, no issue. &nbsp;What makes my Xplore so different? &nbsp;I tried windows 8.1 to 10 upgrade and a clean windows 10 install. &nbsp;Same osk issue. &nbsp;I can't use
 my tablet like this. &nbsp;It's a rugged device and needs to function for me without manually starting a special osk or connecting to a extra input device. &nbsp;I really hope this can be resolved.&nbsp;</p>

            Linney, have you tried any of the suggestions you posted?&nbsp; They seem to have no effect on my osk.&nbsp; Autosizer, for instance, does not detect the osk as a window at all.&nbsp; None of the others work either.&nbsp; I wonder if these applications are looking for a "Form"
 style object to hook?&nbsp; At any rate, thanks for the reply.

 get the notebook to boot from the recovery DVD. I even tried screwing around with the BIOS settings, all to no avail. I've looked for help in different forums, but so far I've met nothing but fail. Help!</strong></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Here are some options : (be sure no USB drives are plugged in while you attempt to solve this issue)<br />
<br />
To boot from a Vista disk - Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen<br />
as you boot - set the boot order to CD/DVD 1st - remember to set back later.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do not<br />
have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your<br />
System maker will&nbsp;sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Try StartUp Repair from Recovery Options and/or a Vista disk.<br />

<br />
Also from the Command Prompt of Recovery or a Vista disk :<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
(there are spaces after k and before /&nbsp;&nbsp; and after f and before / )<br />

<p>Can't download to console mon, but can use the engines by going to say google etc. Consoles have only one browser by default and not much security aside from it being on a microsoft console version of the net which is ok but I really don't recommend using
 it for general browsing if you can avoid. Its more of a convenience than anything, like you need to look up a quick question or xbox live status or what ever but I wouldn't use it for to much more than that. PC much better option

    <title>Why do unicode musical notes appear as squares when online&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ç¥ påtä§er  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do unicode musical notes appear as squares when online&#63;</h2>
                    Using musical notes created from Microsoft Word's&nbsp;unicode, I pasted them to create a new "name" for Music in the Start menu. I much prefer using icons whenever possible and am so glad customization is so extensive (and that I found: http://www.word-2010.com/insert-musical-notes-in-word/).
 It is also quite impressive that&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Word is so&nbsp;simpatico&nbsp;with Microsoft Windows.
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, I find it peculiar that when I'm online, the music notes in the Start menu sometimes appear as squares, as if Windows 7 can no longer render their unicode.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why would being online interfere with unicodes used to rename an entry in the Start menu?</div>
<div>Why would being online even interfere with Windows 7's basic structure?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Far as I know, this issue is cosmetic, disfiguring my aestheticism whenever online. More importantly, though, I worry my security might be&nbsp;compromised. While I do use Microsoft Security Essentials and update it frequently, it seems something internet-related
 is communicating or interfering with what I presumed was offline content.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</div>
</div>

            While I couldn't pinpoint what the cause was, Safe mode did&nbsp;alleviate&nbsp;the issue, even while getting online afterwards. However, the next day, the issue returned, but I opened the same programs, if not fewer, than when the issue was temporarily "fixed".
<div><br />
<div>I've also noticed squares have replaced the kanji, hiragana, and/or katakana for song titles in Windows Media Player. Is it just a coincidence that anything music related on my laptop is affected? Probably, since WMP just happens to be the only other program
 where unusual unicodes are actually implemented on my laptop. Still, strange.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, this seems to happen whenever I get online. Restarting Windows 7 does fix the issue, but only temporarily. If anything, I've uninstalled 3rd party software rather than open any.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've recently opened my included webcam software, and downloaded a dictionary and Microsoft Security Essentials. I've uninstalled a 3rd party Anti-Virus program (bloatware). Again, all recently. But, that all seems irrelevant. Whether before or after,
 this issue has cropped up, particularly when online for the past 2 years (since I purchased my laptop).</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only possible culprit I can think of in terms of 3rd party software is HP, which, since my laptop is their brand, has plenty of their programs installed, some of which might be running in the background. Also, I use an air card, which requires a program.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yet, I don't see how they would cause problems with unicode, which are, as of yet, strictly used in Windows 7 and Windows Media Player on my laptop.</div>

            I downloaded Microsoft Safety Scanner then performed a <b>Full Scan</b>. That did choke my simple screensaver, but I managed to exit and turn it off. Anyway, over a million files were scanned, clocking in at nearly 11 hours.
<b>Files Infected: 0</b>
<div><br />
<div><b>"The scan completed successfully and no viruses, spyware and other potentially unwanted software were detected."</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>Having utilized a 3-month trial anti-virus bloatware program (recently uninstalled), Windows Defender (off), and currently Microsoft Security Essentials, I don't believe they've ever encountered any hazardous software on my laptop.</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>As of right now and online, the aforesaid unicodes are accurately displayed. My experience would suggest, however, that they'll likely appear as squares sometime in the future.</div>
<div><br />
<div>With the results of the Microsoft Safety Scan inconclusive re this issue, what else should be done?</div>

            Yep, happened again. Only this time, it was <i>before</i> getting online. I start my computer for the day and already Windows can't read the unicode.
<div><br />
<div>All seemed fine yesterday. I even performed a Quick Scan with MSE before shutting down. What's, uh, going on?</div>

            I'm unsure if it's specific to Microsoft Word. While I did copy and paste unicode music notes from MS Word to rename a category in the Start menu, this issue also affects Windows Media Player. However, I will post my question in a Microsoft Office forum

<div>Even now, the squares have replaced the unicodes for both musical notes and the kanji, hiragana, and/or katakana. This now occurs whether online or off.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I renamed the Music category in the Start menu with musical notes, which were copied and pasted from Word.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Several .wma files in Windows Media Player use kanji, hiragana, and/or katakana by default (or online album updates), having been ripped from import CDs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Those seem the only uncommon unicodes used on my laptop. They are quite disparate examples, as are the Start menu and Windows Media Player. The only connection, perhaps, is the Music&nbsp;category. However, it seems to me that some overarching
 program, whether it's Windows 7 in general or one of its sub-programs is causing unicodes to appear as squares.</div>

                    <p>Yesterday two games, Microsoft Sudoku and Cribbage Classic, which I have been playing for months suddenly became unusable.</p>
<p>I received error messages:- </p>

Hereâ€™s the error code, in case you need it: 0x803F8001</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cribbage Classic is currently not available in your account.<br />
Hereâ€™s the error code, in case you need it: 0x803F8001</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstall and reinstall but the install does not work.</p>
<p>Instead I receive "Couldn't install. We'll retry later".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously some Windows Update has caused this problem.</p>

            <p>Hi Monica, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess if the Camera roll folder is deleted then you can perform System restore to an earlier date and check if it helps.

Search</span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span>Search</span>.)</span>
<li>
<p>Enter <span>Control Panel</span> in the search box, and tap or click
<span>Control Panel</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span>Recovery</span> in the Control Panel search box, and then tap or click
<span>Recovery</span>. </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Wired and Wireless Network Problems &lt;- set the down arrow on right of page<br />
to Windows 8.1 which applies to Windows 10<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;The router can be the issue even it other OS's are working fine. And <br />
I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver :.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - <strong>click Update Driver (may not do</strong><br />
<strong>anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi</strong><br />
<strong>Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device<br />
maker (such a RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What Skype version are you on? Specify the exact version, not latest or recent.

    <title>Rise of Nations - Offline settings not saving - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cruros  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rise of Nations - Offline settings not saving</h2>
                    <p>First, let's start with an introduction; I am a computer technician by trade with 10 years hands-on experience troubleshooting and fixing Windows and Apple computers. I am not a networking guy. I know my way around registry keys and values. I know how to
 get games working with compatibility mode (usually). I can follow directions, like how to "Play games offline in Windows 10 using Offline Mode".</p>
<p>
</p><p>That aside, let's dive into my issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working with a customer to get Rise of Nations: Extended Edition working offline on his Windows 10 Home Premium machine. I follow the directions via the "Play games offline in Windows 10 using Offline Mode" article and they work! Until we power off
 the machine. What this means is that; after we have changed the settings that the article says to change, we can unplug the ethernet cord and RoN works fine offline. No messages about signing in to Xbox, I can leave the game entirely and relaunch it and it
 works offline! Great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when we restart the computer and launch RoN, it says "Please sign in with Xbox to continue" and gives us to option; 1) "ok"&nbsp; &nbsp;2) "exit".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This customer has no internet at home and would like to play the game they paid for offline. The article "Rise of Nations: Extended Edition Faq" make it sound like you don't need internet to play if you follow the directions from "Play games offline in Windows
 10 using Offline Mode". This would be entirely inaccurate if they require a Xbox log in every time you restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thought is that there is a registry key that is not saving properly. I have reset the Windows store, several times, set this computer as the designated "offline device" several times.&nbsp; I have reset and reinstalled the game several times to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get these settings to save so it is not asking to sign into Xbox live after a restart?</p>

<p>Also, this is a fresh install of Windows 10 Home Premium 64-bit. Just updates and VLC player have been installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I was wondering if the log in process may be the cause. We are using a local account to log in to the machine, not a Microsoft account. Which means there is no Xbox live account associated with it unless it is online and logged in to the Windows Store.
 This is something I have not tried yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But seeing as the customer does not have internet, it would be best to keep it a local account if possible.&nbsp;</p>

Have you gone into the store and set the option under Offline Permissions, Manage your devices for "Make this PC the one I use to run some games or apps that have limited licenses, even when I'm offline." ?

            Yes I have Tormaz. A few times. Using this link&nbsp;https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/gaming-on-windows/play-games-offline-windows-10 . This works fine until I reboot the machine. Then I am asked to sign in to Xbox live to play RoN.&nbsp;

            I switched the local account to a Microsoft account, but this did not resolve the issue. I tried uninstalling the game, restarting the computer and reinstalling the game. Same problem. The game works offline after I sign in to Xbox live once, that is until
 I restart the machine and then it will not work offline again due to "Please sign into Xbox Live to continue" message. I am going to try to reinstall the O.S. as this seems like it should be a setting that should be saved after a restart.

<p>That's a good question Ackis, worth exploring. I may try some other games (free ones) and see if they have the same issue. Do you know of any such games in the store that also claim to be playable offline? I honestly don't know of any at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am already running updates on the fresh install. No vlc player or adobe reader installed this time. Started at 1803, going up to newly released 1809. Gonna have to check it tomorrow when I return to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They do not have any other Windows store games bought atm. They had their original Rise of Nations disc from 2003 and Windows 7. I could not get it to work on Windows 7, so recommended an upgrade to Windows 10 and to buy the RoN: Extended Edition from the
 store. In the faqs, it clearly said you can play offline if you follow these directions. And here we are! Unable to restart the computer without it asking to log in to Xbox Live.</p>

<p>Is there a free hitman game in the Windows store? I only see paid for ones. I could be missing it some where.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried Age of Empires: Castle Siege and that is online only. Cannot play offline. Same thing with the Ashphalt racing game. Candy Crush Saga works without internet just fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, I did a completely fresh install of Windows 10. Updated to 1809, installed nothing else. Didn't even resolve the missing driver issue (It's not related to this issue). I even set this one up as a Microsoft account during the installation process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I still have the same exact issue as before; Computer and store are set to play offline, and this works if I go online and log into RoN with the internet hooked up just fine. If I then unplug the internet the game gives me the option to "play offline".</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT this is not the case when I restart the computer and try to load up without internet. I says "Please log into Xbox Live to continue" with only "OK" or "Exit" as options. And "OK" just loops me back to "Please log into Xbox Live to continue".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is certainly not an operating system issue and likely is not a registry issue I would think. Does anyone else have any thoughts on this?</p>
<p>

<p>Unfortunately I do not think this is fixable without a software change from Microsoft. I have tried everything that I can think of except changing registry keys for Xbox Live, which I don't want to do seeing as I am unfamiliar with these keys in particular.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, let's take a look at the text from Microsoft that would lead you to believe that playing this game offline should be possible.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re planning to be in an area with no online coverage, such as a long-distance flight or a sailing excursion, you can prepare your Windows 10 device to allow you to play Rise of Nations: Extended Edition
 offline.</p>

<p>If you play offline, some features, such as the ability to purchase additional items from the Windows Store, will not be available. Additionally, any leaderboards will be unavailable while you're offline.</p>
<p>If you earn any achievements while playing offline, they will sync to your account the next time you sign in to Xbox Live on your device. Your game save progress will also sync when you sign in to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>You also won't be able to use the benefits of Xbox Live while offline. See<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-titles/rise-of-nations-faq#whyshould" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why

<p>Hey Cruros thanks for keeping in touch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that the License itself is attached to the Microsoft Account so every time it loads the system has to verify that the game is owned. We would have to have the device connected to the internet. This particular issue has been reported to us previously
 as we can see from the game reviews, the best bet would be to reach out to our support team through the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support website</a> since they would be able to look further into this issue. Give it a shot and let us know how it goes!</p>

    <title>Printer won&#39;t work after last Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printer won&#39;t work after last Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p>After the last Windows 10 (on 12/1/2017) update my printer stopped working (HP Envy 4520). I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, downloaded and installed latest driver, run through device troubleshooter multiple times with no luck.</p>
<p>When I try to select the print icon to print a document I get "Windows cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup". &nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw a previous post related to Epson printers and the latest Windows 10 update - is there a similar issue and fix for HP printers?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Tried a hard reset and it made no difference. Then did a factory reset and reinstalled the game, which forced it to re-sync my progress with the cloud storage and this recovered my level and progress. I did *not* attempt to play it while it thought my level
 was zero before trying this in order to avoid a conflict with the cloud syncing. Took the better part of an hour to do this and I have half a day of re-installing all my other games ahead of me, but at least it recovered my progress.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if you mean the original problem (no, only Dead Rising was messed up after the game update today), or the factory reset (it clears the *local* copy of all progress in all games, so when you enter each game again for the first time you get a
 "Syncing data for &lt;game name&gt;" message as it downloads your saved progress from the cloud - haven't checked all my games yet because they're queued up to re-install but the couple I checked are all fine). So as long as your game was syncing to cloud storage
 correctly your progress in each gets recovered. Sadly, there's no way to check, the cloud storage just works or doesn't, you don't get to browse what's stored or what's not.</p>

<p>People! &nbsp;Your save is not gone. &nbsp;You simply did not allow the game to update 100%. &nbsp;There is a bug in the system that allows you to start the game before the update is complete. &nbsp;But if you do start the game, is doesn't show any save file. &nbsp;If you allow
 it to complete the update, your save file will be there. &nbsp;That said, if you started a new game while it was updating, i can't say what would happen.</p>

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0e5fd1f5-e7ae-4590-9125-f340b745fa2c" title="friends4life">
friends4life,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you're having issues with your video's music that is&nbsp;skipping during playback. Let me help you with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may be caused by unsupported file types, outdated video drivers, corrupted codecs, or an old version of Movie Maker. To troubleshoot this, we request you to follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. Check that the files you are using are of a supported format - Some file formats are not supported by Movie Maker. You can read about the list of supported file types in this
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B. Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files -Audio and video require codecs to play the file and itâ€™s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try running the <strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft FixIt
</a></strong>tool for codecs.</li><li>Media info will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and whether itâ€™s already installed in your computer or not. You can get it
<span>at this <a href="http://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a>.</span></li></ul>
<p>C. Ensure that your video card drivers are up to date - Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with various software.
 To determine the version and video card driver date, kindly run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on Start button and type dxdiag in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.</li><li>Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.</li><li>If your video card driver seems outdated, please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.</li></ol>
<p>D. Ensure you have installed the latest version of <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker#t1=overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Movie Maker</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, please provide the following information below to further isolate this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the skipping of the music/video happen after saving the video to a movie (Alt + F + M)? What settings did you choose and does it also occur if you choose a different setting?</li><li>Does the issue happen when you play the movie using another player such as Windows Media Player?</li><li>What are the file types used or added to your movie?</li><li>Please provide us the movie that appears to be skipping so that we could check it on our end. Upload that in the private message area that I provided for you.</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Glenda</p>
