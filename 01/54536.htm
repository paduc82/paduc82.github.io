<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f6d362b2-3843-4d8b-8a05-780a0cf6e762" title="kmarcKk">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Surface Community. I can see here that you encountered thermal issue.&nbsp; We can try a series of troubleshooting steps that will help resolve the issue. just a heads up after the troubleshooting steps, still
 having the same issue our best next option is to process a replacement order. Our replacement order will depends on the warranty of the Surface device and the region where the device was purchased.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the troubleshooting steps: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Run SDT or Windows Updates &gt;&gt;Please use this link :
<a href="http://aka.ms/surfacedt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://aka.ms/surfacedt</a><span>. or <strong>For WU:</strong><span> Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Updates &gt; Check for updates</span></span></li><li>Check Power mode slider &gt;&gt;<span>On applicable models, the Power mode slider is found by clicking the battery icon on the Windows taskbar.
<p>For improved performance, the slider should be set to Better or Best performance.</p>
<p>Setting the Power mode higher than Recommended will impact battery life, so the customer should connect to a PSU if possible or remember to lower the slider when they no longer need the CPU performance boost when on battery.</p>
</span></li><li>Check Task Manager &gt;&gt;
<p>From the <strong>Startup</strong> tab in <strong>
Task Manager</strong>, disable unnecessary programs and then restart.</p>
<p>After the restart, from the <strong>Processes</strong> tab in
<strong>Task Manager</strong>, view any items with abnormally high CPU usage. Click the

<h2>            Werewolves Confirmed 11&#47;2&#47;11&#33; Proof Included&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Let me start by saying that in all likelyhood this will be taken down as many forum posts I've seen about this have been taken down at Bethesda's request.</strong>
<strong>Also, it should be expected that one, more or all links I've provided can be taken down any time.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Also, I suggest clicking <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY76RUsRro0&amp;hd=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/qY76RUsRro0?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/qY76RUsRro0?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div> and listening to an epic orchestral song titled "He Who Brings The Night" for dramatic effect. Trust me, it's awesome and it fits perfectly.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Now then, onto the confirmation.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>First off, <a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6223/6305995933_d306c1720e_b.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this image</a> was among the first leaked.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6234/6305995971_8b447c829d_b.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This</a> is a potentially more credible image, as it is a hex editing window for Skyrim
 on PC which features stats from within the game. The original source can be found
<a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/615803-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/60854066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. The poster claims his friend has renamed the hex editing window for comedic effect.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Possibly the most positive confirmation of all are the following two pics from the in-game quest journal and inventory screen. Click
<a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6115/6306519216_43a125df77_b.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> and <a href="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6059/6306519264_4e6546bc76_b.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Also, there are vids of leaked gameplay featuring werewolf npcs as well as player transformation. I won't link them here but they're easy to find (look them up on google or youtube or whatever and filter the results by looking only at content that was
 uploaded today). You may want to hurry though, as Bethesda is on the war path with containing this information. As I said in the beginning of my post, several forum posts I've seen have already been locked and deleted elsewhere.</strong></p>

<p>This is the reason why reviewers shouldn't even get copies early. &nbsp;They are the ones leaking the games, duh. &nbsp;Give them a FREE copy of the game on official release, then make then do their reviews. &nbsp;Quit giving people copies of the game early and spoilers
 will be avoided. &nbsp;If it is truly a great game, the reviewers are still going to reflect that in their writing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>For a game this big, they could afford to give reviewers copies 5 days to a week before release with minimal leaks. Those reviewers will determine ratings. So I'd imagine giving them copies early is a good idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of ratings, how exactly is GOTY determined? Through ratings?</p>

            Hi Denise
<br />
<br />Open Disk Management (accessible by right clicking on your Start Button)
<br />
<br />If you right click that partition, what options do you get?
<br />
<br />How many other partitions are on that drive and is there data on that drive you need to keep?
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the Disk Management windows       
        </p>

<p>The hard drive is listed with drive letter P with the Recovery Partition next to it.&nbsp; The hard drive wasn't connected to my motherboard when I re-installed Windows on the new hard drive.&nbsp; I just connected it this morning.&nbsp; The Recovery Partition is listed
 as "Disk 7 partition 1" in Disk Management.&nbsp; When I right click on the hard drive, no options appear except "Help".&nbsp; When I reinstalled Windows on the new hard drive, it didn't create a partition named Recovery Partition.&nbsp; It created a partition named System
 Reserved (D:).</p>

<p>That appears to be your only recovery partition on a Legacy install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try opening an Admin Command prompt and using the command below to tell if that partition is currently being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>reagentc /info</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy and paste the listing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to delete it, Diskpart may do that or you may be able to disable the recovery option using reagentc.&nbsp; You are booting using only the C partition which is an old Win 7 configuration.&nbsp; Having recovery media would be essential if you remove the
 recovery partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know how such changes might effect any future Win 10 upgrades. </p>

<p>It's strange that the Recovery Partition is needed with a new install of Windows on a new hard drive when the old hard drive wasn't connected when Windows was installed.&nbsp; Why wouldn't a new Recovery Partition be installed on the new C drive during Windows
 installation instead of a System Reserved partition?&nbsp; The Windows program had no idea that there was a Recovery Partition on the old hard drive.&nbsp; What would happen if the old hard drive had failed and Windows couldn't depend upon it to use?&nbsp; If the Recovery
 Partition is needed in the future, will Windows know where to find it?&nbsp; I also don't understand why Windows would use an old Windows 7 configuration when I never had Windows 7.&nbsp; It's strange that the original install of Windows created a Recovery Partition
 and the second install on a new hard drive didn't but instead created a System Reserve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I leave the Recovery Partition on hard drive P, will it confuse Windows if a recovery is ever needed?</p>

<p>When you do a Legacy install, the primary drive is used for the Active Partition, which is where the boot files are kept.&nbsp; One reason we always recommend removing other drives in the system when doing installs.&nbsp; If the drive was pre-partitioned, Windows
 may not have had an option but make do with what it had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if it will bother any future installs.&nbsp; It may just create a new one on your current drive..</p>

<p>The hard drive that I installed Windows on was brand new, never before used, never partitioned.&nbsp; I disconnected all of my other hard drives except the new drive when I installed Windows.&nbsp; I reconnected them after the Windows installation.&nbsp; It's been about
 a week now since I installed Windows and just this morning decided to connect the old Windows hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not planning on future installs or concerned about how Windows will handle a future install.&nbsp; I'm concerned that it might now confuse the old Recovery Partition with the new System Reserved partition or the consequences it might have on my current Windows
 installation if I remove the Recovery Partition on Drive P.</p>

<h2>            Turn off the power switch to Xbox One X after it is turned off</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was wondering if its safe to turn off the power to the xbox one x after i have shut it down.</p>
<p>In the settings i have set my console to be in 'energy saving mode' and when i want to turn it off, i hold the home button on the controller and then select 'turn off console'. After that i give it a couple of seconds to let the flashing white light on the
 system turn off, then I switch off power to the console. When i switch off the power i sometimes hear a little bleep from the console, which leads me to believe that it wasn't completely powered down when I turned off the power.</p>
<p>So will the method i use to turn off the system , hurt it in the long run ?</p>
<p>And should i go into the settings menu and select 'full shutdown' (although i dont remember seeing that option)</p>
<p />

            This shouldn't hurt the console as it is considered one of the power cycling steps.&nbsp; However, if you want to shut your console off fully why not just take it off of the energy saving mode?&nbsp; Have it shut down completely when you're not using it.

            I don't think that would be causing an issue.&nbsp; The audible chirp might be coming from the power brick (in the console for the S and X) which would still hold a small charge after shut down.&nbsp; Do you have other devices plugged into the Xbox that might also
 be affected by the shutdown, such as external drives or headsets?

            If you truly want to power off the console you should be doing it by holding down the power button for several seconds on the console.

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Keyboard Cover Not Working - auto rotate and tablet mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psg73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Keyboard Cover Not Working - auto rotate and tablet mode impacting</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have been following the&nbsp;Surface Pro 3 Keyboard Cover Not Working for some time and it seems unresolved for many as well as myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the recommended methods from MS and contributors and even purchased a new cover thinking it may be hardware related but without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to propose this is being caused or impacted by the auto rotate and also the tablet mode functions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I disable both of these the problem does not reappear except for when the auto rotate attempts to engage, which it does try often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we permanently disable auto rotate? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Opinions and guidance are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<h2>            After Windows 10 April 1803 update, BSOD when trying to reinstall SoundBlaster Zx sound drivers</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I don't know how you did it Microsoft, but you really screwed this one up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Once again after getting a major update my Sound Blaster Zx sound card driver was screwed up, I have a 5.1 surround sound speaker system and my center channel and bass speakers will NOT WORK without a fully functioning "sound blaster" driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The only problem is when I try to install the latest driver (March of 2017) the system BSOD's with
<span>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL"</span></p>
<span>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Error and the faulting module is <strong>Chdrvr01.sys&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled this same driver the last time this happened so I KNOW the driver is not bad nor is the download, it's the windows update 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my sound system working again if the system BSOD's EVERY time I try to run the driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I stop the system from blue screening?? can I turn that off until I get the driver installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm sorry if I sound rude but I have WASTED and entire day on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NEVERMIND!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I finally figured it out...‚Ä¶</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It wasn't the sound card causing the problem, it was incompatibility between the sound driver and CH Products joystick driver/software, that was NOT THERE before the 1803 update.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Rob,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are, I am also completely fed up with every enforced Win 10 update constantly breaking my Sound Blaster Zx.</p>
<p>Anyway this update also broke my sound today and i tried so much stuff already but cant seem to figure it out. I don¬¥t have any sound whatsoever since the update. I updated my driver, unistalled and installed again, restarted my computer several times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure what the solution was from your explanation.</p>
<p>Would you mind (or anybody who understands it) explaining exact steps to fix this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, this happened to me already like 20 times every time during Win-10 update, and every time works completely random step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you if you answer,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcel</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm also fed up of losing my center and woofer sound on every major new update for Win 10. I reinstall these drivers and it seems to fix it every time, although you have to re-set your speaker settings... http://support.creative.com/Downloads/searchdownloads.aspx?filename=SBZ_CD_L13_1_01_10.exe&amp;ShowDetails=1

<h2>            Decline game updates&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've just moved to a new home and I haven't got broadband installed yet and it won't happen for a while. To fill the gap and allow some online gaming I'm using 3G internet but it's annoying that my console keeps insisting on downloading multiple gigabyte
 updates (Forza currently wants to down load a 3Gb or ¬£15 update). My question is, is there any way to decline updates so you can just play the game offline? Many thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>WinXP split screen issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khahli  say:</h3>
<h2>            WinXP split screen issue</h2>
                    Brand: Compaq Presario<br />
Model: V6444US<br />
OS: XP sp3<br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
<br />
When the computer was turned on this morning the entire screen (from boot start) was split into tiled copies of iteslf. Even when I go into the BIOS screen, it too is split in tiled copies. When Windows boots, the entire desktop is tiled. Each tile has it's
 own cursor, task bar, desktop icons, and programs. All tiles work simultaneously (not individually), so when the mouse is moved, all cursors move the same direction and click the same icon in each tile; when a program is opened, it opens in all tiles. No new
 programs have been installed and no updates occurred since last use (the night before).<br />
<br />
Attempted fixes:<br />
<br />
1. simple reboot - no change<br />
2. system restore - no change<br />
3. updated graphics driver - not needed<br />
4. virus scan - clean<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any clues about how I can remove the split and make it normal again (short of complete reinstallation)? Any help is appreciated thank you.<br />

<h2>            start button</h2>
                    I think I messed up. I'm trying to get use to Windows 8. I clicked the start globe/button on the toolbar at the furthest left side. It is the one that list all the programs etc. I was looking for the turn off choice. It said exit so I hit that which did
 not turn the laptop off but did get rid of the start button, B &nbsp;Now I can't find it anywhere.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I get that back on the tool bar?</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thanks</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Windows 10 lets you create your own theme with a custom desktop background, Windows border and Start menu accent color. If it's not working, then we suggest running your PC on a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong>. Safe Mode starts your Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers.
