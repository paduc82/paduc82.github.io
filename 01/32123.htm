<h2>            Docking station charging - Surface 3</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the same <span>"plugged in, not charging"&nbsp;</span>issue as so many others do!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed ALL the recommended resolution steps again and again, but the device still does not charge effectively or consistently.</p>
<p>I always have to fiddle with the charger, plug and unplug and it will start charging if I'm lucky (!!!). I have already purchased a new charger but the problem persists. It is just so frustrating and nerve wrecking. So unreliable!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't stand worrying about it anymore and before giving up and buying a new laptop I wanted to ask if I will have a better chance at charging via a docking station.</p>
<p>Does the Surface 3 docking station use the same port for charging?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone previously had the charging issue resolved with a&nbsp;<span>docking station?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard 5000 defective USB Wireless Transceiver &#40;Not from Earth anymore&#41;</h2>
                    <p>As noted by others Keyboard stops working or you get weird stuff on the screen writing or like me Left Shift Key and Microsoft Groove activates.&nbsp; It's the USB Transceiver.&nbsp; Three PCs all the same.&nbsp; Second 5000 set up works fine on all three PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll find in the control panel -- Devices -- "Microsoft Wireless Transceiver" which the mouse still works with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I too would like to know how to get a replacement Transceiver that can be paired with the Keyboard 5000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft!!! Give a solution instead of more plastic recycling.</p>

            Hi Dano

<p><span>Hi Fernando Y.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Vendor, got them on-line while in the USA.&nbsp; Just left there last week and now in Indonesia for a long winter out of the cold :).&nbsp; I think I paid about $50 USD each.&nbsp; Returning it or contacting POP hardly worth the time.&nbsp;
 GEEK squad would look at me ???? about the same for the cost of a new one.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have no clue on the dynamics of the pairing of the USB transceiver, mouse and keyboard of these MS 5000's.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Just strange that a few other things happened at the same time with a Window's Update @18 Sep.&nbsp; Things disappeared from one PC and went to the Cloud, something I rarely do and it pisses me off.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Of note the transceiver is quite exposed to other USB items and other cables not to mention on two of my PCs very close to my left hand to get a unintended touch that one forgets.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Very happy how well it worked.&nbsp; Guess I'll check out what is available now in Indonesia.&nbsp; Big Ban on Imports right now.</span></p>
<p>

            If you feel the update caused your issue, one option is you can try rolling back to the previous build.  I would recommend reset Windows 10 keeping your files and apps . . . 
<br />
<br />To do this
<br />1.	 Start your PC as Windows attempts to load and the spinning dots appear, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds.  This is known as a Hard Shut Down
<br />(Do this twice )
<br />2.	Turn on your computer for the 3rd time and it should come up in the Recovery Environment
<br />3.	You will be prompted for System Repair/Safe Mode/Command Prompt
<br />4.	Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows 
<br />5.	If this is unsuccessful, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps,

<p>That procedure does not repair a device.&nbsp; As noted in my message, three PCs, same issue.&nbsp; Different MS WCK 5000 unit works fine on the same three PCs.</p>

<p>folks who have like 50,000</p>
<p>80,0000</p>
<p>140,000 gamer scores</p>
<p>really, you think you can just say goodbye to that and move on to sony or nintendo?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>me, i thought i could take pride in my score for decades to come. now thanks to microsoft's betrayal i realize my wife was right all along. its just a freaking waste of time slaving for that 1000 game score, when this score is entirely at the mercy of someone
 else. thank you microsoft for showing me the light.</p>

<p>gamerscore will be irrelavant with the next xbox. developers will be able to add weekly challenges to increase gamerscore easily for people. &nbsp;achievements are no longer standardized and quite frankly, trophies are an improvement on achievements.</p>
<p>oh so you have 50,000 gamer score? I have 5 platinum trophies. (platinum = all trophies for the game)</p>

<p>As I have heard but may be rumors is as followed. Gamerscore with the new Xbox &nbsp;will be taken deeper into involvement with you're profile. Rewards are supposedly going to be given out to profiles who hit big milestones but as I said there just rumors...</p>

<p>Quick, off the top of your head, name one of your friends' exact gamerscores.<br />
<br />
See...that's why nobody cares.&nbsp; The only person who ever looks at yours is...you.&nbsp; The only thing I've found them useful for is seeing if a friend had finally nailed a tough achievement we'd been talking about.&nbsp; But the number?&nbsp; Meaningless.&nbsp; Someone with 10,000
 score from 10 tough games is a better gamer than the person who has 150,000 by milking easy cheevos from hundreds of games.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, more involvement with the achievements. It's probably just going to upload to facebook automatically. Woohoo, big deal. Lets give a round of applause for Microsofts vague answers to questions. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft beats
 BoA out for worst company of the year next year.</p>

<p>Honestly, I thought it would be a big motivator this generation. Then I lost my main Xbox Live account because I forgot the email address I'd used to register with. It was just so long ago and probably a business email address that I never got it back. It
 annoyed me no end at first, and then I thought... "what have I really lost". OK it was cool to have 60K plus gamer score and 60 platinum's on PSN, but I'm not really attached to them like some seem to be. Perhaps because I know they're not 'real' and only
 really mean anything to those who are into those bragging rights.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Activation Using Embedded Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> z46v  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Using Embedded Key</h2>
                    <p>I need some assurance and documentation that when Windows 10 says it is activated it is actually legally activated. This is in a corporate/commercial environment, so we need to make sure this is correct and proper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer in question is a Dell Latitude E7440. Originally it was Windows 8 with downgrade rights to 7. It had Windows 7 Pro installed and activated. Because it came with Windows 8, I assume it has the embedded key in the UEFI/BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We purchased Windows 10 keys specifically to upgrade older computers. This laptop was imaged with Windows 10 Pro. The image was created with the official Windows 10 Media Creation Tool. The intention was to use one of the purchased keys to activate the newly
 imaged laptop. However, after the image and initial setup, the activation screen indicates that Windows 10 is activated with a digital license. We never needed to input a key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my understanding, officially from Microsoft, the "free upgrade" period ended July 29, 2016. That is why we are questioning this seemingly "free upgrade."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any documentation or legal license agreement that would prove that this is in fact a fully licensed and legal copy of Windows 10? We need to prove this to our legal department. All over the internet there are reports that this still works and is
 functional, but there is no official word from Microsoft.</p>

            Hi  z46v
<br />
<br />This has been asked many times on Community and Microsoft have come out before with an answer:
<br />
<br />This case indicates the difference between being activates and licenced, those are two very different things
<br />
<br />Yes, it is still possible to activate Windows 10 with a Windows 7 or 8 licence key, but according to Microsoft the resulting Windows 10 is not legally licenced

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Where in documentation or the license agreement does it say this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically Windows 10 was installed fresh on a laptop that was originally Windows 8. Windows 10 detected the embedded key and activated on its own. How is this not a legally licensed version of Windows?</p>

            Hi z46v, you should probably contact Microsoft Support regarding this matter. I advised many users here on Community they could still activate Windows with their Windows 7 and 8 licence keys and was advised (nicely but firmly) by a Microsoft Representative that my advice was incorrect and that the advice I was providing was not aligned with the Windows 10 EULA Agreement . . .

<p>And I've done that myself on personal systems just fine. It looks like everything's fine. Windows is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in a corporate environment, it's pretty galling that everything can look fine, when it's actually not. And there isn't a way for the end user to know. Feels like entrapment. This whole "the free upgrade period ends on this specific date" but then
 actually letting it happen indefinitely without any explanation or way to know if it's legal is pretty nasty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll see if I can make time to call or chat with them. If I get anywhere I'll update this thread.</p>

<p>I had two chat sessions with MS concerning this issue. The first chat session essentially ended with "call pro support." The second chat session ended with "have your legal department contact Microsoft's legal department." When asked if this applied to private
 citizens (for lack of a better term, meaning non-commercial) the answer was the same. You would need a lawyer to contact MS to get an answer. Also got a (different) phone number for pro support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have transcripts of both of these conversations. Maybe I will have time to call pro support and see if they can provide any different answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still. It boggles my mind they would allow this to happen (Windows activating using previous version keys) without providing the means to find out if it is actually legitimate.</p>

<h2>            Micro hdmi connection to TV not working after updgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Prior to installing Windows 10 when I connected my TV to my Samsung 900X laptop through the laptop's micro-HDMI connection the TV immediately sensed the connection and displayed the laptop screen.&nbsp; After installing Windows 10 the TV does not recognize any
 input from the laptop.&nbsp; I was hoping the most recent fixes to Windows 10 would include this problem as I've seen a number of references to it on the internet, but no such luck.&nbsp; Any thoughts on what I should do?</p>

Hello, sorry to hear about your problem with Call of Duty, let's see if I can be of some assistance.
How long has this been happening to your account? Were you able to connect before?
If you are not receiving an error stating that your account was banned, then your not banned. MS and Activision let's players know when they are banned from XBL/their game.
Here are some simple solutions that might resolve the issue, that I've used in the past when I've encountered this error:
<ul>
<li>
When this happens, try disconnecting from Xbox Live, then power cycling your modem and router to obtain a fresh IP address.
</li><li>
Once your modem and router have been power cycled, try connecting to Call of Duty again.
</li><li>
If the same problem occurs, try directly connecting your Xbox to your modem/router and see if that fixes the problem.
</li><li>
Make sure UPnP is enabled on your Router.
</li></ul>
Hope one or some of these help, if not, please post back, and we'll see if we can't find something that will fix the problem.
Good luck, and I'll see you out there on COD. :-)

<h2>            Photos import into 1st Jan 1980 folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Been having this problem for a while and think it all started with Windows 7 but I'm now on 10. &nbsp;When importing photos using my card reader they always end up in a folder '1980-01-01'. &nbsp;The current date is set up correctly in the camera and this translates
 correctly when looking at the date taken in the Properties of imported photos. &nbsp; Having deleted this folder, the folder regenerates itself when importing another photo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't find any help on the internet although it seems that other folk have had a similar problem.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>After importing photos from the card reader and mobile phone they all appear in a 'Photo' screen, with options for Collection, Album or Folders and they are sorted in the correct date order. &nbsp;However, when I go to look at the file structure, pictures from
 the mobile phone have gone into a correctly dated folder but those from the camera go into this 1st Jan 1980 folder. &nbsp;So, they import correctly from the mobile but not the card reader.</p>
<p>I cannot import directly from the camera because of a connection issue and have updated the Trnscend card reader software to the most recent version.</p>

<p>Thanks for the assistance but I have bought a new camera and can now download directly from the camera. &nbsp;This works fine and seems to induicate that there was a problem with the card reader or its firmware. &nbsp;So now sorted thanks.</p>

    <title>Surface Pen Replacement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zech5p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pen Replacement</h2>
                    Hello, I have had my replaced Surface Pro 4 for around 3 months, and now and the Surface Pen that came with the Surface doesn't work. It started off by not writing, but the eraser and side buttons both functioned. Then it stopped working completely, but
 will remain connected through Bluetooth even after I have replaced the battery and the pen tip. As this is my second Surface, I don't feel I should have to purchase a third pen. Is there a way I can get this replaced?

<h2>            Can&#39;t Troubleshoot Network Connection - Diagnostic Policy Service is not running &#40;Error 1079&#41;</h2>
                    Can't Troubleshoot Network Connection.<br />
<br />
The Diagnostic Policy Service is not running properly. I cannot fix it and thus I cannot run the Network Diagnostics "Troubleshoot problems" tool.<br />
<br />
It looks as though the "Diagnostics Policy Service" is being started by windows 7 in an effort to resolve the problem. The result, however, is that the Network Diagnostics "Troubleshoot problems" tool (right click on internet connection icon in tray, select
 "Troubleshoot problems") reports again that the service is not running, and "Troubleshoot problems" still doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I have tried starting the service manually (it is set to "automatic") but I get this error:<br />
<br />
Windows could not start the Diagnostic Policy Service service on Local Computer.<br />
Error 1079: The account specified for this service is different from the account specified for other services running in the same process.<br />
<br />
So then I tried to change the account to "Local Service" instead of "Local System" but it didn't work because i don't know the password. also, that may not be the correct account - I don't know. It was a shot in the dark.<br />
<br />
Here's what I got from trying to run "Troubleshoot problems"<br />
<br />

    <title>Surface Pen doing jagged&#47;discontinued strokes in Surface 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angela-c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pen doing jagged&#47;discontinued strokes in Surface 3</h2>
                    <p>Since I got my Surface 3 (running Windows 10) one year ago, I've been using it along with my Surface Pen almost on a daily basis to take notes in university, which has been perfectly fine. But over the past few days, whenever I use the Surface Pen to draw
 or write, the strokes become discontinued or jagged (small dips). I've unpaired and paired it many times, changed the batteries twice, installed all the updates, installed WinTab, restarted my Surface 3 a few times, rolled back the Surface Pen driver, then
 updated it again, and turned off the "Use pen pressure sensitivity" in OneNote. I also don't have anything connected to it, whether USB or power cord. Still having this problem. I've tried writing faster, slower, harder, gentler, with or without the kickstand
 out, with the pen straight, and with the pen on an angle. It does the same thing regardless, but I noticed it seems to be worse when I write fast.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to be a problem with the touch screen of my Surface 3, because it works fine with my fingers.</p>
<p>This problem isn't only limited to OneNote; it also happens for the Ink Test in the Surface app, in the Reader app, even when I use it to select text in Chrome. Is there some way to stop it from happening? Or do I need to send it back for replacement?</p>

            &nbsp;Your pen needs to be replaced -&nbsp;bottom line is that if your pen is less than one year old, you can get it replaced under warranty. If you are in the US, go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store, otherwise contact support

<h2>            Svchost &#40;netsvcs&#41; running at about 40&#37; CPU usage, iphlpsvc causing the problem</h2>
                    Hi I am running windows 7 professional 32-bit. I am having a problem with my computer where the cpu is at 90-100% almost all the time. the problem is being caused by iphlpsvc which is running under scvhost.exe. This iphlpsvc is averaging about 30% CPU
 usage according to the resource manager. Unfortunately I do not know when the problem started. But it has been there for at least a week, maybe longer just can't remember. I have a program that allows my computer to run fairly normally even though this is
 consuming so much CPU but don't want this to keep happening. Is there a hotfix for this or something? I noticed there was one for the Windows server R2 but wasn't sure if that would work for Win 7 as well or not. Would really appreciate any help with this
 problem. I can provide other details if necessary. Just tell me what is necessary and if complicated how to get the info and I will post it. Thx

<br />
make a xperf trace [1] to diagnostic the high CPU usage. Please upload the etl file to your SkyDrive [2] and post a link here.<br />
<br />
I'll take a look at it. Which hotfix do you mean? Can you please post the KB-Number?<br />

</p><p>According to that you are using Volume Licensing which is for large Corporations and requires re-activation every 180 days.</p>
<p>Your System Admin in your I.T. Dept. should know what type of licenses have been bought and use the correct means to re-activate them.</p>

<p>ohhh ok, thanks guys, you guys sure its not my xbox? sorry about the video quality, EA made me take the video quickly -____-. but it shows like moving edges from the top of the wall, and below the wall on the bottom edge its like white pixels moving around,
 it only happens in some stadiums, and usually it happens on one side of the stadium while the other side doesnt have an issue o.O</p>

<p>EA makes some good games and some very bad, rushed games.Whenever you have to rush a title out to match a sports season, your'e bound to run into time constraints during development.
</p>
<p>As such, a lot of these sports games involve a lot of "copy and pasting" to speed up the development. Doing this over and over, you're bound to run into artifacts and aliasing (an unfortunate side affects of taking the easy-path when placing objects on the
 XY plane of the "stadium")</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 can do some amazing anti-aliasing. Much better than the PS3 even. (360 uses 4x MSAA and edge smoothing VS PS3's "quincunx" technique which blurs the entire texture leading to the standard PS3 Washed-Out look)</p>
<p>Make sure your video settings are correct (ie- if your tv is 720p, make sure your settings are set to 720p.) Besides that, there's nothing you can do but hope that next years' game the issue will be resolved..</p>

<p>thanks so much to exilious and everyone else! Microsoft and EA kept telling me it was my xbox i guess microsoft wanted to make money off of this and ea doesnt want to admit they have an issue D= the players and field tho looks great its just the walls in
 the backof the goal net that have advertisement and one side of the side walls that have that issue but that has to be because of anti alaising im guessing, if anyone else has an input feel free to comment! and my tv is 1080 p so i put it on 1080</p>

<h2>            Backwards compatibility - disconnected from Xbox live.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Whenever I attempt to play an Xbox 360 title I get the error message "disconnected from Xbox live", however i'm still connected, just unable to play the games. Has anyone else experienced this issue? I've contacted support, they advised a hard reset and
 to redownload my profile, but still no luck.</p>

<h2>            Frequent BSOD &#40;Blue screens of death&#41; on a custom built PC.</h2>
                    <p>So basically during the time I have had my PC I have been receiving numerous BSOD's these include: Pfn_list_corrupt, memory_management, Page_fault_in_nonpaged_area, Special_pool_detected_memory_corruption, and some others that are less frequent. Now after
 looking on the internet many people have said to run memtest86 so I did for 10 passes overnight and no errors were found other users said that it could be a driver problem so I ran driver verifier but that doesn't seem to do anything. So now I don't know what
 to do so I reinstalled windows yesterday and from then until now I have had 5 BSOD's and I have looked at them with blue screen viewer and it says they were all caused by 'ntoskrnl.exe' so if anyone could enlighten me on what I can do to get rid of these irritating
 BSOD's then it would be much appreciated. P.S. Any browser I use crashes randomly and that is also irritating however I don't know if it is linked with the cause of the BSOD's. Update new BSOD critical_structure_corruption.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To add to XP ROCKS! good advice :<br />
<br />
The most common problem with a new home build is a loose card and/or connection. Remove<br />
ALL power then reseat the cards, memory and cables (on-both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug. <br />
<br />
Memory tests don't catch as errors such as the tiny speed differences between memory modules<br />
that appear to be identical. So it may be necessary to swap the modules in and out in different<br />
combinations and patterns. Faster memory always has to be installed in front of slower memory.<br />
<br />
Be sure to check with MSI Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major<br />
on-board and separate 3rd party device drivers.<br />

    <title>How to move music from old pc to new pc - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to move music from old pc to new pc</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - User Accounts and iTunes</p>
<p>
</p><p>The technology gods have kicked me multiple times in the last couple of months resulting in me having to get a new computer and a whole lot of headaches.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, what I'd like to do is move my music (includes iTunes purchased music, ripped CDs, and other misc. downloaded music) from my old PC to my new Windows 8.1 PC. I would like all user accounts on my new PC to be able to listen to the music. (Currently
 there are only two accounts--myself and my husband.)</p>
<p>Is this possible, and if so, how do I do it? How/would the iTunes application complicate this sharing?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. I spoke with Apple Support multiple times over the last couple of days and the end result is that they "helped" me right into deleting half of my music files. No joke.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update download error 80072ee2</h2>
                    When i attempt to install my updates, after a while it stops and an error message 80072EE2 pops up...Why is this and why can't I download any updates to my windows?? This is super frustrating to say the least, and unexpected from such software, especially
 since it is a brand new notebook. Please can you provide me some assistance in the regard? I also at one stage received messages 80010108 and 80240076 for some reason...Any reasons therefor???

    <title>Sharing between my computers does not work anymore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maurice.br  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharing between my computers does not work anymore</h2>
                    <p>I have two computers on a residential network. The desktop computer in on Windows 10 Pro, version 1809, the laptop uses Windows 10 Family, version 1809.</p>
<p>In recent weeks I cannot transfer files from one to the other. When, from the desktop, I try to open a user account on the laptop, I get a "Cannot Access" message. However I can open the Default User account. The user accounts I need to reach are both "Shared".
 The Permissions are for "Everyone".</p>
<p>If I try to reach the desktop from the laptop, I get a Windows Security window asking for "Network Credentials". What are those? This little window also says: "The user name or password is incorrect", even before any user name or password is entered.</p>
<p>I was using Residential Group to communicate from one to the other. I understand that in recent versions of Windows 10 Residential Groups have been deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I transfer files from one computer to the other? What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you Andre for your rapid response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried your Troubleshooting 1: no change to my status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried your Troubleshooting 2: Desktop cannot access the user accounts of laptop, but still can access Default user account. Now laptop does not "see" desktop: it does not appear under Network in File Explorer. What happened?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am ready to try your Troubleshooting 3, but do not quite understand your instruction. What do you mean by:
</p>
