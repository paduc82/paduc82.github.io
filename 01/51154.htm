<h2>            Unable to install Windows Apps - Error 0x8024500C</h2>
                    <p>I used to be able to install apps, but now get an error telling me that something went wrong - error code 0x8024500C.</p>

<p>I have subsequently tried the suggested solutions in detailed at the following link without any success

<p>
</p><p>Looking across forums it seems that many have had this same error with very few having successfully fixed it.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher palabrica  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update Issues</h2>
                    <p>I have a AMD Athlon 64bit 3500+ running @ 2.2GHz, 4MB RAM, and a 2TB drive.&nbsp; Running windows 8.1 Pro like a champ.&nbsp; After I ran the Windows 10 update, everything seemed to go well.&nbsp; Until I started testing various programs that are routinely used with this
 machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept getting a screen that says, it encountered a problem and needs to restart.&nbsp; After cycling through that a few times, I get a new screen that gives me options to try repairing the problem, which it couldn't.&nbsp; I also noticed that it may not
 like my sound board, because it looks to be disabled after the Windows 10 installation completes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I reset to previous windows build which reset my machine to the original Windows 8.1 configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Windows 10 is pretty cool, although I miss the tiles screen from Windows 8.1.&nbsp; But, I would like to know what I can do to make this work successfully.&nbsp; Should I let it keep cycling?&nbsp; I got the same kind of error when I tried to do a clean install
 of Windows 10 previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original compatibility check didn't find any issues.</p>

            <p>Over the past few days, I've upgraded&nbsp;6 machines to Windows 10.&nbsp; Out of the&nbsp;6 I only experienced one problem with the installation.&nbsp; Three machines are fairly new. These upgraded with no issues whatsoever.&nbsp; One machine was running Windows 7, this upgraded
 with no problem.&nbsp; One is an AMD processor and I've had problems.&nbsp; The other 5 were some form of an Intel processor.&nbsp; In each case, prior to the upgrade, I made sure the drivers were updated to the current driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, Windows 10 is an improvement in speed on each of the machines.&nbsp; I'm not sure why I am having issues with the AMD machine, I have three more to go to fully migrate to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade appears to proceed without any problems.&nbsp; It even gets to the point where you can start&nbsp;up Windows 10.&nbsp; Then when testing each of the applications that the machine will routinely run, I got an error message that Windows encountered a problem
 and needed to restart.&nbsp; After a few cycles it takes you to a screen which gives you options to try to repair the problem.&nbsp; Selecting the repair option yielded no result.&nbsp; I then reversed the install which proceeded with out any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last machine has all our accounting records, so any suggestions will be useful.</p>

            I was finally able to upgrade this machine to windows 10.&nbsp; Had to downgrade the sound driver to the original HP/Compaq driver.&nbsp; The one from the realtek site would not work with the hardware.&nbsp; After I did that, I've not had any issues.

            OK, after Googling around I see that you really aren't asking about VHS2DVD Wizard; you're asking about the USB 2.0 Easy Capture device. In my Googling, I found a review for the Easy Capture device which clearly shows an installation/drivers CD. Did you
 not get one?<br />
<br />
Here's a great place for you to post questions about DVD capture, etc.:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://club.cdfreaks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Club CDFreaks</a> <br />
<br />
Your shutdown problem may or may not be connected to your video capturing issues. There isn't enough information in your post to tell. Here is some general information about troubleshooting shutdown issues:<br />
<br />
As always, start with:<br />
<br />
The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
<span>Shutdown issues are generally caused by a program and/or process that is refusing to exit gracefully. The program and/or process can be from malware or can be legitimate (such as an invasive antivirus like Norton or McAfee). If you
 are using a Norton or McAfee product,&nbsp; uninstall it and replace with a better program such as NOD32, Kasperksy, or Avast (free). The Windows Firewall is adequate for most people. With Vista, shutdown issues can also be caused by old/poorly written drivers
 so make sure all drivers are updated. See Step B. below for general driver directions.<br />
<br />
A.The first step is always to make sure your computer is virus/malware free.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
B. Drivers - Never get drivers from Windows Update. Get them from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html</a> - Belarc Advisor<br />
<a href="http://www.gtopala.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gtopala.com/</a> - System Information for Windows<br />
<br />
C. If the computer is virus/malware-free, drivers are current, and no Norton or McAfee programs are installed, then do clean-boot troubleshooting to see which program/process is the culprit:<br />
<br />
How to perform a clean boot in Vista and XP - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a> <br />
D. If you need more information, here is an excellent shutdown troubleshooter:<br />

<a href="http://www.aumha.org/win5/a/shtdwnxp.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.aumha.org/win5/a/shtdwnxp.htm</a>
<br />
<br />
Standard caveat: If troubleshooting the issue is too difficult - and there is absolutely no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the machine to a computer repair shop. This will not be your local BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place. Get
 recommendations from family, friends, colleagues.</span> <br />

<p>Many Thanks for your response. I have just tried the following to rebuild the performance counters. Fingers Crossed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Vista/Server 2008 and higher, a very easy command to get your base O.S. performance counters working:
</p>
<p>Click on Start, CMD (evelated as an Administrator)<br />
Type "<strong>C:</strong>" without the quotation marks and Enter.<br />
Type "<strong>CD\windows\system32</strong>" without the quotation marks and Enter.<br />
Type "<strong>LodCtr.exe /S:Backup_Original.INI</strong>" without the quotation marks and Enter.<br />
Note: This let's you backup the performance counters before we rebuild.<br />
Type "<strong>LodCtr.exe /R:PerfStringBackup.INI</strong>" without the quotation marks and Enter.<br />
Open up Perfmon and check to see if your counters are showing up properly. </p>

<p>So sorry for the silence. Unfortunately, we still have the same BSOD... Upon running the BlueScreenView, it is always pointing to the network drivers...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfffc806-31d4-4a3d-9345-df6a167c2fee?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfffc806-31d4-4a3d-9345-df6a167c2fee?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>No hardware fault was detected by HP diagnostic tool... </p>
<p>These highlighted drivers were updated by windows update just before the problem is started so am currently planning to roll back the responsible patch and&nbsp;also will&nbsp;try to reinstall the NIC driver?</p>
<p>Will keep you updated.</p>
<p>Many Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Reset Taking Too Long</h2>
                    My Dell laptop has been very slow recently, so I decided to reset it. I chose the option to delete everything, then I chose to only clean the files (instead of wiping the drive.) For well over an hour it has been on the same screen. It says ‚ÄúGetting things
 ready, This won‚Äôt take long,‚Äù which is why I‚Äôm confused as to why it‚Äôs taking long. Is there anything I can do? Is it supposed to ‚Äúget things ready‚Äù for an hour?

            Is this the full-screen display with no option to cancel or stop it?&nbsp; If so I think I'd honestly recommend you let it be, overnight if you have to.&nbsp; Since you're doing a total reset anyway it wouldn't be the end of the world if it got messed up and you
 had to reinstall from an install disc/USB stick (which you can make yourself for free at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Windows 10 Media Creation Tool</strong></a>
 page) but that's a lot of hassle if it will actually finish.

<h2>            Purchased games no longer accessible on XBOX</h2>
                    My Son got xbox and some games with it and had a problem with a Gamer Tag and delated the tag or account and we cant seem to recover that Particuar account or&nbsp; to know what the account was or gamer tag but the game was Minecraft and it was downloaded from
 the ONLINE STORE and we still have the Product Key used to download the game and XBOX tells me the game has Already downloaded but every time he tries to play it it directs him to Purchase it again or redeam a code for it but the code will not work as its
 already been used so he is unable to unlook the game even though its been Purchased and tells us its on his System ?

<p>Codes are one time use only and are tied to the account they were redeemed on. He would need the original account in order to redownload it and play again or at least sign into the original account again and set the console as his Home so he can access the
 game on a different account. Otherwise, the game would have to be purchased again.</p>

<p>Some keyboard shortcuts are built into Windows.&nbsp; Others are functions of various software installed in your keyboard.&nbsp; Probably the best-known standard Windows shortcut is F1 for help.&nbsp; See
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts</a> for a list of Windows keyboard shortcuts, including F key shortcuts.</p>
<p>Most laptops have software that uses the various F keys to perform things like switching between internal and external display, making the screen brighter or dimmer, turning the wifi radio on and off, etc.&nbsp; To make things easier for users to remember, these
 keys often have little icons printed on them.</p>
<p>Some keyboards are sold as "multi-media" keyboards or "gaming" keyboards.&nbsp; These keyboards may have additional special keys in addition the F keys. &nbsp; In general, you must install a specific software application (or driver) to enable these functions.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
 Acer's website doesn't seem to have drivers for its stand-alone keyboards (although you could try looking it up using the serial number on the bottom of the keyboard:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers</a>).&nbsp; Or ask in the Acer forums:&nbsp;<a href="https://community.acer.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.acer.com/en</a>/&nbsp; Or ask Acer directly:&nbsp;
<a href="https://us.answers.acer.com/app/chat/chat_launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://us.answers.acer.com/app/chat/chat_launch</a></p>
<p>There are numerous web sites that purport to offer drivers for the Acer SK-9621 keyboard, but I would be very wary of such sites.&nbsp; If you can't get any help from Acer and still want to try one of these sites, I suggest the following:&nbsp;
 (1) Do NOT, under any circumstances, download and install a program that purports to scan your system to find updated drivers; (2) make sure that your antivirus and antimalware applications are up to date to help avoid "drive-by" infections at sketchy web
 sites; (3) upload any file that you do download to Virus Total before executing the file:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.virustotal.com/</a>; (4) backup your system before installing the driver or at least create a System Restore point.

<h2>            How to fix Windows 7 stalls&#47;freeze&#47;white screen&#47;hangs&#63;</h2>
                    I have been testing for a solution for months now on Windows 7 with random freeze/stall/white screen/hang........what ever terminology applies to this to no avail.
<br />
I have read almost every blog, and I so far did not come up with an answer as of 4/12/12.<br />
I wish Microsoft admit to this problem and fix it.<br />
<br />
Symptoms: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * On a new install, Windows will randomly stop working except the mouse.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * This appears in time from 5 seconds, to a maximum of 30 seconds, then resumes operation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * This behavior re-instates itself with the frequency of every 6 minutes to 30 minutes in time.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If repeated mouse clicks are given, screen turns whitish with the cursor rotation (working gesture).<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; * Upon ending, Operating System returns to normal.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * This has been observed by me on almost every Windows 7 machine one time or another.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;I will save read here as to what I have tried to do. I just need someone to see this post so as to tell me, or link me a solution to this; what seems to me a forever problem with Windows 7 Operating System.<br />
<br />

    <title>Optical drive will suddenly read files in some cd&#47;dvd&#39;s but - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> homeport  say:</h3>
<h2>            Optical drive will suddenly read files in some cd&#47;dvd&#39;s but not others&#63;</h2>
                    I use Windows 7 in my Dell Studio XPS 8100 which is less than a year old. I have never had trouble with the optical drives. I have 2 of the HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW GH50N drives. Suddenly, within the past month, I can load a music CD-R that I made and it will
 open to the folders but gives the message that the folders are empty. Yet, this same CD-R will open on my WinXP and my Mac and show over 200mb of music files. Another example is my CD that I got with my MS Office 2003. I used this to set up this machine and
 install the Office programs. Now, when I insert the MS install disk, it will not automatically start the program. Rather, it shows the folders, but all of the files within the folders are grayed out and inactive. Meanwhile, the drive is grinding away. This
 same disk will work fine in both my WinXP and Mac. Other CD-R disks that I have made open fine as do the DVD's. It is just that selective disk's that will not open. I need the Microsoft Office disks to be able to reinstall the Office application on my Windows
 7, but it will now work.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

<p>Yes, I have tried this a couple of times. Each time it says it can find no problem.</p>
<p>The strange part is that when I play the disk and choose the drive&nbsp; "PROPERTIES", it shows that of the 720mb total space, over 300mb is used, which is about the same that is shown when I do the same thing on the WinXP computer. Yet, if I look at the "PROPERTIES"
 of the individual folder, it shows zero bytes, indicating that there is nothing there. Is it possible that the header information is not being read properly by the optical drive? If so, why doesn't this occur on most of my other discs and why would it occur
 on a microsoft supplied disk?</p>

            If you view Winupdate&gt;History were any driver updates installed? If so go to Dell specific to your tag and reinstall the dell drivers. The in winupdate settings turn off 'reccommended updates'

<p>The problem in doing this is:</p>
<p>The drivers for these drives were factory installed. When I go to the Dell Download Driver site for this machine, it shows a driver that has a different name and a later creation date. My Device Manager shows "HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW GH50N". The driver on the Dell
 website shows "<strong>HS</strong> -DT-ST DVD+-RW GH50N" and the description says that this driver is for my machine. When I questioned the Dell Tech about this he told me that Uninstalling and rebooting the driver located in the Device Manager will bring
 up the latest driver. When I did this, the same "HL....." driver reappeared. So, he said not to put in the website driver ("HS..."). There is one other reason why I hesitated to install the website driver. The optical drives do recognize many of my other disks,
 both CD-R and DVD's, so it seemed to me that the drives themselves were working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a program called CD-CHECK. I installed and ran both of the disks that I am having a problem with. The self-created music disk gave the error message: "file or directory is corrupted and unusable". This is strange since it opens without incident on
 both my WinXP and my Mac.&nbsp; The Microsoft disk, after running the check, said no errors were found. Yet, I can see all of the folder and files, but cannot open any of them in either of the optical drives. This is when the optical disk sounds very odd, different
 then when it opens any other disk. It sounds like it continually is moving back and forth rapidly.</p>

            Thanks - It wasn't too long ago that a clean and install was done and all of the appropriate drivers were reinstalled.&nbsp; However, if nothing else works, I can try to reinstall again, but if other cd's and dvd's are recognized, I don't see how this would
 help. There seems to be some selectivity occurring which would indicate to me that something is causing a conflict between windows 7 and the media.

<h2>            Game downloaded from the store has the wrong language</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I acquired "Dead Space 3" from the Xbox 360 store, but once installed it, I realised it's in Spanish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find a way to change it to English. I made sure the language of my Xbox 360 is set to "English" and downloaded again but it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in Italy, so I would expect the game to be in Italian or English, I can't really figure out why it's in
<em>Spanish </em>instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Xbox 360 games use your account's country to determine which version you get.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if your account is from a Spanish speaking country, your downloaded game will be in Spanish, as this specific game only has one language.</p>
<p>In order to get the English language version, you might have to migrate your account to a different country. But be aware that a lot of Xbox 360 game downloads are Geo-Blocked, and won't download, if your account location doesn't match the location of your
 actual country you're connecting to the Internet from.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer Arminator. I'm Italian, and I downloaded the game from Italy. I could live with the game in either English or Italian but I just don't get why it's downloaded in Spanish... Clearly I'd rather not mess around with my account and risk
 breaking other games, but so far I don't have other choices. How would I "migrate" my account to another country?</p>

<p>Hi Acasaccia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We generally do not recommend having your account region set in a different country than your physical location. This will allow you to access that marketplace and get the games in that language but it can also cause region mismatch errors where you cannot
 download certain content and some banks lock payment methods that are suddenly used in a different country. Licensed digital content (like games, video, and music) that you have already bought can also potentially be affected by region migration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for a language pack for the digital titles would be best but not all games offer them. That would be something to speak with the game developers for as we have no control over that content. Is your account region also Italian or English? You can
 check by going to <a href="https://billing.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please contact our support team at <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us#0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contact Us</a> if you would like them to check on the account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes :)</p>

            <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Remeeming errors can be caused by issues on the account itself. Be sure to check if your billing information is correct at <a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://billing.microsoft.com</a> and also check <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.microsoft.com/services</a> for any outstanding amount issues, these need to be sorted prior to being able to redeem codes.&nbsp;</p><p>After that try redeeming the code on both xbox console and via xbox.com/redeemcode
<br />Also check that the Xbox Live account , the console and code all match region wise, using different regions for any of them cause issues too.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>If you can't find anything wrong and it is still not working, best thing to do is to contact official Xbox Support via Phone or Microsoft Support Chat at <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> they can do a more indepth look into this issue.</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the issue you are facing and appreciate the steps taken to solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the methods provided below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>:&nbsp;Check for the issue in Clean Boot state. <span>
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>*
</span><span>Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the link to view the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>

<span>"How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"
</span></strong>from the link above.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2</strong>:&nbsp;Create a new user account and check if the issue persists in the new user account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Create a local user account in Windows 10</strong>
</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10</a>

<h2>            I am not able to burn to a CD-R no matter the software or disc</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have recently purchased a 50 pack of blank 52x 700mb (80 min of music) CD-Rs made by HP. However, I am--for some reason--not able to burn any data or music to any of the CDs I have tried. I have tried burning music to 23 of the CDs so far (what
 I have been doing this whole entire day), and it never seems to work. I have a compatible DVD/CD drive on my HP 580-023w desktop PC that even advertises on the box that it is capable of burning to CDs. I have the newest drivers for the drive, so the drive
 should be no issue, as I have even watched DVD movies from it before and installed software from it. Whenever I use Windows Media Player or any third-party CD burning software on my Windows 10 PC, it never works. I add the music I want (under 40 mins of music)
 to the Windows Media Player list, then queue to burn.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>After preparing every single file...</strong><strong> It will state 'Writing to disc' on the first track for a few seconds...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0614a106-4dc8-4ab7-a306-d78c4ec8d266?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0614a106-4dc8-4ab7-a306-d78c4ec8d266?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>... Then it will</strong><strong> pop up on error message stating:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74d56156-4c85-41ed-9593-e4ae94f04835?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74d56156-4c85-41ed-9593-e4ae94f04835?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every other third party application I've used also has a similar generic message, with ImgBurn stating that my disc isn't writable (even though it is a CD-R meant for writing to), and CDBurnerXP stating that it, while it does detect I have a drive,
 that it doesn't detect that I have a CD in. I have no clue what to do.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried this on my machine, but with a bit of a different method... I was trying to get this to appear...</p>
<p>If you select the USB type it may cause a problem... Have you seen this pop up ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c377097-84a6-406e-ba88-ea6912ac8f14?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c377097-84a6-406e-ba88-ea6912ac8f14?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... I simply highlighted a number of .mp3 songs, right clicked on them, selected "Send To" the CD\DVD Drive...&nbsp; This prompted the above option to appear...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After selecting next, I got the option to burn them for Normal CD Player, or Computer...</p>
<p>After selecting Normal CD Player I was redirected to a Windows Media Player screen as you posted with the list on the right side only...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected Burn, and they did... Out of curiosity I'm going to check if it will play in my old fashioned Car CD Player...</p>
<p>

            I selected a small number of songs and did the "send to" action, and selected "With a CD/DVD player" like I always do, but when I clicked next, no option to burn popped up. I had to manually go to the manage window and select to burn them. I selected Audio
 CD like I normally do and like you said, but I still got the same message that I have been getting.<br />

<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<h2>            Unable to Capture HDV from a Canon VIXIA HV30 using Cyberlink Power Director ver7 or Windows Moview Maker.____HDV Capture Issue</h2>
                    Unable to Capture HDV from a Canon VIXIA HV30 using Windows&nbsp;Moview Maker or Cyberlink Power Director ver7.<br />
<br />
Running Win 7 Home Premium on a Dell XPS 9000. All software &amp; drivers updated.<br />
<br />
HV30 camera connected to computer via Firewire connection, software detects camera and can control it's functions (FF,REW, PLay), however unable to capture video.<br />
<br />
In&nbsp;Power Director&nbsp;I get an alert saying the i-Link mode on the camera is not compatible with the tape format of the machine. Verified camera settings with Canon Rep. Verified media is HDV (60i).<br />
<br />
In Windows Movie Maker camera is detected and capture can be started but no video is ever captured.<br />
<br />
Video Card is ATI Radeon HD 4350<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions?<br />

<p>Disconnect Firewire</p>
<p>Turn camera to play</p>
<p>tap function button, then toggle down 4 time to menu, select menu</p>
<p>In the "Rec/In Setup", make sure AV to DV is set to OFF</p>
<p>Reconnect Firewire, should work now.</p>
<p>Cannon Camera has many options and if they are all not set correctly, capture is affected, suggest you read the manual and experiment.</p>

<p>Reseal &gt; Audit has three valid pass: AuditSystem, AuditUser and OOBE.</p>
<p>The first doesn't work; I'm trying the second.</p>
<p>For the features maybe I need to configure the x86 passes even if I'm on 64-bit system... really I don't know.</p>

Only way to disable features is to apply unattend.xml to wim.<br />
Did anyone try to configure hidden packages in unattended file?
