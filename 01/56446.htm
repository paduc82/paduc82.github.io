<h2>            Constantly losing wireless Internet connection. What can I do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Acer Aspire V5 laptop that runs Windows 8. I use a wireless connection to the Internet. What I'm about to describe occurs ever 2-3 minutes and has been an issue at multiple WiFi locations (so it's not the router). Also, my husband, using the
 same wireless setup but a different laptop and an earlier version of Windows, has no problems at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first sign of trouble is that, while trying to bring up a new web page, I get the message: "This page can't be displayed. Make sure the web address _____ is correct. Look for the page with your search engine. Refresh the page in a few minutes." At the
 bottom of this message there's a box that reads, "Fix connection problems."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click the "fix" link,&nbsp;I get another message via&nbsp;Windows Network Diagnostics that says, "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem. You can try exploring other options that might be helpful" and the choice to either "Explore additional options"
 or "Close the troubleshooter."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on "close the troubleshooter," the screen reads "Troubleshooting has completed. Problems found: The default gateway is not available." Next to that, there's a green checkmark and the word "Fixed."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I close that notification, I'm back on the Internet and the connection works for another couple of minutes, at which time the whole cycle as described above repeats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that this occurs on various WiFi systems, it's likely something to do with a setting on my laptop. I've been through Microsoft's tutorials on this subject to no avail. Anything else I should be looking at?</p>

    <title>How do I Run Clue for Windows 7, 64 bit&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sergeant extreme  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I Run Clue for Windows 7, 64 bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to run Clue: Murder at Boddy Mansion on a Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium system. It installed correctly, but whenever I try to start the game, all I get is a black screen. I hear background music, but nothing comes up, and a CTRL+ALT+DELETE-----&gt;Task
 Manager says it's Not Responding. FRAPS says 0 frames per second. I tried DOSBox, but all I get is "This Program cannot be run in DOS mode. And Windows XP mode doesn't work either (forum post confirmed that) So does anyone know how to get this running? I have
 also tried the "Compatibility Modes", but I would actually call those <em>"Non-Compatibility Modes with the word Compatibility in it"</em> for all they are worth.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And yes, it shouldn't have any 16 bit code in it. I have run into other posts on forums that said that they have gotten this game to run on 64 bit systems, but unfortunately the posts are old and they no longer respond.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The game was produced Dec 15, 1998.
</span></p>
<p><span>Platform: Windows 98, Windows ME and Windows 95.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the Windows Compatibility mode does not work, there is no other way to get it to run.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using Windows 7 Home Premium, you may try using VirtualBox (www.virtualbox.org) or VMware Player (www.vmware.com)
 and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose.</span></p>

            <p>I heard that there is ways to "trick" the computer into running the game by dropping files into the "SysWOW64" folder. Do you know what this would entail?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This was done for another vintage game I own called Ultimate Yahtzee. You can see the instructions here:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>http://www.amazon.com/review/R39MM7EPNRREI6/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00002STLL&amp;linkCode=&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have followed the instructions and the game Ultimate Yahtzee works&nbsp;<strong>perfectly</strong>. So, I was wondering if you or anyone else knows of any tricks like this to get the game
<em>Clue: Murder at Boddy Mansion</em> up and running.</p>

<p>All right, how would I set this up using VMware? And if I did, would I be able to utilize my current graphics cards in order to run this game at its highest graphical settings?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And do you know how I could get the game running using the "Drop dlls into my sysWOW64 folder"? If so could you post instructions?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, I was in my basement and found an old copy of Windows 2000. If I were to install Windows 2000 and dual boot, would I be able to utilize my current sound and graphics cards? I would like to try to play this game at its highest graphical settings.</p>

<p>1. Doesn't go on forums.</p>

            I got this game running on Windows 7 x64, but unfortunately I can't remember the exact steps.
<div><br />
<div>I do remember that I had to turn off the hardware acceleration of the graphics card. Depending on what graphics card and drivers you have, if you right click on the desktop and choose "Screen Resolution" there is then an option for Advanced Settings. In
 there is a Troubleshoot tab and this has a slider for reducing hardware acceleration. I put mine to the lowest setting. Although you are turning down the settings, as this game is so old it still plays at its full resolution and quality. For me it ran in the
 centre of the screen with a large black border as I think its fixed to 640x480.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This might help you as you say you can hear the game start up but can't see anything, which could suggest graphics problems.</div>

            Wow. Thanks for the reply. I haven't tried anything with the game since I upgraded to Windows 8 (yeah, I know....now it's going to be even harder), but I'll try anyways. I'll let you know how it goes. And if you got any Windows 8 tips for getting this
 game to run, that'd be great too.&nbsp; Still same computer though (X64 bit&nbsp;with Intel i7 quad core).

            <p>Win7 32bit worked for me....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rename the video folder in the installation directory..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: the 32 bit version -&nbsp;C:\Program Files\Hasbro Interactive\Clue\Data\Classic\Video</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rename Video to VideoOLD&nbsp;for example. The videos won't play but the game runs fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Also I did Compatibility mode - Windows 95&nbsp;&nbsp;on Clue executable, seems to work well for the flickering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I installed DirectX5.exe and DXMWrap.exe&nbsp;in Compatibility mode -&nbsp;Windows XP SP3. Installed no errors</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good Luck.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that you use a third party Partition Manager. This would allow you to Move one of the other partitions next to the C: partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could then extend the C: partition to that partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following partition manager is free and can accomplish this easily.</p>

    <title>Unable to open any attachments from windows live mail email without - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to open any attachments from windows live mail  email without saving to desktop first</h2>
                    <p>As of Sunday 11-17-2013 my Windows Live Mail has stopped allowing me to open any attachments directly from my emails&nbsp;including pdf, docx,&nbsp; and excel spread sheets.&nbsp; All have been from trusted sources.&nbsp; I right clicked on the attachment icon and it will not
 Open or Print.&nbsp; No error messages, just won't open.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The only work around I can find is to right click on the attachment icon and choose "save all....".&nbsp; I can then save the attachment to my desktop and open it from there.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am confused since I did not change any settings in Windows Live Mail and I could open the same attachments last week.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How can I change the settings so I can go back to opening the attachments directly?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">FredHoeser</font>,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<font><font>
<p>We're sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>I understand the inconvenience this may have caused you regarding opening attachments on Windows Live Mail. As what
<font color="#0072c6">¡Firedog</font> already explained, the issue may have been caused by the file association and the default program that opens the certain types of file. In this case, this is the Microsoft Office for your .docx and excel files. For further
 assistance regarding that, we suggest that you refer to the link below:</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office">Microsoft Office Forum Support</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your concern about the PDF file,&nbsp;we are looking into the possibility that it could be&nbsp;your default PDF viewer that is contributing to the issue since you mentioned that you haven't changed anything on Windows Live Mail and attachments worked fine 2 weeks
 ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>Hope this helps. <span><font color="#000000"><font>Feel free to post if you have other concern.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Regards.</font></font></span></p>

<h2>            Star Wars Battlefront 2 on X-Box 360s</h2>
                    
<p>Realize this is has been brought up several times. &nbsp;I purchased Star Wars Battlefront 2 to play on Xbox 360 slim. &nbsp;I purchased a 20G internal HDD "for Xbox 360s Slim." &nbsp;However, it was not manufactured by Microsoft. &nbsp;I reinstalled the software updates per
 some guidance elsewhere. I have seen postings saying it has to be "an official Microsoft" HDD, and other that have said it has to be at least 60 HDD. &nbsp;Just looking for the latest guidance. &nbsp;At this point I am about ready to buy and Xbox console on ebay. &nbsp;Cheers.</p>

            <p>Yeah, it needs to be an official hard drive.</p>
<p>For the S, these are either 250GB or 320GB. With an official one of this capacity, you will be able to play Original Xbox games on your 360.</p>

<p>The problem is the hard drive you purchased as it is not an official nor is it designed for that model. You need an OFFICIAL Microsoft hard drive that is either 250 or 320 GB in size - the smaller sizes of official drives (20, 60 and 120 GB) are not compatible
 in this model and have a different enclosure as they were designed for the original 360 design (fat). Only the OFFICIAL Microsoft drives have the necessary software to run emulation for the Original Xbox games.

<p>My kid has installed more memory into his 360, and can't find any updates.......Any help you have would be soooo soooo helpful :) Thanks.</p>

<p>Cross - That would mean that either the game he is trying to play is not backwards compatible (not all original Xbox games will work with the 360) or he does not have an official MS brand hard drive.</p>

<p>"window hello has been blocked due to many sign in attempts. To unblock hello, sign in with your PIN"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And i couldnt enter my PIN !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know if is it a Virus, or something like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please if anybody knows how to restart the Windows hello ( so it could recognize me) or know another way, please let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finnally i want to give a tip to window , that in this cases is better for the users to block the PIN !! Not the window hello!!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Do check this issue by booting your computer into <span><strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart your PC. When you get to the sign-in screen, hold the <strong>Shift </strong>
key down while you select <strong><span>Power</span></strong>&nbsp;<strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%2fmain%2f5a774598-9041-49c1-ac51-955242b27bd4_50.png" /></strong> &gt;

</p>
</li><li>
<p>After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select 4 or F4 to start your PC in
<span>Safe Mode</span>. Or if you'll need to use the Internet, select 5 or F5 for
<span><strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong></span>. </p>
</li></ol>
<p>Once you're on to the <span><strong>Safe Mode with Networking, </strong>
check and see what sign-in options it will give you to access.</span></p>

            <p>Hello, thank you for the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) yes i try restarting my pc but nothing happens</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to enter Windows using a pin. But now, when i try to enter by using the pin, nothing happens, it dont work any more. (the notebook is new, i bought it a Few months ago).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4-5) the day before yesterday ( on tuesday) i bought the Microsoft office ( because it is not incluyed in window 10). The installation process took very long. i had to wait like 3,4 hours, and then, suddenly the installation process was interrupted. So i

<li><span>Reinstalls Windows 10 and removes all your personal files. </span></li><li><span>Removes apps and drivers you installed.</span></li><li><span>Removes changes you made to settings.</span></li><li><span>Removes any apps your PC manufacturer installed.

<h2>            RDP dual monitor window minimizes and won&#39;t restore</h2>
                    <div>I have customers that log into our application using RDP that use dual monitors. They are able to drag 1 window of the application to the second monitor and all is well. However, when they minimize the window on the primary monitor it will not restore.
 It shows on the task bar but will not open or restore. They then have to close that window and re-open it to work again.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Client machine is Win XP</div>
<div>Remote server is Windows Server 2008 R2</div>
<div>Application is Java and Silverlight. (The Silverlight window is the one that specifically has the problem.)</div>
<div>Remote Desktop Connection is version 6</div>

<div>Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Pro 4 - Jitter</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously I had wrote in to say that my surface pro 4 screen was jittering. My surface pro 4 was still under warranty as well.&nbsp;<br />
But when your personnel contacted me to get the exchange done, my surface stopped jittering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, my surface has started to jitter more often and very badly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think I'd like to go ahead with the exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please advise me on the following;</p>
<p>- Is my surface still under warranty? How do I go about to check for the serial number of my surface?</p>
<p>- Will I get a brand new free one-to-one exchange?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<h2>            How much RAM is recommended for Windows 10 if you have a pentium processor &#63;</h2>
                    I need to know the "recommended" for fast processing. Not the "minimum".&nbsp; I have a Pentium processor. My laptop is 5 years old and has 4 GB RAM. Ran fine in Windows 7, but really slow in Windows 10.

            <p>I disagree.&nbsp; I have a computer running Windows 10 with 4 GB, and it performs fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The proper answer isn't just quoting an amount of memory.&nbsp; Without knowing what is really slowing down the machine there is no way to even begin to solve the problem.&nbsp; The problem could be in another part of the machine like the drive or maybe the CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But most likely because the machine was doing fine in Windows 7, the problem is in a driver or some process that is eating up all the resources.&nbsp; In general Windows performance has been getting a bit better when changing from Windows 7 to 8.1 to 10.&nbsp; With
 maybe the exception of the "universal apps", because of the way they work they have more overhead. But of course they didn't even exist in Windows 7.&nbsp; On the other hand there are always people that run into driver problems which can really slow a machine down.&nbsp;
 There are also some cases where some Windows 10 processes have been eating up, memory, CPU, and disk.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the Modern UI apps, such as Internet Explorer have the same behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use keyboard shorts to handle these functions in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close the app: Alt+F4</p>
<p>Snap the app to the left side of the window: WinKey+Left Arrow.</p>
<p>Snap the app to the right side of the window: WinKey+Right Arrow.</p>
<p>Switch to the Start Screen: WinKey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is another update due to be released in early april that will return the Top/Right buttons.</p>
<p><br />
Regards</p>

<p>the visual desktop is comprised of&nbsp;folders and you can copy the shortcut back via the explorer.</p>
<p>simply right click on the start button and select open.</p>
<p>the explorer will open up to the users account.</p>
<p>if you look carefully, you will see a folder called desktop.</p>
<p>find the shortcut and copy it.</p>
<p>then look for the all programs folder, then drill down to the subfolder you want and paste the shortcut in it.</p>
<p>you can also use the method above to organize your desktop.</p>
<p>incidentally, don't fiddle with the folder for admin or all users.</p>

<h3> nathan2455  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX 360 SLIM Buzzing Noise.</h2>
                    
<p>Yeah, this is odd. My Xbox 360 Slim doesn't make a buzzing noise when i'm not playing a game but when I put a game in (even though it's installed), my xbox will make a buzzing noise for about a couple minutes then go off, but get this, I got the new Ghost
 Recon Future Soldier and when I put that game in, the buzzing noise even sounds worse! I did put another game in to see if it was just the xbox but it turns out, the really bad buzzing sound only comes from Ghost Recon and the other games just make a buzzing
 sound, not the really bad sounding one.</p>
<p>But what is this? Why does Ghost Recon make my xbox go crazy? I installed it so whats the problem?</p>

<p>All games in the Optical Drive Buzz [even when the games are installed] &amp; is to do with the composition of the discs + Disc copyright checks on the console &amp;/or Xbox Live etc..</p>
<p>GRFS discs, could be slightly thinner &amp; lighter than the older discs &amp; the Optical Drive, will always&nbsp;try to spin at the same speed to read discs.. Thus, making the lighter disc, spin a bit faster than a slightly heavier disc &amp; make more noise&nbsp;etc.. [Power-Weight
 Ratio of Drives motor etc..]</p>
<p>Nothing to worry about, if the games are being read &amp;/or working fine..</p>
<p>If the drive stops reading discs, then send the console in for warranty repair...</p>

<h2>            Task Scheduler task not running</h2>
                    <p>I created a task to display a message at 915 am every day, but nothing is happening.&nbsp; It worked fine in Vista, but is not working in Windows 7.&nbsp;

            <p>"Task command is simply to display a message." - sorry I meant, what is the entry in the Action tab. I'll try to run it as a comparison for you.</p>
<p>As far as I know, 0x1 is just a&nbsp;<em>did not&nbsp;run</em> code*.&nbsp; There should be a better explanation in the task history in TS [the right-hand tab of the task's 6 tabs].</p>
<p>Have you tried running it from a command prompt?&nbsp; That might reveal better info.</p>
<p>The problem might be in the security settings on the General tab, the Conditions tab settings or the Settings tab settings.</p>
<p>* <em>I have not seen an error for ages now but used to get 0x1 when I first started with the Win7 version of TS.&nbsp; I think most failures I had were from security settings errors.&nbsp; I had not understood about trying to run a task&nbsp;using the admin account when
 that account was not the one logged on at the time - only tasks that require no user interface can be run this way so a "message" task must be run using the account of the user who is currently logged in.</em></p>
<p>These links might also help but much of it goes over my head</p>

<h3> nick405  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can Windows 7 Home Premium be upgraded to Windows 8.1 Professional&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can an old computer tower Intel Core i7-2600s Processor 64-bit&nbsp; w 8GB DDR3 system memory and with windows 7 Home Pemium be upgraded to Windows 8.1 Professional?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it is better Windows 8.1 regular&nbsp;and not&nbsp;the Professional?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the upgrade is firt to Windows 8 Professionals, without losing some of the programs, etc, from old, then the further upgrade to Windows 8.1 will keep also the old programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I purchase Windows 8 Pro Professional, then the upgrade to W 8.1 can be downloaded for free or it has to be purchased separately?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have asked some other related questions in another separate post, if these can be answered also, I will appreciate it.</p>
<p>

<h3> kevincloch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows7 64x and Canon LBP7200Cdn&#58; Print Spooler Hangs</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
I have a new printer for 1 month and a Win7 64x machiene (=system1)<br />
Latest canon-driver, printer on LAN<br />
No problems for one month.<br />
Also have WinXPSP3 x32 system (=system2), no problems printing<br />
<br />
Now I have a new laptop, Win7 x64 (=system3)<br />
Same drivers as machine1<br />
On this new system, the spooler doesn't always send the printjob. The printtasks stays queued.<br />
Printer tool shows Printer online and ready.<br />
When I remove the printer and reinstall it, I can print... but after some time, the jobs stay queued.<br />
<br />
When the other systems want to print, the jobs are queued also.<br />
When I restart the print spooler service on system3, the jobs of system1 and 2 are processed.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it also helps when I reboot the printer.<br />
<br />
Can anyone advice?<br />
Bug Win7?<br />
Bug Canon printdriver?<br />
Why does it all work in System1 and not on System3, although the run same software?<br />
<br />
I disabled: bidirectional printing and I am trying it out now. Bidirectional printing is enabled on system1.
<br />
Printers are not shared.<br />
<br />
On system2 I can print when not connected on the LAN. When I connect to the LAN, the jobs are printed.
<br />
On system3 I can print when not connected on the LAN. When I connect to the LAN, the jobs stay queued.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
Kevin<br />

            Uninstall the drivers completely and re-install the same from system 3. <br />
<br />
Use Windows installer cleanup utility, if required: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
