<h2>            Error code 1053 on service accounts and Group Policy start-up error</h2>
                    <p>Running windows 8.1 and seeing Group Policy error on start-up; also get code 1053 on most service type programs I try to run such as task manager, regedit, etc. Also cannot run CMD in Administrator mode -- likely all related. Always get the ...failed to
 start in timely manner" popup after several long minutes. History in Windows Update showed all loaded - no visible errors.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the first response, but the first referenced article has me run services.msc.&nbsp; As pointed out earlier the system or service commands do NOT run -- the important ones&nbsp;ALL get the 1053 timeout type error. I am not sure how I can see the list
 of services without actually running <strong>services.msc.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The second article references .Net framework 1.1...we're 3-4 versions beyond 1.1. Not sure how this would apply except to explain why Windows wants to generate a timeout message. ??</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>More...</strong></p>
<p>I am running an online account, Admin privs s/b granted. In PC Settings, I cannot add an account (no error, no action occurs when I click the +) In addition, no action occurs when I click the EDIT button on my current account. I cannot edit or create new
 user accounts in this state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to change my password and after waiting 3 minutes I canceled it. Never got past the "...Please Wait"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help and ideas&nbsp;are appreciated.</p>

            <p>Mayank -- I had already tried that and I got the same error -- I am not able to "run as administrator". I tried again today just to verify and received the 1053 error, this time with&nbsp;cmd.exe&nbsp;- after about 5 minutes of wait time.&nbsp; I do not get the error running
 cmd.exe - I only get it&nbsp;running&nbsp;with "run as administrator" privileges.</p>

            <p>At this time I am no longer experiencing the issue. I was so desperate after not being able to resolve the issue with Microsoft Tech Support online that I decided to run the Restore/Repair Utility that comes with this HP machine. After a cold boot I hit
 F11 or F9 (tried both, not sure which worked) then got to the boot menu. I wanted to restore/repair the registry but after&nbsp;it started I canceled it when it seemed to get hung. Then I&nbsp;ran the backup utility (same utility screen from HP)&nbsp;before I&nbsp;making anymore
 changes...which took several hours; but, when I tried to save it to an external drive it had an error...said space was the issue, but that did not compute. Regardless...I abandoned that tactic since I knew although limited it still functioned as a PC and my
 kids needed it for schoolwork. The next day the error disappeared. Makes no sense, but it must have (this is my only guess) restored an earlier version of the registry even though I abandoned that process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The few things I've checked thus far are working well again such as -- I can actually run Task Manager, You Tube videos play in real-time instead of painfully slow, I can manage user accounts again...etc. Life is good once more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do appreciate the effort and time you put into this&nbsp;-- (not nearly as much frustration and time as I've vested) -- but much appreciated there are other fellow techies out there willing to help.</p>

<h3> brusterbear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Manual Install of KB3172605 Failed</h2>
                    <p>Have read multiple threads regarding windows 7 update issues... update hangs.&nbsp; Found the fix spoken of... kb3020369 and kb3172605.&nbsp; Checked my system and update 3020369 is installed, but not 3172605.&nbsp; I downloaded the proper file for 64x windows 7 home edition.&nbsp;
 I've followed all instructs regarding turning off windows update to "never", re-booted... then in "services" changed windows update to "manual" (was "automatic") and clicked "stop" to stop it from running.&nbsp; I then disconnected internet... tried to install...
 it initializes, proceeds to install and then hangs right at the end (like 95% pt), won't finish, then it pops up "update failed".&nbsp; It like times-out looking for a file or more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; I unplugged internet cable, I've tried blocking internet access via McAfee firewall, but it's always the same result.&nbsp; same thing occurs when I try to manually install any other kb file update... each one will fail to install.&nbsp; Pulling
 my hair out, what can be done?</p>

            <p>ok I reset windows update to automatic (delayed).&nbsp; Tried solution 1 exactly... on installation, it initializes, then rapidly goes thru installation but stops at like 95%... waits for like 15secs and then pops up "failed"... the update was not installed.&nbsp;
 Same result as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried the 2nd solution.&nbsp; Made sure windows update was stopped, went thru the cmd entries, went back to install... same thing, install stops at 95% then fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only issue in the cmd entries was with items 5 &amp; 6... response was "duplicate file name exists for softwaredistribution.old or file does not exist"&nbsp;.&nbsp; Same response for catroot2.old.&nbsp; Nothing happened for either of these 2 lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried these exact 2 solutions previously, to the letter.&nbsp; I still can't complete a manual installation... everything fails.</p>

<p>When you restart and run Windows update again, do the same updates show as failed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason you got failures on those cmd lines was because someone/somehow has performed the same operation before.&nbsp; If when you changed the 1s to 2s, the change was confirmed and you proceed through the rest of it, then you did complete the reset.</p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t buy Transformers War for Cybertron</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I'm trying to buy Transformers War for Cybertron. The xbox marketplace takes me all the way to 'confirm purchase' and then shows "<span>Je aankoop kan op dit moment niet worden voltooid. Probeer het opnieuw." (Btw, I hate dutch, just because my credit
 card is dutch, does not mean I want to read _anything_ in dutch...). If I try to buy it through the xbox console it tells me something like "This title is not available in your region". I've been living in Spain for the last 5 years, that also tends to confuse
 some systems (i.e., non-spanish credit card in spain..). What gives? Does anyone know why I can't purchase it? Thanks.</span></p>

<p>thats bwcause region locked content you need to be in the same region ss the account</p>

<p>use this tool to migrate to spain however you will lose access to previous region locked content you purchased</p>
<p>your best bet is to buy after you migrate</p>
<p>to use a new creditcard you need one from spain</p>
<p>for thw best experience on live you must use the same region as you are in</p>

</p><p>OEM or RETAIL product keys for Windows can be used to activate on the same physical system over and over, no limits (although you might have to call to activate if you do it too often.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you change the motherboard, it may not work.</p>

<h2>            Forward&#47;Back buttons on mouse got remapped on Windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using a J Tech Digital V628P mouse with my windows laptop for some time. Recently, without any action on my part, the functionality tied to the forward/back buttons changed. Now, the forward button launches the calculator (no matter which program
 is focused) and the back button launches a new window in my browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked for driver updates (all up-to-date) and uninstalled/reinstalled the mouse (no change). I'm aware that the functionality of these buttons is configured by the mouse's software, rather than windows, but I don't see how it could have been reset,
 nor where it is located (I don't see an appropriate associated program on my list of installed programs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

            Hi Westley
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Open the Mouse 
<br />Check if there any settings for the mouse that might have been installed that you can change there. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point before the problem started. 
<br />
<br />Information in the above link is sourced from a trusted Microsoft MVP blog.

<p>Unfortunately, these attempts did not change the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mouse settings on the Control Panel have no options for the additional mouse buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring the system to a previous state (5 days ago; fairly certain but not positive the mouse functioned properly at that time) changed nothing, and there were no other listed system restore points.</p>

            You might want to reach out to the hardware manufacturer of the mouse to find out if they are aware of any issues and if there any fixes or patches available that might enable support.

<pre><strong>Game or add-on you are having issues with:</strong> Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas<br /><br /><strong>Date you bought the content:</strong> April 9 2013<br /><br /><strong>Purchased with points or credit card:</strong> 1200 Points<br /><br /><strong>Specific issue you are having:</strong> It won't let me play because it says I need to attach an XBOX 360 hard drive. It's running on an XBOX 360 Hard Drive. The thing is, I downloaded this with points from XBOX Live, and no where in any way, shape, or form did it say that I needed something to play this game. I looked it up online, and everyone says that all you have to do is download and play it. It's not working for me, so how do I get it to work for me?<br /><br /><strong>Any error code or message you are receiving:</strong> "You need to attach an XBOX 360 hard Drive to play original Xbox games.

<pre><strong>Additional comments: </strong>Of course it says no refunds, so if I don't get this to work, I'm essentially out $15.00. Thanks Microsoft.</pre>

<p>I did see the description and the description says :</p>
<p>An Xbox 360 hard drive is required to use this item Local Multiplayer 2, 5.1 Surround Sound. GAME-PLAY ALERT: This game has been fully tested to successfully play on your Xbox 360 console. However, in some cases, you may see some minor irregularities with
 audio/video for brief periods. For more details, see www.xbox.com/xboxoriginals.</p>
<p>It does mention needing a Hard Drive in the description, however to me there's a built in Hard Drive. Silly me for thinking that a game console has a hard drive, and that I'm currently using it to play games. Who knew I needed an over priced extra hard drive
 to play something almost 2 decades old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that means that I just wasted $15.00 on a game that I can never play, because it requires a piece of hardware that costs almost $100.00 So to sum it all up, I'll need to pay over $100 in order to play a game from the 90's because Microsoft is greedy,
 and tricky. I guess my original sarcastic "Thanks Microsoft" stands.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help anyways.</p>

<p>I had the same problem. My mate bought it a few weeks who on his 250GB xbox so i downloaded it at my house using his profile then tried playing it but it said i need the hard drive drive to play originals so i just went onto ebay and bought a 250GB hard
 drive made by Microsoft for just £20. i have no problems now and i am now playing san andreas for the first time since 2009 when i was on ps2. ps2 version was better though</p>

<p>NewfieAssassin's advice is the correct answer.</p>
<p>The internal 4 GB is just a flash drive. You require an Official Xbox 360 HDD.</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Wired Controller Won&#39;t Install&#47;Update Drivers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Wired Controller Won&#39;t Install&#47;Update Drivers</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just plugged a wired xbox 360 controller into my table for the first time in while (Microsoft Surface Pro (1)) and the light flash briefly and go out, and then the controller isn't recognized in any game or other application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the controller in the device manager and it says: "This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to update the driver, and no matter what, I get this error: "Windows encountered a problem install the drivers for your device</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows found drivers for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the installers for this device cannot perform the installation at this time."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a bunch of googling, and haven't made any progress. One microsoft article said something about deleting a couple registry entries related to USB stuff, but it wouldn't let me do that, either. The error it gave me was similarly unhelpful and vague,
 but MORE googling said it was some sort of permissions or null value issue, I tried a couple of the related solutions to no avail, and gave up with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured later maybe if I reinstalled "Microsoft Xbox Accessories 1.2" that might help, so I uninstalled it, rebooted, and can't find how to re-install it now as all the drivers are for Windows 7/8, and the Windows 10 ones should "already be there".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty frustrated by the issue, and I'm really hoping someone can help me out here. I am genuinely completely at a loss for how to fix this simple issue that ironically involves hardware/software all from the same manufacturer (microsoft) that really
 shouldn't be having this kind of issue.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I've been through that article, and many like it. The process wants to be entirely automated, but there's obviously something wrong somewhere. The Surface is completely up to date.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>TEMP and TMP Work Areas Not Accessible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yumpin  say:</h3>
<h2>            TEMP and TMP Work Areas Not Accessible</h2>
                    <p>After recent Microsoft Updates were applied, I was not able to perform various routine functions such as opening Email attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally traced the issues to the 'Environment Variables' for the TEMP and TMP work areas somehow getting changed to not allow writing to these areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After resetting the Write permissions to the TEMP and TMP work areas, things work fine again.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is:&nbsp; how did these items get changed???&nbsp; I'm assuming it was part of the recent updates as things worked fine prior to their application.....</p>

    <title>SD card visibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ratsea  say:</h3>
<h2>            SD card visibility</h2>
                    <p>I can't see my MicroSD card of 32Gb in file explorer on Windows 10, yet the Disk Manager can see the disc, but without a drive letter.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't let you assign one either.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is either connected directly or through the phone interface.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sd card
 is formatted in FAT32 for the data plus a small EXT4 and Linux Swap partition an HTC android phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access it with an old PC running Vista, and 3rd Party partition managers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response and I have tried both the methods you suggested.</p>
<p>There wasn't a 'Card Reader Driver' listed.&nbsp; But the SD card was listed in the Disc Drives section, but was showing no issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would populate correctly, but didn't show a drive letter.</p>
<p>It also showed in the Disc Management (Computer Management).&nbsp;&nbsp; If I try to assign a drive letter, I get 'The system cannot find the file specified'</p>
<p>What is curious is that it did briefly appear once but didn't persist after a reboot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what I did though!</p>
<p>I can insert my 16GB SD cards from my camera, and they work perfectly.</p>
<p>Also if I put the SD card in the phone, and switch on the Disc Drive, it stall does not assign a drive letter and again it appears in the Device Manager as a Disc.&nbsp;&nbsp; It obviously works perfectly in the phone too.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

                    <p>I have Outlook, am running Win 8.1. Yesterday my email app stopped sending. Last Windows update was the day before. However, over the past week or so, emails (inbox, outbox, deleted and sent) have been routinely disappearing from the email&nbsp;program installed

 me to "reconnect to the internet and then sync to get the rest of this message".&nbsp;&nbsp;I am continuously connected with the internet. Wireless. This outlook program doesn't seem to be, tho'. I suspect I'm not receiving email, either. No new messages during this

 to do- send and receive emails. Is anyone out there listening? Why does&nbsp;Microsoft not step up and make themselves available to help repair this stuff? Why close themselves off from their customers and make the customer resort to a forum to fix the probs? This

            <p>Using the Mail App. Since the previous post I got in touch with HP Tech Support who told me Win 8.1 is doing this and to get rid of the update by "refreshing" my computer. That turned this computer back&nbsp;to day one, and to Win 8. Too bad. I liked the improvements
 to Start page and email&nbsp; running Win 8.1. Things are working better, tho. &nbsp;Altho' Email sometimes isn't downloading my mail from Outlook. com.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bad stuff associated with "refresh": I had to reinstall everything I'd installed on this computer since I bought it in July. A large waste of time and effort just because, I assume, Microsoft didn't beta test Win 8.1 thoroughly enuff or revise it before
 offering it. Hp tech said "...hundreds of thousands of people are in the same boat or worse". &nbsp;Is there anything else you could do to more completely destroy trust and satisfaction in your customer base?&nbsp;

<p>You are better off opening a new topic of your own instead of bumping an old not really relevant thread. Regions are not currency.
</p>
<p>I would also suggest reaching out to support for your region as most of the support here is related to US or UK based accounts and issues.</p>
<p>Here is some contact info:</p>
<p>Hours of operation:</p>
<p>08:00 - 21:00 clock Monday to Friday</p>
<p>08:00 - 19:00 clock (Saturday) / 09:00 - 17:00 clock (Sunday)</p>
<p>Phone Numbers</p>
<p>Toll Free: 0800 83 6667</p>
<p>Direct line: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +41 44 654 5357</p>
<p>If the correct currency for your region doesn't show you may not have your region set correctly.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 to 10 upgrade - error code 800700C1</h2>
                    <p>When trying to update Windows 8.1 to 10, I get error code 800700C1. I've tried running Windows Update troubleshooter, and it finds the following problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Potential Windows Update Database error detected 0x8007000D</p>
<p>- Windows Update components must be repaired</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both are marked as fixed, but if I run the Update Troubleshooter again, it finds the same problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, Windows Refresh throws an error when I try and run it, so I feel like there's quite &nbsp;bit of corruption going on in the system files. This is the error window:&nbsp;</p>

    <title>USB printer port not accessible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gmontoya  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB printer port not accessible</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a Canon Pixma MG2580S inkjet printer for home use with my Lenovo Ideapad 310-15IKB running Windows 10 Home 1809.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plugged the printer in and windows detected it as MG2500 Series, and also as MG2500 Series WS. Neither of these options was functional for printing. I removed the printers and used the Canon install disk. It ran fine, until it asked to plug in and activate
 the printer. I did so, and it detected the printer, but after sitting for ten minutes, announced that the printer was not actually connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per both Windows and Canon troubleshooting, I rolled back the installation and tried again. It repeated the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the USB port drivers and they are up to date. I checked Canon's online database and I also have the most up-to-date driver there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the first time I have had trouble running a USB-based printer from Windows 10. Last time I tried it, in December of 2017, I got a similar error from an HP printer, where the install software announced that Windows 10 cannot run USB printer protocols
 over a USB 3.0 port. I got the same error running it in both a USB 3.0 port and in a USB 2.0 port on the same computer, where it worked just fine on the office computer running Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the solutions available in this thread: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/windows-10-cant-find-printer/84cb9a70-be67-4666-81ef-b486c9e9b304</p>
<p>They did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I can't use the printer over Wifi protocol because Windows 10 also won't talk to anything in the LAN... any IPv4 address in the 192.168.nnn.nnn range is completely anathema to every installation of Windows 10 I have ever worked with, so I can't
 access the printer to set it up and make it visible to my home network. How do I make the printer and the computer make nice?</p>

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern, in order to get clarity on this issue and to assist you with appropriate troubleshooting steps, please provide us an answer for the following questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the exact model of your printer?
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What happens when you connect a different USB device to your PC?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, let us try few troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue and check if that helps. I would suggest you try connecting the printer to a different USB port and check if it works. If you are still facing the issue, try connecting the printer
 to a different computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are able to connect the printer to a different PC, I would suggest you to refer the article on

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to create a restore point and uninstall the USB root controllers. Refer the article on

<p>
</p><p>Inability to access apps after a clean install may happen if the installation is corrupted or damaged. The best way to resolve this is by repairing the installation itself. You may refer to Andre Da Costa's

<p>I've had this problem fixed before but now it seems to happen constantly. Before the most recent update to the game I never had this problem. It also seems to happen on only one world. Anybody else having this issue.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It's unfortunate that you are facing this issue. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A blue screen error (also called a stop error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly. When you experience this type of error, you won’t be able to see things like the Start menu or the taskbar on the screen when
 your PC is turned on. Instead you might see a blue screen with a message that your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to try the below methods and check:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, Display Port to VGA, or any other combination.

</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li></ol>
</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try to boot into <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> or <strong>
Enable low-resolution video</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Press and hold the&nbsp;<strong>shift key</strong>&nbsp;while clicking on&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>&nbsp;at the login Screen (Bottom right corner).</span></span></p>

            Hey Omega.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update (which you can check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)

<br />Expand the Display Adapters section

<br />What video device is reported in that section?

            Hi Omega Tunnel, well that graphics card supports resolutions way higher than 1920 x 1080, it is a good card.
<br />
<br />I think your graphics card driver is not loaded correctly and that is why that resolution is not showing
<br />
<br />Download and install the driver from the page below and hopefully you will be able to set that resolution . ..

<p>What brand and model monitor are you using ? 1600x900 is native to 19" wide screen monitors.
</p>
<p>If you are wanting to use AMD's <em>Virtual Super Resolution</em> to force a virtual 1920x1080 you need to do this in</p>

<h2>            Camera app does not recognize the camera</h2>
                    Original title:&nbsp;Has anyone succeeded in getting the media center to recognize the camera on a Dell touchscreen?
<div>This might sound a bit simplistic to some but I have not been able to get Win8 to recognize the camera on a Dell touch screen using the camera app. I almost feel like upgrading to Vista and everyone knows how well liked that was.</div>

            Hi Harold,
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
From the issue description, I understand that the Camera app does to recognize the camera.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Does other app or desktop app recognize the camera?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error message when you try to connect the camera from Camera app?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

            Absolutely no help. I would gladly contact you if you provided contact information for Windows 8 support somewhere that I do not have to spend 30 hours looking for it in some obscure location.

            Thanks for the response but nothing worked. I still get the "very informative" description that this app does not function in this version of windows (Windows 8 with media upgrade installed).&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>They should kill the app if it is not supported.</div>

<p>You can only remove accounts from the family, if you are wanting to change the gamer tag associated with an email address you will need to get another email address to associate it with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way to swap to email around as these are bound to the account (depending if they are outlook emails).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are wanting to remove a gamertag from an account you would need to pay for it to be changed.</p>

<p>This switching of login emails will only work if they are not Outlook, Live, or Hotmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See here how to switch email logins: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will first need to change the email of the first account that has the email you want to a 3rd email and then about 48 hours later (may take up to 48 hours to sync across all systems) you can switch that email to the account you want it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For moving Gamertags, you will have to purchase a change on the account that has it and then that gamertag is freed up for use on another account to either take it for free while creating a new account or after you purchase another change on the other account.</p>

    <title>Files missing after windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikidll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Files missing after windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi , </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 started taking matters on its own hands again and yesterday it performed an update without my permission. Apart from restarting and doing staff on its own this time it considered my files as disposable and deleted them!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After spending a few hours and trying all the solutions posted online (like checking if i am logged in with a temporary account) I contacted support. Support took over my laptop only do try things I had already tried and at the end their advice was to bring
 my pc to some local tech guy. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I guess it would be too much to ask for a stable system , that doesn't update whenever it wants regardless of what you are doing at that time and also doesn't delete your work, so i am just gonna ask this : Is there any actual solution to get my files back?
 and please don't tell me that i should backup because I am. </p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<br /> 
<br />If you have a backup, have you tried to restore back to before the update occured?
<br />
<br />What was everything you tried? Check the windows.old folder and recycling bin? 
<br />
<br />What files were deleted?

<p>Hi Zachary, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a backup from last week but I also do need the files I created in the meanwhile. That is my main problem. I had a lot of scanned docs and pics of docs that are now gone. They were pdfs, pictures and zips mostly

            Gotcha. How much did you create? Maybe you could create a backup of the files or move the files to an external USB &gt; Restore &gt; the move your files back to the PC.

            Your best bet is going to be to either 
<br />
<br />1. Happen upon them somewhere on your PC like the recycling bin or windows.old which is probably not the case here. 
<br />
<br />2. Use file history to restore files 
<br />
<br />Windows key + S &gt; file history &gt; Click restore your files with file history 
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 PC goes into hibernation even though the power plan says &#39;never&#39; sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hibernation is not an option on the power plan menu but that is what the computer is doing: all power off, no lights.&nbsp; When I power up again and log on it is where I left it.</p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<p>creating a new power plan,</p>
<p>using the troubleshooter,</p>
<p>running DISM (no problems)</p>
<p>Computer ran just fine with win7.</p>
<p>HP with 2 gb of memory.</p>

            <span><span>Hi William,</span></span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for giving us an opportunity to assist you with the query.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing in Windows 10, and we appreciate the steps that you have taken so far to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could have occurred due to incorrect power settings.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us try the following steps, and check it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to <strong>reset and restore all
</strong>of the default Power Plans back to their default settings. Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows Key + X.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;At the <strong>command prompt</strong>, type <strong>powercfg -restoredefaultschemes
</strong>and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;At the command prompt, type <strong>exit </strong>to exit the Command Prompt window.<br />
5.&nbsp;<strong>Restart </strong>the computer and check with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: </span><span>Let us try to place the computer in
<strong>Clean Boot</strong> state and check for the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A Clean Boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></span></p>
