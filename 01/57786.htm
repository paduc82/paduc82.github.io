<h2>            Unable to add family member on Xbox Live........</h2>
                    
<p>When I am logged into xbox.com, and I review my account, myself and my two children are listed.&nbsp; My Wife also has a live account, but she does not show up as a family member. On my wife's account page, she is the only one.&nbsp; To reiterate, this is ONLY on
 xbox.com.</p>
<p>My wife AND two children DO show up on my Microsoft account, which as far as the Windows 10 side of things go, are fine.&nbsp; All our computers and accounts have no issues.&nbsp; Both my wife&nbsp;and myself have received emails about my older child's computer usage.&nbsp;
 The whole family is on my account page.</p>
<p>We're all friends on LIVE and at this time are silver accounts.</p>
<p>Tuesday 9/8/15,I had a chat session with someone from the xbox support team.&nbsp; After some investigating I was told that it was just a sync issue and I just needed to give it time.&nbsp; No change yet.....</p>
<p>It's getting pretty late in the week, and I'm getting a little anxious. Since the whole family setup is intended for an easier transition between console/pc (gift cards/networking/gaming) I would like the assurance that we really are connected properly AND
 my wife has control as on the 360 as well, and eventually an xbox one.</p>
<p>Instructions for adding a family member are only posted for the Xbox One (I don't have.....yet).&nbsp; I am aware that the family gold pack isn't a thing anymore for the 360, but it looks like multiple adults should be on my account page.</p>
<p>How can I get her added to my XBOX family?</p>
<p>Please remember that everyone IS in my Microsoft family, we are all using the same 360, and all accounts on PC's are fine (1 kids pc, 1 adult pc, 1 HTC).&nbsp; All the accounts are on Hotmail with the exception of mine at live.com. The only issue is with my wife
 missing from my family on xbox.com.</p>
<p>Any information regarding why this is happening would be a great help - Thank You</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;As the Family Gold program has been discontinued on the 360 there is no need for adults to be part of a family so it seems as though that was eliminated.</p>
<p>Only children who are on a parent account will be shown on xbox.com. &nbsp;If you upgrade to an Xbox One console you'll be able to share out your Gold membership to all family members (including your wife who can be added on the One).</p>
<p>As for gaming on the console, any game purchased on a console can be used by any person (gamertag) on that console regardless as to whether or not they are in a family.</p>

            Hi Diane,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />Are you referring to lower the resolution?
<br />
<br />If so, make a right-click on your desktop and select Display Settings and there you will find the option.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hi DIane.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />To decrease the text and object size on the screen, update the Display driver, then set the maximum screen resolution which will refine and often make everything smaller.  
<br />
<br />To Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />If this is not what you need, then please explain more so I can help you better.

            Hi Diane 
<br />
<br />Can you please explain this in more detail . . .
<br />
<br />Does everything on your screen not fit in the screen, or is everything too big on your Screen?
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />Is Resolution set to the one marked (recommended) and what resolution is that currently set to?
<br />
<br />In the Scale section, is Scale set to 100%?

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. 
<br />
<br />The font on Windows 10 is called Segoe UI, and if you don't like it, you can use this Windows 10 guide, which will walk you through the steps to modify the registry to change the default system font on your computer. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Important: Before you go through this guide, it's worth noting that modifying the registry is risky, and it can cause irreversible damage to your installation if you don't do it correctly. It's recommended to make a full backup of your system before proceeding: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-make-full-backup-windows-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-make-full-ba...</a>
<br />
<br />Alternatively, you can create a system restore point: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-configure-system-restore-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-configure-sy...</a>
<br />
<br />Which will also help you to revert the changes you make using this guide. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Steps: 
<br />1.Open Control Panel. 
<br />2.Open the Fonts option. 
<br />3.See the font available on Windows 10 and note the exact name of the font you want to use (e.g., Arial, Courier New, Verdana, Tahoma, etc.). 
<br />4.Open Notepad. 
<br />5.Copy and paste the following registry code into the text file: 
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 
<br />
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts] 
<br />"Segoe UI (TrueType)"="" 
<br />"Segoe UI Bold (TrueType)"="" 
<br />"Segoe UI Bold Italic (TrueType)"="" 
<br />"Segoe UI Italic (TrueType)"="" 
<br />"Segoe UI Light (TrueType)"="" 
<br />"Segoe UI Semibold (TrueType)"="" 
<br />"Segoe UI Symbol (TrueType)"="" 
<br />
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontSubstitutes] 
<br />
<br />"Segoe UI"="ENTER-NEW-FONT-NAME" 
<br />
<br />6.In registry code above, make sure to replace ENTER-NEW-FONT-NAME with the name of the font you want to use like Courier New. 
<br />7.Click File. 
<br />8.Click Save As. 
<br />9.Under "Save as type," select All Files, and name your file anything you want with the .reg extension. 
<br />10.Click Save. 
<br />
<br />11.Double-click your new .reg file to merge into the registry. 
<br />12.Click Yes. 
<br />13.Click OK. 
<br />14.Restart your computer to complete the task. 
<br />
<br />Once your computer restarts, you should see the new font family throughout the elements, including on File Explorer, message box, taskbar, and apps that make use of the default system font. 
<br />
<br />If you want to revert the changes use the previously created system restore point or follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1.Open Notepad. 
<br />2.Copy and paste the following registry code into the text file: 
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 
<br />
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts] 
<br />"Segoe UI (TrueType)"="segoeui.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Black (TrueType)"="seguibl.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Black Italic (TrueType)"="seguibli.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Bold (TrueType)"="segoeuib.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Bold Italic (TrueType)"="segoeuiz.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Emoji (TrueType)"="seguiemj.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Historic (TrueType)"="seguihis.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Italic (TrueType)"="segoeuii.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Light (TrueType)"="segoeuil.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Light Italic (TrueType)"="seguili.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Semibold (TrueType)"="seguisb.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Semibold Italic (TrueType)"="seguisbi.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Semilight (TrueType)"="segoeuisl.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Semilight Italic (TrueType)"="seguisli.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe UI Symbol (TrueType)"="seguisym.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe MDL2 Assets (TrueType)"="segmdl2.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe Print (TrueType)"="segoepr.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe Print Bold (TrueType)"="segoeprb.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe Script (TrueType)"="segoesc.ttf" 
<br />"Segoe Script Bold (TrueType)"="segoescb.ttf" 
<br />
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontSubstitutes] 
<br />
<br />"Segoe UI"=- 
<br />
<br />3.Click File. 
<br />4.Click Save As. 
<br />5.Under "Save as type," select All Files, and name your file anything you want with the .reg extension. 
<br />6.Click Save. 
<br />7.Double-click your new .reg file to merge into the registry. 
<br />8.Click Yes. 
<br />9.Click OK. 
<br />10.Restart your computer to complete the task. 
<br />
<br />Remember not to choose a crazy font, such as Webdings or Wingdings, which are symbols and they can cause issues on your system.

    <title>Xbox One Sound Distortion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> general c34  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Sound Distortion</h2>
                    
<p>Ever since I got my Day One console I have noticed an odd audio distortion that occurs usually once every several hours of play, and only for about a minute each time. I thought it was the game at first, but it's happened on other games and after every console
 update it still happens. Here's some facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only ever happened in-game, but it follows to the dashboard or other games even after quitting the one it started in. Leads me to believe it's a console problem.
</li><li>All sound during the brief period this problem occurs is distorted and full of static and echoes. Voices sound like droids from Star Wars (serious).
</li><li>99% of the time the sound is perfect.&nbsp; </li><li>I have played with the Display and Sound settings on my console. I have now tried every sound setting it allows me (Stereo Uncompressed or Bitstream Out is all I can do). Problem continues.
</li></ul>
<p>I have made a post about this already but received only one response. He believed it could be my speakers or TV set up, but then I believe I would have this problem watching regular television, which does not happen. Can anyone help, please? Thanks.</p>

<p>And so it ends. The problem was with the HDMI cable that came with the console all along. For some odd reason, it works fine hooked up to the Xbox 360. I can't believe such a painful problem is all caused from a silly wire. Thanks to everyone who helped.
 I hope anyone who may have had this same problem can find this solution.</p>

            Hi KShelp,<br />
I would suggest a follow-up with MBAM to make sure nothing is lurking in there.&nbsp; You can download to your desktop
<strong>Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware</strong> from <a href="http://www.besttechie.net/mbam/mbam-setup.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><strong>Here</strong> </span></a>or <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/Malwarebytes_Anti-Malware_d5756.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><strong>Here</strong> </span></a><br />
<br />
Double Click mbam-setup.exe to install the application.
<ul>
<li>Make sure a checkmark is placed next to <strong>Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware</strong> and
<strong>Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware</strong> , then click Finish. </li><li>If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version. </li><li>Once the program has loaded, select "<strong>Perform Quick Scan</strong> ", then click
<strong>Scan</strong> . </li><li>The scan may take some time to finish,so please be patient. </li><li>When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. </li><li><span>Make sure that <strong>everything is checked</strong> ,
</span><a href="http://s270.photobucket.com/albums/jj116/Bugbatter2/?action=view&amp;current=mbam.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi270.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fjj116%2fBugbatter2%2fmbam.jpg" />
</a><br />
<span>Click <strong>Remove Selected</strong> .</span>
</li><li>When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart.(See Notes)
</li><li>The log is automatically saved by MBAM and can be viewed by clicking the Logs tab in MBAM.
</li></ul>
Extra Note:<br />
<span><strong>If MBAM encounters a file that is difficult to remove,you will be presented with 1 of 2 prompts,click OK to either and let MBAM proceed with the disinfection process; if asked to restart the computer, please do so immediately.</strong>
</span><br />
<br />
If you encounter this message:<br />
"c:\program files\malwarebytes' Anti-Malware\mbamext.dll<br />
Unable to register the dll/ocx: RegSvr32 failed with exit code 0x5"<br />
Click on ignore mbamext.dll <br />
<br />
From now on keep MBAM updated and use it to scan every so often for malware, or upgrade to the paid version for realtime scanning and auto updating.<br />
<br />
Here is my standard list of simple steps that you can take to reduce the chance of infection in the future. Above all, prevention would include watching where you surf to and how you surf.
<p><strong>The following suggestions are general prevention and are not customized for your computer. You may have already taken some of these steps, and depending on your current security, you may not need to implement all of these:</strong></p>
<p>1. Visit Microsoft Update: Make sure that you have all the Critical Updates recommended for your operating system, Office, and IE. The first defense against infection is a properly patched OS from Microsoft Update at update.microsoft.com. More info
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/updates/mu.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a> .</p>
<p>2. Please use a firewall and realtime anti-virus. Keep the anti-virus software and firewall software up to date.</p>
<p>3.You might consider installing Mozilla / Firefox .<br />
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/</a></p>
<p><strong>4. Do not use file sharing. </strong>Even the safest P2P file sharing programs that do not contain bundled spyware, still expose you to risks because of the very nature of the P2P file sharing process. By default, most P2P file sharing programs are
 configured to automatically launch at startup. They are also configured to allow other P2P users on the same network open access to a shared directory on your computer. The reason for this is simple. File sharing relies on its members giving and gaining unfettered
 access to computers across the P2P network. However, this practice can make you vulnerable to data and identity theft. Even if you change those risky default settings to a safer configuration, the act of downloading files from an anonymous source greatly increases
 your exposure to infection. That is because the files you are downloading may actually contain a disguised threat. Many very malicious worms and trojans, such as the Storm Worm, target and spread across P2P files sharing networks because of their known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>5. Before using or purchasing any Spyware/Malware protection/removal program, always check the following
<strong>Rogue/Suspect Spyware Lists</strong> . <a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm</a> <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/database.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/database.php</a></p>
<p>6. If you have not already done so, you might want to install <strong>CCleaner</strong> and run it in each user's profile:
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/ </a>** UNcheck the option to install the Yahoo toolbar that is checked by default for the Standard version, or download the toolbar-free versions (Slim or Basic) when given the option for those.</p>
<p>7.<a href="http://www.mywot.com/en/download/ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Web Of Trust </a>, uses colored alerts to warn about risky websites warns you about risky websites that try to scam visitors, deliver malware or send spam. Protect your computer against online threats by using
 WOT as your front-line layer of protection when browsing or searching in unfamiliar territory. WOT's color-coded icons show you ratings for 21 million websites, helping you avoid the dangerous sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Red</span> for Warning = STOP</strong> </li><li><strong><span>Yellow</span> for Use Caution</strong> </li><li><strong><span>Green</span> for Safe</strong> </li><li><strong><span>Grey</span> for Unknown</strong> </li></ul>
<p>There is a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Web Of Trust</a> version for
<span><strong>Firefox</strong> </span>as well.</p>
<p>8. You might consider installing SpywareBlaster: <a href="http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/spywareblaster.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/spywareblaster.html</a> <br />
It will:<br />
Prevent the installation of ActiveX-based spyware, adware, browser hijackers, dialers, and other potentially unwanted software.<br />
Block spyware/tracking cookies in Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.<br />
Restrict the actions of potentially unwanted sites in Internet Explorer.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrading Problem</h2>
                    So I applied for my free upgrade to Windows 10 a few weeks ago on my Toshiba Satellite S55 with Windows 8.1. I have the Get Windows App on the bottom of my screen that has not changed from the message about my upgrade arriving soon, but I noticed that
 when I go to my Control Panel, the Windows 10 Home Page is a failed upgrade multiple times. I've tried the things listed on the forms but nothing works. What should I do?

<h2>            4K Set top Box - Directv</h2>
                    <p>I have an Xbox&nbsp;One X; I also have DirecTV; My television is an LG webOS TV UH6350; my DirecTV receiver is Model&nbsp;C61K-700. When I run my DirecTV receiver model&nbsp;C61K-700 directly to the HDMI input on my&nbsp;television (LG webOS TV UH6350 ) I am able to get 4K support from DirecTV. However, when I Set up live TV with my Xbox One X by&nbsp;Connecting my&nbsp;set-top box HDMI output to the Xbox One HDMI input I no longer get 4k support. I receive an error stating my television does not support 4K and it automatically switches to 1080P. Does the XboxOne X Connection to my&nbsp;set-top box only support 1080P? Also, is anyone else experiencing&nbsp;this when they connect a 4K set box to the Xbox One X? &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Camera roll on windows does not act like a normal folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that the camera roll folder that is used to automatic photobackup on onedrive acts different to regular folders.</p>
<p>All files seems to need to be downloaded prior to use. Also it takes time for the folder to get populated every time i enter the folder.</p>
<p>Quite annoing is it though, that each time i want to copy files from the folder, files are copied only very slowly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How come?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Praseetha</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem persists on my laptop running windows 8.1. &nbsp;And it backups my onedrive just fine. this particular camera roll folder just behaves different to all other folders, be it local or onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is ecxactly like i write, it seems that the folder is not a "real" folder. It seems like it behaves in a state between online and offline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files are present in the folder, but if i have no internetconnection, the files cant be downloadet. The thumbnails for the pictures are also faded/grayed out when there is no internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that working with the files in the folder goes very slow, even with a good internetconnection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How in the world can i make the camera folder "real offline"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Think i found a solution. in the context menu theres an option to "make folder available offline." I hope i solves the problem, and will let you know if it doesnt.

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We apologize for the delay in responding. The screenshot that you have attached shows that the file is being downloaded. In OneDrive folder, you have the option of making files available Offline or Online only. When you
 make a file available Online-only, the file will not be downloaded and stored locally in your PC. Instead a small place holder file will be stored instead of that file. This place holder file will contain all the information about the file, and takes only
 a fraction of the total space of the file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When you double click on a place holder file, it downloads the file to your computer and then open it for you. If the Internet connection is slow, it might take some to download. In order make accessing files easier, you
 can make the frequently used files available offline. Right click on any folder that you frequently use and select make available Offline. This will download the files and store them locally in your PC, so that you can access them anytime.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for clarifying the behaviour of the camera roll. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Of course it makes sense, but since i take a lot of pictures, this behaviour is very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it in any kind of way or at any point be possible to change the foler settings, so it behaves just like a normal OneDrive-folder, so that it synchronizes seamlessly and automaticly ?</p>

<h2>            Front facing webcam not working with Skype on a Surface 3 using Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I cannot get my front facing webcam to work while 'in call' on Skype. It is set up correctly and viewing correct way in settings before I make a call. When call connects the front facing cam briefly works correctly then switches to rear facing and will not
 change back in my setting. Skype says something like camera not available it is in use by another app, but I have no other apps running that use the camera.</p>
<p>I'm using Skype on a Surface 3 running Windows 10. I've not used skype for about 9 months. It was working fine last time, yet when I used it this weekend I had the above problem so not sure if it's down to an update issue in Skype or Windows 10.</p>
<p>

<h3> cameronwinter  say:</h3>
<h2>            WLAN AutoConfic Service disables itself every 30 minutes, turning the wi-fi off</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys. I've got a tough one for ya.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent over four hours with various support agents trying to resolve this strange software issue; over an hour with Asus, Microsoft support technicians -- levels 1 and 2 -- and have tried innumerable troubleshooting commands and updates and new drivers
 and yadda yadda yadda. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As patient as they all were, nobody has helped so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roughly every 30 minutes -- almost on the dot -- the Command Prompt window appears briefly onscreen and flashes a few lines of information before closing, and my WLAN AutoConfig service disables itself. Without the AutoConfig service, wi-fi doesn't work,
 so every 30 minutes it forces me to go to the services window and manually restart it. Every 30 minutes, video calls drop out, online video-games cease to function, and no wi-fi networks are discoverable until I go to WLAN AutoConfig properties and start the
 service up again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all started after a windows update about a week and a half ago. However, despite numerous windows re installations and updates, the issue has persisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beginning to think that the only way the problem can be resolved is if someone knowledgeable is able to decipher the information that the Command Prompt spits out every time the AutoConfig disables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By videoing my computer for a minute or two, I was able to get a picture of the text that the Command Prompt flashes whenever the problem occurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what it says:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The WiredAutoConfig Service is not started.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3521.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>GDISK32 (W) Fixed disk 1 has partition(s) that extend past the end of the disk</strong></p>
<p><strong>GDISK32 (W) Fixed disk 1 does not have an active partition</strong></p>
<p><strong>GDSIK32 (E) No such fixed disk -- 2</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what this means. I have googled and googled to no avail. If you need more information, just say so and I'll give you what I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can manage to help me with this issue, I promise that every few months or so, for the rest of my life, I will look up into the night sky and reminisce on your kind assistance in these trying times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a bunch,</p>
<p>Cameron</p>

            It looks exactly correct, so I'm inclined to think it's a Hardware, Windows corruption or program conflict issue. When/if you reinstalled due to this, or rolled back Updates that you thought might be involved, did it ever work correctly again without the
 error? What I do in cases like this is Clean Install but then monitor for the problem after every group of Updates, every program install or settings change, to try to isolate the cause.
<br />
<br />
If you want to try this then use this gold standard install which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of
 money could buy: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
<br />
It could be a hardware issue with the wireless adapter. You could disable it in Device Manager to see if a USB wireless adapter works that would isolate it as the cause.
<br />
<br />
You can also check over your system: Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most
 thoroughly. <br />
<br />
Starting with the Wireless adapter, update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones
 presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.

<p>Ever since the 12/11/18 update, the problem has persisted in the exact same way nearly each and every time I have installed something or rebooted or attempted some other fix. The only exception is when I boot up in "Safe Mode with Networking"; both times
 I did this, no wi-fi networks were found, whether WLAN AutoConfig was running or not. I hope that might help to "isolate the cause"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Clean Install, I read over the installation instructions a few times, and I'm a little confused on what the actual chronological steps are for me specifically. I'm also a little confused on terminology... What is a BIOS boot menu? What is an ISO?
 What are partitions (is it even important for me to know what they are?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the flurry of questions, I just want to make sure I do this right. I have pretty limited knowledge on computer software. If it wouldn't take too long, a numbered list of what I should do to achieve a clean install would be monumentally helpful.
 Or whatever you prefer. Again, just tell me all the info you need to make this easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for being patient with me here</p>

<p>hey; so right now im at this point:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did an advanced restart and selected the UEFI option. I followed your instrucrions to create a bootable installation media on a flash stick, so i have that onhand; im just confused on how to proceed from right here, despite reading
 your article and googling walkthroughs. Please give me some pointers?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Apparently mobile doesnt let you include images; Im at a screen that says aptio setup utility on top and looks way different / more archaic than windows 10. It has five tabs near the top labeled Main, Advanced, Boot,

            That's the UEFI setup, not the Boot Menu.  Exit and choose the Boot Menu key for your PC or motherboard from the link.  <br /><br />You should be following the tutorial which explains all of this here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  If you completed all other steps then continue in the section for Installing the ISO. Do not skip any steps.  <br /><br />If you are not going to follow the written tutorial then I would not proceed because there are too many things that can go wrong and it will not be as good an install as those who follow the steps and never come back with another problem.

<h2>            After Creator&#39;s Update, Windows keeps spinning hard drives for giggles</h2>
                    <p>Since I want my PC to be as quiet as possible, I've set the mechanical drive to shut off after a couple of minutes. Since the OS and most programs are on an SSD, the mechanical drive is rarely used and thus stays quiet.</p>
<p>

            <p>(I found this interesting, so I figured I'd just post this in here...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was recently re-configuring what programs startup on my machine using Task Manager, and felt my desk start vibrating again (read my previous post). I went to the "Performance" tab and saw this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da152ac4-b84b-49b2-9be6-592c1e47232d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da152ac4-b84b-49b2-9be6-592c1e47232d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can see, it appears as if Windows is looking for something across ALL 3 drives (the C: drive is an SSD and thus it's usage is much lower), but I can see a pattern here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as the C: usage drops, the O: usage rises to 100%, then as that drops, the E: usage jumps to 100% for about 20secs, then falls back down to 0%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already ruled out the possibility that the 'usage spikes' were a direct cause of me opening the Task Manager, as I had already had it open for more than 3 Minutes. This only started happening after updating to the most recent version of Windows 10 (Creators
 Update).</p>

                    I have just used Windows Easy Transfer to migrate files and accounts from my old XP machine to my new Windows 7 Home Premium.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have four user accounts on the XP machine, all of which work fine, and importantly all of which appear on the Welcome Screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I ran through the Easy Transfer process, making only one deviation from the defaults: I clicked "Advanced Options" in the bottom right and selected "Create User" for 3 of the accounts, using the same name as on the old PC. (One of the accounts was the
 one I was using)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There were no errors or warnings during the process and it all seems to work fine, with all 4 accounts having folders user C:/Users.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, the welcome screen shows only 3 of the accounts (the one I was using plus 2 of the 3 I used the "Create User" for. If I go into control panel/User Accounts then only the 3 accounts are shown (along with guest) and if I try to recreate the missing
 account (Steve) I am given an error box saying "The specified account name is not valid, because account names cannot contain the following characters: /\[]":;|&lt;&gt;+=,?*". The word Steve doesn't have any of these characters so I can only assume somehow this
 account has been corrupted.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note I have also checked the registry for the "SpecialUsers" key but that is not the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<p>I attended the&nbsp;Xbox E3 event and I attended Xbox One S conference at E3 and Microsoft gave me specific steps to get an Xbox One S for free. I got home from the event and I was able to access my Xbox so therefore I couldn't put the secret codes in or change
 my avatar for the code. I don't know if it was changed from the update or what. I&nbsp; really &nbsp;want&nbsp;that Xbox one S.I am a loyal Xbox costumer and I would like it if I could get it.</p>

            Hi AT. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
Was it working previously? What was changed that caused this? Do you have a System Restore point to go back to that point?
<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a> <br />
<br />
If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a> <br />
<br />
Compare how the Display language was added (if so) with this guide: <br />

<br />
<br />
Since the laptop is new you could also consider resetting it to Factory Condition, returning it under store return policy, or using the one-year included Lenovo Support, Repair and replacement warranty - which is always a good idea to get all problems shaken
 out in the first year, including if necessary a replacement that then has time to get problems shaken out.
<br />
<br />
To do the Lenovo Factory reset see here: <a href="https://www.cocosenor.com/articles/computer/hard-reset-lenovo-laptop-to-factory-settings-without-password.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />During the warranty, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer for the full functioning of the device. It looks to me a case of adapter error or Battery fault, so consider contacting Lenovo.

    <title>Parental controls in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wl1234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Parental controls in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just upgraded to Windows 10 and I would like to setup parental controls for my 7-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option I found for setting up parental controls would require having both me and my daughter log in using MS Accounts, which would require creating a MS Account and an email address for my daughter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely do not want my daughter to have an email account at this point, as she is not ready for one, and I don't see any reason why she would need her own MS account either. She's certainly not ready to access the Windows Store. Currently, she has a
 local user account on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maintaining an email address and a MS account for a child who is too young to use either doesn't make any sense, and goes against the security principle of least privilege. I simply want to place limits on her use of her user account, such as whitelisting
 applications/sites and placing time limits. How can I do this without giving her email and MS account access?</p>

            My PC is delicately controlled, time limit, internet access, application.. Windows 10 made it so complicated, I will reverse to windows 8.1. Why can't Microsoft let loose? You don't need to start control kids under MS umbrella. That is not the way to win
 customer...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I agree... this parental control was really nice and easy to use Under Windows 8... It would have been nice to at least be warned before the upgrade that this will change...

<p>Hi, I just upgraded to Windows 10 and I would like to setup parental controls for my 7-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option I found for setting up parental controls would require having both me and my daughter log in using MS Accounts, which would require creating a MS Account and an email address for my daughter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely do not want my daughter to have an email account at this point, as she is not ready for one, and I don't see any reason why she would need her own MS account either. She's certainly not ready to access the Windows Store. Currently, she has a
 local user account on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maintaining an email address and a MS account for a child who is too young to use either doesn't make any sense, and goes against the security principle of least privilege. I simply want to place limits on her use of her user account, such as whitelisting
 applications/sites and placing time limits. How can I do this without giving her email and MS account access?</p>
</blockquote>
I feel the same way about creating an email address for my 5 year old, so I just used one of my email address instead since she don't have access to it. But I am running into an issue where I can login to her account on my laptop that ran windows 7.1 home but
 can't login to profile on my desktop that had windows 8.1 pro, it gives me the welcome but then says signing out and goes back to the lock screen. The same happens to the profile that's not under family that has no email address.&nbsp;

            Me 3 - I had my parental controls, including time limits and curfews,&nbsp;all set for my 16 year old son and now, after the upgrade, they don't seem to applied to his account any more. It looks like I can set him up as a family member but then he loses everything
 from his current account on the computer. Very frustrating.

            <p>We are also having the same issue. We no longer have control over usage times at all. He can log on way past the cut off and stay on all day. What my husband and I think is most interesting is having to attach a credit card to the account in order to activate
 and verify our account. No one complained about that here... did anyone else mind doing this or were none of you asked and charged the money?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will probably ride out the storm because we like the 10 interface so much more than 8.1. I just hope they fix it soon. :o/</p>

            <p>I did not go through with registering my kids info with ms. &nbsp;They just aren't allowed on the pc for now. &nbsp;Even if I did create one or more accounts, teaching them a password that is secure enough for the Internet is ridiculous. &nbsp;With local accounts they
 could just click the little icons they picked and get in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i don't remember being required to enter a credit card, but it's been a while since i joined my hotmail to my win8.</p>

            They call it "family safety" now, should be readily googlable.

            <p>"Family Safety" in Windows 10 is serious step backwards compared to previous versions:</p>
<p>1. it requires to give MS your kids PII, which is not safe by default</p>
<p>2. functionality - time limits are dumbed down compared to previous version - no way to set activity hours with pauses, only total daily time</p>
<p>3. The whole feature does not work without "Microsoft accounts" - serious step back in security. In previous versions all parental control features worked with local accounts.</p>

<h2>            Realtek continually self muting</h2>
                    <p>I have contacted MS three times (SRX13473304466ID), I have uninstalled and updated drivers, rolled drivers back, re-set computer, checked for mal-ware, updated with Windows 10&nbsp;media,&nbsp;yet the microphone keeps muting itself.&nbsp; It's almost like a magnet. I un-mute
 it and it pops right back as fast as I move the mouse.&nbsp; What's more, when I do fix it for however short a time it may last I cannot change any default settings as these are all greyed out.&nbsp; My laptop is about 14 months old and I am computer literate.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have
 troubleshooted the issue multiple times, made sure that no other program can take control of sound (i.e. Skype)...</p>
<p>This all just recently occurred and all after one of those automatic updates which is why I re-set the computer and that only helped for as long as it took&nbsp;to turn the computer back on. &nbsp;</p>

            I believe the issue has been resolved and it was a bug. Malwarebytes has worked for the time being.
