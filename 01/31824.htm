    <title>Will Deleting an Account in Windows 10 Mail affect Account in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karen.dowell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will Deleting an Account in Windows 10 Mail affect Account in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 with Outlook on a DELL laptop. &nbsp;Yesterday, I was trying to send an email via a website form, and I was prompted to set up Windows 10 Mail. &nbsp;Without thinking, I went ahead and set up the same account I already have on Outlook. &nbsp;So now
 I get two prompts for each email and have two email repositories on my computer, when I really only need Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to remove the account from Mail, but got prompted with a message that deleting the account would completely remove it from my "device." &nbsp; Does that mean that it will also remove it from Outlook? &nbsp;My device is my computer. &nbsp;I don't want to do anything
 that will mess up my Outlook settings or remove my mail account from that program. &nbsp;I just want to remove it from Mail so I no longer get notifications from the Mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Karen</p>

<p>Hello Karen,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing an account from the Windows 10 Mail app will <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not </span>remove the account from Office Outlook, however it will remove the accounts from the system for other apps such as&nbsp; People and Calendar or any other apps that use the email account.&nbsp; If you remove the account and find that you are using another app
 that used it, you can easily add it back to the Mail app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to removing the account, you could leave the account and disable notifications for the Mail app. This can be done from Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Notifications &amp; actions, and then turn off notifications for Mail (listed under the heading
 "Get notifications from these senders". </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do decide to remove the email account from the Mail app, and don't want to receive the notification to setup Mail, you can set Outlook as your default Mail app from Start -&gt; Settings -&gt;&nbsp; Apps -&gt; Default apps, and then clicking on the icon under the
 heading "Email" and then selecting Outlook.</p>

<h2>            My computer won&#39;t install software&#33;</h2>
                    when I attempt to install new software. the installer starts and says that it's installing the program but then just sits there until the message box appears saying that the installer is no longer responding. I assume that something is interfering with
 the process, How do I find out what?

<p>Here's a link to Adobe's Technical support with a phone number to call to get assistance installing Adobe products:
<a href="http://forums.adobe.com/community/general/downloads/purchases.'" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.adobe.com/community/general/downloads/purchases.'</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps they can help you since it is their product and they know much more about it than we do.&nbsp; They may tell you
 it can't be installed on a 64-bit Vista system (make sure you mention that's the situation upfront).&nbsp; They may also provide you with a trick that will get it to install that only they would know.&nbsp; It's certainly worth a try.</p>
<p>Adobe also has a dowload and istallation forum for posting questions about such issues but from reading it, it doesn't seem to be frequentled very much and you're not likely to get an answer anywhere near as quick as you do at forums such as this one - but
 here it is if you want to try (though I wouldn't bother): <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/community/general/downloads/purchases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forums.adobe.com/community/general/downloads/purchases</a>.&nbsp; It also includes the istallation trouble phone number and instructions on how to get through it and speak to a human who might be able to help you.</p>
<p>I checked the Vista Compativiity Center to see if the software was compatible with Vista but I could not find the product listed.&nbsp; That usually means it wasn't tested.&nbsp; in many cases, that also means it isn't compatible since it was so old that they didn't
 even bother to try to test it - but perhaps I missed it or it goes by a different name.&nbsp; Here's the site to check for yourself:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Adobe%20Photoshop%202.0%20deluxe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Adobe%20Photoshop%202.0%20deluxe</a>.&nbsp; When I went to the Adove site, I searched for Photoshop 2.0 deluxe and found absolutely nothing about it.&nbsp; Is it that old?&nbsp; Another
 issue is that you are running a 64-bit system and they have MANY more problems with software and hardware compativility than 32-bit systems.&nbsp; I suspect that the program cannot be installed on your system because of these issues.</p>
<p>You can try a clean boot <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;and see if you are able to install the product in that mode.&nbsp; If you have the same problems, return the system to normal status according
 to the procedures and reboot - this will not resolve the problem (and this removes most programs and services from running and interfering with the installation so that pretty much rules out that possibility).</p>
<p>Try turning off your AV software and then right click on the installation icon and click rund as Administrator and see if that helps.&nbsp; Remember to re-enable the AV software when you are done.</p>
<p>Try booting into safe mode (repeatedly hitting the F8 key during bootup until the menu appears) and try installing from safe mode (if it will let you - it may not permit the installation but it's worth a try) and see if that works.</p>
<p>I hope one of these options helps (assuming it is possible to install the product with your version of Vista).</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Eventually, I&nbsp; was able to reach a Skype chat agent but I must say, your suggestion of choosing "Billing" was puzzling.&nbsp; Actually, ALL of the choices that present themselves when clicking on your link are puzzling:</p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p>None of them seem to refer to a legal matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up selecting any old category and sub-category, out of frustration.</p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For starters, have you tried checking on the Device Manager and see if you can find the driver there or not? Either way, you can check from there the generic sound driver and update it, so Windows would automatically look for the drivers that best works
 for your sound system. That way, it will download the driver that you lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can go directly to your sound system manufacturer's website and download the driver from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player mis-tagging lots of album info. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tdisalvo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player mis-tagging lots of album info.  </h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have just upgraded from Windows vista 32 bit to windows 7 pro 64 bit.&nbsp; While I do like some of the features I have to say that the upgrade was more difficult that I had hoped.&nbsp; I am using my computer, a Dell XPS420 as a media Center in my living room.&nbsp; I
 have a network drive mapped that holds all of my ripped CD's and downloaded music.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
In Windows Media Player 11 all of the TAGS we working.&nbsp; When I went to 12 I had a ton of issues.&nbsp; 1st off.&nbsp; There is no support for FLAC.&nbsp; So I had to download Shark 007 Codecs.&nbsp; I also had to use a program by the same company to tell windows media player to
 open up in 32 bit mode since no-one seems to have the 64 bit codec written yet.&nbsp; I also had to install the M4a/Flac/Ogg/APE/Mpc tag support plugin fo media player v1.1 from softpointer in in order to get media player to even see any meta-data for my flac files.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This was a minor inconvenience that I got past.&nbsp; The bigger issue is now that it has indexed my music there is over 800 songs coming up an unknown.&nbsp; Also you seem to have striped out the advanced tag editor which would allow me to edit the tags.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I am amazed that a company as large as MS with as huge of a black eye as windows vista was, pushed out this updated without support for major formats.&nbsp; I would like to know if there are plans for native support for these file types, and if there is anything
 I can do to fix my stuff.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><span><span>Hey tdisalvo,<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let me answer to your questions one by one.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Currently Windows Media Player and Media Center don’t include native file support for file types like FLAC, OGG etc.
<span>&nbsp;</span>To see the file types supported by Windows Media Player, see:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Information about the Multimedia file types that Windows Media Player supports</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316992</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>For the indexing issue, check
 if the file type is of <span>ID3v2.4 </span></span><span>standard. If so, you may want to consider changing it to
</span><span>v2.3 since WMP12 is not compliant to ID3v2.4 standard.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Also,
</span><span>Advanced Tag Editor isn’t included in Media Player 12.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>You can edit the tags in the Library view in the player. For adding art, simply drag and drop the art on the track. For further information,
 see:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Add or change album art in
<span>Windows</span> Media Player</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Add-or-change-album-art-in-Windows-Media-Player#section_2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Add-or-change-album-art-in-Windows-Media-Player#section_2</a><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also refer the thread below and see if this helps.<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7music/thread/ef054d9a-fcde-4645-8218-867e9e958fe7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7music/thread/ef054d9a-fcde-4645-8218-867e9e958fe7</a><br />
<br />
And as for Microsoft’s plan to provide native support for file type as Flac, I don’t think there’s any announcement made about it.&nbsp;If and when there’s any plan, we’ll definitely keep it updated.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope this answers all your queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Wallpaper images stay on &#34;stretch&#34; setting in Windows 7.</h2>
                    I have tried to set my wallpaper images to "fit" or "center", but the image keeps going back to "stretch". I have gone through all required steps to save the new settings. but nothing seems to work. I have even tried different images with varying resolutions,
 but everything I have tried does not seem to work, my image keeps going back to "stretch".

            Hi all,<br />
<br />
Hewlett Packard came out with a fix. Judging from the response to previous posts,&nbsp;it also works with non-HP machines.<br />

            Did you install the software as local Administrator? From your description of the issue it would seem that the Mystery Program wants to access something to which the domain user has no permissions. Contact the Mystery Program's tech support.

    <title>Deleting administrator account in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louk_northgower  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting administrator account in windows  10</h2>
                    <p>Good day: I hope somebody can help me - I upgraded to Windows 10 and found that my USB 3.0 ports no longer work all the time. I tried to repair them but had no success. Importantly, at one point it was suggested that a MS troubleshooting tool might work
 if I ran it as an administrator, so I created an administrator account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This did not work, and I want to roll back to Windows 7 to see if 10 is the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, when I try to do so, Windows tells me that I have to remove the account I have created: "you have created one account (Administrator)." I tried do delete the account from the Administrator account - it won't allow me to do so. I used the Administrator
 account to change my personal account to an administrator account, logged out of the Administrator account and used my personal account to try to delete the Administrator account - there is no "other users" when you click settings &gt; accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance</p>

            I appreciate the recommendation; however, all other messages work fine. Also, I've tried from other computers with the same result which indicates something different about the messages with red dashed circles.

            I understand. Unfortunately the fix above is the only one I am aware of. It is possible that this is anew bug and you may want to report this to Microsoft by Pressing Windows key+ F on your keyboard

<h2>            Feature request&#58;  Day of the week notification on taskbar</h2>
                    <p><u><em>Original Title</em></u><strong>: Someone contact microsoft for a new product feature for me?</strong>
</p>
<p>Someone tell Microsoft to add the day of the week on the notification area of the taskbar for windows 7 with an update. When you right click the date/time function and go to the adjust date/time they need to add a format of the day of the week. It shows
 day of the week when clicking on the date/time and on the adjust date/time page. I want it without having to click or double click in the notification area. A THREE letter abbreviation of the day of the week would keep cluster down.&nbsp; SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW
 TO CONTACT MICROSOFT PLEASE SUBMIT THIS FOR ME.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you drags the taskbar up (expands it upwards using the double arrow icon which appears on putting the mouse at thetop of the taskbar) the date time notification
 are will expand and day will also appear in the place. For more information have a look at the link:</p>

            I want the format DDD to stay two lines with the day of the week on line 2 with the mm/dd/yyyy after it. DDD equals first three letters of the day of the week. I don't want the taskbar to expand upwards for the day of the week. I want to go to the left
 edge of the time &amp; date box on the task bar and expand it to show the day of the week with the other two items. Looks and style matter.<br />

            <p>My Taskbar space is fully utilised as I suspect as the case for many other users. I do not need a constant reminder of what day it is when by moving the cursor to the bottom right of the screen if I need to check.
</p>
<p>You should make your representations with regard to Windows 8 as it is unlikely that any feature&nbsp;is&nbsp;likely to be changed in Windows 7. Development of Windows 7 has almost certainly been completed&nbsp;.</p>

    <title>USB printer works but does not appear under &#39;Devices and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macbaba  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB printer works but does not appear under &#39;Devices and Printers&#39;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Brother 1440 printer connected to my computer via USB. In the past, I had to delete this printer from my system using Control Panel &gt; Admin Tools &gt; Print Management since Windows 7 installed multiple copies of this printer; under Printers I'd have
 Brother 1440, Brother 1440 Copy 1, Brother 1440 Copy 2, etc. This happens with USB printers in Windows 7 if you unplug the printer and plug it back into a different USB port, very annoying.</p>
<p>After deleting all the copies in Print Management, I reinstalled the printer. It works, however I don't see the printer under 'Devices and Printers'. I do see it under 'Print Management' though and I can select the printer in the drop down list of printers
 when I print in an application. One big problem is I'd like to set that printer as the default, however you can't set the default printer in 'Printer Management', you can only do so in 'Devices and Printers.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some notes:</p>
<p>-I've already tried removing the printer and the driver too, rebooting, then plugging in the printer. Windows 7 detects it and loads the drivers, it works however it still doesn't show up in 'Devices and Printers'.</p>
<p>-I don't have a parallel port in this PC, I read previous replies about parallel ports and SPP, but this does not apply to my system.</p>
<p>-Under printer properties, I've given permissions to everyone to Print, Manage this printer, and Manage documents, that still did not fix this issue.</p>

<p>Hi macbaba,</p>
<p>You might try disabling your anti-virus software temporarily to see if the issue resolves.</p>
<p>They have been known to prevent printers from showing up in the Devices and Printers window.</p>

<p>Hi macbaba,</p>
<p>You can perform a clean boot to see if a startup program may be prevent the emulation of the printer in Devices and Printers:</p>

<p>I had the same problem.&nbsp; I installed an Epson inkjet, then my Brother laser.&nbsp; After reboot, the Brother was still listed but the Epson printer disappeared from Devices and Printers, yet I can see and print to both from Word, etc.</p>
<p>By accident, I found the Epson entry.&nbsp; I also have a Dymo Labelwriter 400 on the same USB hub as the Epson.&nbsp; I right-clicked on the Dymo labeler and lo, there was the Epson also.&nbsp; For some reason, Windows 7&nbsp;considers the Epson and Dymo as SHARING the USB
 port and lists them both UNDER A SINGLE ICON!!!&nbsp; If you select the other device, the icon will change.</p>
<p>Can Microsoft fix this so that shared USB devices have their own icons???</p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestion! You got me on the right track although my case is different than yours. There are 3 devices I see in Printers: Fax, Microsoft XPS Document Writer, and PDF995. None of them are the Brother 1440 Printer. However, above the Printer
 and Faxes list is the Devices list. In this list at the very top is a device with the same name as the name given to my computer.&nbsp; Here's what it says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Name: COMPUTERNAME</p>
<p>Category: Desktop computer</p>
<p>Classification: Devices</p>
<p>Device Category: Computers</p>
<p>Manufacturer: &lt;BLANK&gt;</p>
<p>Model: &lt;BLANK&gt;</p>
<p>Status: 0 document(s) in queue</p>
<p>Now if left double click on it, the Brother HL-1440 printer document queue window shows up! I can also right click on it to set it as the Default Printer. Nothing changed with the icon though. I'm not sure how the printer got misclassified in the Devices
 and Printers list, once again the Brother 1440 shows up fine in Print Management. So it looks like in my case, my printer is sharing the icon with system's icon in the device list. So, how do we fix that?</p>

<p>I am having the same exact issue as Macbaba with a printer using LPT1. My HP 2035 printer "shares" the same icon as my "computerName".</p>

<p>How do we get them separated?</p>

    <title>Problem&#58; When I turn on the computer, windows installer box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brown789  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem&#58; When I turn on the computer, windows installer box appears and is trying to install a file</h2>
                    After getting the message "preparing to install", another message comes up saying "please wait while windows configures roxio media manager"<br />
<br />
Then another message comes up saying "gathering required information"<br />
"The feature that you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable."<br />
<br />
"Click OK to try again or enter an alternate path to a folder containing the installation package "Roxio Media Manager. msi"&nbsp; The box points to the following path C:\Documents and Settings\Jeffrey Brown\Application Data\Research In Motion|BlackBerry\Updates\6852A378-7780-4e80-B65-343C8D2C36AE\SR_MM\<br />
<br />
I have the Blackberry desktop manager installed on my computer and I also had a message saying there were some updates, but I have never been able to download the updates, if there are any.<br />
<br />
How do I get rid of this process that comes up whenever I turn on the computer?

<p>We had the same issues and same messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you would cancel the install it would come back again and again and slowed the system a lot.&nbsp; I cancelled the Roxio install (although it kept coming back and back, it finally stayed on trying to cancel)
 and then used Windows Installer Cleaner.&nbsp;I found&nbsp;when I tried to&nbsp;install the Cleaner it was already installed on the PC.&nbsp; I ran it and it worked with no runtime error.&nbsp; I shut down and restarted and don't get Roxio stuff wanting to install.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> dejan markovi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to use microsoft account without logging in at start up&#63;</h2>
                    I had trouble with windows update, after computer restarted, all network connections failed (i have wireless and LAN connection and they both work ok ), and i couldn't log in on my pc. I was using microsoft account then. So i had to use third-party software
 to reset password. After i managed to log in, i immediately switched to local account, but network was still down. I restarted pc again and now all works fine.&nbsp;
<div>Now about the question. I would like to use microsoft account as main account, as i did up to now, but i would like NOT to type the password at start up. Is this possible? (Main reason for this is buggy windows update, and i don't want to have problems
 to log in again!)</div>
<div>Thank you in advance!</div>

<h2>            Chrome not working after installing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10 today, Google chrome would not work. It would display the error code err_ssl_protocol_error. I then tried to use Edge to search for answers where the homepage displayed information but when I searched, it would appear as if it
 had no internet connection. Internet Explorer is the only search engine on computer that works and I don't like the layout of and don't want to use it. I tried to uninstall and reinstall chrome but when I tried to reinstall, Internet Explorer did not recognise
 the download page as a website. In fact, after searching round a bit, I discovered that none of the google pages opened. PLease help, I have spent the past 7 hours searching for a soloution to this problem.</p>
