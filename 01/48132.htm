<h2>            Power on the USB port of the SP3</h2>
                    <p>Before I go on, there are already some discussion about the power provided through the USB port of the SP3 being insufficient for some peripherals:&nbsp;
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro3-surfhardware/is-there-more-power-in-the-sp3-docking-stations/6d1bc51b-fdab-40b2-8bc2-5dc79a71cdd8">

<p>
</p><p>My question is this, if I use a cable like this:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086LNYKS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I took a close look at that cable you are referencing and it acts and performs the same job as a "Y" cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That cable is for devices that do not come with a "Y" cable and there is no problem in using it.&nbsp; There is no "backflow" of current to take out the tablet.&nbsp; If it had its own power source, that would be a different story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you external drive does not have a "Y" cable, you can go ahead and get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To date, I have had external DVD burner drives from LG, Samsung, Asus, and Toshiba and all have worked with the SP3 as long as you connect the "Y" cable to the power brick or a powered USB hub.&nbsp; In fact, it worked so good that I downloaded Windows 10 TP
 32-bit ISO image and burned it using my SP3 and it worked perfect on a HP Stream 14 laptop.</p>

            what if the power was connected to a USB charger that supplied 2 amps, not the USB port on the SP3 charger which only supplied 1 amp.

            <p>Let me check on the specs for USB but I do believe it can handle quite a bit but there is a limit. &nbsp;That cable you referenced is 'rated' for 1.4 amps but the wiring can handle a lot more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep an eye on this thread and will get a reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That cable that is on the Amazon.com site is one of many types of cables for devices to make connection where the manufactures of devices did not look at smaller devices to connect too. &nbsp;I have an A/C powered cable for the iPhone 4 which was for video and
 what-not and never trusted it, so, never used it with anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you connected that cable to the power brick of the SP3, there will be no problem. &nbsp;I do believe it outputs 1.5 amps. &nbsp;5 volts is usually the upper limit for voltage on USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A 2.0 amp USB powered hub is usually designed for use with external hard disks in the 1 to 2 TB range (full sized, 5.25" inch models at that). &nbsp;Usually the power controller within the hub will step down but no guarantee on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to play safe and the USB cable on your DVD burner is replaceable, check to see if you can find a "Y" cable to replace it with. &nbsp;Some of those are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the current DVD burner model I am using is an Asus SDRW-08U5-U and it is rated to handle up to 2.5 amps.</p>

            <p>The cable itself is a sufficient gauge in which it will handle probably multiple folds of current that is listed on it's specification; I am not concern if the physical cable can handle that current running through it or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am asking about this scenario:</p>

            Just to clarify, in electrical engineering, there is something called a diode, in which it will enable the flow of current in 1 direction only.&nbsp; I doubt that these Y cables has a diode built-in the cable that ensures only current flows out of the SP3 and
 no current can flow into the SP3.

            <p>Well, the power routing from the "dongle" goes to the device and not to the tablet.&nbsp; Nothing goes into the tablet except for the data transfer signal from the device (essentially, the USB 3.0 port on the tablet is output only).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That dongle boosts the amount of power it does not receive from the tablet in order to operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To keep it simple and short, it makes up for the power the drive requires that it does not receive from the tablet.&nbsp; There is no feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A powered USB hub (which is recommended) will do fine if you do not trust that cable at Amazon.com.&nbsp; Other than that, just use the power brick from the SP3 which has a USB port and that is what it is designed for (to supply power).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SP3 models where "power reduced" in components to extend battery life (I think was the plan).&nbsp; It made no sense to throttle down the power of the port so that it cannot support storage devices.&nbsp; You will get no details from Microsoft at all on these
 tablets to include the internal specifications of these tablets.&nbsp; Intel made the controller and that is the only reference point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That cable 'should' be no problem.&nbsp; However, like everything else, made in China and shortcuts could have been taken in the construction of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your note of the diode; there is no diode and none needed.&nbsp; That dongle cable has no data pins/wires.&nbsp; It only supplies power (I have already tested those).&nbsp; It is also routed only to the device and no wiring goes to the tablet end of the cable.</p>

            <p>I suppose this is somewhat of an ok answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I think the key is what you said:&nbsp;if you want to be extra safe, get an externally powered USB hub.&nbsp; The externally powered USB hub will have the proper electronics to ensure that the external power will not flow back to the SP3 device.</p>

            <p>With the price tag of these machines, I don't blame you in questioning about these types of devices.&nbsp; Getting the wrong one that could be wired wrong, for instance, could send power directly into the power feeds of the port and fry the whole tablet!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powered USB ports are the best route to take.&nbsp; You also have the power brick and I use it.&nbsp; I have a USB extension cable that came with my Mac aluminum wired keyboard and I use it with my DVD burner drive for the power and I use the power brick.&nbsp; That way,
 if you go portable, no hub to add to the pack.</p>

<h2>            3D game performance terrible with windows 10</h2>
                    i have built many pc's&nbsp;and have never had a problem like this.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">i use a 1080p display, I have 8gb ram, a 500gbSSD (with the
 os), a 64gbSSD and a 2TB HDD. A i5-3570, and a 3gb amd hd 7970&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 153, 0, 1)">video</span></span><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">&nbsp;card.
 my motherboard is asrock. on windows 7 i had no problems and could run for example skyrim on ultra settings AND improved graphic mods with very smooth gameplay, bioshock infinte also could be played on ultra. games like fallout 4 could be run smoothly but
 not maxed out. i complely wiped my ssd and installed windows 10. my computer has never been faster, boot times improved as well. if i play 2d games they run quickly (but they likely arent heavy load anyways) but when i play 3D games the performance is terrible.
 i have tried windowed mode and i also can lower the settings down all the way but still the games are far to slow. games are installed on my ssd. now you likely will tell me to update my video drivers but believe me thats not the problem. I use amd's video
 driver uninstall utility to wipe any amd drivers and i have tried the newest drivers, i have tried much older drivers, all work but equally slow performance in games. i have also tried amd's auto detect video driver but that too was no better. i have also
 uninstalled the xbox app and for the **** of it reinstalled directx and .net but again, no improvment. what am i missing? my temp levels are complelty normal without any change. i have used gpu-Z and verifyed my dedicated graphics card is being used. somehow
 my gpu is totallyed under heavy load yet gives bad fps when i play games. but this only happens on windows 10.</span>

<h2>            I cant sync 2 devices using a firewire chain &#40;MOTU 896 and 8pre&#41;</h2>
                    Hello I've heard of people doing this successfully but I cant seem to get it working. They are Audio interfaces used in Music and Sound Recording Production Etc. Anyways the reason i want to use it thru firewire is so i can take advantage of all the inputs
 and outputs of both devices at full samplerates, also i want to be able to use the MIDI in/out from my 8pre.
<br />
<br />
MOTU tech support is no help they just told me it wasn't possible under Windows! but i've heard of people syncing devices!<br />

Hi Elijah,<br />
<br />
There are issues with firewire under the Windows OS that will not allow you to sync multiple firewire audio devices when daisy chanined through firewire.<br />
<br />
You can set up the two units with the 8PRE as a standalone converter and taking the ADAT output of the 8PRE and running it into the ADAT input of the 896mk3. Then set the 896mk3's clock source to ADAT.<br />
<br />
This will also allow you to use the 8Pre through the 896mk3's CueMix FX features.<br />

Is there a way to make this work? please help!

<br />
As per the information on MOTU support this hardware is not supported on Windows 7 and 64 bit editions of Windows.
<br />
<br />
Here&nbsp;are the links for more information.<br />

<div><br />
It is a possibility that technology enthusiasts have found a workaround. I would recommend you to search it on Internet using your favourite search engine.</div>

<p>That is correct. Just verified today I can log into website (after 5 days of it not working)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I or any of my kids try to login to any of our computers with family safe enabled we get the following prompt at least every 5 minutes<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34eeb8fe-579e-448a-a1fa-f0bc078cebbf" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The pre-populated email address is correct, but it won't accept the known good password that the website accepts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be some basic synchronization between my computers and the website because I notice that when I toggle between family safety controls and windows default controls my kids curfew hours end up back with the family safety settings as long as I choose
 it as the final option<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the site filtering and activity reporting are still not working since 7/31</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p><p><br /></p><p>We want to clarify that playing and earning achievements from a game through Game Sharing is not the same as buying a code through a retailer. You would need to purchase the game to be able to play. You can view your purchases on your <a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">purchase history page</a> that we automatically update when you purchase new content. Be sure to check that link out. Thanks.</p>

<p>No, uninstalling Google Updater probably won't remove the tasks from Scheduled Tasks (although they probably won't run ... if uninstalling really uninstalls everything).</p>
<p>You can easily remove the tasks yourself, however.&nbsp; Just open Scheduled Tasks, select each of the Google-related tasks, and press the Delete key (you can even do them all at once using the standard Windows select options -- CTRL+click to select multiple
 items individually or SHIFT+click to select a range of items).</p>

            This link produces the same result.&nbsp; The link takes me to Microsoft keyboard.&nbsp; When I open "keyboard" on my computer, it takes me to the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center, which is not the same as Keyboard.&nbsp;
<br />

I did find this link: <br />

Which is what I'd need if I were running <u>Windows 8</u>.&nbsp; Is there a similar link for
<u>Windows 7</u>?&nbsp; How to create macros in Windows 7 using Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard center.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 running really slow and consuming resources.</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've installed Windows 8 Pro (Obtained trough DreamSpark Premium) in my HP pc. The specs are:&nbsp;Intel Core i7-720QM processor 1.60GHz with Turbo Boost, double hard drive (Primary is a Vertex 3 ssd of 120 gbps and secondary is a WD Scorpio Black 750 Gbps).
 NVidia GeForce 230M, 8GB Ram. I did a clean install in the Vertex ssd, and also tried doing a refresh shortly afterward. I am having performance issues such as computer randomly freezing, CPU usage over 50%, and applications crashing. Could it be a hard drive
 issue maybe?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for your help&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It could be a software conflict or a hard drive issue. Let us try the following methods and see if
 they help.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run Performance troubleshooter:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Refer the following steps:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Move the mouse to the bottom left corner of the screen and right-click on the
<b>‘Start’</b> icon and select <b>‘Control Panel’</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the search box, type
<b>‘Troubleshooter’</b>, and then click <b>‘Troubleshooting’</b>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click View all on the left panel</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From the list of troubleshooter, choose System and Maintenance
</span><span>and click on next to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><b><span><br />
</span></b><b><span>Step A:
</span></b><span>Check if it runs okay in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following steps:<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab.<br />
d) Under ‘Boot Options’, select the ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
e) Choose the type of safe mode by selecting one of the options below the Safe boot check box:<br />
f) Select ‘Minimal’ and click OK and then restart your PC</span></p>
<p><span>If it works okay in safe mode try clean boot
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step B:
</span></b><span>Clean Boot will check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.<br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Step 1:
</span></b><span><br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
f) On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b><span>
 Enable half of the services<br />
<br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3:
</span></b><span>Determine whether the problem returns<br />
<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4:
</span></b><span>Enable half of the Startup items<br />
<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5:</span></b><span>
 Determine whether the problem returns<br />
<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 6:
</span></b><span>Resolve the problem<br />
<br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span>
 Run a system file checker scan and check if that helps. </span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following steps to run SFC scan.<br />
a) Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen, right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.<br />
b) Click on ‘Command Prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt. </span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>Click ‘Yes’ if it prompts for permission.<br />
c) In the command prompt type in the following command: </span></p>
<p><b><span>‘sfc /scannow’.</span></b></p>

<h2>            Is Windows Live Mail still working after upgrade to Win10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need Windows Live Mail to remain the same including all the 60-odd sub-folders with thousands of mails neatly sorted. Can I expect this to happen?

<p>Or is it rather likely that I won't be able to access them any more? </p>
<p>Anything I can do to retain WLM as it is?</p>

            Hi atzu06, version 1803 of Windows 10 introduced a bug into Explorer.exe, where it cannot read the metadata from files correctly, which results in incorrect folder size calculations and free space on drives being reported incorrectly. A fix for this is currently being tested and we will get that in a future update when it has bee tested.
<br />
<br />Even at the best of times, Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, navigate to your D drive, you will instantly see where this space is being used on your D Drive
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what the issue may be . . .

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If needed to replace the CMOS battery on a laptop you probably need a real computer shop
<br />
(not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or BigBox stores) or your System maker's support.<br />
<br />
CMOS battery also know as RTC battery<br />

<h3> oktoptopus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#8217;t add new account to my Xbox</h2>
                    Hello, my friends and I recently started a clan for gaming, and I wanted to change my xbox username to have the clan tag in it. So when I went to make a new account, by pressing the “add new” button under the sign in screen, but it came up with a grey
 rectangle going across the screen, then after about 40 seconds it comes up with a screen saying “Please try again. For some reason microsoft account took too long to start. (0x8027025a)” I’ve tried checking my internet and waiting a day. Any tips?

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. Have you tried performing a power cycle on your console before attempting to create a new account? While your console is on, hold the power button on your Xbox for 10 seconds until your Xbox turns off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test it again afterwards, and let us know the results!</p>

Hello roscow,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should answer your question or resolve your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot deselect a file extension without having a association for that extension to point to.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So go into your ITunes or other audio program and select that file to be default.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I hope the information is useful.</p>
<p>

<span>BIOS - How to Enter the BIOS</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Every computer is different, when you first turn on the computer it should tell you what button to push to enter the BIOS. It's usually one of the following and you must push it within the first 5 seconds:
 F1 &nbsp;F2 &nbsp;F10 &nbsp;F12 ESC &nbsp;DEL</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Once in the BIOS you have to find the menu with memory remapping, it's different on each computer.</span></p>

<span>Enable the memory remapping feature</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Check the BIOS settings to see whether the memory remapping feature is enabled. Memory remapping gives Windows access to more memory. You can enable the memory remapping feature in the BIOS by booting
 to the system setup. See the User's Guide for your computer for instructions on how to boot to system setup on your computer. The name for the memory remapping feature may be different for different hardware vendors. This can be listed as memory remapping,
 memory extension, or something similar. Be aware that your computer may not support the memory remapping feature.</span></p>

            Hello. These images are pretty difficult to find mostly because they are randomly generated via windows spotlight usually. 
<br />
<br />You can go to this imgur album here: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3OqBs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/3OqBs</a>
<br />
<br />where most of the spotlight photos are found and look for your picture in there. 
<br />
<br />
<br />maybe this one? <a href="https://i.imgur.com/gBm5vkL.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/gBm5vkL.jpg</a>

<h2>            I bought Castlevania&#58;SOTN years ago on 360. XBoxOne says I do not own it and have to rebuy it.</h2>
                    As the subject says, I can play Symphony of the Night at any time on my xbox360 whether it is connected to internet or not as I bought it years ago, but when I try to find it on my XBoxOne it says I have not paid for it, and need to buy it again. Any help
 would be greatly appreciated.

            It was download, not disk. I looked at my history, and it shows the point purchases, but not the games that I purchased with any of them back in 2011-2012. I see that it is missing about 4 times i bought games with just the generic points bought.

            If you are really 100% sure you purchased the game (and didn't just play it at a friend), and are using the same Microsoft Account that purchased the game, please contact the official support via
<a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> so they can check your purchase history.

<h2>            Clock icon in frames prevents video editing</h2>
                    I have some lengthy MTS clips which show a clack face in the middle when loaded in to Movei Maker and will not show anything in the preview window. Shorter clips seem fine and work (no clock icon is shown in the frames). What can I do to get everything
 to work so I can edit a video?

            I am using Windows 10 so the latest version provided of Movie Maker, I assume (I see it is still part of Windows Essentials 2012). I notice that other video clips loaded in the software are bright and will play, but the rest are all faded and semi-transparent&nbsp;in
 look, the icons on the&nbsp; tools ribbon above are also faded and do nothing. They also seem semi-transparent when trying to modify the video clips with the small blue clock face icon in the middle.&nbsp;The video clip software works but I get only black screen. I
 cannot change anything with these clips. They are all long clips, of 30 plus minutes, rather than short clips, so perhaps that is part of the problem. As there is no Help section with the software, it is rather galling not to know what I am doing wrong. I
 tried repairing the software, as instructed, but that did nothing. I hold my hands up and admit defeat! Would Apple's similar software do the same thing, I wonder?
