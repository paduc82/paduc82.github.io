<h2>            Unable to play the Minecraft full game</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I purchased Minecraft Windows 10 Edition from the Microsoft Store after previously having downloaded the trial version. The problem is that now when I try to play the game it opens it as if it's the trial with minimal access and a button to unlock
 the full game. I have tried clicking this button but after confirming my password nothing happens. I can't figure out how to uninstall it in an attempt to reinstall it and possibly fix the issue. I'd appreciate any suggestions on how I might be able to access
 this game I've purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Rachel</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I have since managed to uninstall and reinstall the game with no luck.</p>

<p>Hi Rachel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you encounter issues in accessing the game's full version, it may be because the system still detects the trial version you've first downloaded. To resolve this issue, we recommend uninstalling the game's trial version. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the Windows button on your device or keyboard, or select the Windows icon in the lower-left corner of the main screen.</li><li>Select <strong>All apps</strong>, and then find Minecraft's trial version.</li><li>Right-click it, and then select Uninstall. </li><li>Follow the steps to uninstall the game. </li><li>Restart your device so that the changes will take effect. Launch the full version and check if the same issue occurs.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the same issue occurs, kindly proceed with uninstalling and reinstalling the game's full version. Refer to

            Hi Simon,
<br />
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />Is your PC second hand or Windows was reinstalled by a PC Repair Shop?
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

            Hi,
<br />Honestly the only way is to do a clean install right now-You can wait if they release an ISOs for a build not expiring on 14th and do an in-place upgrade.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&lt;This is my alternate account&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been told the ISOs would be released soon before 14th. And Build expiring doesn't mean Windows would stop booting too-you would get notifications only<br />

<p>Absolutely not, i personally have only played one Lego game and in my own opinion it was very poor, it was far too simple, very ugly and simply not fun, but if it's your thing it's your thing...</p>

<p>Again you fail to comprehend what has been said, Lego games are made for children but enjoyed by adults as well, you unfortunately have failed to display any adult traits in the last week. Nice job of derailing my threads with your pettiness as well. kudos
 to you for that. But if you think you are winning any Internet points for it or endearing yourself to the community there is only one other here who would applaud your actions and they seem to suffer from the same delusions as yourself.</p>
<p>By the way, you will fail to achieve your goal here, or anywhere.</p>

<p>Yep Lego Star Wars were great, I have Lego Batman but didn't have time to get into it before Borderlands was released. The amount of detail in Lego LOTR and the fact that they cover all three movies means this game should be amazing. as I have said before
 it looks to be the best LOTR game this generation.</p>

<p>I do have a soft spot for the LEGO games: sure they're aimed at kids, but they're a nice break from blowing stuff up and shooting people in the face! Although I do sort of wish they'd slow down the production rate a little - I seem to be getting one through
 the door ever week.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's hard to resist &nbsp;LEGO versions of the Fellowship. Here's hoping they also bother to read the books and chuck Tom Bombadil into the mix :P

<p>Hey, assuming this isn't boring, which Lego Star Wars was, to a degree (still loved it, don't get me wrong). A few optimisations and a little more detail and it would be awesome.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see some skill trees make it to a Lego game, eventually, but that's not even essential, really. Should be a good one :D</p>

<h2>            Wireless kinect bar&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We just moved to a new house with a media room. &nbsp;What this means is that the Xbox One is in a media closet vs. plugged in to a tv in the front of the room. &nbsp;How can the boys play anything through Kinect now? &nbsp;Is there some kind of really long Kinect attachment
 cord that would allow us to move it to the front of the room?</p>

<p>Look at the wires on your kinect. </p>
<p>Look at your TV.</p>
<p>Look at how thick that wire is.</p>
<p>Look at how thick your HDMI cable is.</p>

<p>@Karch - My projector comes with a wireless HDMI module that transmits the HDMI signal from my receiver to the projector wirelessly, and it works flawlessly. No lag, full 1080P HD.</p>
<p>So it is definitely, definitely possible. It's just unlikely that M$ would implement such a useful feature.</p>

<p>I would think transmitting a digital signal that is being displayed to transmitting commands that needs to be real time might be 2 different speeds.. but yeah... &nbsp;MS does need to make a longer cable or think of something..</p>
<p>OP are you more worried on voice commands or the actual tracking of movements? &nbsp;for the voice.. it does really need to be directly in front... only be able to hear... without picking up exterior sounds</p>

<h2>            Printer not printing color</h2>
                    I have windows 8.1 with an HP desk jet 1510 all in one series printer . I also have a hp computer. I have brand new ink cartridges and it will only print in Black. I recently threw away a color cartridge that was new thinking it was a bad one because I
 could not print in color. Now the same thing is happening. I can print in B&amp;W no problem. But no color. Need assistance if anyone else can help.&nbsp;

<h2>            Unable to make skype calls to the UK</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to&nbsp; make an overseas call to the UK, England. Every time I try, Skype says the number is invalid. I am getting the number from an official Barclays bank statement so I know the number is correct. Here is the number listed on that statement:</p>
<p>
</p><p>+44 (0) 1624 616000</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I do not know what I'm supposed to do with that (0) entry, but here are all the numbers I've tried in Skype:</p>
<p>
</p><p>+44 1624616000</p>
<p>+44 0 1624616000</p>
<p>
</p><p>both of these are invalid according to what Skype says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what I need to do here?</p>

            Is it a toll free number? In most of the countries, toll free calling through Skype is not possible.

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 screen drivers</h2>
                    Recently my Surface Pro 4 screen has stopped registering multi-touch and doesn't sense the pen. This happened recently and I took it into the Microsoft Store and the technician was able to fix it by uninstall and reinstalling a certain screen driver, but
 I was wondering if someone could tell me which one it is so I can try to fix this myself.&nbsp;

            This has impacted customers after installing the Fall Creators Update. Others have found that going into device manager and disabling/enabling the "Intel(R) Precise Touch Device" in device manager made both the pen and the multi-touch work again. Less disruptive than restarting. And the problem will probably re-occur. 
<br />
<br />Open device manager,  Click on human interface devices to expand it and it should be near the bottom of the list. This is a temporary fix and the issue may return, but for now, it is the only work around. Engineering asked that anyone afflicted with this use the Feedback Hub App to send in a bug while in the bad state before disabling/re-enabling so that they can get the logs.
<br />
<br />Sorry you are having this issue (but you aren't alone). If this helps, please DO mark as answer.

<p>There is a problem, normal user can simply go in cmd and type:</p>

<p>and they will get a clear text password...how can i restrict he usage of netsh for standard user</p>

            <p>Is there any reason standard users in your environment need access to CMD? I generally disable access to CMD for all standard users via group policy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If users need access to CMD, then you could try changing settings within UAC and Local Security policy to not allow CMD to make system changes without elevation.

            <p>True, I didn't think of this, good catch. </p>
<p>
</p><p>David, I just tested the following in my lab, you can disable access to netsh for all users in your domain (or via local policy) with a GPO. See the screenshot below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After applying the policy and booting a test computer with a test user account the following happened when running each of the following.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The restrictions error box is when trying to execute netsh via run or any other way, and as you can see the command prompt access has been disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>User Configuration&gt; Policies&gt; Administrative Templates&gt;System&gt; "Don't run specified Windows applications"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put Netsh.exe in the value field. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right above the previously mention policy is "Prevent access to the command prompt" enable this policy and set the value to yes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the real answer I should have given you David was to set the GPO below, but I'd recommend disabling access to CMD by users in your environment too.

 boot into Windows 10:</strong></p>
<p>I was busy and didn’t have time to open my computer for like a month or so, during that period Windows updated stacked up. Then I opened my computer it was fine except even though I had set Windows updates to ask me first before updating, (probably the latest)
 Windows update forced itself, it created a “Windows update helper” shortcut on my desktop and was running in the background. Also there was another Windows update going on at the update settings section with a different percentage (I think they were 2 seperate
 updated but I am not sure). I didn’t have time to wait for the update(s) so I left my laptop on fort the night for about 9-10 hours. When I came back my computer was in System recovery tools, asking for my keyboard layout [Pic 1 at the top] and after selecting
 it I would come to [Pic 2]. And here, none of the options help me. Saying “Continue” reboots to Pic 1 and this screen again. On the troubleshoot section [Pic 3], I can’t do a system restore because it won’t detect my restore point even though I have one and
 used it before. Startup repair and go to a previous build options will both check my pc for a maximum of two seconds and tell me it failed. I noticed that “Startup options” are missing while trying to find the solution on the internet. Two more things that
 concern me are that; Below the continue button it says “Exit and continue with Windows Rollback” and that there are two Windows’ and Windows Rollback as an option for booting with a different operating system [Pic 4]. I executed some cmd commands to try and
 fix this and failed but I think that’s the only way that I can fix this because no other options work in this menu and that I don’t have a CD or a USB that can fix this. Looking forward for replies 😓<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e7ccf32-633b-4a78-92d9-b6498fe12801?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e7ccf32-633b-4a78-92d9-b6498fe12801?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7c2cb8f-88fc-4728-87c4-0f1ff33e8327?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7c2cb8f-88fc-4728-87c4-0f1ff33e8327?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e50096d-e97a-44a9-bedd-e2097b740492?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e5009

    <title>Cannot Change Hardware acceleration settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelly101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Change Hardware acceleration settings</h2>
                    Hello<br />
I have a Toshiba notebook laptop computer with windows vista and cannot play my desperate Housewives games distributed by bvg games. When I try to install it it says that my hardware acceleration failed. It told me to install direct X 9.0c which I did and it
 still came up with the same message. I clicked on windows help and it told me to check my direct X and i did and it said that my direct X was fine and there were no problems with it. Windows help also suggested that I change my hardware acceleration settings
 which i think is the problem but my computer wont let me change them. It that the driver i have doesn't allow me to change them. I even updated my driver and it stil lwouldn't let me.&nbsp;I want to know how or if it is possible for me to change my hardware acceleration
 settings so i can play my game. The graphics&nbsp;driver in my computer is a Mobile Intel 945 express chipset family.<br />
Thanks Kelly101

<p>What was the blue screen error (there are lots of blue screen errors).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you mean that when trying to start the Wireless Network Setup Wizard you see a message like this:<br />
<br />
rundll32.exe - Bad Image<br />
The application or DLL C:\WINDOWS\system32\dot3api.dll is not a valid Windows image.&nbsp; Please check this against your installation diskette.<br />
<br />
Then when you click OK, you see a message like this:<br />
<br />
RUNDLL<br />
Error loading wzcdlg.dll<br />
%1 is not a valid Win32 application.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the c:\windows\system32\dot3api.dll file is somehow corrupted (it is not missing) and needs to be replaced.<br />
<br />
The other file - c:\windows\system32\wzcdlg.dll file might be okay, but keep in mind that it too might need to be replaced.&nbsp; Start by just replacing the dot3api.dll file.<br />
<br />
Since the file is in the list of 3498 files that Windows File Protection cares about there should be "good" copies on your system in a backup folder.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You need to replace the file(s) in c:\windows\system32 with a good copy that you can find elsewhere on your system.<br />
<br />
Search your system and find backup copies of the files.<br />
<br />
Depending on your system and how XP was installed, you may find copies of the file here:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
<br />
If your system has an installation folder that contains an i386 folder (perhaps on a D drive), there may be copies there or if&nbsp; you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD, you could expand the files from the CD.<br />
<br />
Your goal is to replace the suspicious file(s) in c:\windows\system32 with good copies.<br />
<br />
When you find the copies, you should boot in Safe Mode so the files are not in use, navigate to the windows\system32 folder and&nbsp; rename the suspicious file to something you can remember (like dot3api.old, etc.) so in case something goes wrong you can put the
 original files back).<br />
<br />
Then copy in the "good" replacement file from the other location over the top of the old file or replace the files if they are totally missing (unlikely).<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative if you are asked to overwrite or replace the existing files.<br />
<br />
Reboot the system normally and test to be sure things are working again and then wonder if using McAfee is such a good idea.</p>

    <title>Bought the Ultrimate edition of FH3 but didn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t get - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bought the Ultrimate edition of FH3 but didn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t get what i paid for</h2>
                    
<p>As the title says, I bought the FH3 ultimate edition but i haven't been able to download or collect anything but the standard version of the game.. Although the store shows i own everything in the ultimate edition, it still wants me to pay for the 3 extra
 packs, in the actual ultimate edition.</p>
<p>What the heck is that srsly. I paid 800kr for the UE already, where I've only been able to collect the standard version so far.</p>

<p>Has anyone else experienced this aswell? or knows what the heck to do, to be able to get the full content of the ultimate edition?</p>

<p>I also got scammed, I have talked to 10 different Microsoft and XB agents to try and resolve my license key I paid $100 for. This has been the biggest fail of a release I have ever witnessed. I can personally guarantee I will never purchase a game by Microsoft
 or any XB console or game. Microsoft has proved to me they do not care about me as a customer or else I would have to take 14 hours of my own personal time to get this issue resolved.

                    On my taskbar there's a red X where a blue&nbsp;bulb&nbsp;should be telling me I'm connected. But I am only able to use the internet. I cannot download any programs. I cannot use any CD's or iTunes. &nbsp;And I really need to download a program for class tomorrow. I
 recently noticed this happening about March 2011 but now this has begun to happen for 5 days straight. And I really need this program. I've already tried restarting it and&nbsp;shutting&nbsp;it down and using different profiles but nothing is working help!

            No. It's not a problem with the CD because it works just fine on my laptop. And it's not a problem with iTunes because I've tried everything to fix it. And they tell me there's nothing wrong with it. And there's no problem with Google Chrome because it's
 was already installed on my computer when I got it. So why would it just begin to effect my computer when I'm using it right now.

<h2>            Win 7 x64 Home Premium Monitor Calibration</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trust you are doing well.</p>
<p>I am writing to resolve an issue related to improper monitor calibration. Here's a brief description:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Monitor: HDMI native 800x600 resolution</p>
<p>Graphics: Radeon on Adrenalin 17.12.2</p>
<p>Desktop: Running fine at 800x600x16 [need 16 bit owing to compatibility issues with some older games]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue: While initializing 32bpp games the monitor gets wrongly calibrated, the o/s thinks that the monitor has a larger native resolution than 800x600. I think it is only overestimating the width of the monitor. As a result, games configured to run at 800x600
 get pillarboxed, basically the display gets cut-off at both left and right sides while the scene is rendered in full.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My findings: I had a similar problem while booting-up as well..the desktop by default booted at larger than native resolution, changed to 800x600 and the desktop got similarly pillarboxed like the issue I have described above. I searched the registry key
 for "graphic" came across two parameters PrimSurfSize.cx, PrimsurfSize.cy which the o/s had wrongly configured at higher than native resolution, changing them to 800, 600 respectively fixed the issue [it wasn't that straightforward, had to connect the monitor
 to a nvidia computer which was somehow displaying correctly, extracted the registry keys from that computer and ran it on the radeon computer]. Also, 16bpp games are running correctly without the pillarboxing issue. Does a similar fix exist for 32bpp games,
 is the o/s creating some kind of a temporary/permanent key while rendering in 32bpp that needs to be changed? Any other solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
The display issue you're experiencing with your PC might be due to a variety of reasons. One of which is due to an outdated display adapter.<br />
<br />
That being said, have you checked if your display adapter is up-to-date? If not, you may check on it on your PC's display adapter manufacturer's website for the latest drivers. It will also be helpful if pending updates for Windows can be installed.<br />
<br />
Can you also tell us when did it start to happen? Were you experiencing this kind of issue ever since?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.
        </p>

<p>Greatly appreciate your response. Details below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just built a new system .. the problems been there from the first boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I have the latest driver released in second week of December '17 by AMD, installed with a clean o/s during first boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got this industrial HDMI display specifically to play the older 4:3 games at native resolution.. simply because the vid card has only digital outputs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I noted earlier, had to manually change the registry keys above to sort the desktop problem ... the desktop was booting in a larger than native resolution which was solved by changing the values of primsurfsize.cx, primsurfsize.cy.. i did a laymans interpretation
 that those variables stand for primary display surface size on the x and y axis resp.. i.e. the native resolution of the display, which was wrongly calibrated on the higher size. since then, 16 bit per pixel games too are running fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the problem manifests only while playing 32 bits per pixel games [current desktop at 800x600x16] &nbsp;- i can increase the resolution in-game and the problem goes away, but the display looks hazy as it is not really the native resolution of the monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hhmmm. Changing something from the registry makes it a bit complex in troubleshooting the issue since it creates a huge effect on the device.<br />
<br />
Just to confirm, you've mentioned that you built a new system. Does that mean your PC is a custom-built PC?<br />
<br />
Have you confirmed that you got the latest driver for your display adapter on your manufacturer's website? It may be possible that they have a more recent update.<br />
<br />
It is also possible that the issue might be from the hardware since you've mentioned that the problem has been there from the first boot.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your response.

<p>Yes, its a custom built pc.. and on latest display drivers, AMD has not yet launched anything for year 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be a quirk with this specific combination involving Radeon &amp; this small industrial monitor on HDMI - the monitor is working fine on an Nvidia card and the Radeon is providing a perfect output on my LG Freesync wide screen monitor, its also
 providing a perfect output in 16bpp mode on the smaller monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will check if booting the desktop at 32bpp solves this problem, as i didnt see any separate set of registries for when the monitor enters a different mode..theres only one set of registries for the 16 bpp mode, none for 32bpp mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be grateful if you could meanwhile check this with some one from MS with the kind of tribal knowledge required to solve this very specific quirk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.<br />
</p>
<p>Edit: I have confirmed that this registry ...<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\Configuration...</span></p>
<p>is for the monitor and not the graphics adapter..when i move the monitor across Nvidia and Radeon systems, the values in this registry for the non-native mode stay unchanged, which can only mean that these settings are exclusively for the monitor... all
 i have to do is generate the right registry values on the Nvidia computer and append it to the Radeon PC..so one approach might be to figure out how to generate multiple default modes in the registry if that's even possible [since the Nvidia computer too is
 just maintaining one set of registry values at any given point in time, it may not be entirely possible]</p>

<h2>            Installing WinHelp32.exe on Windows 8 Pro</h2>
                    I'm trying to install WinHelp32.exe on Windows8 Pro (64-bit). I go to the relevant Microsoft support site and download:
<br />
<br />
Windows8-RT-KB917607-x64.msu.<br />
<br />
On double-clicking to install I receive the message "This update is not applicable to your computer".<br />

Any suggestions?<br />

            Thank you for trying to help but "you've got the wrong end of the stick". Firstly the problem has nothing to do with Windows 8 Help. Secondly, if you read my post, I am running the 64-bit version of Windows 8. Downloading and running the file you suggest
 produces, not surprisingly, exactly the same error message.<br />
<br />
Fortunately I found the solution in another forum:<br />
<br />
http://www.eightforums.com/software-apps/7540-winhlp32-exe-how-can-i-enable-legacy-windows-help-system-windows-8-a.html<br />
<br />
I agree 100% with the comment "Why on earth does Microsoft put a non-functional stub in Windows 8 WinHlp32.exe, where they could just as easily put a real executable? Sheer bloody-mindedness?"<br />

            <p>On Windows 8 x64 &nbsp;I also want to access a help file from an ancient application that I use daily. I found the same problems and the same solutions noted above worked for me -</p>
<p>Problem 1 - Windows8-RT-KB917607-x64.msu refuses to install with message "This update is not applicable to your computer".</p>
<p>Solution 1 - obtain the old winhlp32.exe from <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/software-apps/7540-winhlp32-exe-how-can-i-enable-legacy-windows-help-system-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/software-apps/7540-winhlp32-exe-how-can-i-enable-legacy-windows-help-system-windows-8-a.html</a>. Then deal with...</p>
<p>Problem 2 - I am unable to rename or remove the winhlp32.exe stub in \Windows, so can't replace it with the legacy winhlp32.exe that might actually work</p>
<p>Solution 2 - follow the procedure given in <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/how-to-delete-a-system-file-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/how-to-delete-a-system-file-in-windows-vista/</a> to take ownership of \Windows\winhlp32.exe, rename it and copy the legacy winhlp32.exe into |Windows. Result: ancient help file can now be read.</p>
<p>Alternatively - use Control Panel/Add language to install &amp; enable English (US) - took ages, required reboot, showed error message (failure configuring Windows) but finally worked. (NB. Before rebooting, ensure you know how to enter any special characters
 in your login password on a US&nbsp;English keyboard.)</p>
<p>Then with US English enabled,&nbsp; Windows8-RT-KB917607-x64.msu installs and you get a more up to date version of winhlp32.exe.</p>
<p>Is&nbsp; Windows8-RT-KB917607-x64.msu enabled only for users of English (US)? It looks like Microsoft's quality control has seriously slipped with Windows 8, particularly with updates.</p>

    <title>Trouble Installing 32Bit - Vista Entry Point Not Found Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trouble Installing 32Bit  - Vista Entry Point Not Found Error</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to do a clean installation of 32 Bit Windows Vista from Windows 2000 (Service Pack 4). When the installation asks which drive I would like to install windows to as I have Sata Drives running of a Sata/RAID Control Card it asks for the drivers.
 No matter which version of this driver I supply for it the installation fails with the following error "Install Windows: setup.exe - Entry Point Not Found - The Procedure entry point LZClose could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll" I
 have a Silicon Image Sil 3513 SATALink PCI Controller which runs my hard drives. The same drivers worked fine to install Windows 2000. As I have the upgrade version of Vista I can only run it through Windows so I have been unable to try and see if it will
 install directly from DOS.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>James</p>

<p>Have found a solution. I am using the Upgrade version of Windows Vista &amp; as such was trying to install through Windows 2000. However Win 2k interfaces HDDs in a different mode to Vista so it was conflicting. I solved the issue by installing Vista via the
 bootable disc.</p>
<p>Now just have to find compatible drivers for my asus motherboard and on board devices.... Grrrr I'm sure I had this computer running Vista previously without all these headaches....</p>
