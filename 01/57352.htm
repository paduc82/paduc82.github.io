            <u><b>The basic definition of a 0x116 bugcheck is:</b></u><br />
<br />
<blockquote><br />
<i>There may be a bug in the video driver or video hardware.</i></blockquote>
So, let me now explain what VIDEO_TDR_ERROR means. First off, TDR is an acronym for
<i><b>'Timeout Detection and Recovery'</b></i>. Timeout Detection and Recovery was introduced in Vista and carried over to Windows 7. Rather than putting exactly what Timeout Detection and Recovery does exactly, I'll just directly quote the MSDN article!<br />
<br />
<blockquote><b>Timeout detection:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The GPU scheduler, which is part of the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>), detects that the GPU is taking more than the permitted amount of time to execute a particular task. The GPU scheduler then tries to
 preempt this particular task. The preempt operation has a "wait" timeout, which is the actual TDR timeout. This step is thus the timeout detection phase of the process. The default timeout period in Windows Vista and later operating systems is 2 seconds. If
 the GPU cannot complete or preempt the current task within the TDR timeout period, the operating system diagnoses that the GPU is frozen.
</i><br />
</blockquote>
<blockquote><i>To prevent timeout detection from occurring, hardware vendors should ensure that graphics operations (that is, DMA buffer completion) take no more than 2 seconds in end-user scenarios such as productivity and game play.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Preparation for recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system's GPU scheduler calls the display miniport driver's
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559815%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>DxgkDdiResetFromTimeout</b></a> function to inform the driver that the operating system detected a timeout. The driver must then reinitialize itself and reset the GPU. In addition, the driver must stop accessing memory and should not access hardware. The
 operating system and the driver collect hardware and other state information that could be useful for post-mortem diagnosis.&nbsp;
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Desktop recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system resets the appropriate state of the graphics stack. The video memory manager, which is also part of
<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>, purges all allocations from video memory. The display miniport driver resets the GPU hardware state. The graphics stack takes the final actions and restores the desktop to the responsive state. As previously mentioned, some legacy DirectX
 applications might render just black at the end of this recovery, which requires the end user to restart these applications. Well-written DirectX 9Ex and DirectX 10 and later applications that handle Device Remove technology continue to work correctly. An
 application must release and then recreate its Direct3D device and all of the device's objects. For more information about how DirectX applications recover, see the Windows SDK.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff570087%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Article here.
</a></blockquote>
<br />
With this being said, if Timeout Detection and Recovery fails to recover the display driver, it will then shoot the 0x116 bugcheck. There are many different things that can cause a 0x116, which I will explain below:<br />
<br />
<b><i>(Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented with
 the latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.)</i></b><br />
<br />
<u><b>The following hardware issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> Unstable overclock (CPU, GPU, etc). Revert all and any overclocks to stock settings.
<br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Bad sector in memory resulting in corrupt data being communicated between the GPU and the system (video memory otherwise known as VRAM or physical memory otherwise known as RAM).<br />
<br />
<b>GPU testing:</b> Furmark, run for ~15 minutes and watch temperatures to ensure there's no overheating and watch for artifacts.<br />
<br />
<b>RAM testing:</b> Memtest - Refer to the below:<br />
<br />
<span><u><b>Memtest:</b></u></span><br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />

<br />
You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced.<br />
<br />
<b>To reset your page file, follow the instructions below:</b><br />
<br />
<b>a )</b> Go to Start...Run...and type in "sysdm.cpl" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
- Then click on the Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Performance Settings Button,<br />
- Then on the next Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Virtual Memory Change button.<br />
<br />
<b>b )</b> In this window, note down the current settings for your pagefile (so you can restore them later on).<br />
<br />
-Then click on the "No paging file" radio button, and<br />
<br />
- then on the "Set" button. Be sure, if you have multiple hard drives, that you ensure that the paging file is set to 0 on all of them.<br />
<br />
-Click OK to exit the dialogs.<br />
<br />
<b>c )</b> Reboot (this will remove the pagefile from your system)<br />
<br />
<b>d ) </b>Then go back in following the directions in step a ) and re-enter the settings that you wrote down in step<br />
<br />
<b>b ).</b> Follow the steps all the way through (and including) the reboot.<br />
<br />
<b>e )</b> Once you've rebooted this second time, go back in and check to make sure that the settings are as they're supposed to be.<br />
<br />
<b>Run System File Checker:</b><br />
<br />
SFC.EXE /SCANNOW<br />
<br />
Go to Start and type in "cmd.exe" (without the quotes)<br />
<br />
At the top of the search box, right click on the cmd.exe and select "Run as adminstrator"<br />
<br />
In the black window that opens, type "SFC.EXE /SCANNOW" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Let the program run and post back what it says when it's done.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
- Overheating of the CPU or GPU and or other components can cause 0x116 bugchecks. Monitor your temperatures and ensure the system is cooled adequately.<br />
<br />
- GPU failure. Whether it's heat, power issue (PSU issue), failing VRAM, etc.<br />
<br />
<u><b>The following software issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
- Incompatible drivers of any sort <br />
<br />
- Messy / corrupt registry<br />
<br />
- Corrupt Direct X - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113</a><br />
<br />
- Corrupt system files (run System File Checker as advised above)<br />
<br />
- Buggy and or corrupt 3rd party drivers. If you suspect a 3rd party driver being the issue, enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7)<br />
- Concurrentcy Stress Test (Windows 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

<p><span>Hi spyder420,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What is the Operating System installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Along with TaurArian`s suggestions, also see if the following steps help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>If this does not help, try installing the updates in a clean boot state and see if it helps. To do so, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type “msconfig.exe” (without quotes) in the Start Search box, and then press Enter to start the System Configuration Utility. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation,
 type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all. Click OK, and then click Restart. Install the updates after the restart.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Make sure you put the computer back to Normal Startup once updates finish installing.</span></p>

<h3> rabbi2  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get &#34;All Apps&#34; to display&#63;</h2>
                    From the Start screen of Windows 8 , I right-click and a bar appears at the bottom of the screen. At the extreme right of the bar is a button/icon labeled "All Apps". When I click that button I should see all of the apps on my computer. When I first installed
 Windows 8 that's what happened. But now when I click that button I get a blank light blue screen.&nbsp; I see no Apps, but can return to the Start screen from the "charms" list. How do I get "All Apps" to appear and work again?&nbsp; Windows 8 phone support (in India)
 didn't have a clue.

<h2>            Security risk when calling without camera</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had my webcam with microphone accidentally plugged out and i received a skype video call.</p>
<p>Instead of a blank screen, my partner could see my desktop.</p>
<p>In my view this is a HUGE security risk and it needs fixed five minutes ago since it breaches any and all privacy policies and i don't even want to think about how this can be exploited...</p>

<h2>            Win 8.1 &#40;Pro&#41; - Creation of System Repair Disc in DVD</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Win 8.1, I notice that I can create&nbsp; System Recovery Drive in Flash Drive (USB Thumb drive) &nbsp;at Action Centre &gt; Recovery &gt; &nbsp;Creating System Recovery Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for me to create the system repair disk in DVD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Win 8,&nbsp;after&nbsp;creation of system image, the system always prompt the user to Create a Repair Disc in DVD / Thumb drive,&nbsp;In&nbsp;Win 8.1 can the user do the same?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the difference between System Recovery Drive and System Repair Disc? Are they the same?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            PXE-M0F&#58; Exiting Intel PXE ROM No bootable device on ACER 4810T</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 Prof running on 64-bit Acer 4810T. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All seems to be working ok when I'm using the computer, but when I walk away leaving the computer running for a good while (open or closed), an error occurs and I get a message as follows on a black screen:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Intel UNDI, PXE-2.1 (build 082) etc. . . .</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For Atheros PCIE Internet Controller v2.0.0.4(03/03/09) Client MAC ADDR etc. : No DHCP or proxyDHCP offers were received. &nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PXE-M0F: Exiting Intel PXE ROM No bootable device - - insert boot disk and press any key. &nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I then power off rather than follow the command to insert a boot disk, the computer re-boots normally. I haven't tried the controlled options. I &nbsp;don't seem to have any problem accessing or saving files to the hard disk. Any idea what the problem is
 and how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 64 bit Repair disk I made a couple of years ago. Should I insert and run that?</p>

            <p>The problem with restoring an image in its entirety is you cannot be 100% certain about how clean it is (as has always been the case) In addition Windows own System Image utility will only restore to the same size drive or larger, safer to use a 3rd party
 tool such as Acronis True Image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact some SSD manufacturers provide a utility to transfer a boot image for you, worked very well with my Intel SSD and is a special version of True Image. Samsung do the same as another example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched from a 1TB HHD to my 240GB SSD. It does take a little thought managing the limited space but can be done, made easier with a NAS permanently available on my LAN (I use Windows Home Server). Some home routers support attaching a USB drive direct
 to the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Physically an SSD is the same size as a laptop HDD and has exactly the same SATA interface.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Niranjan. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to try it out as, in the intervening period, I took my laptop to a shop where they do repairs etc. It probably needed an overhaul anyway as I have had the laptop for 4 years without it
 having been maintained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it got a good cleanup, including removal of some spyware that was probably slowing&nbsp;it down and and the fan was cleaned as the computer was overheating a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be running ok now... fingers crossed.</p>

                    When I trying downloading my Ohio state which I paid for with H&amp;R Block At Home Deluxe + federal e-file + state I get the following error message: Unable To Connect SSL ERROR: bad server certificate or incorrrect PC date Please check the date set on your
 computer. Saved the federal return and closed H&amp;R Block At Home, made sure the date and clock has the right day and time. Reopened the program to try and get the state program only to have it get the error once again. Started Friday March 2, 2013, again Saturday
 March 3, 2013, and once again on Sunday March 3, 2013, still get the error message. Is there a problem with getting the Ohio state program? Or must I only try on weekdays during H&amp;R Block's office hours, or the hours of Ohio State business? grammyfigment

                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-networking/printer-will-not-print-documents-from-wordpad/10b3c4f5-8d6b-498c-b87c-7c098356a6c5" title="Split from this thread">

<p>
</p><p>I have just found that WordPad does not currently find my Brother network printer, even though I can print from my browser and word processor. I haven't printed from WordPad for a while, but I have printed from Notepad recently, possibly not since the Fall
 update, which I installed (after many retries) 1 Dec 2017.<br />
<br />
Neither WordPad nor NotePad shows an option for the Brother, just the PDF printer and the XPS Document Writer, and the Find Printer button shows the network computers but not the network printer. The network printer shows up in the Network area of File Explorer,
 and in the devices area of Control Panel, and, as stated, shows up and prints from other programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating the driver, and Windows reports that the driver is latest available, which I expected, since the printer has automatic updating available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit with solution: <br />
<br />
I ran the Printer troubleshooter, and it said that the problem might be fixed by setting the printer to Default, and did that.&nbsp; After closing and restarting Notepad and WordPad, both the Brother and the Fax, which also had not appeared previously, were in the
 printer lists. I checked on the Printers &amp; Scanners page in Settings, and found that "Let Windows Manage My Default Printer" was set, and turned it off. "Print to PDF" had been default previously, because I had used it last. It then occurred to me that that
 might have been the problem, and reset the default to the Print to PDF. Sure enough, Notepad and Wordpad then did not show Fax and the Brother printer on the printer list. This is bad behavior, IMHO.</p>

    <title>BSOD Upon Waking from Sleep Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allisong94  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD Upon Waking from Sleep Mode</h2>
                    <p>I've recently been able to update my computer from Windows 8 to 8.1, and everything is working fine except for the consistent BSOD that appears whenever my computer wakes up from sleep mode. (It usually fails at the login screen, or the lock screen right
 before.) The error code is the same each time, Driver IRQL Not Less or Equal (iaStorAV.sys). From what I've read this .sys file pertains to the Intel Graphics Card, which I've updated to the latest driver but I'm still having issues. I'm not sure if there
 was an update from Microsoft that Intel hasn't responded to or what, I've found little information relating to this issue.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            WIndows Mail Advanced options shows E-mail button Greyed out and won&#39;t turn on.</h2>
                    I am trying to get my Windows Mail (NOT OUTLOOK) to work. After the recent update it stopped working. When I go into&nbsp;<span>System settings, Apps &amp; Features, click on Mail &amp; Calendar, Click on Advance Options the E-mail button is greyed out and
 won't let me turn it on. I have uninstalled mail and re-installed and that did not work. I reset mail in Advanced options. Any one have any idea how to fix this?</span>

            Try resetting the mail app to see if that works:
<br />
<br />Open the Start menu.
<br />
<br />Search for Windows PowerShell, right-click the result and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Open PowerShell as administrator
<br />Type the following command on PowerShell and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />Restart your computer to complete the task.
<br />
<br />Note that this command will remove the Mail and Calendar apps from Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Once you have completed the task, you’ll need to reinstall both apps from the Store using the instructions below.
<br />
<br />How to reinstall the Mail app on Windows 10
<br />
<br />Open Store.
<br />
<br />Do a search for “Mail and Calendar”.
<br />
<br />Click the app from the result.
<br />
<br />Click the Install button to reinstall the apps again.
<br />
<br />Go to Start menu, open the Mail app, and complete the setup.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps!

            <p>Hi Mayank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to Ramesh Srinivasan suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you remember making any specific change in the PC prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>This could be due to its dependent service being turned off or any system file corruption. Let's try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong><span><strong>I suggest you to follow the steps provided below:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<p>
</p><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Press <strong><span>Windows key + R</span></strong> on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Type “<strong><span>Services.msc</span></strong>” without quotes and press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Locate for </span><strong><span>Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</span></strong> and
<strong>Windows Management Instrumentation.</strong></li><li><span>Check whether the following services are <strong>Started </strong>and set to
<strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Method 2: </strong>If the issue persists, </span>
<span><span>I suggest you to run a full scan of your computer using <strong>Microsoft Security Scanner.</strong></span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspxNote" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Run System File Checker tool.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong><span>Windows</span></strong> key +
<strong><span>X</span></strong> and click <strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin)</span></strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type the following command and press
<strong><span>Enter </span></strong><strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></strong></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you are able to use Windows Defender. Thank you. </p>

<p>==========================================<br />
Might be worth a try to convert the .mov files to the .wmv format.<br />
Then they should be compatible with Movie Maker and/or Windows <br />
DVD Maker.</p>
<p>MOV is the Apple QuickTime format and the<br />
'QuickTime 7 Pro' software can convert MOV files...<br />
(that's the retail version not the freeware)<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)</p>
<p>QuickTime 7 Pro<br />
<a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/D3381Z/A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.apple.com/us/product/D3381Z/A</a><br />
<br />
Instructions for converting .mov files are on<br />
page 42 of the following .pdf document<br />
"Exporting Files with QuickTime Pro".<br />
<br />
QuickTime 7.6 User Guide<br />
<a href="http://images.apple.com/quicktime/pdf/QuickTime7_6_User_Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://images.apple.com/quicktime/pdf/QuickTime7_6_User_Guide.pdf</a><br />
<br />
Or...you could use the following freeware to<br />
convert the .mov files to the .avi format and<br />
import them into Windows Movie Maker for<br />
combining into a single .wmv or .avi video file.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)</p>
<p>Pazera Free MOV to AVI Converter<br />
<a href="http://www.pazera-software.com/products/mov-to-avi-converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pazera-software.com/products/mov-to-avi-converter/</a><br />
(click the Blue download button not the Red one)<br />
<br />
The name of the file you are downloading is:<br />
"Pazera_Free_MOV_to_AVI_Converter.zip"<br />
<br />
After downloading...unzip and open the program...<br />
(no installation required)<br />
<br />
Drag/Drop one or more .mov files...<br />
<br />
Choose an Output Directory...<br />
<br />
Select...AVI - Video Codec - WMV version 1 (WMP 7)...<br />
<br />
Convert...(the button is on the upper toolbar)<br />
<br />
When the file is converted...you can edit it in<br />
Windows Movie Maker. Just open Movie Maker<br />
and go to...File / Import into Collections...and<br />
browse to your converted file.</p>
<p>Also the freeware Format Factory may be worth a try:</p>

(FWIW...when installing...you may want to uncheck<br />
'all' of the boxes on the final screen)<br />
<br />
After downloading and installing Format Factory...<br />
open the program and choose an Output Folder...<br />
(this is where you will find your files after they are<br />
converted)<br />
<br />
Drag/drop your .mov video clips onto the<br />
main screen...<br />
<br />
Select 'All to WMV' / OK...<br />
<br />
Click...Start...on the toolbar...<br />
<br />
That should do it...</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Play and Charge USB Wire is not charging my controller</h2>
                    
<p>I just thought the controller needed to be charged so I use the usb wire and I hook it in the controller and no red light comes on it or anything I take the wire out and plug it into a different one and it doesn't work the Xbox turns on fine it's the controller
 that does nothing when I push the middle button on the controller it spins a green circle around and goes off so I have no clue why my controller is not charging.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It sounds like the wire/cord has gone bad. You may have put a kink in it or perhaps pinched it with something. I think you'll have to look for a replacement.</p>

<h2>            With Office 365, can you hide a Distribution List from Skype chat, but keep it in the GAL for email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A user in my company is asking if it's possible to keep a Distribution List in the GAL for email, but to hide it from Skype for Business so that it can't be used for chat?&nbsp; We use Office 365 for email/Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked, but didn't see any info for this specific situation.&nbsp; Also, we are limited with Powershell Exchange commands since we do not have an on-prem Exchange server.</p>

<p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you cannot prevent the distribution list searched by the users in the Skype for Business Search bar. So, it's not feasible to achieve it.
