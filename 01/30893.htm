Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can only use System Restore if there is already a restore point with a date prior to&nbsp;when the problem started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore takes a snapshot of the system on the date that it is created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot change the date of an existing restore point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So why does it say "choose the restore point that you want to use"? There's even an option to choose another restore point but the problem is that nothing happens when I click that. All the tutorials I have read that explains this procedure are referring
 to that option. &nbsp;What's the point in this feature if all I can do is accept ONE restore date? Seems to be a rather meaningless tool if the purpose is to restore the system back to before my problems started.

<p>My problems started after an automatic Windows update, when I came back to the computer I suddenly couldn't start Opera or any PDF file cause I received cooltype.dll errors all over the place. I then tried to re-install Opera (as suggested in the error message)
 with no luck. So thanks to Windows update I am not updated with a bunch of new errors. Thanks Windows.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

You have some basic misunderstanding of the function of System Restore and the answer Ronnie Vernon gave you.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>System Restore is a point-in-time snapshot of the system state.&nbsp; It's date/time is when that snapshot was made.&nbsp; It's no different than a photograph taken on 3-22-2013 @ 5PM --&gt; that's the time and date it was taken.&nbsp; You can have several system restore
 points (one a day or one is made before certain installations, etc.)&nbsp; You get to choose one of these when using system restore to go back to that 'point in time'.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Just like writing the wrong date on the back of a printed photo doesn't make it true it was taken on that written down date and time - changing the date on a system restore file would do nothing.&nbsp; If that is even what you were attempting to do - which I
 am unsure of.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now - System Restore *can* be corrupted for various reasons and not work.&nbsp; Unfortunately - most people only discover this when they NEED to use System Restore.&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p><br />
Ronnie Vernon thought you were trying to change the date on a given system restore to another date - which would accomplish NOTHING even if it was possible.&nbsp; If you were not trying to change the date - then that assumption was incorrect - but based off what
 you wrote... so that's just a misunderstanding if it is so.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>It's&nbsp;possible your System Restore point(s) are corrupted.&nbsp; If there is nothing happening when you choose one and you are following the correct steps (documented many places - including the video I linked to) then the chances are greater.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>As far as your question, "Whats the point in this feature if all I can do is accept ONE restore date? Seems to be that its rather meaningless." &lt;-- if all you see is ONE restore point - something erased other restore points or you are not following the instructions
 or you don't have room for more than one, etc.&nbsp; Most people have more than one and you could make them on your own too.</p>

Actually - that is exactly one purpose of backups.&nbsp; A good backup procedure is NOT just your data but the system state as well.

            <p>When reading the Windows guides it clearly says that I can choose any restore date that I like to be able to restore from whatever date I think will solve my problem. "Choose a different restore point." Again, if a restore concept doesnt work non linear
 it kinda looses its value like 90%. The errors started before the date that Windows shows me as default in the restore dialog box. And when it says&nbsp; "Choose a different restore point" I guess the reason is what I just explained. Whats the reason for having
 that option if it wouldnt make any difference?!&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I dont know if its corrupted or not but I have scanned the disk with a malware scanner and my anti virus tool (Avast!) with nothing found. The only thing I can't open is Opera and PDF files (as far as I know so far) and all this suddenly started after Windows
 updated the system automaticly while I was sleeping. So, that makes this a very bad update. All it updated was the amount of errors I have to struggle with. So I guess this is a clear message to me saying: Go back to the carefree days of the Mac. Cause thats
 what Im going to do. No more of this, Ive had it.</p>

Let's go back to basics again...</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>System restore is like having an archive of physical photographs.&nbsp; These photographs are stored in a box that, for sake of argument, can only hold (again - this number is meaningless other than an example) 10 of the photographs at any given time.&nbsp; If you
 take two photos a day (6AM and 6PM) and store them in the box - in five days, the box is full.&nbsp; You want newer photos more than you want older (assumption) so you - on the 6th day - remove two photos and replace them with the two new ones from that day.&nbsp; You
 repeat this process every day.&nbsp; In the end you have 10 photos you can review in that box at any given time (and for the sake of argument - you burned the photos you removed from the box immediately.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So - if you wanted to look at a photo from&nbsp;7 days back - you cannot.&nbsp; It does not exist.&nbsp; If you wanted to look at a photo you took 3 days back - that should be no problem - unless you decided one day to take 10 pictures manually and replace all of them
 in the box with the ones from that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>So - you are interpretting the "any restore date" too literally.&nbsp; With your interpretation, I should be able to even choose a restore point from another computer. heh&nbsp; Not likely to happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If the photo (system restore point) doesn't exist - you cannot choose it.&nbsp; The number of restore points are limited by many factors (settings you can change, size of your hard drive, realistic things.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you think going back to Apple resolves your issues without causing any different ones - more power to you.&nbsp; Having dealt with Windows, Apple and Linux for many years now - I have not found that to be true. heh</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>A densely plotted account of the life and crimes of Richard Kuklinski, who murdered more than 100 people before he was apprehended in 1986, The Iceman is a vivid evocation of a remorseless sociopath sustaining a double life as a contract killer and devoted
 family man. Gritty, gripping and unrelentingly intense, Ariel Vromen’s film boasts richly detailed character work from an ideal cast. But the driving force is Michael Shannon in the title role, showing yet again that he can explore the darkness within like
 few actors working today.</b></p>
<p>
<b><br />
</b><b>There’s considerable overlap here with crime sagas from Goodfellas to The Sopranos, and though his film is certainly not quite up there with the classics of Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola, Vromen paints from his own palette. In tone, The Iceman
 perhaps most closely resembles the early work of James Gray in its neo-noir edginess and contagious fascination with the dourest and most dangerous of milieus. One of its most bracing characteristics, established from the outset, is the fluid juxtaposition
 of tenderness and violence.</b></p>
<p>
<b><br />
</b><b>The screenplay, by Morgan Land and Vromen, was based on a fictionalized book by Anthony Bruno and on James Thebaut’s 1992 HBO documentary, The Iceman Tapes: Conversations With a Killer. That source is reflected in a framing device in which the aged,
 bearded Kuklinski responds to questions in prison, with Shannon looking like a fine-grained Rembrandt drawing in the half-light.</b></p>

<p>
<b>The duality of Polish-American Richie’s existence is illustrated right off the bat during his first date, in Jersey City in 1964, with his future wife, virtuous Catholic girl Deborah Pellicotti (Winona Ryder). She coaxes Richie through his conversational
 reticence to declare shyly, “You’re a prettier version of Natalie Wood.” The sweetness of that scene invests us instantly in the film’s central relationship. A barroom interlude follows in which a pool player aggravates Richie, who calmly slits his throat
 in the back alley afterward, suggesting this is far from the first time he has killed.</b></p>
<p>
<b><br />
</b><b>Richie convinces Deborah that he works dubbing Disney films, but he actually bootlegs ****. Before long he gets on the personal payroll of steely unaffiliated gangster Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta), who admires his ability to keep cool while staring
 down the barrel of a gun. After testing his loyalty by having him dispatch a homeless guy, Roy hires Richie to watch his back, collect debts and “send messages.” As Richie and Deborah’s family grows with the birth of two daughters in the Jersey suburbs, his
 emotionless efficiency carrying out kills is expertly chronicled.</b></p>
<p>
<b><br />
</b><b>Here and elsewhere, the work of editor Danny Rafic is hypnotic in weaving together the separate strands of Richie’s personal and professional life, underscoring the radical contrast between them.</b></p>
<p>
<b><br />
</b><b>When Roy’s filial-like minion Josh Rosenthal (David Schwimmer) angers rival mob families by robbing and taking out drug couriers during an exchange, Roy comes under pressure from their mediator Leo Marks (Robert Davi). This indirectly puts Richie in
 an awkward position that ends with him being shut out of the operation and unable to continue providing for his oblivious family, who think he’s in finance.</b></p>
<p>
<b><br />
</b><b>Land and Vromen’s script delves into intriguing details in the developments that follow, when Richie teams up with another free-agent killer, Dutch-Irish Robert Pronge (a stringy-haired, virtually unrecognizable Chris Evans), whose cover is running a
 Mr. Freezy ice-cream truck. They begin using cyanide spray as an undetectable murder method, freezing the bodies to dump later, mutilating them to fit the profile of an existing serial killer. In one memorable scene, Richie carries out a hit by employing just
 a strategic cough on a crowded disco dance floor, accompanied on the soundtrack by Blondie.</b></p>
<p>
<b><br />
</b><b>However, when Roy becomes aware that Richie is back in the game, he closes in, for the first time compromising the safety of his former henchman's beloved family.</b></p>
<p>
<b><br />
</b><b>Vromen’s handle on this incident-packed story is unerring, with cinematographer Bobby Bukowski bathing the world in grim, chiaroscuro shadow and bled-out, murky colors that conjure the environment and the time -- from the 1960s through the mid-‘80s --
 with arresting yet visually unfussy style. The gracefulness and composure of the camerawork even through some of the more volatile action shows highly assured craftsmen at work. Production designer Nathan Amondson and costumer Donna Zakowska’s understated
 period reconstruction is similarly focused. Another invaluable contribution is Haim Mazar’s score, which molds a sense of unpredictable violence and dread without drawing undue attention to itself.</b></p>

<h2>            Cursor hides behind some &#40;not all&#41; menus</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 I have noticed an annoying problem with my cursor. &nbsp;It works fine for nearly everything. &nbsp;The problem is that for some menus (like the New Notification menu) or some other pop-up menus the cursor hides behind the menu. &nbsp;You
 can't see the cursor and have to "feel around" until the part of the menu you want to use changes color. &nbsp;How can I keep my cursor on top at all times?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse. &nbsp;I have checked the drivers and they are all up to date.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Money Sunset Deluxe crashes in Windows 10 if ofx file has been imported</h2>
                    <p>Under Windows 10, Money Sunset Deluxe crashes once an ofx file has been imported.&nbsp; The import works but then the app crashes and it will not stay running unless I restore a backup from before the import was run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that someone has a solution for this issue.&nbsp; I hate manually entering all of my transactions.</p>

First thing to do is to check its Vista Compatibility at the above link, and if not see what patches/solutions are available from its Manufacturer..</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If it is Vista Compatible:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Use the Program below to uninstall it, if you have a prior or corrupted version installed..</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Once you do that, redownload/save it to the Desktop &gt; right-click on its setup.exe &gt; Run as Admin</span></p>

 you to uninstall software and remove unwanted programs installed on your computer even if you have problems uninstalling and cannot uninstall them from "Windows Add or Remove Programs" control panel applet.<br />
<br />
Revo Uninstaller is a much faster and more powerful alternative to "Windows Add or Remove Programs" applet!<br />
<br />
With its advanced and fast algorithm, Revo Uninstaller analyzes an application's data before uninstall and scans after you uninstall an application. After the program's regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry
 keys that are usually left”</span></p>

<p>La possibilità di includere contenuti multimediali è un privilegio ed una novità per i forum xbox. Ecco le linee guida per utilizzare immagini e video nei propri post e nella firma:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Immagini e Video nei Post:</b></p>
<p>- Niente contenuti offensivi. Nel dubbio, non postare. La decisione dei Moderatori è inappellabile.</p>
<p>- I contenuti non devono violare le <a href="http://www.xbox.com/it-IT/Legal/LiveTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Condizioni di Utilizzo</a> ed il Codice di Condotta.</p>
<p>- Una sola immagine per post. Fa eccezione il forum di supporto (in lingua inglese) se l'intento è fornire dettagli su un problema tecnico.</p>
<p>- Larghezza massima 600 pixel.</p>
<p>- In caso di nudità, contenuti estremamente offensivi come razzismo, spam, hijacking di thread (il fatto di sviare volontariamente una discussione verso l'off-topic) la punizione potrà essere estesa anche al di fuori dei forum di Xbox.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Immagini della Firma:</b></p>
<p>- Si applicano le stesse regole di cui sopra.</p>
<p>- Niente immagini .GIF animate</p>
<p>- altezza massima 125 pixel (ci potrà essere della flessibilità se si sfora di pochi pixel). Questa regola esiste per prevenire l'hijacking di thread tramite firme troppo evidenti. I Moderatori hanno la facoltà di modificare le firme degli utenti. Perseverare
 nell'infrangere le regole potrà essere causa di ban.</p>
<p>- Non è permesso l'uso dei loghi ufficiali Xbox, Xbox LIVE o Microsoft - Questi loghi sono marchi registrati di Microsoft Corporation, che ne detiene tutti i diritti. Apprezziamo il fatto che molti di voi vogliano mostrare il proprio amore per Xbox, ma un
 logo ufficiale nella firma potrebbe erroneamente suggerire che rappresentiate ufficialmente Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come per ogni altro comportamento rude o offensivo che vada contro le Condizioni di Utilizzo ed il Codice di Condotta, vi invitiamo ad usare l'apposita funzione di report anche per immagini e video, in modo che il team di Moderazione possa agire di conseguenza.</p>

<h2>            Seagate HDD with third party Enclosure</h2>
                    Hi, I have a Seagate Barracuda LP ST31000520AS 5900.12 SATA 3GB/s 1000GB (1TB) 32 Cache (OEM) with a MediaSonic HD6-SU2 Smart Drive 3.5 Sata External Driver Enclosure.<br />
I just purchased the these two products and tried to connect it to my system<br />
However Vista can't find the driver?<br />
I went to Seagate followed the instructions to manually install drivers -- by selecting C:\Windows and sub folders but could still not find driver.<br />
I checked the power supply and USB connector and the drive in the enclosure -- everything checked out.<br />
I have a 32 bit dell operating system, Intel Core 2 and 2 Gigs of ram

<p><span>Hey
<span><span>charlie_brown52,&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In addition to the excellent suggestions made by Syed
 V, I have <span>few suggestions<strong> </strong></span>for you:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.</span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Try connecting the hard disk to another computer and see if ‘</span></span><strong><span>Seagate
 Barracuda LP ST31000520AS 5900.12 SATA 3GB/s 1000GB (1TB) 32 Cache (OEM)</span></strong><span>’
<span>it</span> gets detected <span>on<strong> </strong>the<strong>
</strong></span>other Computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>Try to</span></span><span><span>
 connect the </span></span><strong><span>Seagate Barracuda LP ST31000520AS 5900.12 SATA 3GB/s 1000GB (1TB) 32 Cache (OEM)</span></strong><span>
 hard disk directly to the motherboard <span>and check if it gets detected.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>If yes, there may be an issue with MediaSonic HD6-SU2 Smart Drive 3.5 Sata External Driver Enclosure.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>In that case you
<span>may</span> have to contact MediaSonic.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the hard disk
<span>is not detected after connecting to the motherboard directly</span>, the issue may be with
<span>the hard disk itself</span>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may contact Seagate, in that case.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<br />
If it's an hardware issue. we can't help with that. <br />
<br />

<h3> windows8er  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visual C&#43;&#43; Redistributable Not Installing Correctly</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Recently when I tried to launch Avid Sibelius, it would not create a window but the RAM usage would simply ascend until my computer froze up completely. I have contacted Avid's support and when they tried a reinstall, the installer
 attempted to install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2017 (x64) - 14.14.26405. It failed with a dialog box that claimed that "The feature you are looking for is on a network resource that is unavailable", and asking for a location for the "vc_runtimeMinimum_x64.msi",
 pointing to the ProgramData folder and a subfolder entitled a long hexadecimal string. If I press the cancel button, it then makes another box that says "The older version of Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 x64 Minimum Runtime - 14.14.26405 cannot be removed. Contact
 your technical support group." Pressing "OK" ends the installation with a failure 0x80070643 - Fatal error during installation.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">To me there seems to be three errors that seem disconnected, and I do not know why any of them are occuring. How could a Microsoft-provided MSI file be missing components to install itself? On a Windows 10 machine? The only other
 versions of Microsoft Visual C++ I have installed are 2008 and 2010, having uninstalled 2015 to attempt to fix the problem, and being unsuccessful. I don't want to uninstall those older versions unless it will fix the problem because they might be for programs
 that would then stop working. Does anyone know about these errors?</p>

            I have solved the problem by using the Microsoft Install/Uninstall troubleshooter. I uninstalled all versions of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 14.14.25008, which I realized did not show up in the Control Panel Programs listing. The Avid program
 I was trying to install has installed. Thank you for your replies.

            1. Can you try to reset your Skype on Kindle or try to uninstall and reinstall this.
<br />
<br />2. As long as you are signing in with same login ID, the address would be same. If you get a call on one device, you get a call on other devices also as long as they use the same login.

    <title>Bluetooth Headphones connection quality on Surface Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonarhack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Headphones connection quality on Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>I have my power beats wireless headphones connected to my surface pro 3 with Windows 8.1 Pro. The audio quality is poor in two ways: 1 - There are occasional bursts of static, 2 - The frequency range is limited, almost as if it is tweaked for telephone quality
 conversations. I've checked the driver and it is the Microsoft driver bth.inf version 6.3.9600.17901 dated 6/21/2006. When selecting Update Driver, the tool tells me I have the most updated driver (which seems a bit odd, since it's now 10 yeas old).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to improve this experience?</p>

<br />If you go to search and type control panel and open that.
<br />Then top right set it to category view.
<br />Go to Programs
<br />Programs and Features
<br />Turn Windows Features on or off.  Is this what you are looking for?

<br />For language packs go to Start - Settings(cogwheel) - Time and Language - Region and Language - add a language.

    <title>Windows XP Firewall turn off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cos_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP Firewall turn off</h2>
                    <p>In my 2005 Gateway Windows XP after running MSE, MS Safety Scanner, MS Malious Software Removal Tool, MalwareBytes (set to only turn on manually).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task bar Indicators show my firewall consistantly turns itself off about 45 seconds after start up, then turns back on about 30 seconds after start up.&nbsp; (I note the firewall controls are frozen before it turns off, so it may be off from the start, it just
 takes about 45 seconds for the PC to detect it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firewall setting link is non-functional (unknown error)&nbsp;while&nbsp;firewall is off and prior to it tuning off.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I hit the main firewall on button toggle arrow, it seems to turn back on (unless it is somehow turning itself back on at about the same time, on numerous attempts).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, If I do not try to turn firewall back on, afteranother&nbsp;30 seconds from when firewall turns off, the firewall turns turns back on, by itself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once firewall is back up, full firewall settings link works and firewall&nbsp;"appear" functional.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;unchecked all exceptions, which remain unchecked.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Side note you can skip: My Kodak ESP 5 printer scanner created about 6 exceptions,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firewall problem occured before and after various scans listed above.&nbsp; Prior to any other type of security software install.&nbsp; So far only MSE and MalwareBytes.&nbsp; I have run the McAffee removal tool a few times, McAfee is the only other security software ever
 used on this, and it was long, long ago ~ 2005</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Fix it 9810866 (which is microsofts fix for this problem in XP) will not run !&nbsp; Other people have noted it will not run in other firewall posts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a system restore feature on this Gateway model, but if it doesn't work, I have no way to get it running as cheapo Gateway did not provide the original Windows (or driver) disks (I'f I had known this, I'd not have bought PC, never buy a PC without
 Windows and driver disks).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know another fixit link or&nbsp;other manual fix than the none functioning Microsoft Fix it 9810866.</p>

<p>In my 2005 Gateway Windows XP after running MSE, MS Safety Scanner, MS Malious Software Removal Tool, MalwareBytes (set to only turn on manually).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firewall turns on in start up (I have seen it in the security center), then firewall&nbsp;turns off about 30 seconds after what appears to be the end of start up.&nbsp; The firewall setting link is non-functional (unknown error)&nbsp;while it is off.&nbsp; When I hit the main
 firewall on button toggle arrow, it seems to turn back on (unless it is somehow turning itself back on at about the same time, on numerous attempts).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once firewall is back up, full firewall settings link works and firewall&nbsp;"appear" functional.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;unchecked all exceptions, which remain unchecked.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>{Side note you can skip: My Kodak ESP 5 printer scanner created about 6 exceptions, I would never buy another kodak product (unlike claims the ink costs are through the roof, a cartridge lasts for a dozen prints, if color is low, printer will not let you
 print in black and white, if color cartridge removed printer will not print in black and white, that with firewall exceptions, worst printer ever).&nbsp; }</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firewall problem occured before and after various scans listed above.&nbsp; Prior to any other type of security software install.&nbsp; So far only MSE and MalwareBytes.&nbsp; I have run the McAffee removal tool a few times, McAfee is the only other security software ever
 used on this, and it was long, long ago ~ 2005</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Fix it 9810866 (which is microsofts fix for this problem in XP) will not run !&nbsp; Other people have noted it will not run in other firewall posts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a system restore feature on this Gateway model, but if it doesn't work, I have no way to get it running as cheapo Gateway did not provide the original Windows (or driver) disks (I'f I had known this, I'd not have bought PC, never buy a PC without
 Windows and driver disks).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know another fixit link or&nbsp;other manual fix than the none functioning Microsoft Fix it 9810866.</p>

<strong>(1)</strong>if you dont have another firewall product installed,&nbsp; this could be due to malware or some other problem...<br />
<br />
if you have an antivirus solution, up date its definitions, and do a full system scan..
<br />
<br />
If you dont have a antivirus solution or your one is not working, use one of the recommended tools

            HI Joseph
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button type wmp and hit Enter to open Windows Media Player
<br />
<br />1.
<br />
<br />One Time change needs to be made to Windows Media Player:
<br />
<br />At the top of Windows Media Player, click Tools - Options
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, choose the Rip Music Tab
<br />
<br />ON that Tab, change the format to MP3 and set a bitrate
<br />
<br />Save that and close that dialog
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />
<br />Insert a CD
<br />
<br />It may begin to play, stop that and then at the top ,Click Rip CD
<br />
<br />That's It
