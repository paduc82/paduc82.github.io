    <title>Fix access denied issue of roaming profiles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azwan a.s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fix access denied issue of roaming profiles</h2>
                    
<p>I took ownership of users shared home folder to Administrators group. This is because I'm having errors migrating them to new drive, "Access Denied" although I'm using an admin account. Soon after some but not all users are having denied access to their
 own profile. I know that Windows 2003 and WIndows XP determines if the roaming profile folder exists and that either the user or the Administrators group is the owner of the folder. But since the ownership belong to administrator, should it allow the users
 to logon? Or does it compares to the copy of the local profiles and if let say some of the profile ownership belong to the users it will deny them.</p>
<p>To fix this should I creates script using icalcs and give all users back permission to their profiles? Since I don't know for sure either user or administrator have ownership to the profiles folder previously.</p>

    <title>Turning Off PC changes behavior of graphic card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> answersprofileidentity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turning Off PC changes behavior of graphic card</h2>
                    <p>Dec 28 2017 - - the latest Win 10 upgrade has affected 1 PC's graphic card.&nbsp; This PC has a dual monitor set up.&nbsp; I have narrowed it down to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;* If one turns off the PC by pressing and holding the power button - - then the next time the PC is turned on everything is ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;* If one turns off the PC using the normal software Off at the Windows icon - - then the next time the PC is turned on only 1 monitor is alive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to note that the single monitor situation: the monitor that is alive is not the primary monitor - meaning that it doesn't have the desktop icons for one but more importantly anything selected from specialty keys or the Windows icon can't be seen because
 they always open initially in the primary monitor.&nbsp; So in this mode I'm not able to negotiate to task manager or settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone has suggested that it sounds like the software Off is only putting it to sleep.&nbsp; But I don't know to what extent this is a key to a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All worked okay for years until now and while I do have this hard turn off as a work around, would welcome advice on returning to the normal software off method.</p>

            Well, the power button method is an improper shutdown. Why would you shut it down that way? I know you can press the power button once and it will default to whatever the Power Options are set for. But holding down the power button until it powers off is not the right way to do it. Since, anything that was in memory would not be saved. You proved that when you properly shutdown from within Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem?
<br />How long has this been happening?
<br />Have you installed any new software or hardware drivers since you started experience this problem? If so, what are they and are they designed for Windows 10?
<br />Have you checked the manufacturers website or contact support find out about compatibility, updates or support for Windows 10?
<br />Do you have a system restore point created you could go back to? 
<br />Does the problem occur in other user accounts on the computer?
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703, 1709?
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?
<br />
<br />Awaiting your reply.

            Hi, Windows 10 Shutdown does in fact use a kind of Hibernate function . . .
<br />
<br />Windows 10 uses Fast Startup, which means the state of Windows is written to the Hard Drive and then read back when you start your PC.
<br />
<br />What you could try is disabling Fast Boot and see if this resolves this issue for you
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Power Options
<br />On the left click 'Choose what the Power Buttons Do'
<br />At the top click 'Change Settings that are currently unavailable'
<br />At the bottom uncheck 'Turn on Fast Startup'
<br />Click Save Changes
<br />
<br />Shut your System Down
<br />
<br />Start your System again, are both monitors working?

            In the start menu, go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power and Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what the power buttons do. 
<br />
<br />See what the various optoins show.  Let us know.  Personally I have everything set to sleep, it is faster for starting the next time.
<br />
<br />Back to your video problem.  I have a similar setup, laptop with a 4k external monitor that I've defined to be the #1 monitor. If I start the computer with the external powered off, the desktop defaults over to the laptop screen.
<br />
<br />Next time the problem happens, try unplugging the video cable from the laptop. That may be enough to nudge the system to move all of the display to the other monitor. 
<br />
<br />If that doesnt' work, try right clicking on the desktop, select display settings. If the dialog opens on the hidden monitor use the &lt;WIn&gt;&lt;Arrow&gt; key to move the dialog onto your screen. From there you can set it to be the primary display.

<p>Here is more info:</p>
<p>&nbsp;* did a soft off</p>
<p>&nbsp;* next start same behavior as original post: 1 monitor awake and is not the primary</p>
<p>&nbsp;* as you suggested - I opened Status screen (which opened in the asleep primary monitory) but then did a Win + arrow to move the settings screen to the awake monitor. &nbsp; this worked, thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;* in System / Display 'Multiple Displays' was optioned 'Extend these displays' - I changed that to 'Show only on 2' (the asleep monitor) - this awakened the monitor &amp; at the same time the system gives me a 'keep or revert' option - - I then selected revert
 and now both monitors work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's all pretty convoluted and I feel somewhat violated by Windows 10 upgrade people.......it isn't a fix because I have to do this rigamarole each time, but at least things are more or less manageable....</p>

            OK, you can speed up the process a little using the &lt;WIN&gt;&lt;P&gt; shortcut to display the "Project" pane to allow you to reset your multiscreen display options. (Sorry, forgot abotu that that path).

<p>well I thought I was in an ok state - but todays recent boot up didn't go well: once again only the non-primary monitor alive. When I opened Settings - it opened in the asleep primary monitor and Win + arrow wouldn't move it to the alive monitor - so I was
 stuck.&nbsp; Tried also closing Settings and trying Win + p &nbsp;&nbsp; but that didn't do anything at all that I could tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So once again I did a hard/button off - then the restart - and everything works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is a hard/button off really such a bad thing?&nbsp; or is that old / past issue ? ......</p>

            Yes it can be. If you power the computer off without properly shutting windows down then yes it is bad.  Part of the Windows shutdown writes a bunch of current registry settings back to your personal profile.
<br />
<br />But looking in the Win 10 Power button options it looks like there is no absolute power off, so I guess that old concern has been handled for the most part.
<br />
<br />From your earlier reply I am not clear what your power button setting is. Take a look and let us know.

<p>as essentially I have no choice but to do the hard/button off - - I will be very careful that all apps are totally closed before doing it.</p>

            Sorry, I didn't recognize it. Since I have a laptop I have more options. 
<br />
<br />So your power button does a controlled shutdown of Windows.  It is safe and when you restart you are starting with a "fresh" windows session, unlike if you set it to sleep or hibernate (which is what I have).  Restarting the computer is often a good trouble shooting step for that very reason.  If Windows code running in RAM "gets confused", restarting gets rid of that confusion. 
<br />
<br />Closing all of the applications before shutting down is a good idea. In the Fall creators update MS added an "improvement" that automagically restarts any applications you had open at shutdown. That has been confusing some people, plus it delays the restart.

    <title>Windows 10 failure to install from USB media - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cordrw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 failure to install from USB media</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a follow up to a prior question via reply I posted November 30 2016 here https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/584819c5-ed48-4e28-b9bc-3d4ab51e19ed for which I did not get an answer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Briefly, I could not login to Windows 10 because the password box was missing nor could I boot into Safe Mode. Since this was a free MS online upgrade from Win7, I did not have access to installation media. I installed Linux instead and have been running
 Fedora until yesterday when I decided to re-install Windows 7 to see if I could get the OS back running. Unfortunately I made a mistake by trying to install the wrong version (64 bit) on a 32 bit system so that didn't work out. I purchased and downloaded a
 new version of Win10 from my institution's volume licensing site, onto a USB drive. After rebooting from the USB, I chose Custom Install and got the following screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb19223f-ff34-4295-b1c7-650fdc2535bd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb19223f-ff34-4295-b1c7-650fdc2535bd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted all of the partitions to create unallocated space on the hard drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc8cfc3d-e493-4d5b-9f2e-43a6eb7d88d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc8cfc3d-e493-4d5b-9f2e-43a6eb7d88d7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try installing Win10 from the USB, Windows Setup proceeds normally posting green checks for all steps but upon rebooting (after removing the USB) it seems to have failed:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c81c91ba-a3b1-4acd-9baa-8c0e63e4106c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c81c91ba-a3b1-4acd-9baa-8c0e63e4106c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I leave the USB in, Windows repeats the installation process ad infinitum but each time it fails. I tried Repair/Troubleshooting options but none of these work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone here who might know what is the problem? The device is a Lenovo T500 laptop in good running condition showing no sign of hardware defects so I would like to get it back running Windows 10 if that is possible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, </p>
<p>Cord</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>32 bit, 3G RAM, 300G HD, Intel processor w/ NVIDIA 1G graphics card, factory Win7 installation. The system performed great until ~3 months after upgrading to Win10 when login screen vanished. The rest happened as described above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation goes smoothly through Setup, then reboots to 'finish the installation' whereupon it repeats the installation if the USB is still in, or if not it boots and I get the 'could not complete installation' message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I created the USB media, Win10 system requirements listed 32 or 64 bit system but didn't ask which when creating the media, so I assume Win10 auto detects your hardware config and installs the correct version??</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is undoubtedly a log with more detail which could be matched up with that symptom.&nbsp; Try Setupact.log&nbsp; (for a guess).&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise you seem to be doing a "<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">clean
 install</a>", so have you saved your W7 drivers somewhere?&nbsp; Also, your previous posts mentioned Linux so I'm wondering if its boot manager could have been the cause of your original problems on the login screen.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here it shows an "X" partition that Windows created. Changing directory to C:\ it returns X:\Sources</p>
<p>When I type cd C:\windows\system32 the path is undefined. Further, the 'Use another operating system' option produces the following:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here it shows four instances of Windows 10 on volume 2! Choosing any one of these causes the system to reboot Windows Setup from USB.&nbsp; Same result with 'Continue using installed system' option.&nbsp; Diagnostic scan of the HD shows all well:</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. Here is a list of volumes:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02dbe76a-c7c0-48c3-9725-512629a5b641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02dbe76a-c7c0-48c3-9725-512629a5b641" /></a></p>
<p>Volumes 1 and 2 are created during Setup. Vol 2 'E' is the partition where I tell Setup to install Windows,
 listed as the Primary partition in Setup. There is no 'X'&nbsp; volume listed here so I don't know what that is. Entering cd E:\windows\system32 , returns X:\Sources&gt;</p>

</p><p>X: is a RAM disk, so Diskpart may not need to know about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two steps to changing a directory from another volume.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick the volume, e.g. in this case enter:&nbsp; E:</p>
<p>and pick the directory&nbsp;e.g. using the CD command.&nbsp; You can do it in the opposite order too.&nbsp; There may also be a /d switch you could use to do both at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; It helps to have used DOS on a multi disk system.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

</p>
<p>Components Updates must be repaired - One or more components are configured incorrectly.&nbsp;Will the fix above correct my issues?</p>

<h2>            File Explorer freezes after downloading and &#34;saving&#34; Microsoft files from internet</h2>
                    <p>I <span>have encountered a problem with File Explorer that seems to be either a glitch with Windows10 or a problem with the original installation</span>. While I have found a<span> successful workaround the troubling</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">behavior,
 I would like to know its cause and correct this if possible, in hopes of avoiding other related problems.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the background: I am new to Windows10, having steadfastly avoided all editions after Window7Pro until now. I received my computer new (not refurbished) from Dell, with Windows10Pro preinstalled. I completed all updates prior to any personalization.
 In setup, I (reluctantly) opted for the Microsoft Account login, which is currently my only User Account. I installed MSOffice Professional2013 from installation disk and activated the license without problems.&nbsp; I then downloaded and "saved" a group a files
 (PDF's, Excel and Word docs) that I need for a project I am working on. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem: if I "touch" any of the saved Microsoft files in File Explorer (to move or open) - File Explorer freezes (stops responding).
<span>There are (of course) </span><span>n<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">o problems with the PDF files.
<span>There are (of course) </span><span>n<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">o problems with the PDF files.
</span></span>Once File Explorer stops responding, no amount of waiting seems to change this. I can close and reopen it without any apparent problems, but get the same unresponsive state if I touch one of the MS files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found two ways to work around this problem: (1) Start Excel or Word, then open the file that I had saved, or (2)
<span>Re-download and then "Open" rather than "Save. In both cases, I get the normal warning when opening about files from the internet, asking if I want to enable editing.&nbsp; When I say yes, I am able to save the files to my hard drive and work with

<p><span>Once again, I am hoping to learn the cause of this problem and appropriate correction.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>If it is a known glitch with Windows10, I can only hope it will be corrected soon. If is a problem with the original installation, I hope to gather enough insight to make an informed complaint to the seller (Dell)
 to help me with a clean install.</span></span></p>

            Hi, JaneGeographer
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow 
<br />

<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<br />
There is no way to set printer margins in Windows Live Mail.<br />
<br />
As a workaround please follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Launch Internet Explorer. <br />
2. Select <i>File | Page Setup...</i> from the menu.&nbsp;"You may have to hold down the
<i>Alt</i> key to see the menu"<br />
3. Adjust the margins (under <i>Margins</i>) and page orientation (under <i>Orientation</i>) to your liking.
<br />
4. Click <i>OK</i>. <br />
<br />
Let us know the result.<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<h2>            Surface Book&#47;Surface Dock mini-DP port not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello dear community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is the first time that I ask a question in a forum like this because normally I can find all the answers to my questions on google or forums like this but not with my current problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My setup:</strong></p>
<p>Surface Book (manufacturer number: CR7-00014)</p>
<p>Surface Docking Station (man. nr.: <span>PD9-00004)</span></p>
<p><span>Asus VS278Q <strong>or </strong>Samsung </span>U28E590D (man. nr.: LU28E590DS/EN)</p>
<p>Available adapters/Cables:</p>
<p>- Active mini-DP to HDMI adapter (man. nr.: CAC-1070</p>
<p>- Microsoft mini-DP to HDMI adapter 1553</p>
<p>- HDMI 2.0 or 1.4</p>
<p>- mini-DP to DP cable 1.4</p>
<p class="contentStandard">- Plugable <span>USB 3.0 Dual 4K HDMI 2.0 Adapter (man. nr.:
</span>USB3-6950-HDMI<span>)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>My problem:</strong></p>
<p>Since I've bought my Surface Book 1.5 years ago, I've never been able to connect a external monitor through my mini-DP port. In the assumption that my mini-DP port was defective, I've bought a Surface Docking Station and tried to connect through one of those
 two mini-DP. Same result - no secondary monitor detected.</p>
<p>When I connect it with the Plugable adapter and the HMDI cable, the monitor receives a signal but I can't work with it because there is too much lag as the Windows Driver Foundation is eating around 40% of my CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I've tried so far:</strong></p>
<p>General:</p>
<p>- Installing newest Windows Updates</p>
<p><span>- And yes I've checked the display settings on my monitor and if the cables are plugged in correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>- Tried connecting the Surface Book directly to one of the monitors by using either the mini-DP to DP cable or the active mini-DP to HDMI adapter with the HDMI cable. Also tried the same with the Surface Docking Station.</span></p>
<p><span>- Tried my setup (Monitor and Surface Docking Station) with another Surface Book - It worked perfectly</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Display adapters:</p>
<p>- Updated the two display adapters with the newest drivers available (Intel HD Graphics 520 (Driverdate: 23.09.2017, Driverversion: 22.20.16.4811), NVIDIA GeForce GPU (23.01.2018, 23.21.13.9077)</p>
<p>- Uninstalled the display adapter drivers, rebooted my system and installed all the drivers again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface docking station:</p>
<p>- Docking Station is charging my Surface Book when plugged in and my sound system also works (connected through the 3.5mm audio port)</p>
<p><span>- Cleared the display cache by running the </span>surface dock registry.reg.</p>
<p>- Tried to update the firmware of the Surface Docking Station with the Surface Dock Update (<span>Surface_Dock_Updater_v2.12.136.0.msi) but this updater always ends prematurely.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I haven't tried so far:</strong></p>
<p>One of my last options would be a complete factory reset of my Surface in the assumption that one of the installed programs causes this problem. I do not like this option because it would cost a lot of time to install all my programs again and it is not
 guaranteed that it would work.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My questions:</strong> </p>
<p>- Does anyone has or had similar problems? Could you solve them? And if yes, how?</p>
<p>- Apart from reinstalling/updating the display adapters, what else can I do? As it is not working either with or without the Surface Docking Station, I assume that the problem lays with the Surface Book itself.</p>
<p>- Is there a possibility to reduce the amount of CPU used by the Windows Driver Foundation? If I can reduce this amount, it would be an acceptable workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help and best wishes</p>
<p>Cedric</p>

<p>Hello Cedric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your time and effort in trying to resolve the issue with your mini display port that doesn't work and we understand why you prefer not to perform a reset since it'll be a hassle to go through the installed software and data you've already stored
 on the device. An alternative solution would be by performing a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong>, to see if the problem is a result
 of a software conflict between software installed in your Surface Book and the firmware controlling the device. With regard to the high COU usage of Windows driver Foundation on your device, please check out
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-driver-foundation-high-cpu-usage-problem/d4ec0265-289f-4b84-98dc-3443b2768a26">this

<h2>            Sorting folders in the same way as files</h2>
                    When files are sorted in a folder in either ascending or descending order, all the files are arranged in alphanumeric order, however the folders are grouped together.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is really causing somebody problem because the same topic which has folder gets out of track.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>E.g. I have arranged my notes in pc as debtor 1, debtor 2, debtor 3 and debtor 4. For debtor 2, there are many files so i put all in a folder named debtor 2. Now if i sort my files and folder again. I don't see folder called debtor 2 after file named debtor
 1. The folder 2 sits at top.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#38; Microsoft Office</h2>
                    <p>I just got a Windows 10 computer and microsoft home office disk. When I download and save a PDF file and go back to open it, the document is all out of order. I received messages that say "Word will now convert your PDF into an editable document. It will
 be optomized to allow you to edit the text so it might not look exactly like the original". Then a second warning message say " This PDF contains interactive features that are not supported by PDF reflow." I've never heard this. &nbsp;Isn't there a way to keep
 the file from becoming out of order so it can be edited later?</p>

 I would have an update for Adobe, but it was pre-installed!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>__Why is my CPU overloading&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sableandwhite  say:</h3>
<h2>            __Why is my CPU overloading&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have newly upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit version. I also added a new SATA drive and a new floppy drive (needed it for a specific job). It took days to get the SATA drive working properly but it seems fine now.</p>
<p>My problem: As often as once a minute the CPU use goes to 100%. At that point everything freezes and I have to sit and wait for some of the CPU to clear. I haven't timed it but the wait is approximately 1-2 minutes. This happens apparently randomly, and
 it happens a lot.</p>
<p>I have watched the task manager's processes tab and an on screen CPU meter (a gadget). Only two processes ever go high.&nbsp;&nbsp;One is a game. The other is something called "System Idle Process".&nbsp;I have no idea what that is or what it does.</p>
<p>I am watching the Processes in Task Manager right now. To add to the confusion, the System Idle Process is up to 97 but CPU usage has remained at 1-4%.</p>
<p>Can anyone out there give me information about how to track the cause down? Please!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hello !</p>
<p>There are a number of reason why a particular process might cause this type of overload. To get the fair idea of your problem, please provide us with your computer configuration. Second if possible, please search for Hijackthis on bing and download the application.
 IT will generate a log file, Please copy and paste the log file here, so that we can analyze the issue.</p>
<p>Secondly : System Idle process is something that you need not care about, it does not cause overload to your system. While checking the Task Manager for programs/Apps causing load on your CPU, make sure to check the box at the bottom which says show process
 from all users. Now you mentioned a game ( please name it ) , other than that try booting into safe mode by press F8 at system startup and choose safe mode, and then notice if your processor still overloads.</p>
<p>You also mentioned that you have recently upgraded to windows. This means it is possible that you missed out on a particular driver to be installed. Please run windows update to resolve any pending or corrupted driver issues. you might also want to check
 out device manager, if it might show any faulty hardware ( start menu-&gt; type device manager-&gt; press enter)</p>
<p>On the other note, why did it take you days to install the harddrive ? please clear out, so that we can rule out the possiblity of either a faulty hard disk or a mis config ?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>It happens pretty much all of the time when i play when i play free skate it gets a little better but in career mode it is very noticeable. It also affects challenges due to the lag .</p>

<p>Try your disk and hard drive out on a friends xbox to see if the lagging continues. The lagging will seem less on a freeskate as there's less for the console to deal with</p>
