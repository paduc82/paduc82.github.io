    <title>Direct X Features are disabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ravimahabir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Direct X Features are disabled</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from windows XP to windows 7 and installed the drivers for my graphics card (ATI RADEON 7000 series, RV 100) which is a legacy device so AMD stopped putting forward drivers after xp. However i found one that worked using DriverMax. Under in device
 manager, my GPU is there and i get the added screen resolutions etc. However, my direct x features are still disabled. I checked the hardware acceleration, its set to max. According to the specs for my gpu, it supports up to direct x 7. Is there something
 i missed/is there a way to enable these features?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

<p>Hi Ravi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several possible factors as to why the DirectX feature is disabled even if the specs of your PC supports it. Try the methods below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Find out the DirectX version that currently installed on your PC.</strong></p>
<p>Use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to find this out. Here is a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/157730/how-to-determine-the-version-of-directx-by-using-the-directx-diagnosti" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong>
 on how to determine the version of DirectX by using the DirectX Diagnostic Tool for your reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Download and install the latest version of DirectX.</strong></p>
<p>See this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong> on how to install the latest version of DirectX and refer to the
<strong>Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2</strong> section.</p>

    <title>Upgrading an HP Phoenix from Windows 7 to 10 and it goes to a black - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hankreed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading an HP Phoenix from Windows 7 to 10 and it goes to a black screen.</h2>
                    <p>I recently had great success in upgrading my laptop to Windows 10 so I decided to try my luck and upgrade my desktop.</p>
<p>The upgrade looked normal, felt normal and took about an &nbsp;hour, give or take. &nbsp;Post upgrade when all the reboots had finished, I opened up the password panel and entered my password and the machine looked and felt normal at this time. &nbsp;I opened up a browser
 and discovered I could not type in the URL line to get to where I needed to go as the characters did not appear on screen. I can move the mouse round and click where I need to go but when I enter the characters, nothing shows up as I type nor does the cursor
 move. &nbsp;I thought back and rebooted and put in a wired keyboard. &nbsp;Same results. &nbsp;I see the cursor move at the password screen and when I hit enter, it works until I try to open anything and type. &nbsp;Browsers do not work, spreadsheets do not work, email does not
 work. In short the only places I can type anything in is when I do a control/alt /delete and task manager will pop up. &nbsp; I can open Run New Task there and what I type shows up and works. &nbsp;I called Microsoft support and we tired to roll back drivers=they did
 not update nor would they update past 2006 drivers. &nbsp;We even tried to use the monitor keyboard to enter onto a URL browser line and nope, nada, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this? &nbsp;If I can not fix it has anyone had success in rolling back to Windows 7? &nbsp;HP Phoenix gaming box about 2 years old and works well for what I use it for. &nbsp;Any thoughts? suggestions?</p>

            <p>I worked with Microsoft for a couple of hours then they referred me to HP. &nbsp;We checked all the drivers and a few other things and after a couple of hours I rolled back to Windows 7. &nbsp;The trip back was quick and easy but the Microsoft Office Suite lost its
 key code during roll back and a few other programs had some issues. &nbsp;I resolved all of those but if anyone finds a path forward, I would appreciate hearing about. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response. &nbsp;I probably could have expanded my answer but I bought a 14 day support package from HP and spent over 3 hours on the phone with them &nbsp;prior to US deciding a rollback was the right thing to do. &nbsp;I used the upgrade link provided
 from Microsoft for the upgrade and followed all the procedures and process. &nbsp;We did try the on screenkey board and that exhibited the same issues we had prior. &nbsp;We simply could not type anything anywhere as it seemed like there was a hidden error screen that
 we could not find. &nbsp;Thanks for your suggestions. I will review further and if I try again, I will let you know. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I got a new MS computer and I wanted to skype with my previous account. However, a new skype account is unfortunately (to make thinks more complicated) already preinstalled and linked to the windows account. How do I change the skype account settings without

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before the Skype migration to Microsoft, users can create a Skype account with a unique or personalized Skype Name. After the migration, users
 can use their Microsoft account for Skype. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In your case, I believe you’re signed in to a different Skype account. Probably the one linked to your original Skype account registered email
 address. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s what you’re going to do:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Check the correct Skype account details like the
<strong><em>Skype Name</em></strong>, <strong><em>registered email address </em></strong>and your
<strong><em>sign in credentials</em></strong>. (If your Skype account has a unique or
<strong><em>personalized Skype Name</em></strong>, always sign in to Skype using the Skype Name and not the email address).
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Signing in to Skype using the
<strong><em>Microsoft email address</em></strong> will route you to a Microsoft Skype account. Technically, this account is created using the Microsoft account and is using your Microsoft details for Skype. As we all know, Skype is now part of Microsoft. Your
 username will be your Microsoft email address. </span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you encountered any sign in issues, specifically the “Incorrect password” error, please reset your Skype account password on this
<a href="https://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">link</span></a>. Make sure to enter the correct Skype username.
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I recommend entering Safe Mode with network network function to repair Windows.
<br />
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.       
        </p>

<p>you still need to send the sound from your 360 to your PC speakers you need the dongle (short cable) that plugs into the AV out jack on your 360 it has a set of red/white RCA female jacks that you plug one of these into [View:http://rockbandparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Stereo_Y_Cable_Lg.jpg]
 the red/white ends plug into the dongle the other end that looks like a headphone plug plugs into your LINE IN or INPUT jack on your PC's sound card, good luck.</p>

            You really should identify what it does before deleting it.
<br />
<br />Can you find the entry in Task Manager? Can you stop  it there?
<br />
<br />What you can do is just MOVE the shortcut from the startup foldeer to your desktop.  Then see what happens.  Does it magically reappear?  That suggests it could be malware.  Is something no longer working?

            Hi Mark, this is very common, it is left over from a malware infection that has been removes already by Defender or your chosen Anti-virus 
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, scroll down and you will find that reference to 'Program'
<br />
<br />Right click that and choose 'Delete'
<br />
<br />That's It!

<p>Hi DaveM121,</p>
<p>I regret my efforts did not yield results.&nbsp; I could not find 'program'.&nbsp; When using the link you provided it got me to Autoruns v13.82 and it did not require unzipping as I ran it without downloading; also it was referenced sysinternals.com</p>
<p>At any rate, I checked various aspects of the program, but my meager understanding was not sufficient to get me to the gold ring.&nbsp; Thanks, Mark</p>

            <p>I'm having the same issue as others, and I didn't play the trial version before downloading the full version and playing thanks to Game Pass. I only selected the trial version when I began getting the message that I didn't have rights to play the game. I uninstalled the game, reset the console, and then then reinstalled. When that didn't work, I attempted to see if installing the trial version would do something; it let me play for the 30 minute trial, and now I get the trial expired error message.</p><p><br /></p><p>So I don't think it's the trial version that's the issue;&nbsp;for some reason, the game isn't being recognized as a part of the game pass.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I would probably be less annoyed and upset if this game wasn't the sole reason I decided to pay for the game pass.</p>

<h2>            STOP&#58; C0000135 This program can&#39;t start because &#37;hs is missing from your computer.  Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem</h2>
                    Microsoft Community,<br />
I am seeking your advice and guidance from a BSOD that has plagued me since the 19/12/2013 - I have searched the web for a solution but with no success.&nbsp; This BSOD will not allow me to boot into Windows 7 Pro on my PC.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 professional (64bit) booting from an OCZ Agility 3 SSD (120 Gb),&nbsp; using an ASUS Mb P8P67Pro with 12Gb Ram and an I7 3.4Ghz CPU.<br />
I definitely DO NOT have a virus, all drives are recognised by the BIOS and when I run the Windows Repair from the Installation Disk it tells me that Windows is stored on D:\Windows and not C:\Windows - which is probably why it will not boot as there are no
 Windows files on D:\drive.<br />
<br />
This PC has run faultlessly for the last 18 months and it is the first problem I have been unable to fix myself.<br />
<br />
What do I need to do so that the Windows Repair function will point to C:\Windows and not D:\Windows - as this will probably go a long way to fixing the problem.&nbsp; I suspect the problem occurred on a recent update of Windows 7 where the PC did not shut down
 successfully.<br />
<br />
Any assistance, guidance or ideas will be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Datamang<br />

    <title>Using the Outline feature in Word, in Windows Vista - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using the Outline feature in Word, in Windows Vista</h2>
                    Hi there everyone,<br />
I am writing a thesis this year for university. I have seen people using the outline/outlining feature to write there thesis easily on earlier versions of word. I am wondering if anyone know where i can find this feature in the new version of word that comes
 with Windows Vista. I have been searching everywhere, and am very confused with the new menus. Any help about where i could find it, or where i can find more information about how to use it in Windows Vista would be great<br />
Thanks everyone<br />
<br />

<h2>            How to find what program is using a device</h2>
                    <p>Usually this happens:&nbsp;&nbsp;After I do some backup onto an external disk drive, I then need to&nbsp;remove the disk.&nbsp; I bring up the "Safely remove hardware and eject media" app, and select the disk to be ejected.&nbsp; Windows pauses a moment and then displays the following
 error box:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows can't stop your 'HP External HDD SCSI Disk Device' device<br />
because a program is still using it.&nbsp; Close any programs that might be<br />
using the device, and then try again later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no applications running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I knew why this happens, because it is annoying and I think it is a Windows 10&nbsp;bug. &nbsp;But that is not my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find what program is using the disk?</p>

<h2>            Faulty hardware corrupted page error &#40;Blue Screen Error&#41;</h2>
                    I just upgraded my computer (ASUS TP500L) from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. Out of nowhere, the Blue Screen error keeps happening, even though my computer wasn't under heavy load (I think). I haven't had this error, when it was Windows 8, but now that it's
 Windows 10, it happened once in every 2 or 3 days or so. What can I do to prevent the error from happening?

<p>Same here! Nothing has changed with the computer but the OS. From windows 8.1pro to windows 10 pro. t is also shutting down my mail window every time I try to use it so I have to use the browser.</p>

            Yea, I did notice ASUS put out two&nbsp;set of&nbsp;drivers to all ASUS computer using Windows 10. I updated those, I don't know if that will fix the issue ( I doubt it). I think this is a Microsoft thing. I am going to try and contact a buddy of mine tomorrow who
 works or them to see if he has any solutions. If not I might go back to Windows 8.1 for now. Can't have my computer&nbsp;restarting because of&nbsp;system errors everyday. You can go back to Windows 8.1 by going to&nbsp;Windows recovery. Heads&nbsp;up&nbsp;you can only do that for
 a month after you install Windows 10.

            I think its a drivers issue, I had this same issue with my inspiron 1545 and I got the blue screen of death. I searched up the error and it stated it was a driver problem. I have since downgraded to Windows 7 to avoid these issues until Windows 10 is updated
 to fix the problem.

            <p>To everyone. I got in contact with my buddy at Microsoft, who let me know that they know the problem exists and are currently working on fixing it. He said although it not a good thing to happen, it really will not cause damage to any computer (the drivers
 on the computer) or the Windows 10 operating system. The system will restart and you will be good to go. Until the engineers figure out what is going and send an update, we just kind of have to deal with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Everyone who has an ASUS computer should update the two drivers for Windows 10. They are on the ASUS website one is for the touchpad (if you have a laptop/notebook) and the other is
<span>ATKPackage. Although these updates are not related to this particular issue, they will cause issues eventually.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows Media Player</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my Lenovo PC from Windows 7 to Windows 10. &nbsp;In doing so, the version of Windows Media Player stopped being able to read anything inserted into the Memory Card reader of the PC. &nbsp;It used to work fine under Windows 7, but with the upgrade, it no
 longer can see the drive at all. &nbsp;Have re-loaded Media Player since but no change in performance. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Craig,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If something isn’t working with Windows Media Player, you might not have the right codec on your PC. The easiest way to solve the problem is to go online and search for the codec you need.
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>However, use caution when installing codecs that you find on the Internet, particularly some of the free codec packs that claim to include codecs from a wide variety of companies or organizations.
 Incompatibilities are known to exist with some of the components in these codec packs that can cause serious playback issues in the Player and other players, lead to system corruption, and make it difficult for Microsoft Support to diagnose and troubleshoot
 playback issues. For these reasons, we strongly discourage you from installing these codec packs, and recommend that you remove them if you have installed them and you're having problems with the Player. Install only codecs, filters, or plug-ins from trusted,
 authorized sources, such as the website of the official supplier. Even then, use caution: many codec suppliers offer minimal customer support. Before installing any digital media components, set a system restore point. The restore point enables you to return
 to your original system configuration, if necessary.</span></span></p>

<h2>            ATI Radeon 3000 Graphics Driver is not working properly.</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10, 64 bit operation system. Do I have to buy a new driver if this old one is not working? Everything has gotten HUGE on the screen. It is blurry and hurts my eyes and looks really stupid. Windows update&nbsp; will not update this driver.
 Can I fix it somehow. It has been working just fine until now.&nbsp; The graphics driver website just wants me to buy a new one and they are very expensive. I don't know what to do. Any ideas out there?

            I've fixed it finally! I tried again to roll back my operating system in settings &lt; update &amp; security &lt; recovery, and this time windows let me do it. A few days ago when I tried, it wouldn't let me. So after restoring to the previous version of windows,
 I needed to block the update so version 1709 would not be installed again. Go to the link in Alden Rey's post above for the troubleshooter to hide updates. Then check the 1709 update to hide/block it.&nbsp; Then I went back into Device Manager and did as described
 in laudablepus' post (gardenman's post) above and tried again to update the driver and found an older ATI Radeon 3000 Graphics driver in my computer that wasn't listed when I was in version 1709. So I chose that one and when it was finished installing, my
 screen is back to normal! Yeah! <br />

 hour later it says pending again. I've seen something about regions having to be the same so I've checked and definitely the same. Any help would be appreciated!</p>
