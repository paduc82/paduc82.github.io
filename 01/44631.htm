<p>
</p><p>If you are getting this error while installing Windows updates then it normally occurs because the Wups2.dll file that is included in the latest version of Windows Update is installed incorrectly or has become unregistered.</p>

<h2>            still can&#39;t get Windows 7 to see Mac on home network</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>The question has been asked by several users without a satisfactory answer. &nbsp;This seems to be a problem with no solution.</p>
<p>I cannot get my Windows 7 laptop to see my Mac desktop on my home wireless network. &nbsp;The laptop connects to the network just fine and can access the Internet with no problem. &nbsp;But I can't connect the Windows PC to the Mac to share files. &nbsp;The Mac can see
 the PC and connect to it from the Mac side, so if I'm at the Mac I can drag files to the PC. &nbsp;If I'm on the laptop, it's an island in the ocean. &nbsp;Nothing can be seen anywhere on the network. &nbsp;It's impossible to copy files to the Mac from the PC.</p>
<p>It has to be a Windows 7 problem. &nbsp;I have another laptop running XP and it connects to the Mac automatically.</p>
<p>Is this a Windows 7 bug and that's why no one can explain how to fix this? &nbsp;The Mac forums are loaded with people having the same problem with their Windows 7 computers.</p>

            <b>Problem Solved!</b><br />
<br />
PilotBob's suggestion did the trick for me. I was tearing my hair out all last night&nbsp; over why my Windows 7 (Ultimate) machine could access files on my one-year old MacBook Air and not my two new OSX machines. When trying to access the new machines I kept getting
 an alert box telling me of a login failure and asking me to enter my username and password. Despite having identical accounts on all my machines, I could not login to the new OSX machines, even after typing the correct username and password.<br />
<br />
The problem, as it turned out, was that the Macbook Air was set to use the same workgroup as the Windows 7 machine (which I had imaginatively named "WORKGROUP") and the new OSX machines were not using any workgroup at all. Once I made that change, Windows 7
 logged into the new OSX machines automatically.<br />
<br />
My only remaining point of dissatisfaction is that Windows 7 still does not automatically pick up the OSX machines on the subnet and list them under "Network," as it does with my other Windows 7 machines. I have to enter the address of the OSX machine I want
 to access in the address bar of the File Manager: i.e. "\\ComputerName" in order to see the shared files on the OSX machines. But once that's done, the OSX computers appear under Network in File Manager and stay there, and I can click on them to access everything
 that's shared. I can live with this, although, as John+6154 pointed out, it seems like Microsoft could make this easier. OSX picks up any Windows machines on the subnet automatically. So why can't Windows do the same? (My guess is that Microsoft won't be able
 to get away with this sort of arrogance much longer. If things keep going as they are it may soon be Microsoft touting that Windows plays nice with OSX, rather than OSX touting that it plays nice with Windows.)<br />
<br />
Anyway... given the situation as it stands, and adapting from all of the suggestions above with special credit to Malkeleah, here is what I believe is a complete list of what you need to do to enable file access on OSX from Windows 7:<br />
<br />
<b>On Windows 7:</b><br />
<ol>
<li>Set up a user account with a password</li><li><span>Go to Control Panel&gt;All Control Panel Items&gt;Network and Sharing Center and click on "Change advanced sharing settings" and set the following for whatever sort of network you're on (presumably Home or Work)<br />
</span></li><li><span>Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> network discovery</span></li><li><span>Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> file and printer sharing</span></li><li><span>Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> sharing in the Public folder sharing section</span></li><li><span>Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> password protected sharing</span></li><li><span>Do not use "Homegroup" (this has a knack for messing up your manual network settings)</span></li><li><span>Make sure your firewall allows traffic on your subnet(s) to pass through</span></li><li><span>Identify the workgroup of your Windows machine by going to Control Panel&gt;System and Security&gt;System. The name and workgroup of your PC are shown. You can changes these if you have administrative privileges; click "Change Settings" just to the right
 of the Computer Name. You'll need the workgroup to set up your OSX machine.</span></li><li><span>It looks like you might have to be using Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate to make the file sharing work. I haven't tried it with Home Premium.<br />
</span></li></ol>
<span><b>On OSX:</b><br />
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to Apple Menu&gt;System Preferences</span></li><li><span>Select Users and Groups</span></li><li><span>Set up a user with the same username and password as on the Windows machine (there is a padlock at the bottom left that you might have to click to allow you to make changes -- this appears for almost all of the settings in System Preferences)</span></li><li><span>You can, if you like, set up automatic login as Malkeleah described for Windows. Just click "Login Options" at the bottom of the list of users</span></li><li><span>Go back to System Preferences and select Network</span></li><li><span>Click the Advanced button </span></li><li><span>Click TCP/IP and make sure you're on the same IP subnet as the Windows machine: i.e. 192.168.XXX.YYY, where XXX is the identifier for the subnet and YYY is the identifier for the machine. (I believe you can access machines on different subnets, but
 you have to search for the full IP address rather than just the name of the computer.)<br />
</span></li><li><span>Click WINS and set the NetBios name of the machine to whatever you like, and the Workgroup to the same workgroup as the Windows machine.</span></li><li><span>Say OK to all of that, and then go back to System Preferences and choose Sharing</span></li><li><span>Check the things you want to share (minimally file sharing)</span></li><li><span>With file sharing highlighted, Click the options button under File Sharing (at the right) and select Share Files and folders using SMB (Windows) and select the user(s) for which sharing is to be enabled. (It does no harm to also click AFP (Apple File
 Protocol) for sharing with other OSX machines.)<br />
</span></li><li><span>Click done and then add the folders you want to share using the [+] and [-] buttons at the bottom of the window, and also the users. You can specify the privileges of each user next to the user name.</span></li><li><span>Go back to the WINS settings and make sure OSX has set the workgroup name. For some reason this doesn't happen instantly. If it's blank, then it hasn't been set. I've had to try and try again on occasions before it "takes." But once it's in there,
 it should stay there. You might have to reboot, though.</span></li></ol>
<span><b>Finally, to access your OSX machine from Windows</b><br />
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Open a Windows Explorer window</span></li><li><span>In the address bar, type \\OSXComputerName, i.e "\\Air" or whatever</span></li><li><span>If all is well, your shared folders should pop up immediately, no need to enter a password, since the Windows 7 password is the same.</span></li></ol>
<span>I hope this helps someone.<br />

            No, this isn't a Windows 7 bug. My Win7 box sees my OS X laptops just fine and has from the very early beta days.<br />
<br />
<span>On OS X, make sure you have File sharing ticked in System Preferences&gt;Sharing. Click the Options button and select "Share files and folders using SMB". Add shared directories as desired.<br />
<br />
You must create matching user accounts/passwords on both the Mac and Windows 7. You do not need to be logged into the same account on all machines and the passwords assigned to each user account can be different; the accounts/passwords just need to exist and
 match on all machines. <span style="font-weight: bold">DO NOT NEGLECT TO CREATE PASSWORDS, EVEN IF ONLY SIMPLE ONES</span> . If you wish a machine to boot directly to the Desktop in Win7 (into one particular user's account) for convenience, you can do this.<br />
<br />
Start&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />
<br />
You will find the automatic logon options for OS X in System Preferences&gt;Accounts.<br />
<br />
On Win7, go to Control Panel&gt;All Control Panel Items&gt;Network and Sharing Center. Click on "Change advanced sharing settings". You do not want to be using Homegroup.<br />
<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> network discovery<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> file and printer sharing<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> sharing in the Public folder sharing section<br />
Turn <span style="font-weight: bold">ON</span> password protected sharing<br />
<br />
Configure firewalls on all machines to allow the Local Area Network (LAN) traffic as trusted. With Windows Firewall, setting File and Printer Sharing ON will take care of this for those machines and if you aren't running a third-party firewall or have an antivirus/security
 program with its own firewall component, then you're fine.&nbsp; With third-party firewalls, I usually configure the LAN allowance with an IP range. Ex. would be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.254. Obviously you would substitute your correct subnet. Refer to any third party
 security program's Help or user forums for how to properly configure its firewall. Do not run more than one firewall.
<br />
The OS X Firewall settings are in System Preferences&gt;Security. Click the lock to make changes and click the Advanced button to make sure SMB Sharing is allowed. If you set it up in the Sharing module, it will be.<br />

<p>KabanetsARTI, к сожалению эмуляция платформы Xbox Original на Xbox 360 не совершенна и для ряда игр приводит к проблемам.</p>
<p>В качестве рекомендации, поищите рецепт на фанатских форумах Xbox Original, здесь едва ли найдутся те кто использует эмуляцию.</p>

<p>Can you upload the crash dumps from c:\windows\minidump to&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>&nbsp;and
 provide a link?</p>
<p>FWIW,&nbsp;<span>general
 guidance for dealing with bluescreens (some of which you will already have seen):</span></p>
<span>
<p>Consider running chkdsk on all partitions. &nbsp;Let chkdsk complete on each partition and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Also consider running SFC /SCANNOW.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to use Driver Verifier. &nbsp;To enable Driver Verifier... start-&gt;verifier.exe-&gt;OK-&gt;Create standard settings-&gt;Next-&gt;select driver names from a list-&gt;Next-&gt;sort by Provider-&gt;select all non-Microsoft drivers-&gt;Finish, and OK your way out
 of the dialog.</p>
<p>Then, reboot and use the system as you normally would, and wait for a problem. &nbsp;In the event that the system does not boot completely after enabling driver verifier, boot into Safe Mode and run driver verifier, and tell it to delete the changes.</p>
<p>Wait for a bugcheck to occur after enabling verifier as described, and then upload the dump to your SkyDrive, and provide a link.</p>
<p>If you boot into safe mode, do you still experience bugchecks? What about if you do a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean
 boot</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/6115cb34-2890-46b5-8c1e-c934c56ecfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">device
 clean boot</a>?</p>
<p>Consider testing memory with Windows Memory Diagnostic or memtest86. Note that memory that passes tests is not necessarily good memory - it just hasn't failed a test. &nbsp;Consider systematically eliminating RAM from the system - run with a couple of
 modules for a while, and see how things go. Then try the other modules.</p>
<p>Other common suggestions include ensuring drivers are up to date, as well as ensuring that you're using the latest BIOS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot BlueScreens using BlueScreenView and MyEventViewer and other methods see
<br />
this thread.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/842fa8cf-535e-4b5d-9416-85eb31edbe6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/842fa8cf-535e-4b5d-9416-85eb31edbe6f</a><br />
<br />
Two primary causes of this blue screen are&nbsp;video drivers and BIOS - Check with System Maker's
<br />
Site for Display Adapter (Video) and BIOS and then Device Maker's site for latest Video. It can be
<br />
other drivers so check while there. Turn OFF auto-driver installation as those are older and if
<br />
Windows Updates suggests a driver just HIDE it. Antivirus is another possibility.<br />
<br />
See Generic Driver Update Methods in next message.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 8E&nbsp; 0x0000008E is same as 0x1000008E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates that a memory access violation occurred.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.
</li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p>If you plan to debug this problem, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2 (the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.
</li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.
</li></ul>
<p>If the bug check message lists a driver by name , disable or remove that driver. Also, disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file
 system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you have to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the system by using the Recovery Console and then deleting
 the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. You can disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve the error. You should also run
 hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows
 installation that are associated with lack of disk space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and
<em>.chk </em>files that contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more free space for the installation.</p>
<p>You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version</p>

<br />
=============================================<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />

<strong>Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.<br />

Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is my generic bluescreen troubleshooter :<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info
<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error
<br />
information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however
<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible

driver issues).<br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party

keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            After &#34;Creators Update&#34; - Start Tiles reset, CMD window text &#34;squished&#34;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Relevant System Info</strong></p>
<p>AMD Ryzen 1800x</p>
<p>ASRock X370 Fatal1ty Gaming Pro (BIOS v2.2)</p>
<p>G.Skill 8192 MB (DDR4-2400) - XMP 2.0 - P/N: F4-3200C14-8GFX</p>
<p>Samsung 950 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of the three computers I've installed the Creators Update on, this system is the only one to have major problems.. So, it could be related to Ryzen.</p>
<p>In any case, here's what I'm dealing with:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Start Tiles</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f20a9015-d25d-457b-b9c4-2de53d22a2b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f20a9015-d25d-457b-b9c4-2de53d22a2b4" /></a></p>
<p>There were additional Tiles in the Start Menu that I un-pinned that had an Up Arrow, but tried to link to a non-existent app. There were 3-5 of them per group.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CMD Window</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b106253a-cdae-4cfd-b878-30a8f699f164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b106253a-cdae-4cfd-b878-30a8f699f164" /></a></p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas on how to fix either of these? I've tried suggestions on these pages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/after-installation-of-the-windows-10-creators/3ad13817-2f98-41e5-883a-cf76a0969e02</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/windows-10-start-menu-tiles-missing-after/e514df0e-21fd-4ecd-a6a8-4c83f7cdea86</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://superuser.com/questions/1205736/start-menu-icons-broken-after-windows-10-creators-update-version-1703-install</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://windowsreport.com/start-menu-issues-fix/</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I haven't done anything to address the CMD window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The update also disabled the Malwarebytes Service, and for a time prevented me from logging into my O365 account from any Office program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I automatically run a DISM.StartComponentCleanup &gt; sfc &gt; DISM.RestoreHealth &gt; sfc maintenance routine after any Windows Update, but that didn't fix the problem. I'm in the process of running it again now, so perhaps my Start Tiles will come back. It would
 probably take me hours to manually rebuild it (as I had a lot of apps pinned there), so I probably won't tackle it until it becomes too annoying to avoid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I should be thankful that the computer runs at all, but if this situation with the WannaCry exploit shows us anything, it's that people don't generally keep their computers updated. And for good reason. There is a huge potential for things being
 broken by WU, so Microsoft has created a resistance to the very thing they are urging people to do to keep their computers safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to up the bar substantially in the QA department if they hope to remain on top. I know of several people who never would've considered paying extra for a Mac that are now one bad update away from pulling the trigger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: Malwarebytes had to be reinstalled to function properly, and the second maintenance routine did not restore Start Tiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT2: The CMD Window bug only seems to be affected by launching the program from WinKey + X. Launching the Start Menu shortcut for CMD does not result in the same text display issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT3: Right-clicking the top bar of the CMD window, selecting Properties, and then adjusting the Font Size fixed the issue. Needs to be done for both "Command Prompt" and "Command Prompt (Admin)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT4: If you don't want to adjust any of the Display Properties for the CMD window, all you need to do is open Properties and hit OK. This is enough to "reset" the text. This must be done at the shortcut for the Start Menu, the program itself (%systemroot%\system32\cmd.exe),
 and for each of the WinKey + X &gt; Command Prompt entries. If you don't alter cmd.exe, then your launchable scripts won't display correctly.</p>

<p>I appreciate your effort Michael, but I have a feeling that the only way I could have recovered my Start Tiles is via the Windows.Old folder, which I unfortunately deleted before noticing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing CU on 8 machines, with a mix of AMD and Intel, the Ryzen machine was the only instance where I experienced the corruption/loss of Start Tiles. It also had the most Groups and number of Tiles, so that may have played a part.</p>

<p>I too have the same problem, I have deferred the updates on the office PC's that I support in an attempt to prevent problems from the latest patches but this is the second time a big update has messed things up.</p>
<p>After updating to 1703 the start menu has lost all customized tile settings &amp; is only showing the default icons &amp; several non MS programs have lost their settings due to permissions in the registry changing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone back to the previous build for now, which has fixed everything, but the update keeps pushing everyday to be installed again.</p>
<p>If there is a way to recover the start menu settings from the windows.old folder this would make my life a lot easier!</p>
<p>Lets hope someone here can suggest a way to do this.</p>

<p>Ok, so I spent some time recreating the start menu's by going back to the previous version of Windows, taking screenshots of all the start menu's then updating all the PC's to 1703 again &amp; adding all the tiles as they were before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, two days later, the PC's have all suddenly reset the start menu's again only showing the default tiles &amp; every program in the list showing "New" next to it.</p>
<p>This is going to be very frustrating!!</p>

    <title>Hyper-V Lagging Media Player Classic &#40;Home Cinema&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danbalasescu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyper-V Lagging Media Player Classic &#40;Home Cinema&#41;</h2>
                    Hi, I'm a developer and must install Hyper-V in order to develop apps for Windows Phone 8 (essentially, to run the emulator).<br />
However I have found that Hyper-V causes slowdowns in Media Player Classic (Home Cinema) where the video starts to lag with 1-2FPS.<br />
<br />
I have tracked this problem down to the Hyper-V feature (after testing with and without Hyper-V installed), however I have no idea why this is occurring while the Hyper-V service is stopped. Obviously this is making watching movies impossible.<br />
While this is happening, my CPU usage is around 30% by MPC and my GPU usage is 0%, so I cannot find the reason as to why this is occurring.<br />
<br />
My Media Player Classic setup:<br />
MPC-HC + MadVR + LAV Filters + xy-vsfilter (All installed with the <a href="http://haruhichan.com/forum/showthread.php?7545-KCP-Kawaii-Codec-Pack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Kawaii Codec Pack)</a><br />
<br />
How can I fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
I'll keep updating this post as I find new information:<br />
<ul>
<li>I've tracked down the issue now to MadVR, still don't know the cause.</li><li><a href="http://u.smgi.me/aly.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://u.smgi.me/aly.png</a> &lt;-- My resource usage while running. As you can see performance is not an issue here (GPU nor CPU).</li><li>Just found out that DirectX games which would previously run at ~1700FPS now run at 700-800FPS.<br />
</li></ul>

<p>Hi le_flyer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that these accounts were hidden that's why it won't allow you to delete it. Let's work around with this. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Pull up <strong>Command Prompt</strong> and run it as administrator.</li><li>Type <strong>net</strong><em>&lt;space&gt;</em><strong>user </strong>then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Take note of the users that you don't recognize.</li><li>Delete these user accounts, type <strong>net</strong><em>&lt;space&gt;</em><strong>user</strong><em>&lt;space&gt;</em><strong>(Username)</strong><em>&lt;space&gt;</em><strong>/delete</strong> then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Restart your device afterwards.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hi Marco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues with the Start menu and personalizing the desktop likely occur due to a corrupted user profile. For us to isolate your concern, we'd like to know if you've made any changes prior to the issue. Meanwhile, we suggest creating a new user profile to troubleshoot
 the issue. Refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the steps on how to create a new account,
 then move your personal data and files to the new account. </p>
<p>

    <title>Windows Media Center UK TV EPG Guide Data missing again - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> it troll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center UK TV EPG Guide Data missing again</h2>
                    <p>The UK TV EPG Guide Data for Windows Media Center is missing past the <strong>
6th&nbsp;September 2015</strong>. In the UK we typically have two or three of these incidents per year. I know other regions suffer similar outages. Normally they occur at the end of the year (31/12) or in October when&nbsp;BST ends and the clocks go back an hour. This
 time it is neither of those things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Historically we could report problem like this on the&nbsp;Connect website for <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/site1145/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Center Guide Data Feedback</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However&nbsp;on 19/03/2014, Microsoft quietly buried&nbsp;the following&nbsp;statement within some comments on the Connect website.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>EPG is considered a legacy application within Microsoft, which means the developers who designed the systems have been reassigned to other projects, and only provide break fix support in addition to their other duties. As time
 goes on and people move on, there are fewer people who are familiar with the system, and it takes longer to respond to problems like this.</em><br />
<br />
<em>We understand that there are still many dedicated media center users, and there are currently no plans to shut down EPG. Additionally there are steps we can take to catch issue and resolve issues such as this more quickly. For the past year the server engineering
 team for EPG has also maintained this site and responded to data quality complaints. However, we also support many other applications in addition to EPG, and it has been difficult to respond in a timely manner to issues raised on this site.</em><br />
<br />
<em>As such, the decision has been made to shut the Media Center Data Quality site down, and route data quality issues through Microsoft Customer Service. Customer service will investigate initially, and then escalate to our team if data quality issues are
 suspected. This should increase the visibility of issues raised, and provide accountability to getting them resolved more quickly.</em><br />
<br />
<em>New requests for help can now be raised at this link: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/media-center-help#media-center-help=windows-8&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/media-center-help#media-center-help=windows-8&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1</a></em><br />
<br />
<em>Thanks for continuing to use Media Center. We will do our best to keep it up and running for you.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The&nbsp;alternative support&nbsp;link&nbsp;which&nbsp;has been&nbsp;provided is just the generic Windows support page. Those that have tried to report EPG problems through this route have found that often the support assistants haven't even heard of Media Center. They then go onto
 provide general advice about installing Windows updates and other unrelated actions. The issue never reaches someone who has the knowledge or access to&nbsp;resolve the underlying data quality problem.<br />
<br />
I am not sure how Microsoft can justify calling EPG a legacy product and providing such dreadful customer support. Media Center is still sold in the Windows App Store for the latest version of Windows and in theory has many years of official support remaining.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we get it fixed now that our support channels have been closed down?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Multiple reports have been made on the Connect site but Microsoft have not responded. It would seem that they are indeed no longer monitoring Connect as per the statement.</p>

<p>Thanks for following up. Another step that you can try is to ensure that Microsoft Visual C++ is installed on your PC. You can do so by typing
<strong>Programs and features</strong> in the Cortana search box. If it's there, try to uninstall Visual C++, download it and reinstall. You can download VC++
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>, but if you need the 64-bit version, use this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, try to install the program again and let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Undo file association for .lnk extension to original setting of &#34;Unknown Program&#34;</h2>
                    I got interrupted and changed the file association on the .lnk extension to my browser.&nbsp; Now all shortcuts open with the browser.<br />
I need to restore that file association to Unknown Program.<br />
<br />
Tried running system restore but it fails due to unknown reasons but probably due to a call to a .lnk file (?)<br />
<br />
Any guidance on editing the registry to correct this errow would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.

            Got the answer to my own question, but for those of you having issues with file associations in Windows 7, which does not offer a delete or remove function, see this link:<br />
http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/231/1/An-Utility-to-Unassociate-File-Types-in-Windows-7-and-Vista.html<br />
<br />
Download the unassoc zipfile and follow instructions.&nbsp; Worked like a charm.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that the folder ClickToRun; location: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\ClickToRun has grown to size of about 17.9 GB (11.7 GB OnDisk). Kindly let me know if there is a way to purge this folder without causing any problems to my OS. This is probably
 related to Office 365 setup or Office 2016 setup.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is the <strong>dumbest</strong> answer to <strong>such a simple question, did you even read it?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear <strong>Microsoft</strong>, I use to have google.com as my homepage and now its msn.com - how can I change it back to google.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's answer: Simple! Use system restore! <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> this may cause irreparable harm to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here is a real answer:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You <em>could</em> delete the whole ClickToRun folder, HOWEVER this will break the '<strong>Online Repair</strong>'.
<br />
<br />
The better option is to go to <strong>Programs &amp; Features,</strong> find <strong>
Microsoft Office 365</strong> <strong>/ 2016</strong>, click <strong>Change</strong> &amp; finally click '<strong>Online Repair</strong>'.
<br />
<br />
After its done, sort the ClickToRun folder by <strong>Date modified</strong>. <br />
</p>
<p>You can <strong>delete </strong>anything that wasn't touched when you ran the repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ClickToRun folder was 23.5 GB, now its 31.5 MB</p>

<h3> jonasjcs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug using slideshow as background wallpaper</h2>
                    I've configured my windows to use slideshow as wallpaper and set the window theme based on color of the background picture. Using windows explorer, when the wallpaper changes if you are navigating through a list of itens then windoes selects the first
 item from that list. Its annoying.

            Yes, this behavior has been the same since at least Windows 7.&nbsp; When Explorer processes a theme color update it reload its interface in order to update any relevant updated interface elements.&nbsp; Changing the timing of your slideshow or turning off auto-color
 selection will help here.

            Yeah, you can in the Colors control panel.&nbsp; When somebody brought this up a while back I looked into it.&nbsp; It's because you're using AutoColorization.&nbsp; Turn that on in WIndows 7 and you get the same behavior.&nbsp; Sounds like you weren't using AutoColorization
 in Windows 7: turn if off (instead use a fixed color) and you'll see the same Windows 7 behavior. :)

<p>I hope there's a campaign or a mode where you can play as zombies against AI plants. PVZ always puts a smile on my face. I played some Gardens &amp; Graveyards last night :-)</p>

<p>PvZ 1 is a great game that could be so much better if not for the awful servers. Constant disconnects and lag plague what could be one of the best games out. Hopefully EA fixes that for the next go around.</p>
