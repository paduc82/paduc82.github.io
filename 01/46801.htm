<h2>            Xbox One controller disconnects every time the console is turned off</h2>
                    <p>My controllers disconnect and will not sync every time I turn the console off. &nbsp;I have gone through all of the usual troubleshooting steps and the problem still persists. I have tried updating my controllers, I have turned off other wireless interference, my batteries are not low, and there are no doorways or anything obstructing the console. &nbsp;I can usually regain connection by turning the console on and off repeatedly, the controllers usually sync after repeating this 4 or 5 times. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Xbox One won&#39;t wake up occasionally</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the past weeks I have encountered a weird problem with my Xbox One X. When waking up from hibernation, the console fails to startup. The Xbox One hardware beep does sound, but the Xbox hardware light does not turn on. Turning on the controller does not
 bring the Xbox back to life. Hard pressing the power button is the only way to restart the console.<br />
</p>
<p>Is this a known issue?</p>
<p>

<p>If your console is in the Insider Preview program, there was a mention in the "known issues", that the console sometimes fails to start up from hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are in the Preview Program, and that happens, restart the console and then file feedback that you have that problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your console is not in the Preview Program, download the Xbox Insider App, and then use the app to file feedback that you also have that issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I remember this was an issue mostly on my original Xbox One console. Sometimes the controller wouldn't wake the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is typically a minor issue with setting the power mode to "Instant-On". When your console has not fully shut down for days (or weeks), occasionally the temporary cache (in memory) goes a little corrupt, causing unusual behavior from the console such
 as not being able to wake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best fix is to simply perform a <a href="http://xbx.lv/19Pxh2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Perform a power cycle on Xbox One">
power cycle</a>, and your console should be acting normal then.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice. I power up the console about every 1-3 days, so I use it quite regularly. I use Instant-On for this reason. But I didn't know that there is a "soft" reset option such as the power cycle. I'll give it a try.</p>

<p>Hey Robert! We appreciate you posting. As our Ambassador previously mentioned, it is one of the known issues&nbsp;the Preview program team is tracking. It seems to be related to the console fully shutting off when in Instant-On mode. Personally, I have an Xbox
 One X as well, am part of the Preview Program, and have experienced that exact issue myself. This
<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/09/19/new-preview-alpha-ring-1810-update-9-19-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>&nbsp;explains the recent update for the current system update build, which includes known issues. To provide
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub-report-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
feedback</a> follow the link&nbsp;I provided and make sure to have the Xbox Insider Hub App installed. The power cycle our other Ambassador suggested is great to do as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if there is anything else you need.</p>

<p>It seems thst performing a power cycle did not work. The issue resurfaced despite that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, I made two weird observations:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If I wait a couple of minutes after the console fails to wake up from hibernation, I am able to turn it on, but the console performs a full startup. So obviously it has performed a full shutdown before by itself.</li><li>Occasionally, the Xbox turns on completely by itself.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I believe there is no solution to this issue until the developers fix it.</p>

<p>Hello Maniac</p>
<p>
</p><p>A suggestion is to reset the console to factory settings.<br />
Before doing so, make sure of a few things.<br />
Here's a list:<br />
The information for your profile/profiles are up to date and you know email/password for each/all of them.<br />
There is a backup connection to a network, i.e. HotSpot, or hardwire connection (Ethernet)<br />
Make sure to select Keep My Games and Apps<br />
This soft factory reset is performed by accessing the Settings.<br />
It shouldn't have to do with the username, but give this a shot.<br />
Let us know if there is more we can do for you!</p>

                    <p>Edge Browser stopped working 30 days after upgrade to Windows 10. Cortana doesn't answer searches as if there is no internet connection. Internet Explorer Windows 8.1 returned to PC now is my default internet connection so Cortana doesn't really sync with
 EI. Tried twice to reset PC, restart connection dropped each time so Windows 10 will not reset automatically nor manually. Can't manually download Edge nor Windows 10 upgrade now my PC seems stuck between Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 and I can't do anything
 about it. Not a tech head so all the long drawn out solutions I have read so far in this forum are not my experience. So Microsoft do something since my Windows 8.1 is lost to me.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; I already have Windows 10 on this very machine, but I need to reset it, as </p>
<p>sfc /scannow has found corrupted files and cannot seem to download the proper ones to fix that issue, so I tried what you wrote, redownloaded the source files, put them on a stick and let the baby go. &nbsp;Well that did not work as after a half hour or so, I
 am told that Win10 cannot be installed on this machine.</p>

    <title>Cannot Install Vista Service Pack 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> capitankeen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Install Vista Service Pack 1</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install Windows Vista Service Pack 1 on a clean installation of Vista so that I can upgrade to Windows 7. When I try to install it using the automatic updater, a window pops up asking me to agree to the terms of service. I agree to them and
 hit install. About two seconds later, the updater claims that the service pack has been installed successfully, but it in fact has not been, and when I check for new updates, Service Pack 1 is listed as a new update. I have run the Update Readiness Tool from
 Microsoft, the FixIt tool from Microsoft, and have tried installing the service pack in a clean boot, always with the same result. I ran chkdsk. That did nothing.<br />
<br />
I have also tried installing the service pack by manually downloading it from Windows' site, also in a clean boot, multiple times. Every time I try this, it runs through the entire installation process, restarting the computer multiple times, but when it finally
 reaches 100% of Step 3 of 3, it says "Update did not install. Reverting changes." Then it corrupts my installation of Vista to the point that I have to reinstall it from scratch, including all of the updates preceding Service Pack 1.
<br />
<br />
I have no third-party anti-virus software running. The only third-party software I have installed is Firefox.<br />
<br />
This seems to be a common problem, but I can't find any solutions that work for me. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reinstall Vista &gt; then install the standalone SP1 &gt; then SP2&nbsp;&gt; then get the rest of the Updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Start &gt; right click Computer &gt; left click Properties &gt; see if you have Vista 32bit or Vista 64bit installed.</p>
<p>It will also tell you there what SP you have installed after you are finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then choose the correct "bit" download to use to install the Service Packs, installing SP1 first if it is not already installed.</p>

            So I gave it a try, but when it got to 100% of stage 3 of 3, it did the same thing as before, saying, "Service Pack did not install. Reverting changes. Do not turn off computer." Then, as before, Vista wouldn't start at all. I even tried this in a clean
 boot. Do you have any other suggestions?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apologize for the delay in response. Since you've tried all the possible troubleshooting steps, I would suggest you to do an In-Place Upgrade of the Vista operating system and then install the Service Packs. Refer to the following article to do the same:</p>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2255099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Perform an In-Place Upgrade on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 &amp; Windows Server 2008 R2</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <span>We strongly recommend that you back up all your personal files and then perform the operation.
<span>erforming a repair installation will not damage files and applications that are currently installed on your computer. Also, some of your customized Windows settings may be lost through this process.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information helps. Get back to us for further assistance.</span></span></p>

            Thanks. I'll try it, but I'll need to find some time to actually do it first, because I'll have to reinstall Vista as a result of the outcome of the last suggestion on here that I tried. It could be a couple of days, but I'll let you know how it turns
 out.<br />

    <title>Mouse not working after Windows 10 Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> merganserbli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse not working after Windows 10 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>The problem has been on an Acer Aspire 5417Z-5433 Laptop with a Logitech M325 wireless mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My problem started with a hanging Windows Anniversary Update.&nbsp; Having looked online, I found a suggestion on a non-Microsoft forum&nbsp;to remove the transmitter for my wireless mouse from its UBS port.&nbsp; After a few seconds to a few minutes, the installation
 began again and completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, a new problem occurred.&nbsp; The&nbsp;laptop did the automatic restart and I put the mouse transmitter back into the USB port.&nbsp; I signed in, but the keypad on the laptop, keyboard and mouse were non-responsive.&nbsp; I did have the switch on the mouse itself
 turned on. &nbsp;I tried using a different mouse, a Logitech M310, but still no improvement.&nbsp; Since I had no controls, the only thing I could do was shut down the laptop by pushing the power button, then turning the laptop on again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I forced a shut down 2 more times, with the transmitter still in the USB port, but still the keypad, keyboard and M325 mouse were not responsive after I signed in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did yet another forced shutdown, this time with the mouse transmitter removed from the USB port.&nbsp; I turned the power on again and signed on.&nbsp; Next, I waited a bit for the laptop to fully "wake up."&nbsp; Then I put the transmitter back into the USB port.&nbsp; The
 laptop "recognized"&nbsp;the M325 mouse, and the mouse and keyboard worked normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since the Anniversary Update, when there has been a new monthly Windows 10 update, I have had the same problem of mouse and keyboard not being responsive.&nbsp; I don't know about the touchpad, because I don't use it anyway.&nbsp; Each time I have "solved" the problem
 by forcing a shutdown by shutting off the power button, removing the mouse transmitter for the USB port, and turning the laptop on again, etc.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have these problems after my original installation several months ago of Windows 10 - they began with the download and installation of the Anniversary Update.&nbsp; I also have an HP desktop with a Logitech wireless mouse and have not had any of these
 problems with the HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>I think the problems regarding the Acer laptop have something with Windows 10 update installations not recognizing the mouse.</strong>&nbsp; I do hope I don't have to keep forcing a shutdown and pulling out the mouse transmitter after each future update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a "techie,"&nbsp;so I don't want to get into the registry or other complicated thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any non-tech help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Automatic Updates no longer working</h2>
                    Update screen just sits and spins.&nbsp; Rebooted several times over two days, tried Update Repair, but still no joy.&nbsp; Only once did it show an error, which was 0x800705b4.&nbsp; The Update Troubleshooter tool said "Service registration missing or corrupt."&nbsp; Following
 instructions from another thread, I tried to stop then restart the Windows Update service. Still no luck.&nbsp; Also, not sure if related, but MS Word 2010 also hangs now.&nbsp; Thanks for any ideas on how to get my computer back.

<h2>            Windows 10 update indicates Intel E8500 CPU as not compatible</h2>
                    <p>My computer in addition to&nbsp;a Intel E8500 CPU &nbsp;has 4 GB of RAM, a 1 TB HDD and a 640 GB HDD, and a&nbsp;Nvidia 450 GTS Graphics Card.&nbsp; In am running 64 Bit Win 7 Home Premium. This configuration &nbsp;is more than adequate to run Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The Windows 10 update app indicates the CPU is not supported. This makes no sense as this is a standard&nbsp; intel core 2 Duo&nbsp;CPU which should be more than adequate to run Windows 10.&nbsp; I have already upgraded an E 8200 and a friend has upgraded an E8500 CPU
 with the identical motherboard ( Asus P5K-E).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I uninstall the windows update app&nbsp;and re-install and try again? &nbsp;I originally had overclocked the CPU but&nbsp; returned all my settings to default in the bios. Still no luck passing the CPU test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most programs created for earlier versions of Windows will work in this version of Windows, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. You can run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter on most programs to detect and fix common compatibility
 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly refer to: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</a></strong> (information holds good for
 Windows 10 as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what the update contained, other than the fact that it totally hosed my wifi. Device manager reports that the "device cannot be started". Wonderful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to go back to an older firmware version? If so, how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does something like this happen when&nbsp;a single company has complete control of both hardware and software? A complete lack of ability to execute a product, in my opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unbelievable, Microsoft!</p>

            <p>Hi Giridhar,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding. &nbsp;my computers are in a workgroup, not a Domain. &nbsp;There are no errors when printing because I don't even see the printer as an option. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I remotely connect using Remote Desktop Connection, there is a document on the Host machine that I want to print. &nbsp;if i e-mail the document to myself, I can print from the client computer on my home printer so I know the printer works. &nbsp;If I remotely
 connect to the same user profile using Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection on my Mac, I CAN print the document on my home printer. &nbsp;This tells me 3 things: 1) the printer is working fine, 2) host machine is set up correctly to allow the print to be redirected
 across the Remote Desktop Connection and 3) the problem is NOT with the user profile on the Host machine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is this started happening after the above installs were installed on the Host Machine. &nbsp;I have reverted back to restore point just prior to the updates and everything works fine. &nbsp;However, this update is a critical update for security reasons
 and since this is my main work computer i need to have this update installed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi. I tried the things that you suggested but neither worked. When I open Windows Movie Maker and try to import video it says that import video could not find a compatible video device. When I open Windows Photo Gallery and click on file, the box that opens
 hasn't even got the video camera there. Cheers. Phil</p>

            download wmm2.6 follow the hack I created, you do not need to download anything other than wmm2.6 and the original wmm for XP..... paste xp files over the 2.6 version after you install 2.6&nbsp; and boom capture from video device will be an option..... pick
 analog and make sure you click the button that says composite even if it looks like it is picked click it anyway or else it reads the tv signal instead...... make sure to give me credit after you do this and find out it works perfect..... thanks

            Hi Douglas
<br />
<br />The advantages are few for the normal everyday user . . .
<br />
<br />You will be able to initiate a Remote Desktop session with another PC
<br />
<br />You will be able to encrypt your hard drive with Bitlocker
<br />
<br />More control over Windows Updates
<br />
<br />
<br />The upgrade to the Pro edition costs approx. $99 and the process is painless
<br />
<br />It takes maybe 10 minutes to upgrade, you personal files and 3rd party applications will remain untouched during the upgrade process . .

<p>Three points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is your Windows Home 32-bit or 64-bit? If it's 32-bit, you can't upgrade to 64-bit You would have to do a clean installation, and that means losing everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If it's 64-bit Windows Home, you *can* upgrade and by definition, upgrading means you wouldn't lose anything. But when you take a big step like an upgrade, things *can* go wrong, so it's wise to be sure you have an upgrade on external media of all your
 files that are important to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What advantages Professional will give you depends on you and what you do with your computer. But be aware that most home users wouldn't see any difference at all.</p>

<p>Not in Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>I suggest you download the free VLC Media Player it has a Convert Option under the "Media" controls setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get the 32 Bit version...it will work on a 32 OR 64 bit Computer and their 64 Bit version has some issues.</p>

            Hey ForThePeople,
<br />
<br />I've been hearing of this recently, it's not just you. It seems that "Set time zone automatically" may not work, you should perform changes to that registry entry.
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + R, a new Run box should open to which you should enter: regedit
<br />
<br />The Registry Editor should open. Navigate to the following path: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\tzautoupdate
<br />
<br />Now on the right, there should be a DWORD entry named Start. Click that, and change that to 3. I noticed that despite me setting mine to off using the normal way in settings, it was 4. 4 means on, 3 means off. Hope this helps, should that be proven fruitless, you can check the source for additional solutions. Good luck.
<br />

            Cool, thanks for the great instructions. I just followed all those steps, and all it seemed to do was turn set time zone automatically back on. I assume that this is what it was intended to do, but does that fix the problem of randomly changing time zones?

            Usually, this issue is caused when the Windows Time service has gone corrupt.
<br />
<br />If Date and time is changing automatically I would suggest you to follow the methods given below and check.
<br />
<br />Note: You must be signed in as an administrator to be able to change the date and time.
<br />
<br />Method 1:
<br />
<br />Check the status of Windows time service.
<br />
<br />a. In the desktop window, Press windows key + R
<br />
<br />b. Type services.msc in run window.
<br />
<br />c. From the services window find 'windows time' and double click on it.
<br />
<br />d. If service status is stopped, click on start and press ok.
<br />
<br />Method 2:
<br />
<br />Check if the correct time is set in the BIOS from the device manual.
<br />
<br />If you are not comfortable accessing the BIOS, please contact the device manufacturer.
<br />
<br />If you still have issues, contact the computer manufacturer and get the CMOS battery check.
<br />
<br />Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause
<br />
<br />serious problems that may prevent your tablet from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.

            I originally had it disabled because I had set my time zone manually, so it was set at 4, and then I changed it to 3 which turned auto time zone back on

            ForThePeople,
<br />
<br />You might want to switch it to 4, then, and see if the issues persist. Try disabling "Set time automatically as well" and synchronize it with a time server.
<br />
<br />I wouldn't be surprised to see a KB hotfix come about to fix this time zone issue too, since I've had a couple of people from Australia experiencing this since the April 2018 1803 feature update, so that might be something to look forward to.
<br />
<br />Another thing you can do is open an elevated Command Prompt session to use the tzutil binary.
<br />
<br />You can use the command like so: tzutil /s "Eastern Standard Time"
<br />
<br />Instead of standard time, use a timezone listed in the command (this will bring up a bunch of timezones): tzutil /l
<br />
<br />And you can use that name in the command with the /s switch to change it there.
<br />
<br />Keep me posted on this issue.

            <p>For your task bar concern, you can do and observe the methods provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Clean boot</p>
<p>Clean boot helps eliminates software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update when you run a program in Windows 10. You can follow the steps provided on this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: System File Checker</p>
<p>System File Checker helps to identify files that are possibly corrupted. Here are the steps to perform SFC:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click (or press and hold) the Start button, then select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Enter <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> (note the space between "sfc" and "/").</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>No U&#43;2011 Non-Breaking Hyphen in Cambria per Character Map - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gary in wv  say:</h3>
<h2>            No U&#43;2011 Non-Breaking Hyphen in Cambria per Character Map</h2>
                    Using Character Map, I see no U+2011 Non-Breaking Hyphen in Cambria.<br />
<br />
A co-vendor says he gets the same result with Character Map, but he sees it using some other font tool he has.<br />
<br />
Is the character there or not?&nbsp; Is the font damaged?&nbsp; (Keep in mind this other person hundreds of miles way also does not see the character using Character Map.)<br />
<br />
The font is version 5.96.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 64-bit.<br />
<br />
This is troublesome because the customer says we should be able to display this character, but my software agrees with Character Map that the character isn't there, so of course I can't get it to come out.&nbsp; (We are exporting XML to RTF.)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Gary<br />

            The customer has &amp;#x2011; in XML data.&nbsp; Because this is not found in the Cambria font, MS Mincho is being substituted.&nbsp; The customer is complaining about getting MS Mincho; the line breaking is of secondary importance to them.&nbsp; In case it is of interest,
 the software is Arbortext Editor by Parametric Technology Corp.&nbsp; I am developing an application to perform export to RTF.<br />
<br />
So this isn't about preventing line breaks by other means, since the customer does not want to modify their XML data, which was auto-generated by another process for which I am not responsible.&nbsp; (Different vendor; MANY megabytes of highly technical data; I
 don't feel at liberty to name the end customer.)<br />
<br />
So, the question is, does the Cambria font(s) (actually Cambria Math) have this character or doesn't it?&nbsp; Is there something wrong with the font?&nbsp; I think so, but I can't prove it, without a foray into the internals of TTC files, which I would much like to
 avoid.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

            The Cambira and Cambria Math fonts do not have that particular character. My suggestion would be to try and use a more universal character like what Jeeped suggested.<br />

            Thanks, Jeeped and David.&nbsp; For now, the customer is going to accept getting MS Mincho in their RTF output, even though I am seeing Word 2007 break after it.&nbsp; At some point I may have to figure out how to replace the character with \_ (RTF for unbreakable
 hyphen) as part of my RTF Export functionality.&nbsp; (They don't want to change their source XML.)<br />

    <title>The circle next to &#34;Welcome&#34; and &#34;Shutting Down&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shadow77&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            The circle next to &#34;Welcome&#34; and &#34;Shutting Down&#34; screens does not spin. Is there a fix&#63;</h2>
                    Hello. I've built my new PC last December and I installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit on it. I am very happy with the performance overall. However about a month ago the blue spinning circle in the "Welcome" screen and the "Shutting Down" screen has stopped
 spinning. Is there a fix for this? Why would it stop spinning all of a sudden? I am afraid that a malicious software could have caused this, even though I am extremely careful to what I install and I'm the only one using this computer. I have run some scans
 with my AV program and widows defender but it found no threats. Also the performance of my computer is still as good as it when I first installed windows. The only thing annoying me is the non spinning circle...<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help!

            Thank you for your reply. My computer is indeed very fast at boot and shut down. However, the blue circle was spinning before, and it does not now. (there has not been any performance loss however)<br />
<br />
I have not tweaked any "visual" settings in windows. And Now I tried setting performance mode on, and then using the settings for best appearance again, but the circle is still not spinning. Anyway, thanks again for your answer! I guess I'll just ignore this
 "problem" from now on.<br />
<br />
P.S.: Since one of my HDDs broke and I had to <u>temporary</u> replace it with an old HDD I had, the computer was taking longer to start up (the HDD that broke was SATA 3 and the one I replaced it with was an old SATA 2 HDD). It added at least a +4 second startup
 delay. The circle was still not spinning, even with the slow startup.<br />

            The SFC scan reported that all the files are ok, and did not fix anything. The circle is still not spinnig. However a message poped up on the startup of my computer saying that "An attempt to add the root certificate to all known browsers on your computer
 failed". I don't believe this has to do anything with my original graphical problem, so I will open a new thread if I keep getting that error. Thank you for all your help.<br />

    <title>Dual boot BIOS settings changed by windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harrosmit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual boot BIOS settings changed by windows update</h2>
                    <p>I have a very annoying situation: I am runnig my laptop (Acer Aspire E 15) as a dual boot with Ubuntu (Linux) and Windows 10. To do this I had to change the BIOS settings:</p>
<p>1. Enable the BIOS bootmenu "F12"</p>
<p>2. Adress a safe boot option (in my case the Ubuntu partition) and give it a name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good. Everyting worked. Until I installed a major Update from Windows Update... Suddenly Laptop didn't respond to the F12 button anymore during boot, but went straight away to booting Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to my (password protected!!) BIOS. I was flabbergasted to see that the Update of WIndows changed my BIOS settings back to the original settings!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I immediatly changed the settings back to my preferred settings and everything works fine again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But... How the f*** is it possible that Windows Update changes my BIOS settings? How can I prevent this annoying behaviour of Windows? Microsoft seems to act as if their OS is the only one there is. But every now and then I really need Linux!</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer, but in that case windows shoudn't boot at all and I would have to restore BCD (bootrec /rebuildbcd) in a recovery environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case windows booted fine however (after a 'hickup') but my BIOS was changed back to the basic settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me it is already annoying that I have to use the F12 button to boot Ubuntu at all. I would prefer to go straight to the grub menu to choose an OS, but that doesn't seem to be possible with this Laptop/BIOS.</p>
<p>Now that my secondary OS (Windows (only used by my daughters for their schoolwork)) changes my BIOS, I realised that this laptop wasn't the best buy after all. But does anyone have an idea how to prevent this behaviour after future updates?</p>

<p>Thanks again. But Windows doesn't even see the Linux partition or Linux bootloader.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07015836-662e-4940-aebe-ffc0810864a3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07015836-662e-4940-aebe-ffc0810864a3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all handled by the BIOS, I assume. But the Linux Bootloader and Linux Partition actually do exist!!</p>
<p>Please look at this picture of my partition layout:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62756eed-d53c-499d-a856-1b469249d6b0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62756eed-d53c-499d-a856-1b469249d6b0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>sdb5 is my Linux Partition</p>
<p>sdb3 is my Winows Partition</p>
<p>sdb1 seems to be the windows bootloader or the linux bootloader</p>
<p>But what f*** is sdb2 "Microsoft reserved partition"? No way to acces this. I can, of course, delete it but will it cripple the whole bootproces? Somehow I'm afraid this is actually my bios...</p>

<p>Typically when you receive this error it means that there is a temporary block on your account due to a violation of the billing terms of service. &nbsp;Usually this occurs when you have a credit or debit card stuck in a decline cycle. &nbsp;You probably had a subscription
 setup on your credit or debit card at one point and when Microsoft attempted to charge you, the payment was declined multiple times resulting in the violation on your subscription. A representative will need to transfer the outstanding balance to another payment
 instrument in order to lift the violation. Contact Xbox LIVE Support at 1-800-4MY-XBOX if you are in the US or Canada or go to
<a href="http://www.support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> if you are elsewhere.</p>

<h2>            Gibberish files with &#34;&#91;KeyList&#93; Count&#61;0&#34; inside</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>Leaving aside my failed Windows 7 x64 SP1 undo and subsequent redo (x3, long story which basically means I sort of kind of maybe have SP1 installed unless you prod it hard enough, and it insists sqmapi.dll is missing) I noticed in my Windows directory I
 have five gibberish files, four dated a month ago (created within ten mins of each other, and the last dated way back in November (I'd only had the laptop a month then and barely used it). They are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>$øž<br />
öM<br />
8ô4<br />
ôöì<br />
üóÖ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every one just says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"[KeyList]</p>
<p>Count=0"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>inside. Now, I had two trains of thought. One, virus/spyware/keylogger (my worst fear), etc. However I don't think so. Firstly because avast!, SUPERAntiSpyware and MalwareBytes! report nothing whatsoever back, plus I've not noticed any kind of adverse affect
 from these. My second thought was corruption, especially as I have a squeaky (but new) HD. I don't think so there either, because aside from the November one as I say all the others were created around the same time, whereas I would have thought with corruption
 they'd be <em>any</em> time, and the fact that - as far as I'm aware - there doesn't seem to be any in other (Windows) directories. Oh, nor (again, as far as I'm aware) are any of my general files corrupted, and a friend said it was more likely I'd have a
 load of 'found.001' directories in the root.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any guidance?&nbsp; I was tempted to use my Dell D: partition to factory restore but unless everything gets worse (more files going wonky, or there's suspicious activity, etc) I don't see the point.&nbsp; Plus if the HD is failing it'd be a waste of time.</p>

            No-one have any idea? I've tried Googling the phrase and only two people have asked about it before (both having gibberish filenames and the specific text inside). One reply to those suggested a virus scan, and the other mentioned perhaps a foreign language
 program was involved. I'm absolutely sure it's not the latter, and I really, really don't think it's the former. I don't understand why there's such a large gap between the November file and the mid-late Jan others. My brother said he didn't think it could
 be corruption because of the text inside - as it'd most likely be gibberish too if that were the case. I'm just stumped. I'm guessing maybe Windows/a general program having created them?

            Well, as I say one was in November and four last month, so not regularly, but I'd be interested to know if I'm going to get them every few months in a semi-regular way. I was just interested if anybody had heard of that inner-text phrase regarding the
 keylist count. When I do Google searches I see "keyList-&gt;count", "KeyList.Count" etc but not phrased in exactly the same way (or on its own in a gibberish-sounding file). When I first saw them I freaked and thought they were part of a keylogger or something,
 but it'd be the dumbest keylogger ever (and like I said, although virus scanners never pick up everything, avast!, SUPERAntiSpyware and MalwareBytes! all came up fine, and I've certainly not had anything stolen). I've moved the files for now and will wait
 and see if more appear any time. Anyone else come across this or the specific phrase inside the text? Thanks.

            <p>These files come from the Windows Live Setup process. Did a search and at that time of creation it was created by&nbsp; Windows Live.

<p>Although unfortunately I wish windows search would just go back to the window millennium phase.

<p>Is there really any privacy anymore? Win 10 is an open facebook live. Everybody is making money off of selling our information with others. You are not welcome Microsoft.</p>
