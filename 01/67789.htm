<h2>            audio issue - volume at 100&#37; after upgrading to Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>ORIGINAL TITLE:audio issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did upgrade install of win8 from dvd - kept win7 settings - I find it annoying that a volume level icon is constantly displayed top left of screen&nbsp; and worse, after doing MS update to audio it is set to 100 % and won't allow decrease - can it be fixed?<br />
If I can't get rid of this annoyance will it be a problem to revert to win7?<br />
thanks<br />
<br />

            <p>I had the same problem as "gitardood".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem seems to lie in the Volume Mixer control but uninstalling all audio drivers and trying again doesn't help. I have High Definition Audio 5.1 and Logitech USB speakers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can overcome the problem as follows. On the first Start screen (where Charms pop up menu also doesn't work),&nbsp;I use CTRL+ALT+DEL and in bottom right corner of that screen click on the power symbol and select "re-start". The computer works as advertised
 after the restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still haven't found what is causing the problem trying all of the above suggestions, but a restart as above always works - so much for the quick starting feature of Windows 8!</p>

    <title>Unable to wake docked laptop with usb mouse or keyboard. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to wake docked laptop with usb mouse or keyboard.</h2>
                    I have a new HP laptop running Windows Vista Home Premium OS 64 bit. This is hooked up to a Samsung monitor, usb keyboard and a usb Microsoft trackball. The lid is in a closed position and the laptop placed on a shelf which has 4" high clearance. My problem
 is that I can put the laptop to sleep from the keyboard but I'm unable to wake it unless I pull the laptop off the shelve and open the lid at least 3/4 of the way up, it doesn't respond to me cracking the lid and touching the touchpad or laptop keyboard. I
 didn't have this problem with my Toshiba laptop running Windows XP 32bit. Is there anything I can do to get it to wake it up using the usb peripherals?<br />

            Hi Matt,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
I've upgraded the bios firmware of the laptop to the latest post from HP Support. I checked out the bios and saw nothing about usb&nbsp;support. Tapping the power button is not an option also as it requires opening the lid wide. I've kind of worked around the problem.
 I've found a pcmci IR remote card that came with the laptop. It not only wakes it from a sleeping state when the lid is closed but it also will power it on and off! So my problem is solved with this work around.<br />
<br />

<p><span><span>Hi Jim54,</span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for using the Community Forum for Vista.</span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Usually, this is a hardware issue.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are comfortable with the BIOS, you can take a look at your manual first and see if there are options in the USB settings to allow
 it to “wake” the computer.</span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>Editing the BIOS can cause severe damage to your computer, proceed at you own risk.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Also, you should be able to tap the power button to wake up the machine.</span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps, let us know!</span>

<h2>            Event-The following boot-start or system-start drivers failed to load&#58;</h2>
                    
<p>My notebook locked up unexpectedly while uploading photos into Facebook.&nbsp; Restarting in normal mode does not work, but restart into safe mode w/networking is fine.
<br />
<br />
System specs:<br />
<br />
ASUS G51<br />
Intel Core Duo P8400 2.26 GHz CPU<br />
4.00 GB RAM<br />
nVidia GeForce 9800M GS 512MB video<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium x64 w/SP2<br />
<br />
Researching Event Viewer showed this error:<br />
<br />
The following boot-start or system-start driver(s) failed to load:<br />
aswSP<br />
spldr<br />
VET-FILT<br />
VET-REC<br />
VETEFILE<br />
VETFDDNT<br />
VETMONNT<br />
vmm<br />
Wanarpv6<br />
<br />
Additionally, there were several DCOM errors:<br />
<br />
1084 attempting to start the service Shell HWDetection with arguments<br />
<br />
1084 attempting to start the service EventSystem with arguments<br />
<br />
1068 attempting to start the service fdPHost with arguments<br />
<br />
1084 attempting to start the service WSearch with arguments<br />
<br />
In regards to the drivers that failed to load, over the last week, Event Viewer shows several instances where the VETxxxxx drivers shown above "were blocked from loading due to incompatibility with the system."<br />
<br />
Topping it all off, there is an occasional series of clicks and a beep from my hard drive where none were audible before.</p>
<p>I mistakenly posted this first on the Vista IT Pro forum, any answers from here would be most welcome.</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
1. What type of USB devices are these? E.g. Flash drives, external hard drive etc.
<br />
<br />
2. Which Windows troubleshooter have you performed to fix this issue? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Code 10 error pertains mainly to hardware and device driver issues or to compatibility issues between hardware drivers and additional software that is installed in Windows. Therefore, we recommend that you troubleshoot these issues by focusing on device
 drivers, on device configuration issues, and on hardware compatibility issues. You might need to update the chipset drivers and the USB controller.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: <br />
<br />
</strong></div>
<div>You may try deleting the USB "Upper Filter" &amp; "Lower Filter" Entry</div>
<div><br />
Before we go any further, please first backup the Registry.<br />
<div>Important: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</div>
<div><br />
For more information about how to back up and restore the registry in Windows:</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756</a></div>
<div>1. Click “<strong>Start</strong>”, type “<strong>REGEDIT</strong>” (without quotation marks) in the “Search” bar and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Note: If UAC (User Account Control) pops up, please accept it.</div>
<div>2. Right click “<strong>Computer</strong>” (the root node) in the left pane, click “<strong>Export</strong>” under the “File” menu, choose “<strong>All</strong>” under “Export range”, and select “<strong>Desktop</strong>” in the “<strong>Save</strong>”
 in box and type backup in “File Name”. Click “<strong>Save</strong>”.</div>
<div><br />
Note: The backup file is on the Desktop and named backup.reg. We can simply restore the registry by double-clicking the backup.reg file.</div>
<div>3. Click “<strong>Start</strong>”, type “<strong>REGEDIT</strong>” (without quotation marks) in the “Search” bar and press Enter again.</div>
<div>4. Locate the “UpperFilters” value under the following key in the registry:<br />
<div><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}<br />
</strong></div>
<div>5. On the “Edit” menu, click “Delete”, and then click “OK”.<br />
<div>6. Locate the “LowerFilters” value under the same key in the registry:<br />
<div><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}<br />
</strong></div>
<div>7. On the “<strong>Edit</strong>” menu, click “<strong>Delete</strong>”, and then click “<strong>OK</strong>”.<br />
<div>8. Quit Registry Editor and restart the computer.<br />
<div><br />
Also update the drivers in the device manager<br />
<div>Refer the link provided: <br />
<div><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Automatically get recommended drivers and updates for your hardware</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: <br />
<br />
</strong></div>
<div>Please refer to the following article and follow the troubleshooting steps listed.<br />
<div><strong>Description of Code 10-related errors that Device Manager generates in Windows-based computers</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/</a><br />
<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: <br />
<br />
</strong></div>
<div>If the issue still exists let us reset the usb controllers and check if the issue is resolved.<br />
<br />
<div>First, please disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:<br />
<br />
<div>a. Click "<strong>Start</strong>" button, type “<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>” (without quotation marks) in the “<strong>Search</strong>” bar and press "<strong>Enter</strong>". Click “<strong>Continue</strong>” if necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
b. In Device Manager, double click to expand "<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>", right click on the Host Controller, click "<strong>Uninstall</strong>" and click "<strong>OK</strong>".<br />
<br />
c. Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".<br />
<br />
<div>Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps! <br />

            <p>Hello Winston M,</p>
<p>I uninstalled all the USB Drivers, restarted my laptop and on inserting my spare mouse my laptop did indeed reload the usb drivers and everything is now working. Thankyou.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The culprit was a driver for a HP officejetpro that was uncomptable with my CPU (an AMD C-50 Rated at 1ghz). &nbsp;Windows7 64 bit, 4 gig of Ram.&nbsp;HP sent me a fix but as nothing would work I could not install it.</p>
<p>I still have not installed the printer. and again thankyou for your advice.</p>

<h2>            Still experiencing issues receiving messages in a single Skype chat</h2>
                    <p>Despite the Heartbeat message that connectivity issues have been resolved (http://heartbeat.skype.com/2017/07/skype_connectivity_problems_3.html), I'm still experiencing issues in one chat. I use multiple chats as part of my work but am experiencing issues
 where only one isn't updating. The issue occurs primarily in my Windows (7) client; my IOS chat appears to be updating now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>That would depend on so much information that you're <strong>not</strong> giving that it's impossible to answer (even if this is an Answers forum :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; ).</p><p>Your major might have something to do with what to look for. Are you a Journalism major, or maybe going for Engineering? Electrical or Mechanical?<br />Do you plan on a lot of gaming, or mostly social networks and email?</p><p>Much as I despise the Big Box stores for technical support and repairs, they make a good starting point for someone who's not too sure of what they want. Find someone there that <strong>seems</strong> to know what they're talking about, and grill them like they're a murder suspect :-) You don't necessarily have to buy from them, but write down their recommendations, then shop the 'net for the best price and after-sale service. Google and Bing are great for things like that, and for sellers' reviews to see what other people think about them.</p><p>Good luck and happy hunting!</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;SC Tom</p>

<h2>            Screen freezing and kicked out from games</h2>
                    <p>Hey people</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From around 2 weeks ago my Xbox One has been playing up in a variety of ways. Firstly I've been suddenly kicked out of games, screen freezing first then booted back to the dashboard (gears of war 4, ghost recon wildlands, fifa 17), &nbsp;but still able to hear people in the party. Once kicked,&nbsp;the dashboard becomes laggy and&nbsp;unresponsive which then results in me having to restart my console over and over again. This becomes very repetitive and time consuming. Can someone help me with a solution, would be greatly appreciated 😊</p>

            <p>Hey there zDiizaaHx.<br /><br />Really sorry to hear about the freezing and game troubles you're having. To start out troubleshooting, do you have your Xbox One in an open and well-ventilated? Be sure all vents have room to breathe, as it can cause some performance issues when playing for longer periods.&nbsp;</p>

            I have resolved my GTX780-DC2OC-3GD5 install problem by physically installing the graphics card, and going into the BIOs and making the Intel HD Graphics 4000 chip the Initial Video Boot device, I booted up Windows 8.1 in safe mode.&nbsp; In safe mode I was
 able to see my graphics card in Device Manager and I installed the GTX780-DC2OC-3GD5 drivers from the disk that was provided with the card.&nbsp; I went back into the BIOs and changed the Initial Video Boot device&nbsp; to Auto Select and I was able to use my graphics
 card.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

            <p>There is no way to automatically delete duplicate files,</p>
<p>You can verify the locations and see if there is a duplicate folder and just delete the folder or remove it from your library,<br />
Right click one of the duplicate files and click on Open file location,</p>
<p>Then right click the file the duplicate is of and do the same, Open file location.</p>
<p>Compare the locations,</p>
<p>Another way,</p>
<p>Click on the Blue file button and click on Include a folder,</p>
<p>Verify that the same location is not entered twice and causing the duplicate listings.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Scan and Fax will not allow me to select modem name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rlbuzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Scan and Fax will not allow me to select modem name</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 PRO version 1511 from Windows 7 and was trying to set up Microsoft Fax and Scan. I was able to send and receive faxes with Windows 7 , but for some reason it stopped working and I just never was able to find out why. Since the
 upgrade to 10 I tried again to work out the problems. No a days faxes aren't used as much as in the past, but there are times when it is a big advantage to have a fax.</p>
<p>What I am finding is that after going to 'tools' and 'fax settings', under the 'general' tab I am shown the name of the internal modem in my computer, in this case it is 'PCI Soft Data Fax Modem with SmartCP'. When I am asked to select the modem, the correct
 name appears but the select button is grayed out and will not allow me to select my modem.
</p>
<p>The 'send' and 'receive' options are checked and I have also checked 'automatically answer'.&nbsp; I've checked the phone line and it is active. I've done a diagnostic on the modem and the computer says it is operating correctly. I've also checked to see if there
 are any updates for modem drivers, but was told that the most up to date has already been installed.
</p>
<p>Another problem I have is that I am not able to configure a fax account. After going to 'tools' and then 'fax accounts' I am taken to a window asking me if I want to add a fax account.&nbsp; It will not allow me to enter the name of the account and if I select
 'add' I am taken to the next window which asks me to choose a fax modem or server. If I select the one which says that I want to connect to a modem inside my computer it takes me to the next window which asks me to choose a modem name. Entering the name of
 the modem and selecting 'next' I am taken to a screen which asks me how I want to receive faxes. If I select 'automatically' or 'notify me' I am taken to the next screen which shows a message of 'To send a fax you must first connect to a fax modem or server'
 and am told to see Help and Support on how to set up my computer to send and receive faxes. It is a never ending circle which does not allow me to enter much of the required information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am at a total loss of where to go from here and would greatly appreciate any help at all.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might be caused if the driver is not compatible with Windows 10. I suggest you to download the latest driver for the modem and install the same in compatibility mode by following the steps provided below and check for status.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Download the s<strong>etup files</strong> for the driver from the manufacturer website and save it on your local disk.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the
<strong><span>setup file</span></strong> of the driver and select
<strong><span>“Properties”.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
<span>“Compatibility”</span></strong> Tab.</span></li><li><span>Place a check mark next to<strong><span>“Run this program in Compatibility mode”</span></strong> and select operating system from the drop down list.</span></li><li><span>Let the driver install and then check the<strong><span>functionality</span></strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. I did go through Device&nbsp; Manager and located the modem information along with the current driver version. I attempted to update the driver by allowing Windows to search for a more up to date driver and the result said that I have
 the best driver for my device already installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a CXT PCI Soft Data Fax Modem with Smart CP, driver version 7.8.0.4.50, dated 5/6/2009.&nbsp; I have searched for a more current driver but can't find anything more up to date.&nbsp; I have found various sites that want to install a program to automatically
 scan my computer and check for driver updates, but I'm leary about using unknown and possibly questionable programs to make changes to my computer. I did go to the Conexant website but couldn't find any information on updating this device.
</p>
<p>I doubt that this had anything to do with the update to Windows 10.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier I previously had Windows 7 and the fax and scan app did work, but had stopped working some time ago.&nbsp; Since then I updated to Windows 10 and tried to get the fax
 program working again, but it shows the same problem that it did when it stopped working in Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though a diagnostics of the modem said that the device is working properly, I am thinking about replacing it anyway to see if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your input into this problem.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help in this matter. &nbsp;I doubt that my problem really has anything to do with the version of Windows that I am running. &nbsp;I originally had Windows 7 and at first the fax program worked great. Then for some reason it stopped working and started
 exhibiting the problems that my original posts described and I stopped trying to use it. &nbsp;Then later when I updated to Windows 10 I had the need to try to send a fax and tried it again. The fax program still showed the same problems that it had in Windows
 7 and still would not work.</p>
<p>In answer to your question, I have installed Windows 10 Pro, version 1511, OS build 10586.494. &nbsp;The computer is an HP Pavilion Elite with an Intel Core2Quad CPU Q6700@2.66GHz, has 8.00 GB of RAM, and is a 64 bit operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only error message I get is when I try to set up a fax account. When I go through 'tools' to 'fax accounts', when I click on the 'add' button I am immediately taken to the next screen where I am asked to 'choose a fax modem or server'. &nbsp;When I select
 'connect to a fax modem' because I am using an internal modem in my computer, I am sent to the next screen which tells me to 'choose a modem name'. The default name 'fax modem' is listed and when I press the 'next' button &nbsp;I have to 'choose how to receive
 faxes'. &nbsp;Selecting 'answer automatically' takes me to the message 'to send a fax, you must first connect to a fax modem or server. To see how to set up your computer to send and receive faxes, see help and support'. Pressing 'OK' removes that message, but
 that is as far as I can go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All diagnostics done through device manager show that the modem is connected and working properly. I have updated it with the latest driver that I can find, but still nothing. I have double checked and the phone line connected to the computer is good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than that I have no ideas of what to try next. Even though faxes aren't used that much today, there are still times when they are necessary things and to have a working fax machine would be of great help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are sorry that you are still facing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to&nbsp;follow the methods provided below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>:&nbsp;Run the Printer troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” in search box and press Enter.</li><li>Click on “<strong>View All</strong>” option on top left pane.</li><li>Select “<strong>printer</strong>” from the list and follow the prompts for troubleshooting.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>:&nbsp;Check if the issue persists in a Clean Boot state. <span>
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>* Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the link to view the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>

            <p>I have the exact same problem. Ever since the windows 10 update at the end of August, windows does not see my internal fax modem. I am convinced it has something to do with the anniversary update of windows 10 that happened at that time.</p>
<p>The device manager claims&nbsp;about my fax modem that "this device is working properly" and that the latest driver version is installed. &nbsp;Under "diagnostics" I can successfully query the modem. It also shows up under "devices and printers."</p>
<p>Using Windows Fax and Scan, scanning works fine as always; however, faxing does not. Going to Tools, Fax Accounts, I can click on "add," after which I can click on "connect to a fax modem," but when I do, the error message is "to send a fax, you must first
 connect to a fax modem or server. To see how to set up your computer to send and receive faxes, see Help and Support." There is absolutely nothing under Help and Support that would be any help or support.</p>
<p>A "clean boot" is recommended. Somebody wrote that such a clean boot "messed up his computer." How safe is a clean boot? It was also said that a clean boot did not fix this particular problem.</p>

<h2>            Call of Duty Ghosts loosing progress due to signout</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I just got the xbox one with COD Ghosts. There is my profile and my son's, i was thinking we could progress separately through the game.</p>
<p>However, when my son was playing he got signed out and the code above resulted.</p>
<p>Because of this he lost all his progress and it seemed whichever one of us is signed in the game has reset to my checkpoint.</p>
<p>Can someone clarify how the profiles work especially when kinect is involved in signing people in and passing the controller? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hey Colin,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear your son is having issues with his game.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of questions that will help us get a better idea on this:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Was there a message or error code when he got signed out? </li><li>Did he pass someone the controller? </li><li>Did someone enter the room and get auto signed in?&nbsp; </li></ol>

<p>Yes there was this code 0x87dd0019.</p>
<p>We tend to have turns when we are both there and yes sometimes someone walks in and gets signed in and it said the profile had been switched. I guess it's just kinect causing the issue? Maybe we should turn off auto sign in? Although I'd prefer not.</p>

<p>Either I have had no problem in the past logging into my XBox One CC app with my Comcast Xfinity login, or it's a new feature of the CC app to ask for a log in for some full episodes. Anyone know the answer to this?</p>
<p>I've definitely watched episodes of Broad City on my CC app in the past. In fact, I jut watched episode 1 of season 2. Went to watch episode 2 of season 2 and was asked to login in order to view. I tried but Comcast Xfinity isn't an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did as something change in the last 30 minutes?</p>
<p>Whats going on?!?!?</p>

<p>App availability will be up to your network provider. I recommend reaching out to Comcast if you're still unable to select them as a provider. This will also give them feedback that you would like to access content using their internet service.</p>

            Hello exploitguo,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!       
        </p>

<p>Well, the web version of MS Store seems to work well. However, the Win 10 MS Store app is just a total mess.</p>

            1. Download and run the problem solver for applications and the Windows Store: <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_apps10</a>
<br />
<br />2. Manually restore store settings:
<br />
<br />a) Press the Windows + R keys to open the Run window.
<br />
<br />b) Type wsreset.exe and press the Enter key to execute the command.
<br />
<br />3. Wait for the process to finish, restart your computer and check that it has been fixed.

The program you provided shows me: Windows Store cache might be damaged. But also got stuck when it tried to restore MS Store.</p>
<p>I manually restore the MS Store in settings-&gt;applications but that made no difference.</p>

<div>Whenever you change to a new version of Windows, you need to install</div>
<div>drivers (software that provides the interface between the hardware and</div>
<div>Windows) for printers, scanners, video cards, etc., that have been</div>
<div>written for that new version of Windows. And also note that you need</div>
<div>different drivers for a 32-bit version of Windows and a 64-bit</div>
<div>version.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It's up to the manufacturer of the hardware to write and make</div>
<div>available for download those drivers. Especially if your hardware is</div>
<div>older, it may well be that the manufacturer has decided that it's not</div>
<div>worth his time and effort to develop drivers for hardware that he is</div>
<div>no longer selling. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check with the manufacturer or on their web site to see if a driver</div>
<div>exists. If it doesn't, you're out of luck.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So in the future, before you do such an upgrade, be sure that you've</div>
<div>done the appropriate research to find out what drivers don't exist,</div>
<div>and therefore what hardware you will have to replace if you upgrade.</div>

<p>Hi shrosie,</p>
<p>Is this printer connected direct to the computer, shared from another computer, or a network printer?</p>
<p>You might try disabling your security software temporarily to see if it has an affect on the issue.</p>

<p>We all have this problem. We don't plug in the printer to the computer using the usb card, per the printed instructions. No tough questions to answer, please, it's a simple, routine, process which has worked many times, with ,many devices and many versions
 of Windows. HP F4280 Printer says Windows 7 ready, but using the latest update from the HP website, the software displays 'fatal error'. Many tries the same; when googling see many others with the same problem. Is it possible to simply plug it in and try to
 let Windows 7 install the correct drivers?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Activation on new device Digital License - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quentin clement  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Activation on new device Digital License</h2>
                    <p>Hello smarter people on the Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a question and i'm in desperate need for help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So since last week i have been working on my new laptop because my old laptop is out for an repair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have bought Windows 10 Pro and it has been activated on my older laptop and worked fine, but i do not recall how i activated Windows 10 Pro on that laptop. I assumed that it just activated because i bought it on that laptop not sure if this is correct
 but im pretty certain that it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now i want to activate Windows 10 Pro on my new laptop but Pro wont show in the windows store or at the activation screen in the Settings app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i click on show my account it clearly shows that i have bought windows 10 pro but all the links around it lead me to websites with errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So any ideas on how i could activate windows 10 pro on this laptop because i need hyper-v for my work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, Quentin Clement&nbsp;</p>

                    I have my video done...when I view it on the screen in the small version it will go from one song to the next but when I hit the little arrow to view it in full screen it will not go from one song directly to the next.&nbsp; I have to go back to go to the smaller
 screen and then start where I left off for the large screen viewing for every song.&nbsp; What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; I have tried the fade in and fade out for each song but nothing seems to be working.

            <p>Are you talking about the preview, or in your final movie?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The preview is just trying to give you an approximation of what the final movie will look like. But depending on the capabilities of your computer, it may not be able to keep up with giving you a real-time preview. This is especially true if you are previewing
 it in the full screen mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing to do is to actually save the movie (<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>
Save movie</strong>) to your computer. Then playback the movie in full screen. It should work fine in the final movie, even if it can't preview at that resolution.</p>

</p><p>Save the movie to your computer as a *movie*. Now play that movie back in Windows Media Player, VLC or similar. It should play the same way in all sizes without skipping.</p>

<h3> leopoldskotch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen - nvlddkm.sys</h2>
                    
<p>Last night my pc started throwing up errors saying that said somethign allong the lines of "nvlddkm driver has stopped responding but has successfully recovered". After that happened twice I updated my graphics card drivers to the latest version. Soon after,
 the screen froze and crashed.</p>
<p>This morning I woke up to the the pc on system repair mode. I tried to run a system restore from there but it didnt seem to work. I booted in safe mode and tried to do a system restore from there but to no avail. Now the pc wont even boot in safe mode. When
 I try boot normally it goes straight to blue screen.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure this is down to the graphics card. I have an Nvidia 7900 GS card. I would include more system information but I cant get at it while the computer keeps blue screening :(</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly apreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The Safe Mode tips are in case some of these help you to gain access to it - if so come back<br />
and try these.<br />
<br />
Can you use Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? Try Last Known Good Configuration.<br />
Or can you use Safe Mode with Networking?<br />
<br />
1. If the System has an add-in Video Card does it also have an on-board card? If so you can<br />
physically remove the 7900GS and enable the on-board in the BIOS.<br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 so watch the screen - check to see if you can enable<br />
on-board video (it may not have). Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom<br />
systems).</p>
<p>2. Can you access Safe Mode with networking to reinstall your driver? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.<br />
See methods below. Also see below to uninstall driver if needed and refer to&nbsp;video device&nbsp;maker's site.<br />
<br />
If not you will need to use&nbsp;Recovery Console&nbsp;(if you have) or a Vista boot disk. If you do not have a Vista<br />
disk you can borrow a friend's as they are not copy protected. Your system maker will also sell you the<br />
physical disks cheap since you already own windows. You can also make a repair disk - see below.<br />
System Restore and StartUp Repair often works from a Vista boot disk when it does not from Safe Mode<br />
or Recovery.<br />
<br />
Removing drivers manually &lt;-- try removing the Video drivers manually.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Sticky Notes Error</h2>

<div>
<p>Error Message:</p>
<p>"This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.</p>
<p>Please contact the application's support team for more information."</p>
<p>And then the sticky notes shut down, and if i try to restart them, I get the same error message.</p>
<p>My anti-virus program isn't affecting it, and the shortcut isn't corrupt. Also, the SFC scan isn't working. When I try to do it, it gives me this error message: "Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service." And I've tried to start a new
 user account, but the same problem happens in every account.</p>

<p>Thank you for all your help, and yes, there were viruses on my computer, eleven to be exact... I ran Windows Defender and a third-party anti-virus program endlessly, but they never found anything. So I ran Microsoft's Security Essentials, as you recommended,
 but it could only find the viruses, not get rid of them.</p>
<p>Among the sticky notes error came other issues, such as IE8 not working, old programs that had been uninstalled months ago were suddenly back and unable to be uninstalled this time around... and the list goes on. So in the end, with no way to purge the viruses,
 I recovered the system back to factory settings. In short: everything works now.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, regardless of the outcome. I do appreciate the fast the response time, even if, in the end, recovery became my only option.</p>

    <title>Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery causes random restarts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lord_dundy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery causes random restarts when unplugged</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few of us have been struggling with the following issue with basically brand new notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notebook: Acer V15 Nitro (<span>VN7-59</span><span>2G-747C) &nbsp;- it's 4 months old, been having this issue since it was bought.</span></p>
<p><span>OS: Windows 10 &nbsp;64 bit</span></p>
<p>ACPI driver version: &nbsp;10.0.10586.0 dated&nbsp;6/21/2006.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows and all it's drivers are a 100% up-to-date, so is the notebook's BIOS firmware.</p>
<p><br />
<span><span><span>Symptom</span><span>:&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
<span><span><span>Symptom</span><span>:&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As long as the charger is plugged in, everything works fine. However, w<strong>hen the notebook is running on battery, after the battery level drops to 30-50% sudden reboots can happen.
</strong>It is <strong>NOT a reboot cycle. Only one reboot happens at a time</strong>. No warning messages, no blue screen, no dump file created, Event Viewer shows absolutely nothing happening in the seconds before the reboot takes place. Once the first reboot
 happens while using the battery, it is likely to reboot again within 2-10 minutes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On the Acer Community site some experts have been trying to help figure out what could be causing it and it basically comes down to the famous "</span><strong>Microsoft ACPI Compliant Method Battery</strong>" under
 device manager. That's the driver that causes the instant reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>When that is disabled, the notebook work fine on battery, no rebooting takes place.
</strong>However, this is not a solution because without the ACPI driver we can't tell how much juice is left in the battery.</span></p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling &amp; reinstalling the most recent ACPI driver, it does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further details on everything I have tried to figure out what could help can be found on the Acer site:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://community.acer.com/t5/V-and-VN-Series-Laptops/Acer-Nitro-VN7-592G-747C-randomly-reboots-when-on-battery/td-p/427482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.acer.com/t5/V-and-VN-Series-Laptops/Acer-Nitro-VN7-592G-747C-randomly-reboots-when-on-battery/td-p/427482</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be hugely appreciated as this is &nbsp;very frustrating issue to have with a brand new notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi TimBMicro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is me, the same guy who made the original posts. For some reason MS messed up my forum subscription over the last few weeks and would not allow me to reply to this post until I added a new nickname - very strange..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, the service did some through testing and confirmed that it is not the RAM/CPU/HDD or the battery which is causing this - they did install a brand new battery which didn't help so don't bother.. They were about to install a new motherboard which is
 when I told that I wanted a brand new notebook as I did not wish to receive back a gutted notebook which I just bought 2 months before.. so after quite some struggle I got a brand new replacement notebook, the exact same model.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This one works just fine. It seems that this problem is definitely a hardware one.</p>
