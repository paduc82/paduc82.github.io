    <title>How do I install drivers for a shared printer on another machine. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I install drivers for a shared printer on another machine.</h2>
                    If I use "Add printer", I can find the Canon S820 printer, which is locally attached to another machine in my network.&nbsp; However, trying to install the drivers fails with:&nbsp; No driver found.&nbsp; Windows can't find a driver for Canon S820 on the network.&nbsp; The
 other option, is to look for a .inf file, which obviously doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
I even added the printer locally, even though it isn't attached, and used the Windows Update to get the correct drivers.&nbsp; I was hoping that after this, it would find the drivers when I, again, tried to add the networked printer, but it failed again, for the
 same reason.<br />
<br />
The machine the printer is attached to is still running Windows XP, and has the Canon supplied drivers installed, not ones from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
There are no drivers available, from Canon, for the printer, for Windows 7, as they expect the Microsoft ones to be used, and only provide an "add on" for those drivers.<br />
<br />
So, how do I install the official Microsoft drivers for this printer.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Eddie<br />

<br />
Since you can add this as a local printer try the following: go to the printers folder, Add a Printer, Create a new port, local port, then in the local port box type \\xpcomputer\printername with the appropriate share names for the XP computer and the printer
 share name.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 isn&#39;t activated yet, is this going to affect the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> briannaruiz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 isn&#39;t activated yet, is this going to affect the processing power of my PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So long story short, I got a new PC from a local internet cafe that was shutting down. These computers didn't have any sort of operating system on them, so I checked the Microsoft website to see what I could do. I downloaded the Windows 10 ISO, foolishly
 thinking that I could use the activation key from my old PC on the new one. Obviously, that's not the case, as it isn't an upgrade from 7/8.1. Now I need an actual activation key, and at this point everything is so convoluted that I'm willing to drop the $120
 just to get the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to the actual issue. I tried to run Sims 4 on the new PC, and it worked just as poorly as it does on my old PC. My question is, since Windows 10 isn't activated, is that going to affect how well the PC runs games? If it doesn't, I might as well just
 take the thing back and not bother dropping the $120 on the activation key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any sort of information that could help, I'd greatly appreciate it.</p>

            <p>So unfortunately I don't know the exact model as it's a couple years old and I bought it used, but the make is Cyberpower. As far as I can tell, it's one of the older Fang models.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to run the game, everything is laggy and unresponsive unless I put it on the lowest settings-- and even on the lowest, it's practically unplayable. There aren't any error messages, at least.</p>

            <p>Sims 4 never ran perfectly on my old PC either, so I'm definitely familiar with the issues it can have. I'm just worried I'm going to activate Win10 and it won't do anything for me and I'll be stuck in the same boat again, just with much less money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for system specs, I'm not a hundred percent sure. Like I said, i bought it used and the only thing I can tell you is that is has an EVGA motherboard and graphics processor. I know for a fact it's strong enough to run the game (I tested it out at the cafe
 before bringing it home) which is why I was worried Win10 was the issue. But now I'm not so sure.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Fair enough, but if there are no Win10 specific drivers for this unknown hardware the machine will
</p>
<p>not be suitable (as in more prone to instability and reduced performance) for gaming with Win10.</p>
<p>If Win10 drivers for the motherboard and graphics processor are available from the mfg's web site</p>
<p>downloading and installing them may help.</p>

<div><br />
Place the computer in clean boot and see if it helps. </div>
<div><br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista&nbsp; by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: Follow <strong>step 7</strong> to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.

<div><strong>Note</strong>: Identify the program which causes the issue by performing the steps from the link suggested above.
<div><br />
Hope this information helps. <br />

<h2>            South Park explained the scam behind WoT, as well as every other free-to-play game &#38;amp&#59; it was hilarious&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>If you haven't seen "Freemium isn't free", yet....you NEED to see it!</p>
<p>We all laughed so hard, because it was 100% on target. (If you haven't seen it, then I'm not going to spoil it for you.)</p>
<p>They had that school black board-style presentation that was conveniently hidden behind the curtain. It showed the fundamental elements of the scam, in hilarious fashion!</p>

<p>The BEST part is that you KNOW exactly to whom they refer if you are reading this forum!</p>

<p>Oh...it's FREE for me, because I had this worked out long before those South Park comedic geniuses...but they did a FANTASTIC job on the episode! (A+!!!)</p>

<p>then why do you like playing the world's worst game? I think it's a wonderful game with decently built mechanics and lots of balance. There are a couple issues here and there but I have never had any real problems, ever. around 8k games and 5k in light tanks
 I always have a blast of fun when playing. sucks I can't play anymore right now....</p>

<p>It's hilarious how you call it the world's worst game!</p>
<p>You REALLY need to watch that South Park episode, so that you can see yourself as we see you!</p>
<p>Did you pay $$$ for a game that South Park said wasn't worth 40 cents???</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>I've seen that episode. Ive seen all south park episodes. It's pretty funny, yes. But it doesn't refer to tanks personally. I think it's making fun of that simpsons game but I'm not sure cause I don't have a fancy phone and don't play stupid phone games.
 I don't think it's the world's worst game like the guy posted earlier. I really enjoy it... or did until I lost gold account. &nbsp;I fiend for it regularly now. Suffering from constant withdrawls of not being able to whoop major *** in my light tanks against higher
 tier scrubs.</p>
<p>never spent a dime on this game either. It's all knowledge and skill!</p>

<p>
</p><p>World unlimited mins mobiles and landlines - 1 month is a <strong>calling subscription</strong>, not Skype Credits.
<br />
</p>
<p>Previously, Skype offers calling subscription with Skype number/s included on the package. However, that has been phased out since Skype updated it's products and prices offered on the website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just purchased you Unlimited World subscription, possible that it doesn't include Skype numbers in it and therefore, there's a need for you to purchase Skype number separately.&nbsp;To check, you may log in to your Skype account on Skype website, click
 your calling plan and see the description.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clarifies your concern. Let us know if you need further assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Pire console jamais vu </h2>
                    
<p>J'aimerais savoir si quelqu'un a une one qui fonctionne correctement ? &nbsp;Pour moi c'est la pire m.... que j'ai jamais vu. Rien ne fonctionne, la synchronisation des données avec le cloud échoue constamment, &nbsp;donc tu ne peux pas jouer avec plusieurs &nbsp;jeux
 , &nbsp;la plupart du temps les succès ne s'affichent pas dans ton flux. Les serveurs de halo 5 plantes souvent, donc déconnecter du jeu et microsoft a le front de te bannir du jeu pour 30 minutes vous avez quitter le jeu trop souvent etc etc. Ce serait trop long
 d'énumérer tous les problèmes de cette console. Tu téléphone au service xbox plus incompétent que ça c'est impossible à trouver, jamais réussi à réparer quoique ce soit. Comment on peut se faire rembourser pour l'abonnement ? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Exact la One t'indique facilement si tu tombe en reseau strict ou carement port fermé &nbsp;avec ton routeur/modem....</p>
<p>Jai eu ce meme probleme au debut pour me rendre compte que c'est Videotron le probleme.... tu paye full $$$ pour illimité et de la fause représentation.... IL controle la bande passante en heure de pointe ....c'est sur!! leur reseau de cable de cuivre pseudo
 &nbsp;Hybride &nbsp;est engorgé et sur saturé..... </p>
<p>on est 3 ici, et on utilise min de 1To a 2To de bande passante par mois, mais le hic c'est qu'on reste en bloc appartement de de 18 logie sur un quadrilatère qui comporte des dizaines de bloc du genre sans compté les commerce.... alors le reseau est instable
</p>
<p>presentement c'est impensable de jouer Battleborn ou Overwatch en apres midi si je suis pas seul a utilisé la connection dans l'apparte sinon faut que je reset les adresse ip tout le temps... ca devient ok jusqu'a temps que videotron envoye leur ping de
 vérification automatisé au heure... </p>
<p>Bref, avant de dire que c'est une console de marde sur un forum officiel, renseigne toi.... ca fait la meme chose avec la ps4 en passant ;)</p>

<h2>            my speakers are sounding very low</h2>
                    i was playing a movie on my laptop at volume levels of 85%. no external speakers or headphone was connected. everything was fine when suddenly the volume of internal speakers went too low to be audible. now when i listen songs the quality is not at all
 good. and above all at 100% the sound is like it was at 50%. i never increased volume levels such high. this may be the second time. i always listened to songs at 40-50%. i increased the volume as my friend was also with me and the movie volume was low ( generally
 i always use a headphone). also it does not sound that clear now. it also crackles a bit. the voice of my favorite singer now seems a mess to me. i have tried to change each and every setting but to no use. my laptop warranty expired just 2 weeks ago :-( .the
 drivers are also up to date.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update - Now my dual monitors do not work</h2>
                    <p>After the most recent Win 10 update I found one of my monitors did not work.&nbsp; While searching for a solution, I assigned the non working monitor as primary (bad move, I know), now I have neither monitor lit, so I cannot make any changes on screen.&nbsp; For now
 I am searching for a solution to 'undo' and to reassign the once working monitor as primary via keyboard or something else.&nbsp; The once working&nbsp;monitor is attached to the internal video card.&nbsp; The monitor that is now primary (and didn't work after the update)&nbsp;is
 attached using an external card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the basic stuff that I know of.&nbsp; Detaching, rebooting, etc., with no success, so this solution will need to be more obscure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>UPDATE: One day later, after a cold start, and I find that the problem hasn't been resolved!
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm back to signing out, which seems to enable/initialise the second monitor correctly, then signing back in again, and everything is then fine for the rest of the session. Hopefully, this may offer an expert some clues as to the root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FURTHER UPDATE: Whilst signing out then in again resolves the issue, so does a reboot - I'm beginning to wonder whether this is a hardware issue (ie faulty second monitor), and the timing of the Windows 10 update was coincidental ...</p>

<p>My problem seems to have been resolved by some recent Windows 10 updates, on Nov 15, the latest ones being KB4049011 and KB4048954. I've since booted up my machine a handful of times, and both monitors are working correctly from the outset.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Things may have improved for a short while, but now my monitors' capabilities are not recognised, and I'm stuck with a single monitor, and poor screen resolution. Did the Creators' update consign my graphics card to the bin?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE, 30 Nov: My original video card was not officially supported at Windows 10, although it had worked perfectly since Windows 10 was introduced. When it started mis-behaving, immediately after the Creators' update, I couldn't get hold of a driver update
 for Windows 10. Now I've replaced the graphics card with one supported at Windows 10, and everything is now ok.</p>

<h2>            Why does MS offer RDP 5.2 updates for XP SP3&#63;</h2>
                    Why does MS offer RDP 5.2 updates for XP SP3? SP3 ships with 6.1 so why does Microsoft continually release 5.2 updates alongside 6.1 updates?<br />
<br />
This can be seen in... <br />

            I found the answer myself...<br />
<br />
Here are my findings. I started with SP0 RDP 5.1.<br />
Upgraded to SP2. 5.1<br />
Finally found an installer for 5.2 at <a href="http://www.petri.co.il/download_rdp_5_2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.petri.co.il/download_rdp_5_2.htm</a> (you must scroll down a bit to <a href="http://www.petri.co.il/software/rdp52_win2003_sp1.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>Download RDP 5.2 (local download - 677kb)) and installed it. I searched MS for 5.2 and could not find any.<br />
Installing petri's 5.2 it installed 5.2 in Program Files. msts in system32 was unaffected. So you have both versions.<br />
Installed SP3 and it deleted petri's 5.2 from Programs Files. System32 was upgraded to 6.1.<br />
Tried to reinstall 5.2 and it succeeded in installing it in Program Files. So now you have 6.1 and 5.2.<br />
<b>Went to Windows Update and indeed an update for 5.2 was shown</b>.<br />
<br />
So in the end 5.2 does not come with any service packs. It's not a stock thing in XP but
<em>can</em> be installed from petri's website.<b><br />
EDIT: </b>or from<b> </b>windows 2003 install CD: MSRDPCLI.exe in SUPPORT\TOOLS.(thx to allen2 for that tip.)<br />
Once I new the filename, I found it in MS's downloads....<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=856</a><br />

<h3> scoutxlt  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Reinstall&#34; DRM License after Custom Upgrade from XP SP3-32Bit to Windows 7 PRO-64Bit</h2>
                    
<p>I am in the process of "Upgrading" my custom built tower, from 32Bit XP SP3 to 64Bit Windows 7 PRO and came across the warning about my DRM license, and needing to re-install said license. Since my system was "Custom Built" and parts &amp; software were all&nbsp;purchased
 individually, a bit over a year ago I frankly don't recall exactly&nbsp;how I handled the licensing originally. Thus I suspect I'm going to need to gain either new or renewed DRM Licensing for my system, media players, and DVD Drive{s} Where do I get the DRM Licence
 I will need for Video &amp; Audio files I currently own, have downloaded or purchased... Some are iTunes files that I believe I just have to "Authorize" the system at their "Store" and I'll be set, along with their file backup I have performed.</p>
<p>BUT, my real concern is over my DVD-RW[s] a pair of which are installed in my system tower, and the video files I have saved or otherwise purchased in my backup for XP, via the File Migration software provided by Microsoft for the purpose. My primary media
 software is NERO... and I suspect that when I reinstall that it may handle the licensing, but I'm not completely sure.... I know when I did it originally, NERO tried to get me to purchase their New version,&nbsp;all but a few months after my purchase of the "Full"
 Version of NERO I&nbsp;currently own... I suspect they will attempt the same again... were I to "update" their software. I have never had ANY luck getting&nbsp;Customer Service responses from them, as I recall I tried for a couple months with no reply what so ever...
 [<em>Needless to say I will not be making a&nbsp;"Full Version" purchase of their products again...</em>]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance on this situation would be most appreciated, following the Help File instructions I was directed to "Call" Microsoft Customer Assistance and was provided with a phone number, but they are not available today... [Sunday AM EST] so I am resorting
 to the Forum in the hopes of resolving this issue so I can continue my Upgrade today... Thank You!</p>

<p><span>Hi Scouttxit,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may use Windows Easy transfer to move your music files from Windows XP computer to Windows 7 computer. Windows</span><span>
 Easy Transfer moves your music and video files, including files protected by digital rights management (DRM), but it doesn't move the licenses for these types of files. To re-obtain rights to the files, you'll need to contact the provider of the files. Some
 online stores offer this and might refer to it in different ways, such as </span>
<em><span>computer activation</span></em><span>,</span><em><span>computer
 authorization</span></em><span>,</span><em><span>library restoration</span></em><span>,
 or</span><em><span>license synchronization</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>The procedure for restoring your rights varies from store to store. The store might limit the number of times that you can restore your rights, or limit the number of computers on which
 you can use the songs or videos that you've obtained from them. Some stores don't permit you to restore rights to DRM‑protected files at all. For details about store policies, refer to your store's customer support or Help information. If your music or video
 was obtained from a store that's no longer in business, you won't be able to restore your rights to that content.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you're using<span>Windows</span> Media Player, you can add online stores and try to re-obtain rights to your music
 by doing the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on&nbsp;<span><span>Start</span></span>
 button, click <span><span>All&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Programs</span></span>, and then click&nbsp;<span><span>Windows</span></span><span><strong>
</strong></span><span><span>Media Player</span></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the&nbsp; Player Library, click the
 arrow to the right of&nbsp; <span><span>Media</span></span><span><span>Guide</span></span> at the bottom of the navigation pane, and then click&nbsp;<span><span>Browse
 all online stores</span></span>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click your store, install the store
 software, and then click a customer service or account management link on the store's webpage.</span></p>

<p>I live in the U.S. and will be traveling to France. I want to confirm the dialing scheme for making a toll free call (French number) while I’m in France. Would it be just the regular number: 0-800-xxx-xxx or do I need to utilize the 011 exit code/country
 code, like 011 33 800… ?</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Shipping Packaging Query&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, <br />
<br />
So I have to send my Xbox One in for a warranty repair.&nbsp; I've registered it online and printed out the label and whatnot.&nbsp; I was wondering though, can you use the original box the Xbox One came in as a shipping box?&nbsp; Or is it better to go out and buy a proper
 postage box?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello allebaker,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you for the response.&nbsp; I would first see if your laptop has a built in diagnostics test, installed by the manufacturer.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp; I would confirm all drivers, firmware and BIOS updates are at the latest from the manufacturers website.&nbsp; If you are still
 having this issue,&nbsp; I would then contact the manufacturer directly and/or look at the forums from the manufacturers website.</p>

<h2>            Additional free space is needed on the drive where windows is installed. Clear some space and try again.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, so what happened is I was updating the drivers for my graphics card, the install went smoothly and windows said I needed to reboot my machine for the effects to take place, so I do so and now I get some stuck with a stop code: INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE
 (as can see in the picture) so after rooting around and trying out different methods I decide to try and reset the machine and when I try that, is when I get the error message for the lack of free space available. I've have a look around on the internet and
 I have not found a solution for my problem. If anyone is out there I would really appreciate some guidance on how to solve this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, just wanted to inform you that I have managed to fix my issue, not through the method gave but with alternative option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If at all curious about how I solved my issue, all I did was install Ubuntu onto a USB stick and ran it through bios. Grabbed everything I needed and then did a full reinstall of windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it doesn't solve the issue I had, but it is a workaround to get any files needed before reinstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do appreciate the time you spent helping me figure out a solution and wish you all the best.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Automatic repair loop, but nothing works&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I left my pc on while I went out into the city and when I came back, it was on the blue screen 'automatic repair'. I clicked restart to see if it would fix it but it would just go back to the same screen over and over again. so then I clicked 'advanced
 options' and 'continue' but still the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a little while I searched for fixes on the internet but none of them work. I didnt want to lose my files, but even in the end I tried resetting the pc and removing everything but it just comes up with 'there was a problem while resetting your pc'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated, but I do really want to keep my files so if there is way I'd be so happy, if not then its alright.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Travis,<br />                 Do you have access to a Windows 10 recovery disk? You can use it to repair the installation. Also, if pressing F8 at startup, does it bring up the repaire menu?

            Hi TravisXY 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Seems the current image on your PC is beyond repair.
<br />What you will need to do is find another PC that has windows 10 on it and create a Windows 10 USB media.
<br />Then boot to that and do a fresh clean install making sure to format drives.
<br />See link by Greg on how to do a clean install.

            <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern&nbsp;and we will&nbsp;provide the assistance required to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the information that you have provided, I would suggest that you click on the link below and try to download and install the driver for your printer manually and check if you receive the same error.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/product/HP-Officejet-6300-All-in-One-Printer-series/1120059/model/1120060/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/product/HP-Officejet-6300-All-in-One-Printer-series/1120059/model/1120060/drivers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>KB 3133431&nbsp;</strong>is related to Windows Flash player. To manually update the driver, follow the steps below.</p>
<p>1. Click on the link <a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Microsoft Update Catalog.</strong></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;You will get a prompt to install a plug in, install it.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Once its done, you will get a search bar, enter the KB number in that bar and you will find the update thatbis required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.&nbsp;</p>
