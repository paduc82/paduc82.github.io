Clean Install Windows 10</a> on either of those laptops and have a much better install than either the Upgrade or the Factory install which are such inferior installs most tech enthusiasts would never run either in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new PC should have the Windows 10 Product key permanently embedded in BIOS and the older PC should have permanent Windows 10 Digital Entitlement in MS Activation servers if Windows 10 ever activated on it so that it will reactivate after going online.&nbsp;
 If the old laptop never was activated with Windows 10 I will help you get it activated since you had made the attempt before.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>In addition you can also use the new tool to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10startfresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Many thanks for&nbsp;this - much appreciated. I'm determined that I will have my other laptop up &amp; running before the end of the year (2016!) and will happily take up your offer of help, and similarly from Monkey57 and others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to do it in stages - the obvious one is to first install Win10&nbsp;updates and then Norton etc updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I right in thinking that I'll have to install every Win10 update separately as I did in Win 7 i.e. check the date of the last update installed and then install the next oldest? (Someone suggested to me that I could simply install the latest update, then
 run 'check for updates' again, hence my confusion.)</p>

    <title>After performing Windows update sound is not working. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After performing Windows update sound is not working.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: </strong><em>Update Issues?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello! So, my PC updated last week and everything seemed ok. It was running really slow two nights ago so I restarted it, which I don't normally do. When it came back on the sound will not work. "The Audio Service is not running." Except that it says it
 is...that means I can't play any games either. I can't get a single game or program that requires sound to open, i.e. Windows Media Player. When I try to play audio I get "Server Execution Failed." As if that's not enough, Control Panel will not open at all.
 Windows Update will not work. I got system restore to work, went back to before the update and still nothing. I keep trying to chat with a specialist, but it just says loading and nothing happens. If one isn't available it seems the page is fine. I tried the
 sfc /scannow, but it just goes to a blank line with the blinking cursor. This happened with an update a few months ago, except it was video, then two weeks later everything was just fine again. I don't want to go two weeks again without video, audio or games.
 Please help me fix this because right now Windows H8. is killing me! I would chop off my pinkie for a copy of XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            I have an HP Pavilion TouchSmart 14-b109wm. I have no idea what the update was before that. It was up to date including all optional updates before 10/4/2014. I ran System Restore to that date, but it didn't do any good. I found a way to get to the Control
 Panel. If I go to System I can go up a level then choose from the side menu, but if I click Control Panel it goes to a blank page and won't load, respond or close. I followed the instructions you gave me, but the High Definition Audio Device came back upon
 restart (twice actually), but the Intel HD Audio didn't come back. It still doesn't work. I have downloaded all drivers again and will restart.

            After downloading all audio drivers, well both of them, it still says "The Audio Service is not running." Control Panel is also still freezing, it requires Task Manager to close. It also becomes unresponsive when I attempt to update the new drivers or
 when I attempt to go to Windows Update. On Task Manager Services Audiosrv is stopped. In Services (not the tab, the services) it says running. I just don't understand what's going on. I haven't downloaded anything or installed anything in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If issue still persists please try </span></span><span>to check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run

            <p>Hello Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you logged in as an Administrator?</p>
<p>Which security software is installed on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have AVG security software installed then there might be a chance that issue is caused by that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to <strong>disable </strong>it <strong>temporarily</strong> and perform
<strong>clean boot</strong> too and then check the status. You may refer to the thread provided below for more clarification. In the thread mentioned below the cause of the issue was AVG security software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/windows-audio-cant-be-started-error-1740/d94003a0-aee9-44a0-9d0d-a8931fd45462">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/windows-audio-cant-be-started-error-1740/d94003a0-aee9-44a0-9d0d-a8931fd45462</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to <strong>disable security software temporarily</strong> and then see if it helps.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:&nbsp;<em>Antivirus
 software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.
 If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2 </span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to
<strong>perform clean boot.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></span></strong></p>

            Hi Joyce.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI, UEFI is enabled, CSM disabled, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, if necessary disable Secure and Fast Boot until after install:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands,  each followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Make sure to follow the setup steps in the first link tutorial to complete your install.  Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the first linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

    <title>Why is the shrink partition so small&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankstar10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is the shrink partition so small&#63;</h2>
                    So I go Computer Management, Disk Management, go to my primary hard disk, right click and click shrink volume. So it takes like 5 minutes &nbsp;then a window pops up asking me to select how much MB I want to give the new volume. The problem is that the size
 of available shrink space is&nbsp;433 MB. I would like to know why it says this when I have 629 GB free on my primary hard disk. Also is there a way to fix it? Here's a pic to show what I'm talking about (I would recommend you click it):&nbsp;http://i.imgur.com/voodD.png

            <p>You can only shrink the drive to the point where the NTSF volume information is located as it can not be move.</p>

<p>I created an acount via xbox.com several months ago, and today when I was trying to set up Xbox Live via my 360 I get a message saying my gamertag is already in use every single time I try to log in using my E-Mail and Password used to create my account.</p>

<p>Hey OranShingar! Can you explain a bit more what you mean? By "Character" name do you mean Gamertag? Can you list out how many different Gamertags you've created and WLID accounts you've created. For example:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Gamertag A is linked to WLID A</em></p>
<p><em>Gamertag B is linked to WLID A</em></p>
<p><em>etc.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure not to list any actual Gamertags or WLIDs for personal safety!</p>

            <p>In this case, you can try removing the specific update (if you are certain which was that update) that caused the issue and see if that helps. To remove an update manually, follow the steps below:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click "Start" and go to "Control Panel".<br />
2.&nbsp;Click "Programs" and navigate to "Programs and Features" -&gt; "View installed updates".<br />
3.&nbsp;Click the update that you want to remove, and then click "Uninstall".<br />
<br />
Additionally, if you do not want Windows to download and install updates automatically, you can turn off automatic updating by following the steps below:<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Windows Update by swiping in from the right edge of the screen (or, if you're using a mouse, pointing to the lower-right corner of the screen and moving the mouse pointer up), tapping or clicking "Settings", tapping or clicking "Change PC settings",
 and then tapping or clicking "Update and recovery".<br />
2.&nbsp;Tap or click "Choose how updates get installed".&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp;Under "Important updates", choose the option that you want.&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp;Under "Recommended updates", select the "Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important updates" check box.&nbsp;<br />
5.&nbsp;Under "Microsoft Update", select the "Give me updates for other Microsoft products when I update Windows" check box, and then tap or click "Apply".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, you may consider performing System Restore to restore your system to an earlier point in time when the game was working fine. To know how to do this, follow the steps mentioned under "Restore your PC to an earlier point in time"
 section on the link below:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, you may need to reinstall the game and see if that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will help you.<br />

            I agree!&nbsp; I HATE Bing, and suddenly one day after an automatic update, BING replaced my Google!!&nbsp; I didn't ask for it, I didn't want it, and it took me 2 weeks to totally get rid of it!&nbsp; Every time I deleted it following the directions I got, it would
 reappear.&nbsp; I finally got a friend who works on computers to get rid of it!&nbsp; Now, everytime I try to open a program, this message for a RECOMMENDED update comes on.&nbsp; There is a statement that says click HERE if you don't want it, I click it, but it won't go
 away.

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build

            Hi Jashanpreet, please see if you can get into the Windows Recovery Environment:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Hi!
<br />
<br />My name is German, and I am here to help you.
<br />
<br />Depending on how you got your copy of Windows 10, you'll need either a 25-character product key or a digital license to activate it. A digital license (called a digital entitlement in Windows 10, Version 1511) is a method of activation in Windows 10 that doesn't require you to enter a product key. Without one of these, you won't be able to activate your device.
<br />
<br />Where to find your product key depends on how you got your copy of Windows.
<br />
<br />Select any of the following to see more information:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10749/windows-10-find-product-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10749/...</a>
<br />
<br />Any other questions I am at your disposal.
<br />
<br />Have a great day!

            Hi Nischal
<br />
<br />The screenshot indicates your PC is somehow running the volume licence version of Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />Is your PC second hand or was Windows reinstalled by a PC Repair Shop?

            Hi ,
<br />
<br />My name is Edward, an independent advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />The 0x80070020 error may be caused by windows system files damage. The corrupted system files entries can be a real threat to the well being of your computer.
<br />
<br />
<br /> Solution
<br />
<br />1) Start your computer and log on as an administrator.
<br />
<br />2) Click the Start button then select All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, and then click System Restore.
<br />
<br />3) In the new window, select "Restore my computer to an earlier time" option and then click Next.
<br />
<br />4) Select the most recent system restore point from the "On this list, click a restore point" list, and then click Next.
<br />
<br />5) Click Next on the confirmation window.
<br />
<br />6) Restarts the computer when the restoration is finished.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Kind Regards.

    <title>Halo&#58;Combat Evolved Demo Server list problem in Multiplayer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mastermind159  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo&#58;Combat Evolved Demo Server list problem in Multiplayer</h2>
                    Few days before, I played halo multiplayer demo and it worked fine, but by mistake I uninstalled Gamespy arcade which is required to play that game multiplayer. Forgetting that I have uninstalled Gamespy arcade, I went onto play the halo multiplayer, but
 when I clicked the "get list" button, no servers at all showed up. Then, I downloaded Gamspy arcade thinking that the reason might be the uninstallation of Gamespy arcade. But, even after installing Gamespy arcade, there were no servers displaying. I unistalled
 and reinstalled the game and gamespy arcade many times, and from different websites, but still no servers are showing up. I am really frustrated. Please help me to solve this problem. Thanks.<br />

            Thanks for the reply. The first link you sent is not useful at all because it lists the solutions if you have the full version of Halo. In the second link, the one thing I am interested in doing is changing the Port and network settings. Please guide me
 on how to do that. Thanks.<br />

            Ok, if u don't have any good advice don't bother answering. I'm aware that intuit made to product. I'm also aware that this error 1935 is a windows error that a lot of people have had problems with. I talked to Microsoft last night and they said they could
 fix it, but I'm not willing to pay $99.00 for a fix on something that is less than 6 months old. Now I'm sure you have nothing better to do than sit on MS forums all day and act like your some computer guru, but as states before, if you don't have a legit
 way for me to possibly fix this problem myself then go away.

    <title>Very slow printing. Spooler problem&#63; Tomeout Problem&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> howiepj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very slow printing.  Spooler problem&#63;  Tomeout Problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Up until recently printing a document would happen almost immediately and the whole document would be printed with no delays or hesitations.&nbsp; At some point all this changed.&nbsp; It now takes 120 seconds for the printer to begin printing.&nbsp; In addition the printing
 is in fits &amp; starts - it appears to print one line at a time with several second delays between lines.&nbsp; During this time the 'Properties...' button in the PRINT box takes a long time to open and the PRINTER's Status box says 'Printing; 1 Document(s) waiting'.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the problem occurred when I was obliged to install Adobe Acrobat Reader DC when I download a tax form.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I have an HP e9250t running Windows 10.* The printer is a Lexmark 2600 series connected via USB.&nbsp; Device manager says "This device is working properly", and says the driver is up to date.&nbsp; This is a generic printer driver - Lexmark says it has no drivers
 for Windows 10.<br />
</p>
<p>I've tried...</p>
<p>* Uninstalling Adobe Acrobat (I end up reinstalling it).</p>
<p>* I sent a document to be printed without any paper loaded in the printer.&nbsp; I then waited quite a long time before I loaded paper, at which point the whole document was printed immediately &amp; without any hesitations.
</p>
<p>* I Reset the printer to factory defaults</p>
<p>* I uninstalled the printer &amp; re-installed it.</p>
<p>* I tried to update the 'UBS Printing Support' controller but it says it's up to date.</p>
<p>* I've run SuperAntiSpyware, MalwareBytes AntiMalware, Rkill, and TDSSKiller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like maybe a 'ready/status line in USB isn't being set and instead a timout is used.&nbsp; Or maybe another task is holding the printer from being 'ready'.&nbsp; Any suggesting as to how to fix?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Method 1: When I Right-click on PRINT SPOOLER the START option is not available - presumably because the service is still running.&nbsp; If I hit STOP and try to print I'm told that no printer is available.&nbsp; That message goes away when when I START the spooler
 again.&nbsp; So that didn't work.</p>
<p>Method 2:&nbsp; I've tried this before - forgot to mention it.&nbsp; Troubleshooter could detect no problems.</p>
<p>Method 3:&nbsp; Lexmark says it doesn't have drivers for this 2600 model - it says to use Windows 10 generic drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts?</p>

</p><p>Windows Media Center for Windows 7 would have worked out fine by following the EPG data issue instructions.&nbsp; I recently got a new tower for my computer that works for Windows 10 and it does not come with Windows Media Center.&nbsp; I cannot go into further details
 in how, people who bought Windows Media Center for Windows 10 does not have the features just like in Windows 7.&nbsp; As of right now, "NO DATA AVAILABLE" and I did follow the EPG data issue instructions, but it does not work for Windows Media Center for Windows
 10. Is there a way to fix this issue for people who bought Windows Media Center for Windows 10. I also already submitted to Microsoft Connect about this issue as well.

            <p>Hello Krispy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where did you buy Windows Media Center for Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows&nbsp;Media Center isn’t a part of <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> and won’t be available after you upgrade or it won't come with Windows 10. We’re providing a free DVD playback app that will be installed after the first Windows Update after upgrading
 to <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In view of the same, force installation&nbsp;of Windows Media Center will leave you in problems due to compatibility. You may see problems with some feature after installing Windows Media Center on Windows 10. It is not recommended of installing Windows Media
 Center on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop composition visual experience feature, introduced since Vista, fundamentally changed the way applications display pixels on the screen. When desktop composition is enabled, individual windows no longer draw directly to the screen or primary display
 device as they did in previous versions of Windows. Instead, their drawing is redirected to off-screen surfaces in video memory, which are then rendered into a desktop image and presented on the display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop Window Manager Session Manager (DWM) service. Through desktop composition, DWM enables visual effects on the desktop as well as various Aero features such as thumbnail previews, Aero themes, glass window frames (transparency), 3-D window transition
 animations, Windows Flip and Windows Flip3D, and high resolution support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, In Windows 8, Desktop Window Manager (DWM) is always ON and cannot be disabled. It’s started before the user logon and remains active for the duration of a session. This issue might occur if there are certain system files that are corrupt or missing.
 Corrupt or outdated display driver might also cause such issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, check if you are running the DWM.exe file resolves the issue. Follow the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+E</strong> to open <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to the following location:</li><li><strong>System drive:\Windows\System32\dwm</strong> (application file)</li><li>Right Click on the file and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. Check if it fixes the issue. If not, proceed further.
</li></ul>
<p>Follow the methods listed below to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run SFC scan and check if finds and fixes corrupt system files. </p>
<p>Refer to the link to run SFC scan:</p>
<p>Follow the steps from section "<strong>Windows 8.1 or Windows 8</strong>":</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</a><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the computer and see if it has fixed the issue. If not, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Since, the issue has occurred recently, I would suggest you to perform a System Restore to restore the computer to a point prior to this issue.
</p>
<p>Refer to the link to perform System restore:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Restore your PC to an earlier point in time</strong>”. While following the instructions, look for a restore point available to restore the computer.
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For further reference:</strong></p>
<p>Download and install the latest available Windows 7 display driver from <a href="http://www.acer.ca/ac/en/CA/content/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Acer’s website</a>. You will need to uninstall the current version and then install the latest version of display driver in Windows 7 compatibility mode. While downloading the drivers, type “<strong>Aspire 4720Z</strong>” under product model and click on Search.
 Choose the operating system bit from the drop down menu and then, download the latest drivers. While installing the driver, right click on setup file and select
<strong>Properties</strong>. Go to <strong>compatibility</strong> tab, check the box that says “<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>” and choose
<strong>Windows 7</strong> from the drop down menu. Click on <strong>OK</strong>. Double Click on the setup file and follow the onscreen instructions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know the status of this issue. </p>

            <p>i had a windows 10 installation disk made.</p>
<p>there was no 'fix' to the problem.</p>
<p>kept telling me there were no windows installations on the computer, yet from the command prompt i could see that drive D contained windows. &nbsp;there was no repair to that windows.</p>
<p>all the disk wanted to do was install a new windows 10.</p>
<p>finally decided i would let it do that and even though windows 7 was previously on the computer and it had been upgraded to windows 10 it wanted me to buy a new windows 10 license which i will not do for an old computer!</p>
<p>so i finally said screw windows 10 and wiped the hard drive and reinstalled windows 7.</p>

            Thank you Ruth, so easy when you know how..... I spent several days looking for the answer, about to give up then found your simple instructions.. thought to myself "I'll give this a try then take my PC to a specialist" as soon as I restarted it stuck
 on 16% and stayed there for ages, then whizzed through the rest and hard drive cured. I ran task again and it took seconds, perfect. Thank you, thank you, thank you&nbsp;

            Hi Alexey
<br />
<br />A Windows Crack or KMS Activation will not survive formatting your drive
<br />
<br />If your Windows activation is showing as a Digital licence, that is legit . . .
