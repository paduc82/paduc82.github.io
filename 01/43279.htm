<p>Has anyone heard if you will be able to bring your 360 save into the Xbox One version?</p>

<p>Do you mean for the definitive edition or if it goes backwards compatible?</p>
<p>I believe the definitive edition will be considered a completely different game and will have to be started from scratch. If the 360 version goes BC, I believe you you will be able to use your saves.</p>
<p>You won't be able to use 360 saves for the Xbox One version, at least this is the impression I got.</p>

<p>^ I THINK that, for game saves to be available on XB1, you have to upload them to the cloud /from a 360/. Not sure how this part of BC works, to be honest.</p>

<p>Since the backward compatible game thinks it is running on a 360, you access the 360 cloud (all 512mb of it) just as you would on a physical 360.</p>

<p>I highly doubt we'll see any game with a remaster getting added to the backward compatibility list.</p>
<p>As Microsoft said in a video, they have to ask permission to add the games to the list. Is a publisher going to want you to play the game you already own or are they going to want you to pay out for the shiny new version.</p>

<h2>            Hitman Pro removed necessary files</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - Hitman Pro</p>
<p>I installed Hitman Pro and did a scan. The only files that I saw were "pup" files, so I hit clean. In doing so, it not only removed the "pup" files, but all the necessary files, too. Now when I open Google Chrome, it says that my preferences are not able
 to be read, or something like that. When I open IE or Firefox, all my customized toolbars are gone. Is there anyway to recover them? I ran a system restore, but it did not put those back, only the programs that I downloaded after my restore point.

    <title>NTI Backup Now EZ failure on Vista - Runs on XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elizabeth2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            NTI Backup Now EZ failure on Vista - Runs on XP</h2>
                    Purchased 3 Toshiba USB drives with NTI Backup Now EZ. One works and two fail.<br />
<br />
The working unit is running XP.<br />
<br />
The two failures occur on Lenovo T61's running Vista with Service Pack 2.<br />
<br />
The "File and Folder" backup initially completes successfully. The "Complete System Backup" fails. It runs through about 7%+ of the backup and then Vista logs a failure message: "Backup Now EZ Module stopped working and was closed. A problem caused the application
 to stop working correctly. Windows will notify you if a solution is available."<br />
<br />
Once the failure occurs, both the "File and Folder" and "Complete System Backup" completion messages go to: "Failed to backup."<br />
<br />
My account has administrator authority. User Account Control (UAC) is not active.<br />
<br />
Any insight into the problem and potentially a fix, would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth

<p>Well I haver received today a response from NTI Backup Now support department. And guees what? It worked!!! Now I can back up my files and folders, as well as my complete system. Here you have the answer I recevet from the NTI guys...</p>
<p><span><span>Dear Customer,</span></span><span><span>Try
 turning off the User Account Control (UAC) and see if you still have this issue. &nbsp;You can turn off the UAC by opening the Windows Control Panel and going into the User Accounts function. If you are in the Control Panel Home view, you will need to click on
 User Accounts twice. In User Accounts, click on the link that says ‚Äúturn User Account Control on or off‚Äù. Then uncheck the checkbox where it says ‚ÄúUse User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer‚Äù and click on the OK button. Then restart your computer.</span></span><span><span>Also,<span><span>try
 running CHKDSK to look for and attempt repair of bad sectors and file system errors; you can do this by opening My Computer and right clicking on Properties. In the properties window, click on the Tools tab, in the Tools tab click on the check now button in
 the Error Checking section. In the window that opens select both options and the click on OK. You computer will need to reboot to run CHKDSK.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Hope It will be useful for you too :)</p>

<h2>            I want to keep track of how many games I&#39;ve completed, statistics back&#63;  Microsoft solitaire Collection</h2>
                    <p>Recently Windows 10 updated my Microsoft Solitaire Collection on both my laptop and my desktop PC. &nbsp;Since then, all of my statistics are gone . &nbsp;I have been playing Free Cell for years and have been working towards completing a certain number of games. &nbsp;Now
 when a game finishes, instead of showing my statistics, I get a window that shows how long the game took me (which I can already see in the upper right hand corner of my screen as I play the game, so this is unnecessary) AND it offers me 3 challenges to play
 telling me how all of these challenges are solvable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want the challenges. &nbsp;I want to keep track of how many games I've completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get my statistics back? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you mess with things that are working the way people like them .... we should have an option of showing the statistics or playing the challenges ... I'm an adult. &nbsp;I don't need you to make decisions for me!!!!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 running defrag says my Raid Drive is SSD</h2>
                    <p>My system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot Drive is SSD which defrag show as a SSD</p>
<p>Drive D is a set of Raid drives which defrag shows as a SSD</p>
<p>Drive E is a set of Raid drives which defrag shows as Hard disk drive</p>
<p>Drive F is an SSD drive that is used to accelerate Drive D defrag shows as SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the exact same set-up I used with Windows 8.1 and all the drives were correctly shown as the right kind of drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that having Drive F to accelerate Drive D is the problem though it was not a problem in Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Why would they introduce a new bug in Windows 10?</p>

</p><p>Can you double check if the notification for your Skype application is enabled? You can check
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34670/how-do-i-turn-off-notifications-in-skype-for-windows-10?q=notification+settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> on how to toggle your notifications On and Off. Make sure the latest version of Skype is installed on your device. Since Skype for Windows 10 is still being developed some of the features of Skype for Windows desktop is not yet incorporated
 on the Windows 10 application. You&nbsp;can send a feedback directly from the application so you can let our developers know what needs to be and can be improved still.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar problem: Incoming calls not showing up, neither ring nor notification.</p>
<p>Now, I just noticed that Skype does not show up in the "Notifications and Actions" menu of "Settings".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet, Skype does appear in that "Notification and Actions" menu on other notebooks and PCs where Skype works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have been trying to find out how to add Skype to my list of apps in the Notifications menu and so far, I have not found anything yet. (It is supposed to add it automatically according to the doc I have read)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I share the general consensus: The latest version of Skype is not good (dare I say "cr@ppy"?) I think it was released too early, more likely to meet a deadline... So, why do you force people to upgrade from Desktop to the new Win10 version with the annoying
 "You will not be able to communicate with people who are using the new version" (I am paraphrasing)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beware that I have a few colleagues who switched to Zoom and I am inclined to follow their lead if this issue does not get resolved by Sept 1st...</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I'am just adding a copy of another persons problems and I see MANY others are having the same trouble. to keep from typing the same thing over again...</p>
<div>
<p>Is Anyone else with this latest update to Skype having new calls/missed calls and notification not showing up properly in windows 10 ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>they just stopped showing up . they would show on my taskbar and now nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>someone is tearing this app apart , removing features &amp; options that I have paid for for years</p>
<p>
</p><p>so now we don't even get proper notifications for VOIP calls or new messages in skype in windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>missing custom/personal voicemails now this too , then why am I paying for it ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's time to leave skype after 11 years of dedicated use...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too bad you cant get someone to talk to to keep you from leaving Skype after many years!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I Agree, the app version for Win 10 is Veeery Crappy, have a Skype meeting for a Job Interview and the program didn't recognice phone call, and give me notice after I the call was missed...we literally tried to talk to each other for 20 mins, and we had
 so meny problems that we had to reschedule the phone call for another day...bare in mind, this call was for a very important job interview so it was an extremely bad experience for everone involved...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution, install de Desktop version, in still work perfectly...</p>

<p>(Not sure if this going to be removed by the chat room admin...)</p>
<p>I have had similar experience with a couple of missed business calls.</p>
<p>I have reinstalled Skype (desktop and Win 10 versions) multiple times. The problem with the older desktop version is that you get a warning that some people who are using the new version may not be able to contact you. (backward compatibility problem?)</p>
<p>I now keep Skype for family calls and chats, but for business, to align myself with my clients, I am using Zoom: All my clients are slowly dropping Skype because of those missed calls and misc. audio problems.</p>
<p>And the trend is snowballing.</p>

<p>I have posted similar.. I have figured out that when a contact in my skype contact list calls my skype number, I get a pop up and actually have to answer it on the Windows 10 pop up. It shows the phone but not the contact name until I answer it, which is
 weird. That call also does not appear in my log. My log seems to now only trace calls that I make.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use my skype phone number to time stamp and half my calls no longer show up. I also have been paying for this for over 10 years and am fed up.&nbsp; Desktop skype has also become terrible because it is not supported and the web version has the same flaw as
 WIndows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system is not user friendly any more and certainly not business friendly.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>What type of files are you looking at?</p>
<p>I don't see a "Used" property on any of the&nbsp;standard file types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide more details about where you are seeing this behavior. A screenshot would also help.</p>

            Hi Mr. Vernon, this is Finnish, but I'm sure you get the idea. Luotu (created), muokattu (edited), k√§ytetty (used). I copied it from my old machine on 20th August 2010 (claims it is created on 20th August 2010), saved it to my original harddrive on 8th
 June 2008 (claims it is edited 8th June 2008) and opened it today (claims it is used 20th August 2010). This bug has persisted for 10 years on Windows!<br />

    <title>&#34;the ordinal 495 could not be located in the dynamic link library - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jhfriedman  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;the ordinal 495 could not be located in the dynamic link library urlmon.dll&#34; occurs 10 times each reboot</h2>
                    <p>I am running MS Vista on my laptop. Recently whenever I start-up I get the message "the ordinal 495 could not be located in the dynamic link library urlmon.dll" in a popup box and must cancel it 10 times before I can proceed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had thought in some way it might relate to a recent update accepted for Skype on my system.&nbsp; So I uninstalled Skype.&nbsp; Attempts to reinstall Skype have failed.&nbsp; the app installs but I cannot get to a login screen.&nbsp; Instead of the normal Skype window I get
 just the background loading in a web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a similar but transposed ordinal 459 error discussed in the KB and tried following many of it's steps (+my results):</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this problem in Internet Explorer, follow these steps: </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Quit all programs that are running.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <span>Start</span>, and then click
<span>Run</span>.</span></p>
<span>Run</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type <span>regsvr32 urlmon.dll</span>, and then click
<span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>When you receive the "DllRegisterServer in urlmon.dll succeeded" message, click
<span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
(received </span><span>"DllRegisterServer in urlmon.dll succeeded")</span> <span>
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not resolve the problem, repeat steps 2 through 4 for each of the following files (in step 3, replace Urlmon.dll with each of the file names below):
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Shdocvw.dll</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; (failed)</p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Actxprxy.dll</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (failed)</p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Oleaut32.dll</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; (failed)</p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Mshtml.dll</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (receive no response)</p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Browseui.dll</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; (failed)

<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Shell32.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (succeeded)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method (step) 2:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot into safe mode and test the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Boot to Safe Mode:<span>&nbsp; </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method (step) 3:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a SFC Scan and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>The System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) scans for missing or corrupted system files and repairs them.</span></p>

</p><p>(SFC Scan completed successfully)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side note: when I booted into Safe Mode I received an immediate error "Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime library "Application requests runtime to close in an unusual way"</p>
<p>
</p><p>DavidMCandy suggested the user get a listing of the URLMON.DLLs on the system.&nbsp; I have done that as well.&nbsp; See the file on my Onedrive at

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this will help you find me a resolution to my problem.</p>

            The USB cable with the Play &amp; Charge kit is for charging the controller only - the controller is still a wireless controller, not a USB one. Basically, you can't use it as a USB controller, sorry. (I think you can buy USB wireless receivers that you can
 plug into your computer, and then use the controller wirelessly.) &nbsp;

<h2>            Folder stuck on my desktop</h2>
                    I have a empty folder stuck on my desktop. When I try to open it, it says that the folder is unavailable due to the information might have been moved to a different location.
<br />
And when I try to delete it : <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Cannot read from the source file or disk</span> .<br />
<br />
What do I do?<br />
Thx.

<h3> cokney charmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dead Rising 2&#58; Off The Record Expansion Release Date</h2>
                    
<p>source =&nbsp;http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/117/1179929p1.html</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capcom's <strong><a href="http://www.capcom-europe.com/blog/2011/06/dead-rising-2-off-the-record-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">official blog</a></strong> has splurged a release date for the upcoming Dead Rising 2: Off The Record expansion, which is coming
 to North America on 11 October followed by Europe three days later on 14 October.
<br />
<br />
The expansion pack centres around Frank West, star of the first Dead Rising, who returns in a 're-imagined' ‚Äì read more of the same ‚Äì Dead Rising 2 campaign with new weapons, areas and bosses, co-op, photo missions and, of course, legions of the undead to slay.
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://xbox360.ign.com/objects/105/105963.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</a> will be released at retail on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC, priced around $40(¬£)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well....be fun to play as Frank West in a full game rather then DLC, one I have to admit yet to complete</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 I have posted the log below maybe someone can help me to see why this update will not install. Trying to avoid a clean install if possible.

            Hi Rick.
<br />
<br />Have you tried to do a clean install.
<br />So wipe your hard drive and start fresh with a new clean copy of Windows 10?
<br />Below is a great link by Greg on how to do this.
<br />This is what I would recommend.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

            Hi Rick, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would try the below link to download 1803 manually and install it:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4338819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, I'd try resetting Windows Update components manually. The instructions for this are in the article linked below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/971058...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise, try the following steps to see if they fix Windows Update:
<br />
<br />Perform a clean boot:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135...</a>
<br />Boot into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/...</a>
<br />Run the System File Checker tool:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>

<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.

<h2>            Windows thinks I&#39;m using windows remote login. How do I stop that&#33; </h2>
                    Nero says that if I'm running Nero burning software via windows remote login, I might not be able to access my drives. It says it's a windows security feature. I'm not using windows remote login, but I still can't use my drive to burn? How do I get windows
 to let me use my drives or turn off the security feature. I'm sitting right in front of my computer just like always, but recently it started doing this to me!

<h2>            TV Tuner and Erro r0X80070005&#58; Access Denied</h2>
                    I upgraded my Hauppauge TV Tuner to Hauppauge 2250. &nbsp;Both have worked flawlessly, until today. &nbsp;The tuner stopped working, Media Center said, due to disk space. &nbsp;I freed up space on the drive and WMC states there is a "conflict. Device Manager says everything
 is okay. &nbsp;When I to to Admin.Tools/Services/WMC Receiver Serice Properties and try to start, I receive" Error 0X80070005: &nbsp;Access Denied." &nbsp;Any suggestions to fix this?

            I resolved this problem by going to Windows Features, unchecking Media Center, shutting down the computer, installing the Hauppauge 2250 tuner card, restarting the computer,and &nbsp;installing the drivers from the Hauppauge website. &nbsp;In Windows Features I
 checked Media Center, restarted the computer and went back to the Hauppauge website to complete downloading the Media Center drivers etc. I restarted the computer, opened Media Center and went through the TV Signal Setup and the tuner now works. &nbsp;Not sure
 this will work for everyone, but for now, it is working for me!&nbsp;

            <p>Windows 10 airplane mode stuck on. Cannot enable WiFi.</p>
<p>Open the Command prompt as an administrator. </p>
<p>Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh int ip reset c:\resetLog.txt</p>
<p>If you receive any Reset Failed do this.</p>
<p>Open regedit&nbsp;&nbsp; (Windows Key + R and type regedit)</p>
<p>Look for key 26 under </p>
<p>Local machine&gt; System&gt; CurrentControlSet&gt; Control&gt; Nsi&gt; big string of numbers, in there if you have a 26 key‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Right click the 26 key and go to Permissions</p>
<p>Set the ‚ÄúFull control‚Äù to Allow</p>
<p>Do this for any keys under Nsi that start with 26.</p>
<p>Return to your Administrative Command Prompt.</p>
<p>Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh int ip reset c:\resetLog.txt</p>
<p>It should all come back clear now.</p>
<p>Reboot</p>
<p>Turn off Airplane mode.</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone.</p>
