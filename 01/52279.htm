<h2>            eaphost and appliucation experience are causing high cpu usage constantly</h2>
                    The computer runs really slow and svchost is using 50% cpu time. when I click go to services it highlights eaphost and application experience.
<br />
Also, if I look at the resource monitor, it shows constant communication with many websites, 2 of them are google and amazon. I tried blocking their cookies but it didn't help.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Scan for Malware in Safe Mode with Networking.</p>

<p><strong><u>Windows Vista</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Using the F8 Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information start to gently tap the
<strong>F8</strong> key repeatedly until you are presented with the <strong>Windows Vista Advanced Boot Options</strong>.
</li><li>Select the <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>&nbsp;option using the arrow keys.
</li><li>Then press the <strong>enter</strong> key on your keyboard to boot into Vista Safe Mode.
</li><li>When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Vista will enter Safe mode.
</li><li>Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once in Safe Mode with Networking, download and run RKill.</p>
<p>RKill does NOT remove Malware; it stops the Malware Process giving you a chance to remove it with your Security Programs.</p>

<p>Have a closer look at the sticker using a LED torch and Magnifying glass.</p>
<p>Move the light source to different angles as there may be a possibility of making out Key if not rubbed off all together.</p>
<p>With the DVD Drive they do have a tendency to fail.</p>
<p>Check with some other DVD`s to see if they read.</p>
<p>If they do it may well be a damaged disc which it could no longer read.</p>

    <title>After clean install of Win 10 several times, is it possible to go back - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skip3119  say:</h3>
<h2>            After clean install of Win 10 several times, is it possible to go back to Win 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Somehow Windows 10 doesn't like this computer: &nbsp;Gateway FX4710 came with windows Vista, but later upgraded to Windows 7.</p>
<p>It had been working fine for many years with this windows 7 (upgraded from Vista).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When windows 10 came along, I upgraded to Win10, and then did a Clean Install. (That's what they advise - do upgrade first, then do clean install afterwards.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the windows 10 got on to this computer, it has become unusable. &nbsp;It quits working every few days, then had to do a clean install again. &nbsp;The "Automatic Repairing" can not fix the problem, the only way to get it working is to do another clean install.
 I have done half a dozen clean install already - I hardly put any other programs or files on this computer, because I knew the computer would stop working in a few days, and had to do another clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Help needed: &nbsp;How to reinstall the Windows 7 on this computer?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Note: &nbsp;Gateway FX4710 was a Vista computer. I then bought a copy of Windows 7 upgrade software and upgraded it to Win 7.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: &nbsp;To be fair to Microsoft, I have 3 computers - 2 of them work great with Win 10, never have had any problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One was a Win 7 computer (it came with Win 7) another was a Win 8.1 computer. After upgrade, I did clean install for both.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, 2 computers work great with Windows 10, only 1 computer just doesn't work with Windows 10.</p>

The expectation among users should be that they will either need to upgrade to final release or reinstall their previous version of Windows after they have completed their evaluation of the Preview. Microsoft officials recently indicated the intention of having the preview releases support upgrades to the final version. This is the intention, but of course, things can always change on the road to RTM. With the excitement surrounding the arrival of a new major release of Windows and the more public approach to testing Windows pre-release version in comparison to previous releases under development, a lot of persons who are normally not exposed to beta testing are jumping in without hesitation.

<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Option 1:</p>
<p>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need
 to use the product key also.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>If the neither options 1 or 2 is possible, then you need to invest in a new retail full version Windows 10&nbsp;license.</p>

            <p>Thanks.<br />
1. &nbsp;Haven't done anything about it at this moment, because I have 2 other computers running Win 10 fine (my wife uses one and I use one.)<br />
2. &nbsp;The computer has had clean install have a dozen times already, involving reformatting the hard disk - doubt if there is any recovery partition still exists.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;I can contact Gateway (I have model # and Serial #) and get the Win Vista (came with it when bought new) for a small fee (I guess).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;But I lost the Windows 7 upgrade disk that I bought, and lost the receipt too. So, I don't have the key.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Buy another copy of Win 7 upgrade disk? &nbsp;I haven't decided to cough up that money yet.</p>
<p><br />
With so much emphasis on that one must "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>upgrade first</strong></span>" BEFORE "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>clean install</strong></span>", I thought Microsoft would have collected my windows'
 "Key" to check if my Windows 7 is "genuine" or "pirated".</p>
<p>Oops, they didn't.</p>

<p>Upgraded to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I got back to be able to use this computer, as a Windows 7 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Gateway FX4710 (with NVidia Gforce 9800GT video card) and Windows 10 just can not work together.</p>
<p>I will just have to settle with Windows 7. &nbsp;I am happy with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Clean-installed Windows 10 many times, but got bombed every time - BSOD.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this old computer was running Vista and then subsequently running the upgraded Windows 7, it has never run into BSOD for many many years. &nbsp;Glad I am back to run the good, old and trusted Windows 7.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time trying to help.</p>
<p>Yes, each time I clean-install the windows 10, I always reformat the hard disk.</p>
<p>I have had no problem to get it to work, actually it works every time.</p>
<p>The problem is, in a few days especially when leaving the computer "on" overnight - it will then fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic repair won't fix it, tried many "Advanced Trouble Shooting" - none did any good.</p>
<p>Always ended up had to do another clean-install.</p>
<p>The first time I installed all the programs that I normally use - then get bombed.</p>
<p>Later, I installed fewer and fewer programs, &nbsp;until I installed nothing - just Chrome browser. &nbsp;Still get BSOD.</p>

<h2>            FAQ&#58; E-Mail, Windows Live ID, Wachtwoord veranderen&#47;aanmaken</h2>
                    
<p>Voor het veranderen van je e-mail adres wat gekoppeld is aan je GamerTag, zorg er dan voor dat het e-mail adres een Windows Live ID (WLI) is. Wanneer je een hotmail of een live adres aanmaakt is deze al een WLI. Als je een nieuw emailadres met WLI wilt aanmaken,
 volg de procedure van <a href="https://signup.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
deze pagina</a>. Wilt u van een ander email adres een WLI maken, klik dan op <a href="https://signup.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
de zelfde pagina</a> in het veld op <span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Of gebruik een eigen e-mailadres</span></span>.<span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><b><br />
<br />
Hoe verander je een wachtwoord of WLI die gekoppeld is aan je Gamertag<br />
</b></span>Tijdens uw aanmelding bij Xbox LIVE hebt u uw Xbox LIVE-account aan een Windows Live ID gekoppeld (uw e-mailadres). Meld u met dezelfde Windows Live ID en hetzelfde wachtwoord aan om uw account te beheren, uw profiel te wijzigen en u aan te melden
 bij diensten als Windows Live Messenger.<a href="http://support.xbox.com/nl-nl/pages/xbox-live/how-to/xbox-live-account-management/manage-live-id.aspx#section-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<p>Hoe kan ik een Gamertag overzetten op een ander WLI-account zonder gebruik te maken van een Xbox (want die heb ik niet). Mijn zoon (en zijn vrienden) willen Fable 3 voor de PC , maar moeten gebruik maken van mijn WLi, wat tevens inhoudt dat ze de beschikking
 hebben over mijn Hotmail-mail..</p>

<p>Dat is niet mogelijk. Een WLI is alleen over te zetten via een console. In geval van Games For Windows zou je voor je zoon een eigen WLI kunnen maken waarmee hij zijn eigen Gamertag heeft. Als de gedachte uitgaat om de verdiende achievements die nu op deze
 gamertag staan geregistreerd over te zetten dan heb ik helaas een domper voor je. GFW en Xbox spellen zijn niet samen te bespelen. De behaalde safegames is ook niet over te zetten. Het spel moet dus van af de PC opnieuw gespeeld worden. Dus stel voor zijn
 vriendje heeft een Xbox en uw zoon achter de PC en ze willen beide het zelfde spel spelen in 1 lobby dan gaat dat dus niet.</p>

<p>Je kan je gamertag overzetten naar een ander e-mail adres via de console in de hub 'system' en dan naar 'account'. Let wel, als je met de live server in verbinding wil blijven staan dan moet het e-mail &nbsp;wel een 'Microsoft Account' (voorheen "Windows Live
 ID") te hebben aangekoppeld. (zoals in de startpost beschreven). Ik hoop dat dit een beetje helpt wat er zijn wat wijzigingen geweest sinds de nieuwe dash. ;-)</p>

<p>Hallo fellow Xbox-gamers!</p>
<p>Ik heb een aantal vraagjes. Ik heb afgelopen zaterdag een nieuwe generatie Xbox 360 gekocht, omdat mijn first gen het voor de tweede keer begeven heeft. Jammer, maar helaas. Nu heb ik op mijn eerste Xbox altijd kunnen spelen met mijn account, en heb nooit
 een wachtwoord in hoeven vullen. Nu wilde ik me aanmelden op mijn nieuwe Xbox met mijn XBL account, maar Windows herkent blijkbaar het emailadres plus wachtwoord niet meer, en weet dus ook niet dat hier mijn account aan gekoppeld zit. Is hier iets aan te doen?
 Ik heb nu dus een nieuw account, zonder enige achievements.</p>
<p>Ik heb geprobeerd mijn account over te zetten via een usb-stick, maar ook dit werkt niet. Iemand enig idee?</p>
<p>Hiernaast heb ik een vraag die wel enigzins gerelateerd is aan mijn eerste vraag: als ik een car-pack voor Forza4 koop, is die dan voor alle accounts beschikbaar die op dezelfde Xbox spelen? Dan weet ik dat ik met een gerust hart die VW Kever kan kopen ;)</p>
<p>Alvast bedankt,</p>
<p>Bazooqa/Yakoozi</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your previous post, you are still having issues when connecting your device to your mobile Hotspot. As a solution we recommend that you try to delete the current connection and create a new one to get rid of the authentication error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to respond if you need further assistance. </p>

Revo Uninstaller
uninstall and clean-up utility
<p>Revo Uninstaller is an uninstall utility that includes additional system clean-up tools. It provides an alternate interface for the Windows Add/Remove software dialog that offers web search options, access to registry keys and some additional commands. The
 program also includes a startup manager to inspect and disable programs that start automatically as well as a privacy cleaner to remove Internet traces, a secure deletion tool and an option to find and remove files, folders and registry keys that were left
 behind during uninstall. Revo Uninstaller comes with a unique `Hunter Mode` that allows you to uninstall a program, search for information on the web or perform other actions by simply dragging a target over the program or shortcut icon on your desktop.

<p>If I acquired a used computer, no matter who previously owned it, the first thing I would do with it would be to reinstall the operating system cleanly. You have no idea how the computer has been maintained,<br />
what has been installed incorrectly, what is missing, what viruses and<br />
spyware there may be, etc. I wouldn't want to live with somebody else's mistakes and problems, possibility of kiddy p0rn, etc., and I wouldn't recommend that anyone else do so either.<br />
You're playing with fire if you don't reinstall Windows cleanly.</p>

<h2>            NDP40-KB2600217 - Cannot delete and Windows Update freezes during install</h2>
                    <p>original title: NDP40-KB2600217 - CAN NOT DELETE, WTF!? PLZ HELP ME!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">I am using: Windows 7 Home Premium x64bit Ver. 6.1 (Build 7601: Service Pack 1)</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Asus U43Jc</span><br />
I AM THE ADMINISTRATOR AND ONLY USER OF and ON THIS COMPUTER (I've had people question this on another forum)<br />
&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;<br />
Five days ago Windows Update ran and froze while installing the updates. I had to force shut down, and restart. I ran the updates again and seemingly everything ran correctly.<br />
<br />
However, then I notice a folder called "C:\e1c344ce53705556d359" has mysteriously appeared on my hard drive, and that it is locked and I can't delete or modify it in any way. Looking at the files inside, I see a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows Installer Patch</span> file called "NDP40-KB2600217". Using my powers of deduction, I find out that "KB2600217" is a .NET update, and that I am not the only person to have problems with it. Here is the article
 I came to on this site ---&gt; [ http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/kb2600217-update-for-microsoft-net-framework-4-on/4a2eff48-3a81-4d10-8ffa-96f48ff2f831 ]<br />
<br />
I followed the links contained in the body text of that article to manually download and install this update, and it ran fine with no apparent issues. However, the mystery file "C:\e1c344ce53705556d359" is STILL THERE! When I try to delete it, I still get a
 message telling me I need permissions from "SYSTEM" to delete it. After some more research, I find and follow the instructions found here ---&gt; [ http://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-7/windows-7-how-to-delete-files-protected-by-trustedinstaller/ ]&nbsp; I have reassigned
 the file permissions to "Administrator", which again is me, and I go back to try to delete it again. Now I get an error message that says, "You require permission from Administrators to make changes to this folder."
<br />
<br />
So WTF!? How can I get rid of this folder? PLEASE, can't someone help me? I would really, really appreciate it.&nbsp; :D<br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
To work with the issue, refer these methods. </div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>I would suggest you to create a restore point before you perform Method 2. This is to ensure that we can perform a system restore if there are some issues later.<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong>Try the steps below and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Make sure that you have given proper permissions following the steps mentioned below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How to Take Ownership in Windows 7:</strong></div>

            Sorry for the long time away from the forum... <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, no this does not help me. As I follow the instructions I run into 2 issues:<br />
<br />
A) Which user do I select to grant permission to? Since it keeps requesting "Administrator" permissions, I went with Administrator. It still gave me the error when I tried to delete the problem folder. I tried it with my user name, which was the only other
 option in the "users" window, and again I got the same error.<br />
<br />
B) As I follow your instructions in "Part B", I run into a problem: I don't have an edit button on my "Properties" from the Context Menu. The only "edit" button that appears is on the Security tab, which again, just takes me to the user permissions options
 again. It seems to indicate that I have "full control" permissions under my user name... The only option that isn't checked in this menu is "Special Permissions".<br />
<br />
This is nuts, why would Windows not allow its only user to manipulate files on my hard drive? This was apparently the result of a Windows Update that didn't work correctly, and now I have no way of getting rid of this file folder! Please, tell me there is more
 that I can try!<br />

            I ran all the Chkdsk variations I could. One took only about a minute, another took 3hrs. None of them indicated any problem areas. The only screenshot I got was the one here: http://www.mediafire.com/i/?53ia9w24qzswoh9<br />

I don't believe there is any problem with my computer; this issue resulted from a Windows Update operation that didn't work properly.<br />

Any other ideas? <br />

            <p>Hello TCCO,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's re-run that chkdsk from a different environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boot to WinRE and run the chkdsk:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Tap F8 during startup to get to the Startup Options menu.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose Repair Windows.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After choosing the location and logging on, click on the Command Prompt option.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type the following command followed by the ENTER key:<br />
<br />
CHKDSK C: /F</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Let CHKDSK run to completion. It may take some time so be patient and do not restart the computer while it is running.
</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try to rename the folder at this point:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>REN C:\&lt;old_foldername&gt; C:\&lt;new_foldername&gt;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that works, try to delete it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If not, then reboot and try to re-run the updates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know if you have any questions.</span></p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Matthew_Ha</p>

    <title>Threshold 2 Windows 10 update breaks my ability to log into secure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken forbus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Threshold 2 Windows 10 update breaks my ability to log into secure wifi networks</h2>
                    <p>I just updated my Surface Pro 2 yesterday, which was already running Windows 10.&nbsp; Now two networks that I used to be able to log into, I cannot.&nbsp; It is not that Wifi is down: When I take the machine to an open network, it logs in.&nbsp; (Not great for security,
 not an acceptable solution.) What is different is that now I get a little initial pop-up dialog when I try to open such a connection that says "Windows Security" and asks for a user name and password.&nbsp; It has the domain fill-in on the bottom.&nbsp; I have tried
 putting in my usual credentials, associated with my organization.&nbsp; No joy.&nbsp; I have tried putting in my Microsoft account credential.&nbsp; No joy.&nbsp; (I log into this machine with my Microsoft account.)&nbsp; That little box is separate from the authentication credential
 queries that fly out from the right on the network box, which is wht I'm used to seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is this new box for, what is it expecting, and what can I do to actually connect to my usual networks????&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry, but the link you provided&nbsp;has nothing to do with my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said before,</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10, Threshold 2 update.&nbsp; Not Windows 8.</li><li>Wifi works with open networks.&nbsp; It's not that Wifi doesn't work at all.</li><li>Wifi won't work with specific secure networks under W10 Threshold 2 that it worked fine with under Windows 10.</li></ul>
<p>Given the evidence above, my inference is that something about the use of certificates or some other secure protocol settings have been tightened up, to the point where I cannot connect anymore to my own university Wifi network.&nbsp; I can connect to my locked
 down home network, to the Eduroam network (a network that universities run so that people from participating other universities can access the net when travelling), but not my local university network.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, as if the other evidence isn't enough, the same bug manifests with a brand new Surface Pro 4: Won't connect to my university network, but will connect to locked-down home and Eduroam networks.</p>

            <p>I'm sorry, but I don't think you read my message carefully, or perhaps you didn't read the article you are suggesting.&nbsp; It cannot be relevant.&nbsp; Here is why.&nbsp; Since
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I can now connect to some networks but not others,</p>
<p>2. I could connect to the others before installing Threshold 2</p>
<p>3. The only change in the machine was installing Threshold 2</p>
<p>4. The only difference between the networks it works on and the networks it does not work on are the authentication methods that they use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two clear conclusions that follow from this:</p>
<p>1. It is Threshold 2 that caused this problem.</p>
<p>2. The issue is how Threshold 2 is handling certain kinds of authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was the point I had things diagnosed to, in the original message.&nbsp; Your response isn't building on the diagnosis that I've already done, and is more like "make sure the machine is plugged in".&nbsp; I know that you're trying to be helpful, but ignoring most
 of the symptoms&nbsp;does not make for a&nbsp;helpful response.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As it happens, one of our local Windows folks managed to track down the issue.&nbsp; The problem is that Windows 10 does not authenticate properly using WPA2 Enterprise TLS-EAP, but Windows 10 TH2 (Fall Update) enables the use of TLS 1.2.&nbsp; The solution is to
 disable TLS 1.2 by tweaking the registry, specifically,</p>
<p>
Create DWORD
</p><li>
<ul>
<li>DWORD Value: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP\EAP\13\TlsVersion</li><li>Value: 0xc0</li></ul>
<p>then restart the EAPHOST service (or just reboot).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have verified that this fix works on my Surface Pro2.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

    <title>Backup XP System and Restore to XP Mode in Windows 7 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> praetas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup XP System and Restore to XP Mode in Windows 7 Pro</h2>
                    <p>We have many customers finally replacing their XP computers with new systems, but some require old XP software that can't easily be upgraded or replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can always clone their slow HDD to a new SSD in a new system and repair the hard drive controller, but then they're still running XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a procedure to backup Windows XP (NTbackup, System Migration Tool, Acronis system image, etc.) and then on a Windows 7 Pro machine with XP Mode installed, restore the backup to the XP Mode PC? &nbsp;That way they have Windows 7 for new software,
 and can easily "boot up" their virtual XP computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would essentially be looking to restore a mirror image of XP so programs are intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We could do something other than XP mode too - VirtualBox or VMWare would be fine too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your ideas.</p>

<p>[/quote]Wrong I'm afraid. I own several NTSC games and they work fine in my console.<br />

PAL and NTSC have nothing to do with region locking, it is up to the publisher if they want to region lock a game.&nbsp;<br />

<p>In the future if you buy games abroad again look for NTSC-U as they are region free games. NTSC-J is asia/japanese, NTSC-A is American and PAL is Europe (france is Secam) UK &amp; Australia. As said above its upto the Publisher to region lock their games. UK
 xboxes are PAL locked but do play region free games.</p>

<p><strong>That's wrong, PAL &amp; NTSC have everything to do with region-locking, Pal &amp; Ntsc are region areas of the world of the software &amp; media industry. You cannot play a dvd film bought in America R1 (Region 1) on a UK Xbox 360 because of region-locking.

<p>[/quote]PAL and NTSC are display technologies that have been adopted in regions, they do not define the region locking.<br />
<br />
I have several DVDs imported from America that work in my Xbox because those DVDs are not region locked. Just because a DVD is released in the US does not mean they have to 'lock' it to region 1.<br />
<br />
Several of my 360 games have come from the States, and they play perfectly in my 360 because they are region free.<br />
<br />
PAL and NTSC stopped being an issue years ago, I don't know a single person who owns a TV that can't handle both types of signal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[/quote]In regard to the DVDs that is my point. Just because a DVD is NTSC does not mean it has to conform to region 1 (or other region that employs NTSC). That is a separate step added.<br />
<br />
I must confess I am unaware of NTSC-A. The only place I can even find reference to such a variant is an old support post on the xbox.com forum. Could you explain a little more about it?</p>
<p><br />
All other variants of NTSC however use 525 scans lines, compared to the 625 employed by PAL. They remain a separate issue to region locking, though of course you could end up proving me wrong by telling me what NTSC-A is.<br />

 of explanation that is going on in this thread.</p>

<h2>            Looking for HDTV expert. Please help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. I want the best possible picture quality for my xbox 360 setup. Here's what's connected...<br />
.<br />
-Microsoft Xbox 360 Elite<br />
-Microsoft HDMI Cable<br />
-Emerson 32" LCD HDTV (<a href="http://emersonaudiovideo.com/products/product.php?id=27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://emersonaudiovideo.com/products/product.php?id=27</a>)<br />
.<br />
My "optimal resolution" for my tv is 1080p. My question is, what do I set the "Reference Levels" and "HDMI Color Space" to on my Xbox 360?(All settings are in<br />
"Console Settings" under "HDTV Settings").&nbsp;Here are the options...<br />
.<br />
Reference Levels<br />
-Standard<br />
-Intermediate<br />
-Expanded<br />
.<br />
HDMI Color Space<br />
Auto<br />
Source<br />
RGB<br />
YCbCr709<br />
YCbCr601<br />
.<br />
If anyone would help me with my HD setup, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you.<br />
.<br />
NOTE: "Display Discovery" is enabled.</p>

<p>I would go with these settings</p>
<ul>
<li>Use 720 because your display has a native resolution of 1366 x 768 or 1080 if you want the 360 to handle image scaling.
</li><li>Reference Level Expanded </li><li>Color Space YCbCr709 If that doesn't work use RGB </li><li>Turn off all the post processing options and make sure it's set to game mode. On yours the only major option is denoise so turn that off when playing games.
</li></ul>

Hello,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I'm making a software to be used with Microsoft Mixed Reality and I had a question about using MR without any screen but the headset's.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I'm using a VR backpack (MSI VR One) and there is only one HDMI port, so I can only connect the headset to it, problem is it seems not to work if the headset is connected alone. To double proof that I connected the headset on an other computer that had a screen
 connected at the same time, and everything went well. But as soon as I unplug the monitor the headset stop rendering.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Is there a way to use a MMR headset without any screen connected ?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Mixed Reality is a combination of augmented reality and traditional <strong>Virtual Reality</strong>. The former technology overlays interactive virtual objects into the real world while the latter puts the user in this newly created place. With this, we

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is compatible with MR (Got&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;You're good to go</span>&nbsp;with the check
 up).</p>
<p>It just can't have a Monitor and the headset connected at the same time because it only have 1 HMDI port and no other Monitor Port (No VGA No DVI etc)</p>
<p><br />
I'm looking for a workaround to make the Mixed Reality start just by having the Headset connected and no monitor screen.</p>

            If you want to reproduce my problem, connect an ACER Mixed Reality headset to a compatible computer, run Microsoft Mixed reality, put your headset (everything should be fine and you should be able to be in the Microsft MR lobby) once this is done, just
 unplug the main monitor connected to you PC (not the headset), now put your Headset back on your head, the headset won't be rendering anymore.

<p>I see, so I must find a monitor that would work by being only powered by USB, and connect it's HDMI cable to a USB to HDMI adapter, and then Find a way to dock the screen in the backpack.<br />
</p>
<p>While that is a possible thing to do, isn't there just a way to use a Mixed Reality Headset without screen ? Like other Virtual Reality headsets ?</p>

<p><span>We're committed to making Windows Mixed Reality a great experience for you.
</span>This feature is not yet available, as the screen is very much needed to view the content or the games that you are playing using it. It is also the reason why the

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I also use a Vr One&nbsp; with windows mixed reality&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in order To be full wireless i use the wireless Microsoft adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/adapters/wireless-display-adapter-2/p3q-00001</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the connection must be done first by teamviewer with your smartphone or tablet&nbsp; . (To connect vr one with&nbsp; the wireless adapter ) and then just close teamviewer and&nbsp; evrything Will be smooth&nbsp; and&nbsp; completly wireless&nbsp; .</p>
<p>Vr One with windows MR is the Best solution ever ..</p>
<p>
</p><p>NB: I still don't understand why a monitor is absolutely necessary with windows MR. While Steam&nbsp; Vr and oculus don't need it.</p>
<p>It must be an option.</p>
<p>Jpb.</p>

<p>So my issue is that I&nbsp;purchased a seasons pass for RE Revelations 2 on my xbox 360. And recently I&nbsp;invested in a Xbox One. So this game is available on both consoles and all DLC's&nbsp;and things like that should carry over from the 360 to Xbox one. That is how it should be ( as far as my research goes).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But on Xbox one marketplace it keeps asking me to &nbsp;purchase the season pass again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used the&nbsp;season pass on my 360.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;reinstalled the game twice on the Xbox one.</p>
<p>Can someone help me with this ?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hey there RunnySquid5.<br /><br />Where are you seeing that the Xbox 360 version is cross-purchase for Xbox One? Unfortunately Resident Evil Revelations 2 would require a separate purchase on the Xbox One to access the content.&nbsp;</p>

</strong></b>For the last month or so when playing games or downloading updates on my Xbox One, Xbox Live will ping my internet so much that my Ping will go from 19ms all the way up to 300+ms. My download speed will also drop to around 2-5mbps. Upload speeds
 also suffer. The issues have nothing to do with my net, this started happening around the time that XBL had a DDoS attack and the rollout of 1409 to the public, and it hasn't been right since.</p>

<p>Just a bit more information, as I was typing out my Original post I was also downloading a 1410 Preview update on my Xbox One.
</p>
<p>While the update was downloading I ran a speedtest at www.speedtest.net. It showed my ping at around 245ms with download speeds at 2.5mbps upload speeds at 0.80mbps.
</p>
<p>Now that the update has finished downloading my ping is now back to 19ms. Download is back to 16.25mbps and upload is back to 1.25 mbps. &nbsp;Yes I have crappy speeds, but I have NEVER had this problem with Xbox Live.</p>

<p>Also I have now hooked up my Linksys WRT54GS2 router to see if that was a possible issue. It is doing the exact same thing. Also have had 3 different modems from Time Warner Cable with no luck.</p>
