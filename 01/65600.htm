<h2>            Not showing any DLNA device</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>for some time I was using the Teufel Connector 2 and Stream What you Hear to play music with DLNA from my Windows 8.1 Pro Pc to the below listed Teufel Connector.</p>
<p>As already said, it worked for several weaks but out of the blue stopped working now.</p>
<p>I haven't changed any Firewall settings, Router settings or Connector Device settings.</p>
<p>I can ping the Connector over my local network, it does not show up as an DLNA Device.</p>
<p>I can connect to it with the provided Android App.</p>
<p>As it already worked and is still working with the app it seems to be windows specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I properly configure DLNA in Windows?</p>
<p>- The explorer showed the Connector and it's Media server (does not show it now)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need any additional patches, registry settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My DLNA capable device:</p>

            <p><span>Hi Balublue,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>DLNA stands for Digital Living Network Alliance. The Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) is a non-profit trade organization that comprises most major electronics and software companies. DLNA maintains a strict set of guidelines that allows computers
 and other devices to share digital media via a network.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) is a media sharing standard designed to allow networked PCs, printers, consoles, tablets, phones and other devices to communicate and share media such as photos, video and music over a wireless network.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The goal of this nonprofit trade organization is to ensure product interoperability over a wireless home network. DLNA-certified devices are equipped to discover, connect and communicate with one another over a shared network, which potentially gives
 you, the consumer, multiple options by which to play back and display video, audio and photo files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Several manufacturers offer devices that provide a great streaming experience. Other manufacturers don’t always advertise that their devices are compatible, yet many people report a great experience with them. If you’re looking for a new device or
 want to know more about device compatibility, be sure to look through both the Windows Compatibility Center and the Windows Certified Products List. It’s not always simple to know ahead of time if you can stream to a specific device, so doing some research
 before you start can help minimize frustration later. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are more considerations about compatible devices. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>•A simple way to start streaming is through an Xbox 360. When you choose the device to stream to, select the Xbox 360 rather than the devices connected to it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>•Many devices with DLNA certification will work with Play. However, a device with this certification logo doesn’t by itself mean you can stream to it. Be sure that the specs for the device say it has a Digital Media Renderer (DMR) certification.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>•If you're going to stream directly to a TV or speakers, follow the instructions the device manufacturer provides to connect the device to your network. In many cases, this is as simple as connecting the device to your router with an Ethernet cable.
 Once you connect a device to your network and have sharing turned on, Windows should automatically find the devices that work with Play.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Further, I am happy to know that the issue is resolved now. To know the cause of this issue, you may put the computer in a clean boot state and observe the computer for about a week and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with this program, application
 or device. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow steps under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></p>

            <p>This has to be a Windows bug.</p>
<p>I found this article regarding Windows 7 <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/f94371cd-4078-4446-9b28-a43c73ff00b1/windows-7-doesnt-see-dlna-device?forum=w7itpromedia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>The person change the router, but as I already mentioned, it's working fine with the android app, it's just windows being silly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting my pc will bring back the dlna devices, but they'll disappear after some while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wall of text you provided is no solution for this and is merely some information I already had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps.: I don't mean to sound harsh, but it is really annoying to always restart the pc to fix this.</p>

<p><span>You may reset the router and check if this helps. Refer to the router manual. Further, you may also update the firmware on the router. You need to visit the device manufacturer’s website
 of the router to make sure they have the most updated firmware.</span></p>

<div>&nbsp; I'd be curious if when you are in the "bad" state if you </div>

<div>&nbsp; 1. disable then re-enable the adapter and</div>
<div>&nbsp; 2. from a cmd prompt run ipconfig /flushdns</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>recover from the bad state and then see the DLNA device. </div>

<div>I've recently noticed some strange DNS failures with network devices (not</div>

            <p>It is a wired connection.</p>
<p>I cannot test the failure right now as I am not close to the DLNA player until October but will keep you updated once I can test it.</p>

<h2>            SC OpenSCManager fails with access denied on Remote Machine</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>I have three Win 2k8 R2 machines, first booted with English OS, second booted with Japanese OS and third one booted with Russian OS. All the machines are in Workgroup and have same username &amp; passwords and have administrative rights. I am trying to start
 RemoteRegistry service on English OS from Japanese OS and Russian OS machines through command line(Ran as Administrator) using following command:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sc "English Machine" start RemoteRegistry</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When fired from Japanese machine above command completes successfully and RemoteRegistry Service gets started on English machine. But when I fire the command from Russian machine, the command fails with "Access Denied" error.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I compared Event Viewer Security Logs for both the cases and Noticed that when fired from Japanese machine TargetUserName is "Administrator" and TargetDomainName is the machine name of English OS machine. However when fired from Russian OS, TargetUserName
 is "администратор" (which is Administrator in Russian) and TargetDomainName" is the machine name of Russian OS machine. This shows that in case of Russian OS logon attempt is made with Russian machine's Credentials which I think is the reason for "Access Denied"
 error.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone please let me know why Russian machine credentials are used in this case and How can I resolve this issue ?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance!!!!!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Alex,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It appears that some of the system files are corrupt. You have mentioned that the SFC scan found some corrupt files, but didn’t fix them. In this case, I would suggest you to run the DISM tool and check. You can refer to these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key + X, select ‘Command prompt (Admin)’.</span></li><li><span>In the Command prompt window, type the following commands and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; press enter after each command:</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<ol>

 However, my speakers works perfectly fine on my other devices and phones. </p>

            There are issues to prevent Bluetooth from working. Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try:
<br />
<br />    Check Windows Update for the latest updates then install them.
<br />    If Windows Updates does not have any updated drivers, check the manufacturers website. Updated Chipset drivers might also be available, apply them to see if it improves connectivity.
<br />    Launch Device Manager, right-click the Bluetooth driver, click uninstall, then restart your computer.
<br />    For the Bluetooth device you are connecting to Windows, make sure it is fully charged and is within range.
<br />    If other Bluetooth devices are on, disable them temporarily.
<br />    Reset the device to see if it works. This usually involves holding down the power button until the device is powered down.

            the question is not about ubuntu but about wsl which is part of windows 10. There is no problem using cups-pdf in ubuntu, the problem, or my question was: is it possible to print to a virtual pdf printer in wsl.?Clearly in Ubuntu there is no problem and
 is easy to do but what about WSL in WINDOWS 10?

<div>If Group Policy Editor is available for your version of Windows, configure the following setting.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Group policy editor is available only in Professional, Ultimate and Enterprise edition of Windows 7. You will not have the Local Group Policy Editor available in the Windows 7 Starter and Home Premium editions. If Group Policy Editor
 isn’t supported in your version of Windows, go to Method 2.<br />
<strong><br />
Method 1: Via Group Policy</strong><br />
<br />
1. &nbsp;Go to <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>secpol.msc</strong> and press <strong>
Enter </strong>to get editor up.<br />
2.&nbsp; Locate "<strong>Network Security: LAN Manager Authentication Level" in </strong>
the list and double-click on it.<br />
3.&nbsp; Change the setting from "<strong> NTMLv2 response only"</strong> to "<strong>Send LM &amp; NTLM - use NTLMv2 session if negotiated".<br />
</strong>4.&nbsp; Network Security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP Based (including secure RPC) Clients.<br />
5.&nbsp; Change the setting from<strong> "require 128 bit"</strong> to <strong>"unchecked (No Minimum)".<br />
</strong>6.&nbsp; Click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: Via Registry.<br />
</strong><br />
<strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However,
 serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more

<p>Salut,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>La procédure à suivre est simple:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Déposer une plainte via le profil de cet utilisateur </li><li>Poser une mauvaise évaluation </li><li>Bloquer les communications </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Il faudrait également arrêté de parler de "Hack". Le terme à employé est "Vol". Sans l'identifiant et la mot de passe associé, cette personne ne peut pas toucher à ton compte. C'est pourquoi,
<b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">il est primordial de ne pas donner ces informations</span></b>. Dans ton cas, je crois qu'Il veut surtout te faire peur.</p>
<p>Cela étant, il serait judicieux de ne pas donner ton adresse mail et ton numéro de dossier sur un forum et donc, à la vue de tous. De plus, la délation est interdite sur les forums xbox.com. En conséquence, merci de ne pas nommer le deuxième gamertag.</p>

<p>Salut,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>La réponse à ta question est dans mon précédent message. La délation est interdite sur les forums Xbox.com. Ce n'est pas en citant tel ou tel utilisateur que son problème sera réglé .... Pire, cela peut même se retourner contre lui, dans la mesure ou ces
 joueurs sont cités à leur insu et peuvent donc demander à leur tour des sanctions.
</p>
<p>De plus, la communauté Xbox n'est pas non plus obligé de le croire, qui plus est ... sans preuve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Si vraiment le créateur de ce topic possède ces preuves, il faut, dans un premier temps, faire les démarches que j'ai écris dans mon précédent message. Ensuite, il peut toujours fournir les gamertags et les preuves à un modérateur qui pourra, le cas échéant,
 prévenir le service compétent (XBLPET : Xbox Live Policy Enforcement Team) pour faire ce genre d'enquête.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cela ne sert à rien de se faire justice soit même. En général, cela fini toujours mal ...
</p>

<h2>            I get an error, &#34;not valid win32 applications&#34; when I click on the desktop icons.</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 7, I have a problem. Whenever I access shortcuts from the start menu or taskbar, I am told the applications are "not valid win32 applications". But the curious thing is, they all work fine. When sent a message on Steam, I could then run the program
 correctly. On the taskbar, it would be shown with a blank icon, but would still run. The same goes for Spotify; it opens automatically and runs just fine. When accessing a link, my web browser would then be opened correctly; if I tried to access the web browser
 shortcut I'd be told it didn't work. When accessing Dota 2 from within Steam, it runs just fine, but with an icon. I've already deleted IconCache.db and replaced it with a blank txt file then renamed IconCache.db. I installed a broken shortcut fixing software,
 but it didn't work.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This all happened when one application, Spore Galactic Adventures, was treated as a file, so I opened it with "SporeApp", after which, all icons became blank and all shortcuts broken. I can't continue to use my computer like this.</p>

            <p><b><span>Hi Technobliterator,</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) Do you get any <b>error message or error code</b>?<br />
2) Have you made <b>any changes</b> on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><span>
<p><br />
Method 1-</p>
</span></b>&nbsp;
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b><span>-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You need to check if this issue persists in <b>Safe Mode.<br />
</b>Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></span></a></b><br />
<br />
<b>Note</b>: Make sure you log back into <b>Normal Mode</b> after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You need to select “<b>Safe mode with Networking</b>” instead of “<b>Safe</b> <b>
Mode</b>”.</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed to <b>Step 2</b> if, the issue does not persist in <b>Safe Mode.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2-</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
I would recommend you to perform <b>Clean Boot.</b><br />
Putting your system in <b>Clean Boot</b> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><br />
</span><span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a<span> clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></span></a></span></b><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: You need to follow <b>Step 7</b> from the article mentioned above to get the computer back to
<b>Normal Startup</b> after you follow all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<b>Method 2-</b></p>
<p><span>Run the fixit from the article-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/system_maintenance_for_windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Fix broken desktop shortcuts and common system maintenance tasks</span></span></a></span></b><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3-</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would have you <b>run an online virus scan.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the article-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></span></a></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: The antivirus will try to <b>repair bad sectors</b> on the hard drive damaged by virus. Any data present on these sectors might be lost in the process. Proceed at your own risk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><br />
<b>Method 4-</b></p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><span>Try a <b>different</b> <b>user account</b>. Check if the issue persists over there.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
If yes, then refer the articles-</p>
</span>&nbsp;

jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.<br />
The application must also be compiled with debugging<br />

            <p>Most likely the dual-core/quad-core processor has no updates,the pc hardware associated with it would be</p>
<p>chipset software/drivers or a pc BIOS update,the BIOS would only be thru the pc mfg web site.The current chipset</p>
<p>would be thru intel</p>

<p>The embedded might be right,edit the tabs,or start over at intel.com/support/drivers/software,browse/chipset software.</p>
<p>The only processor updates ever offered for dual-core,are the processor frequency type utilitits.Either way,intel offers</p>
<p>more driver updates than youre pc mfg would/did....</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your first link says page not found,</p>
<p>&nbsp;the Intel site does come up with this link: and several others, but not sure if this is correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/22326/Intel-Platform-Controller-Hub-PCH-EG20T-Windows-7-Embedded-Standard-7-Drivers?product=53</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the note on the driver details for what it is saying to me is: </p>
<p>Windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware. (Code 37)</p>
<p>&nbsp;do i need to download an info type file for the system to actually find the drivers instead/as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you for your help</p>

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>yes I was aware of that page and downloaded the chipset utility which said that the drivers are up to date?. I found that odd as both core CPU's are showing an exclamation mark in the Driver Manager?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would this be a case for a BIOS update?</p>
<p>Or, am I not downloading the correct drivers?</p>
<p>It is, according to the system using 32-bit</p>
<p>

            <p>There is no driver for the CPU. If reinstalling the chipset software does not fix things, I would try the Intel display driver and the BIOS upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, right-click a core, click Properties and tell us what Device status has.</p>

<h2>            skype doesn&#39;t let me send or receive messages sometimes</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So occasionally, Skype will do this thing where when I try to talk to one person, it won't let me receive or send messages. I'll be able to communicate with everyone else, and it'll say they're online, this just won't happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the other day I tried talking to this one person, and it was showing that they were offline. My messages showed as sent, but when they came online, I got no answer. It was strange, until I finally received a message from them going "are you
 online?". It had showed that I had been online the entire time, but none of my messages had been going through. Finally, for no reason, my messages were finally being received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried looking at online posts, but all I could see was unanswered questions. So I don't know why this happened.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that few weeks ago, we had an issue sending and receiving instant messages on Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate your issue, what's the exact Skype version installed on your device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this happening when signing in using Skype for Web <strong>(web.skype.com)</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            It actually just happened again right now, which is getting a little frustrating, because I need Skype to communicate with this person.

            The problem somehow got fixed, but with no apparent problem solving. We just kept logging in and out and in and out, until eventually it showed them as online and I could finally send messages. I just want to know a solution to the problem that I can use
 when this happens again.&nbsp;

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This didn't work. I followed the steps exactly, and instead, Skype just froze and glitched so bad I couldn't even close it. It took me about five minutes to even be able to hit the quit button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next option is to just keep closing and and opening. Anything else?</p>

<p>Hello Gijojo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. In order to set this up the way you like, you need a specific setup. The Mic you use needs to have an AUX port somewhere on it. The headset you use needs to have a removable mic that connects via AUX port as
 well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So you would have: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The mic plugged in via USB for power</li><li>The Headset plugged into the controller</li><li>Your Mic connected to your headset via AUX cord.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This set up will work for party chat as well as streaming. </p>

            <p>Are you talking about a Google Drive folder that is mirrored on your PC? For performance reasons, you probably want to work with the video on your PC's hard drive rather than pulling it from Google drive directly. But if you have set up Google Drive so that
 you have a local copy on your PC, you already have the files stored locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are instead talking about going directly to the cloud, you might see some hiccups as you try to dynamically preview your changes. If you see that, then you'll know that you want to copy it locally first.</p>

            <p>Sounds like either the driver isn't recognised or it requires updated drivers or it's using an incorrect driver, under device management right click on the WD drive &amp; open properties, under drivers click update driver &amp; then automatically search for an updated
 driver, if this doesn't find on or says it's upto date, rerun it again but this time choose to manually search &amp; show compatible drivers, then choose to install the driver &amp; once installed restart the computer with the drive connected &amp; it should appear.</p>
<p>I had the same problem with a new 6Tb Seagate drive even though I already had a 4Tb drive from the same company working well.</p>

            Hey there NBLCAMUY,<br />
<br />
I would first suggest to try the drive on other ports with other USB cables and possibly test it on other systems. If the drive gets recognized properly do run a diagnostic check and see the condition of the drive and see if it's the one causing the problem
 or there are other issues. I would suggest to use WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic and see if the drive passes both the quick and the extended tests. Here's a link to the tool: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=<br />
<br />
I might be a good time to create a backup of the data inside the drive if you get it recognized.<br />

<h2>            Pressing space doesn&#39;t change to kanji input in Japanese IME</h2>
                    <p>I use Windows 7 and tried writing Japanese before. It worked, but only in a separate window that would show the hiragana and kanji before putting them into the actual document. This separate window would disappear when deleting words and not reappear when
 continuing to write, so that you could not see the input anymore. This was quite annoying and I tried changing the settings. Now whatever I do I just get hiragana input and pressing space actually just puts a space in the document but doesn't change the input
 to kanji.</p>
<p>I used the Japanese input on my old computer with XP and had the input right in the document and could change to kanji by pressing space. Is there a possibility to get that settings in 7 as well and what do I have to change?</p>

            This was not my problem. I have no problem changing between languages. I had japanese input and got hiragana when typing but no kanji when pressing the space button. However I found that the conversion mode was set to no conversion. I must have switched
 to this accidentally when trying out different settings. I get normal conversion now.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Fernando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, Mail app will sync and take the language from System language, which is set as default. The same applies for the auto correction option while sending an email from Mail app. I mean, the auto correction option will work accordingly as per the default
 system language and provide suggestions for correcting the words.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In view of the same,&nbsp;to&nbsp;get suggestions or proofing&nbsp;in Spanish for the content which is typed in the Email app, you should set Spanish as default system language. Navigate to
<strong>Start</strong>, select <strong>Settings</strong><span> &gt;<strong>Time &amp; Language &gt;Region &amp; language.&nbsp;</strong></span><span>Under
<strong>Language</strong>, click <strong>Add a language</strong> and select the appropriate language.</span> Go back to the “<strong>Time &amp; Language</strong>” screen and click on the language you just installed and select&nbsp;“<strong>Set as default</strong>”,&nbsp;and
 reboot your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi ms. Sarkar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd just like to point out, that using the systems internal language for proofing, without the possibility to change it within the applications own menus is a VERY poor choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further more, when I finally did manage to track down a location within the application, where the currently set proofing language is selected, I changed it to the language, that I was typing in.</p>
<p>This looked like it was working (for the email I was typing at the time), until I pressed backspace, and the language changed back to the systems default language, and just started changing words that are very similar in spelling to English words.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is there no option to disable proofing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This needs to be fixed ASAP.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Same problem here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kinda like the Mail app, but the Proofing options are driving me crazy, making it impossible to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start a new email, go to the Options TAB and change the mail language (I write a lot of emails in English, Portuguese and Spanish), but then suddenly the app just seems to go back to the system default language, English, and starts to auto correct words
 and saying that everything is misspelled. It also happens if I press backspace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even understand how this passed your usability tests. Its a simple and very trivial situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line is: If I choose Portuguese, the app shouldn't change to another language just because I pressed backspace or whatever reason. It should keep the Portuguese until I chose another language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please correct this ASAP.</p>

            <p><em>Answer :&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong></p>
<p>-&gt; <strong>Time &amp; Language</strong></p>
<p>-&gt; <strong>Country or area</strong></p>
<p><strong>Add </strong>the languages you need proofing for.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Usage :</em></p>
<p>Start Mail and start a new mail or reply.</p>
<p>Use <strong>ALT-SHIFT&nbsp;</strong>or <strong>mouse </strong>to change to the language you want to type in.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Notes :</em></p>
<p>I have freehand translated the Settings sub-categories so use your imagination if they are not the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be aware that the language setting is per caret position, so if you start typing in language1, later type in language2 and jump back, the language setting in Mail will change accordingly but the language shown on the system tray will not. That can be confusing.
 To see what language the proofing is set to, select the Settings tab in the Mail.</p>

            <p>This changed in the version I am using (Version 17.7369.40791.0)</p>
<p>Now when writing an email you can chose the proofing language in the options tab. You can even have different paragraphs in different languages.</p>
<p>Great job!</p>

            Couldn't see this on the machine I was helping on. I use Thunderbird - it works much better. It is unacceptable that you cannot change languages really easily within an email program. Changing the input language is also not acceptable since it changes
 the keyboard layout which is catastrophic on a German machine.

            <p>****. After more than a year I still have the same problem. A Microsoft assistant just logged into my PC and tried it herself but there was no solution. The only solution we came up with is changing the language to Spanish&nbsp;altogether but that changes all
 my apps to Spanish and I don't want that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want a simple option on the mail app that will let me change the default proofing language to Spanish. I don't know why and I'm not a developer but it seems to be an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you help</p>
<p>

<h2>            MY LANGUAGE IS WEIRD</h2>
                    
<p>Okay I've had this weird language for about a year, its in mexican or something, and its starting to get to me, I can't buy stuff in the marketplace because I literally can't understand the language at all. I tried changing the language in my local language
 but nothing worked. The marketplace and the dashboard is in a different language, and its so annoying. Microsoft please help! I'm tired of this issue, I tried changing my language in my account management, but it didn't work, I tried changing the region, the
 region was in colombia, and I'm in Canada, and I ONLY speak english. So microsoft would you please help, that would be so kind, please?!?!?!? :/&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated. :p</p>

<p>If your account region is set to Columbia then I'm sorry to say that you'll have to create a new account. You can not change the region of an Xbox Live account.</p>
<p>Has it been like this since the day you created the account or did it happen after it? If it happened after you created the account then I suppose you could call support to see if they can assist but I doubt they could do anything for sure.</p>

<p>Everyone is correct. Region cannot be changed once set.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You have two choices at this point -</p>
<p>A) Ring Support for Canada</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1 (800) 4MY-XBOX &nbsp;or &nbsp;1 (800) 469-9269</p>
<p>Hours of operation:</p>
<p>9:00 A.M. to 1:00 A.M. Eastern Time</p>
<p>6:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M. Pacific Time</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>B) Make a new gamertag this time using the Canadian region with language set to English and this will resolve the issue.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Please be advised option A may not work as they may not be able to change the region either.</p>
