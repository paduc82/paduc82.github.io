            <p>Hello Ahdaakmalul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When does the error appear? Is it at the time of Windows startup or when you open an application/program?<br />
2. If error is related to any specific program, what is the name of that program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also realize the inconvenience you are experiencing due to application error issue. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to software conflicts or corrupt Windows files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Perform clean boot </strong>and check.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section ‚ÄúHow to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting‚Äù to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, use method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Run system file checker(SFC)</strong> and see if it helps.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It may ask for Windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with required information and do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Win 10 build 1607 issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fred_k111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 build 1607 issues</h2>
                    <p><span>Build 1607 issues: Cortana cannot hear me, graphics drivers must be reinstalled
 after every reboot, and my web cam is dead. &nbsp;</span><span>These are the problems I know
 of as of this date.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I spent an hour with tech support regarding graphics driver problems. &nbsp;He ended
 up verifying what I already had done (stopping windows from updating the nvidia drivers) and the problem still exists. &nbsp;In fairness to the tech, when he takes access to my computer, the desktop background changes to black and visually appears to change other
 settings as well. &nbsp;With those settings I have no issues with the graphics driver. &nbsp;As soon as everything returns to normal the problems return: 1. &nbsp;right click of the inbox in Outlook shows only a translucent box, NO MENU. &nbsp;2. &nbsp;Quick start does the same thing,
 no icons for anywhere from 1 min to 3 min. &nbsp;3. &nbsp;Bringing up Control Panel does the same thing, no list.</span></p>
<p>Cortana can't hear me at all using a usb headset that in the Cortana menus
 can't be found but in the sound app can be configured just fine. &nbsp;Webcam can't launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything worked fine before build 1607 installation. &nbsp;Even restored back before 1607 and verified.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System : &nbsp;i7 4790k, nvidia 770 gtx, Logitech c310 webcam</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Very Frustrated. &nbsp;Would appreciate any help someone might be able to give.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried as you suggested to no avail. &nbsp;I verified that the setting is still there. &nbsp;Still had to do a reinstall of the graphics drivers in order to even reply to your suggestion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reboot process even deleted the nvidia folder on c: drive. &nbsp;I had to go to another location on my computer and run the setup program again. &nbsp;This was done with driver 372.54 from nvidia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortan still can't setup the mic and yet the Sounds app does so without a hitch, then go back to Cortana and she can't even find the mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the input.</p>

<h2>            How can I gain access to my own locked files&#63; Changing permissions doesn&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
For years now I have transported an old hard drive around because on the hard drive are all my old photos from college (circa 2004). I would really like to get them because there are literally hundreds of my memories stored there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is how they show up to me:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73fe80ac-3931-403b-8f48-0810c1a49ec9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73fe80ac-3931-403b-8f48-0810c1a49ec9" /></a><br />
<br />
I have tried going into the ownership of the file and making sure that I have full control permission. &nbsp;That doesn't do anything helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see here, I have full effective access to the file(s).<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afb07cf8-e3b7-4ed9-b790-c435dcf7039c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afb07cf8-e3b7-4ed9-b790-c435dcf7039c" /></a></p>
<p>Security Audit shows this Principal User S-1-5-21-24..... I guess this is a security identifier but i'm not 100% sure if it's from my current Windows 10 machine or if it's from the old computer long ago (probably with xp on it but can't be sure).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3edb72c9-3b75-45a9-8793-8fe7bb8bf50c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3edb72c9-3b75-45a9-8793-8fe7bb8bf50c" /></a><br />
I cannot copy the file to the current machine. If I try, it looks like this:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bca9f768-bd66-4304-bdec-b85d8c28a5d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bca9f768-bd66-4304-bdec-b85d8c28a5d0" /></a></p>
<p>If I attempt to provide administrator access, this happens:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67f0cf82-c58c-4517-9a9d-14d30d8bd6c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67f0cf82-c58c-4517-9a9d-14d30d8bd6c9" /></a>If
 anyone is able to help, I would be most grateful. I don't want to lose all of these, but the drive has been around the block. So, I'd like to get the files up on the cloud and have them saved.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
JD</p>

            I thought I'd add that I also tried going through the cmd line as an administrator and using the "takeown" command. I tried it on an individual file and it said that I had successfully taken ownership, but the padlock is still on the fill and it still
 won't open and says I need permission.

            Try first changing the owner (click the "change" next to the owner) to you. Then, as owner you should be able to change the permissions for yourself.

<p>Hi JD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue occurs if your new system is not recognizing your files from your old hard drive, that is why it is asking for permission. We suggest that you check the troubleshooting steps in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2623670/-access-denied-or-other-errors-when-you-access-or-work-with-files-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>, and follow the resolution for Windows 8 since it also the same with
 Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate it if you could get back to us and provide us your feedback.</p>

            I can change the permissions successfully, but it doesn't allow me to do anything with the file and it stays locked. Further, when I am the owner, the file still behaves as if I am not the owner.&nbsp;

<p>I'm aware of all the responses below and have been trying all of those methods for years (including today). None of them do anything. I should note that it is not ALL the files.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Out of the 1600 or so on the drive that I'm trying to get, only about 300 of them are locked.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/93181290-868f-43ab-9782-828dc24146bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/93181290-868f-43ab-9782-828dc24146bf" /></a></p>
<p>One of the things on the link from Michael Gall was that the files could be encrypted. So, I took a look.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a747288d-4ca1-484a-9d06-9581c17f069b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a747288d-4ca1-484a-9d06-9581c17f069b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems that some of my files ARE encrypted. There's where it shows the box checked and there it's got my name (from old computer years ago) as the User with Access as well as a certificate thumbprint. I'm not sure how some of the files ended up encrypted
 and the rest not (unless it's corrupted somehow and just reading that way), but I'm not sure not what the next step would be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Found this in another forum and it sounds pretty identical to my problem. Had a computer crash probably back then, built a new machine and copied over the folder with pictures in it from the hard drive. Couldn't get to them all but didn't want to lose them.
 I vaguely remember using some corrupted file recovery software many years ago that I think let me see thumbnails of the pics but I couldn't get them. Can't remember now. It's been well over 10 years.&nbsp;<br />

<p>We appreciate your response. For further resolution on your concern in gaining access to your files, we suggest that you run
<strong>Check Disk</strong>. By doing this, it will check your hard drive and correct any errors. Also, it can be useful for troubleshooting read errors and other storage related errors. Kindly refer to the following steps:</p>

            Hello,<br /><br />This is widely reported and known issue at the moment. We're expecting a fix from Microsoft, in upcoming Windows Updates.<br /><br />As of now, you can use classic Windows Photo Viewer to view photos:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/open-images-with-windows-photo-viewer-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/open-images-with-wind...</a><br /><br />You can try VLC media player for playing MKV files as of now. To edit Photos, you can use MS Paint or third-party program such as Paint.net, IrfanView.<br /><br />Regards.<br /><br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.

<p>
</p><p>The Control Panel / Backup and Restore program does not see any of my four external drives even though those drives are visible to Explorer. I cannot figure out why and hope that someone here can give some guidance. I am running W10 under Parallels.</p>

            <p>Hi Kerwin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running W10 Home , build number 14393.447. &nbsp;The only other USB devices used in addition to the extrernal drives is a printer and that works fine. Another fact I'd like to add is that when I open Control Panel \ Backup &amp; Restore, it says "(Windows 7)"
 after the word Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>This issue might occur if the drivers are corrupted or incompatible or due to hardware problems.</span></p>
<p><span>We suggest that you apply the troubleshooting procedures listed below and check if it resolved the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1: Run the Hardware and Device troubleshooter</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>Start</strong> Button</span></li><li><span>In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong>view all </strong>option on the left pane</span></li><li><span>Run the <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>troubleshooter</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Update the USB Controllers drivers </strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Most hardware interfaces require driver software to work properly. If you recently upgraded from one version of Windows to another, power outages, viruses, or other computer problems, it's possible that the drivers have become corrupted. Downloading and
 installing the latest driver can resolve these types of problems.</p>
<p>

            <p>Derwin, thank you for your help. I've fixed the problem and it turns out that it was a Parallels setting and had nothing to do with Windows. &nbsp;In short, when I upgraded from W7 to W10 several months ago I never changed the Parallels settings to tell it to
 attach the external drive to W10 and not to W7, which I also kept an doccasionally use. My error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, i do not understand why Explorer in W10 was able to see all my external drives but Backup &amp; Restore was not. No matter I guess as the problem is fixed. Also, in following your advice I discovered that I had not turned on the auto update for drivers
 so that was fixed too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            Please note that Backup and Restore tool is only completely working for Windows 7. So that would be the reason of you having a problem with the Explorer. I suggest that you use the File History for creating a backup. Check out this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. For Backup and Restore, I suggest that you reconfigure your settings and ensure that your hard drives are being
 re-plugged before turning on your device.

You are exactly right, I am using speaker which are connected through Ethernet and the device is Samsung DA-E670. &nbsp;I tried to do the steps in the link you showed but it did not solve it.&nbsp;<br />

Thank you for your response

<p><span><span>Hi Vappor,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>‚Ä¢</span><span>Are you using administrator account to login?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: You may try to run a Disc Cleanup to remove the unwanted files and check if the issue remains.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information to run Disc Cleanup refer the following link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Delete files using Disk Cleanup.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you are still facing the issue, you may try the following steps and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Put the<strong>Computer in Cleanboot

<p><span><span>4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All. Click on
 Apply and then OK. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. After restarting the computer</span><span> you may try to install the files giving administrator

    <title>How can I stop constant disk activity&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> van wolverton  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I stop constant disk activity&#63;</h2>
                    My hard disk light flashes about once per second, often accompanied by the sound of the heads being moved. This has been going on for at least 18 months.&nbsp;I have read dozens of forum entries about this problem and tried many things.&nbsp;I have shut off indexing,
 system restore, I have fired up Task Manager and killed every process I &nbsp;don't think is needed, but it never stops. I have downloaded WinPatrol and tried without success to identify the culprit. I have scanned my system for viruses and malware with Avast!
 and McAfee and Windows Defender. How can I identify what is causing this? Can I stop it without reinstalling Windows 7 (or even reformatting the disk)? I'm just about at the end of my rope.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check each process in turn to see what it does. Wildly shutting down processes could make it worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have Avast and McAfee running, that will do it too.. Uninstall one of them..

            Under <b>Processes with Disk Activity</b>&nbsp;there are 2 entries:

<div><br />
<div>The B/sec numbers for System change, but not with each flash of the disk light (the interval varies from 1 to 10 or more).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Under&nbsp;<b>Disk Activity</b>&nbsp;the number of entries constantly fluctuates. They all show
<b>Image</b> of System with a <b>PID</b> of 4. The Read (B/Sec) is always 0, the <b>
Write (B/Sec)</b>&nbsp;at the top position (while I observed) ranged from a bit more than 17,000 down to just over 2,000. The filenames included:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\lastalive0.dat</span></li><li><span>C:\$BitMap (NTFS Free Space Map)</span></li><li><span>C:\$Mft (NTFS Master File Table)</span></li><li><span>C:\Users\Van\NTUSER.DAT</span></li><li><span>C:\Windows\System32\config</span></li><li><span>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\lastalive1.dat</span></li></ul>
<div>And many many more as the list changed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I doubt I've helped much, but that's what I saw. This is driving me nuts. I hope you can help.</div>

            I don't run Avast and McAfee at the same time (honest, I know better). I use Avast (free version) most of the time.
<b>System Idle Process</b> switches back and forth between 98 and 99. Just underneath it is usually
<b>taskmgr.exe</b>. It's usually followed by <b>PresentationFontCache.exe</b>,<b> perfmon.exe</b>, and one or more instances of
<b>svchost.exe</b>.
<div><br />
<div>I have a Western Digital MyBookLive 2TB drive for network backup and run WD SmartWare. If I sort the process list by
<b>I/O Reads</b>, the top two entries (by a mile) are <b>WDDriveService.exe * 32</b> and
<b>WDDMStatus.exe *32</b>&nbsp;at 740,000+ and 490,000+, respectively (the numbers increase with each flash of the disk light). Neither process shows any
<b>I/O Writes</b>, but both show some <b>I/O Other</b> (254,000+ and 62,000+, respectively). When I try to&nbsp;<span>kill the SmartWare processes</span><span>&nbsp;using the Task Manager I have to do it several times because
 they keep reappearing, so I'm not sure whether I succeed in killing them or not, but if I did succeed it had no effect on the disk light. It just keeps flashing.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The two <b>WDD---</b> processes are followed by
<b>AvastSvc.exe</b>, but its numbers are small and change very very slowly (28,000+ when the
<b>WDD---</b> processes had the numbers I cited above).</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I should go into msconfig and stop SmartWare from starting and see if that solves the problem. I'll do that, but not until after I send this. I'll post here what the result was. This whole thing is making me a lot tired and
 a bit crazy.</span></div>

            Update: I used <b>msconfig</b> to start in diagnostic mode, which starts the bare minimum of services. The Western Digital SmartWare services were loaded but not started; the Avast services were running but I stopped them also. A grand total of eight (8)
 services were running:

            <p>I was recently seeing constant disk access for my Windows 7 Pro system, with about 3% CPU use by the System (PID 4). Although 3% should not slow the system down significantly,&nbsp;my PC was sluggish to start and run basic applications.&nbsp;The disk light was flashing
 constantly. The&nbsp;resource monitor (accessed from the Task Manager) showed dozens of disk accesses by this System process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Following several threads and suggestions, I gradually stopped several possible culprits. Although potentially helpful, I stopped the Windows Search (indexing) service. I also stopped the SuperFetch service. These seemed to make only minor gains. I then
 stopped the Media Player and Media Center Network sharing services. Upon rebooting, my system is renewed and fast. My CPU sits between 0-1%, the disk is quiet, and ideal disk I/Os are in the single digits and small. I have not gone about adding back in any
 of these services to see if and which ones might be tolerable, but for now I am a happy camper.</p>

<p>Ayer pas√© horas jugando contra gente. Cuando juegas contra una persona el juego cambia completamente.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quiero decir, contra la IA es muy f√°cil, no se defiende bien, pero la gente... Cada turno suele ser aprovechado al m√°ximo, en una de las partidas nos tiramos una hora. Menudo vicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aunque han cambiado algunas cosas con respecto a la versi√≥n DS, (ha mejorado la jugabilidad y todo est√° m√°s compensado) creo que con el poder especial de Varkas se han pasado tres pueblos. Es muy superior a cualquier otro, ganar con ese es m√°s f√°cil, o eso
 me parece a m√≠.</p>

            If you rename the user account it should rename the folder üìÅ, at least it worked for me, the folder üìÅ used to be called HP and now carries my name after signing in with my Microsoft account.

            <p>Hi ŒùŒØŒ∫ŒøœÇ</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might arise sue to various reasons including issues with the Windows explorer, system file corruption etc. I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>Check if the Application Identity is started and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>‚Ä¢&nbsp;Open Run from Windows task manager as before.<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Type SERVICES.MSC and hit enter.<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Find <strong>Application Identity</strong>.<br />
‚Ä¢&nbsp;Right click on that and select <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, refer to the following method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Run the following command in an elevated Command prompt and check if it helps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
</span><strong>ren %windir%\System32\AppLocker\Plugin*.* *.bak</strong></li></ol>
<p><br />
Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. 
<br />
<br />Try Run the troubleshooting 
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt;Windows Store Apps &gt;Run the troubleshooter 
<br />Try to download it again 
<br />If that didn't work 
<br />Reset the Microsoft store 
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; select Microsoft Store &gt; Advance options &gt; Reset 
<br />
<br />If issue persist I would suggest you to follow these methods: 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Re-register Microsoft Store app for Current User 
<br />
<br />1. Terminate the Microsoft Store app to make sure it's closed and not running. 
<br />
<br />2. Open PowerShell 
<br />
<br />3. Copy and paste the command below into PowerShell, and press Enter. (see screenshot below) 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *Microsoft.WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register ‚Äú$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml‚Äù} 
<br />
<br />4. When finished, you can close PowerShell, and try opening the Microsoft Store app again .. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 2: Re-register Microsoft Store app for All Users 
<br />
<br />
<br /> You must be signed in as an administrator to be able to do this option. 
<br />
<br />1. Terminate the Microsoft Store app to make sure it's closed and not running. 
<br />
<br />2. Open an elevated PowerShell 
<br />
<br />3. Copy and paste the command below into the elevated PowerShell, and press Enter. (see screenshot below) 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register ‚Äú$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml‚Äù} 
<br />
<br />4. When finished, close the elevated PowerShell, 
<br />
<br />5. Restart the computer to apply. 
<br />
<br />6. Try opening the Microsoft Store app again. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you. 
<br />
<br />Angel.

            Hi Raquel,<br />
<br />
<br />
Since you are having issues with updating your software, I suggest that you download the
<strong>Windows Update Troubleshooter </strong>from this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
You may identify what are the updates that are failing, and install them manually. You can search for the updates on this
<strong><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep me updated on the result.
