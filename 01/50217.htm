<h2>            Unable to sign in due to User Profile not accessible</h2>
                    I am having problems accessing Windows 7 on an HP 110 netbook due to repetitive failure of the User Profile.&nbsp; The failure message does not indicate that the password is incorrect, just that the User Profile has failed.&nbsp; As I cannot sign-in, how can I adjust
 the user profiles please?

<p>I'll give you the fix for "User Profile Failed the Login" but if you are having constant problems with this, you may have hardware issues. If the netbook is still under warranty, you may want to contact HP tech support. If not, you can try hardware troubleshooting
 but will need to run tests from either a USB optical drive or a USB thumb drive.</p>
<p><br />
This error can usually be fixed by following the steps below. Doing all this requires a certain level of computer skills. You know yourself best and whether taking the machine to a competent local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place)
 is the better solution for you. <br />
<br />
1. Log into another user account with administrative privileges. If you neglected to make an extra administrative account do Steps 2-3. Otherwise continue at Step 4. Also see the general information about setting up user accounts at the end of this post.<br />
<br />
2. Boot into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. This will get you to the right menu where you can use your arrow key to select Safe Mode [enter]. The built-in Administrator account is disabled by default in Windows
 7. However, if no other administrative accounts exist on the system it may be enabled. If it is, you will see an icon for Administrator on the Welcome Screen in Safe Mode. Log into Administrator.<br />
<br />
3. If If you don't see the icon for the Administrator account in Safe Mode, then the built-in Administrator account is still disabled and you'll need to do some more work. If you have a Windows 7 installation DVD (not a recovery DVD) you can boot the system
 with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes [enter]<br />
<br />
[Note: Do not type the brackets!]<br />
<br />
If you don't have an installation DVD (only have a recovery disc), the computer mftr. may have given you the Windows 7 System Repair option (not a System Recovery!) on the diagnostic menu. This diagnostic menu is the same one where you can choose Safe Mode.&nbsp;
 Or you can make a bootable Windows 7 Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/</a>
<br />
<br />
Note: All the Neosmart recovery disc downloads are torrent files. There is a good explanation of torrent files at the Neosmart website. You will need a torrent client such as
<a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">muTorrent</a> to get the files. The torrent client will download the .iso file with which to create the bootable DVD. If you are creating the bootable DVD in an older operating system, you will need third-party burning software
 such as Nero, Roxio, or the free <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a> to burn the .iso as an image, not as data. Windows 7 can burn .isos natively.<br />
<br />
Now remove the rescue DVD you made, reboot the system into Windows, and log into the built-in Administrator account you enabled.<br />
<br />
4. Try a System Restore to when things were working. If you can log into your own user account, you're finished. Otherwise continue at Step 5.<br />
<br />
5. The critical files are under %systemdrive%\users\user-account\ntuser. The ntuser.dat file is actually a registry hive. Run Regedit elevated and select HKEY_USERS and "load hive" from the menu. Now navigate to:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList<br />
<br />
There is one line for each profile. If a profile is bad, check:<br />
<br />
a) That the key name doesn't end in ".bak" (remove .bak if there)<br />
b) That the RefCount value is 0 (change it if different)<br />
c) That the State value is 0 (change if different)<br />
<br />
Make any necessary changes, close Regedit and try to log in as that user.<br />
<br />
6. If that doesn't fix your profile, it is corrupted. At that point you should make a new Standard user account and copy your data to it. Do not delete the old account until you have retrieved the data you need!<br />
<br />
Once everything is working, log into the extra administrative account you will make per the suggestions below and disable the built-in Administrator account again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP, Vista and all other modern operating systems, Windows 7 is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges in Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may be more work than you want to do. Better not to put yourself into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</p>

<h2>            No internet connection</h2>
                    <p>So about a week ago, Windows tried to do a mandatory update on my computer for Windows 10. The download and install failed and now ever since then, I haven't been able to connect to the Internet. When I go to the Network and Sharing Center it says "unknown.
 The dependency service or group failed to start". I have already looked on this forum and tried the steps others have posted to do to fix this issue, but it doesn't work. I don't know what else to do but I'm very annoyed and frustrated with Windows and Microsoft
 for causing this problem,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>please help!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have Windows 8</p>

                    Unexpected kernel mode trap - ntfs.sys file windows 10 1803 build. The system eventually boots up, but every 3rd or 4th time booting it gets the boot failure (always recovers so far).&nbsp; This is after the April 2018 update. Toshiba Portege Z930-S9302 model.

            Hi Scott, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<br />Your system crashes are caused by MalwareBytes - MBAMChameleon.sys driver
<br />
<br />You should uninstall that software and restart your system
<br />
<br />Then if you do want to run that software, check their website for an updated version!

<h2>            Downloading games data become paused when i minimize the window. But i want it downloading in background</h2>
                    <p>I have installed asphalt 8 airborne from the store last night. It was 89mb then. Now i have opened it and it showed 'Downloading 879mb " . Well, i know this case. It is now downloading the data file.</p>
<p>But my problem is when i minimize this game, it became paused(not downloading). When i open it again from the taskbar, it resumes the download. But i can't keep it open for a long time while i gotta do another pc works.
<br />
So I want it keeping up downloading even i minimize it and doing other pc works . Is there any way of enabling background downloading of this game or any games ? Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>I am also unable to print to my Epson Workforce 520 immediately after upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>1. Printer is on my wireless network</p>
<p>2. Used troubleshooter numerous times - it kept finding a document in the queue preventing printing - which of course it would since every print attempted ended with an error and refused to go through. That includes a simple test print. Also downloaded entire
 driver package re Windows 10 and reinstalled printer. Rebooted PC 3 times. Turned off printer, waited, turned on (numerous times).</p>
<p>3. Yes latest software installed directly from Epson website.</p>
<p>4. Doesn't matter, nothing will print from any application including the test print from printer properties.</p>
<p>5. No</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have trolled Google for other suggestions. Nothing useful or that I haven't already tried. Microsoft website offers nothing but generic solutions to non-specific printer problems.</p>

    <title>UAC elevation prompt for WD Drive Unlock.exe to unlock external HD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> franklin-xy  say:</h3>
<h2>            UAC elevation prompt for WD Drive Unlock.exe to unlock external HD</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit<br />
Western Digital WD My Passport 2 TB external hard drive</p>
<p>Western Digital's security software allows a password to be set on the external drive, encrypting it. When the drive is connected to a PC, a virtual CD (VCD) partition runs (via autorun) an unlocker utility WD Drive Unlock.exe, that allows password entry.</p>
<p>When I connect the locked drive to a Windows 7 PC (that does not have any WD software installed), the autoun popup appears and I select "Run WD Drive Unlock.exe". At that point, User Account Control (UAC) elevation prompt appears, requiring Administrator
 password in order to continue.<br />
WD Drive Unlock then lets me enter password.</p>
<p>Because of UAC elevation, the unlocker can be used only by an Administrator user or by a standard user account who knows the Administrator password.</p>
<p><br />
QUESTION</p>
<p>Is UAC elevation prompt truly necessary?<br />
Is it appearing because Western Digital hasn't coded the unlocker exe correctly, or would any such utility require UAC elevation?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If the program automatically gives the prompt for the elevation, and&nbsp;you didn’t right click the program and select run as administrator, elevation would be necessary.&nbsp;You can try contacting Western Digital to see if there is an alternative or

            <p>Ganesh, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I select "Run WD Drive Unlock.exe" from the&nbsp;AutoPlay pop-up dialog. There's no way to run as admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you're saying that when the program causes UAC elevation, that's normal and not caused by some poor coding choices by WD?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, WD has no workaround, other than to give standard users the admin password, which seems counter to common security sense. Surely there must be a way to let standard users enter password to unlock the drive, without requiring UAC elevation
 and admin password.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A programs developer (WD in this case) can tell windows that the program needs to be run as administrator which windows will try and do, hence the UAC prompt, this is normal.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, if WD doesn't have any way of working around the problem, there's nothing we can suggest.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks. Yes, it appears there is no workaround at this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, what I want to know is:</p>
<p>Could WD code it in such a way that UAC elevation is not required? Is this occurring because they did not code the application properly?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems they assume that only Admin users would unlock a drive, while I think that standard users would want to do so as well.</p>

 I closed my PC.&nbsp; Now it will open only in the Safe Mode.&nbsp; Now Media Player will not open, one source said to replace driver and noted several errors.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Is it possible to install the original Windows Media Player, if so how do I go about doing that?&nbsp; We installed a virus cleaning program but did not remove all,&nbsp; still able only to use in Safe Mode.&nbsp; My computer is HP Windows 7, 64 bit.</p>

                    <p>Original title: <strong>Parental Controls</strong> </p>
<p>When I use my administrator account to turn on the parental controls I click the start button to bring up the menu and the menu comes up only for a second and then goes away. I keep trying to click the start button and the same thing happens. I can turn
 off the parental controls and then it works properly. Does anyone else have this problem? Does anyone know the fix?</p>

<h2>            How to delete account from Windows&#62;Settings&#62;Accounts</h2>
                    Ok I have upgraded to Windows 10, and have had nothing but trouble with Outlook since. &nbsp;My question is this. &nbsp;When you click on Start &gt; Settings &gt;Your Email &amp; Accounts &gt; Under Email, Calendar, and Contacts under +Add an account, I have 2 items showing
 the first is my Microsoft Exchange Account, the second is my outlook. &nbsp;It keeps saying attention required for the outlook. &nbsp;How in the world can I delete this &nbsp;account from this location? I do not need it, I do not want it there and it seems there is no way
 withing setting to remove it? any insight?

<p><span>Hi Wake1,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you check if Windows Explorer when opened fits to the screen?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you check this behavior in Safe mode?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> To check the behavior by booting the computer in Safe mode</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 F8 While restarting the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 Windows Advanced Boot options, select Safe mode and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you login to windows in safe mode, check if the program windows that you’re referring to when opened fits to the screen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use Display Quality Troubleshooter</span></p>
<p><span>The Display Quality Troubleshooter makes sure that your video card driver is compatible with&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;7, and checks to see whether your color calibration,
 video effects, and display settings are correct.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Open the Display Quality troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Display-Quality-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Display-Quality-troubleshooter</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 3:</strong> Update your video card drivers</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Visit the link below to know how to update a hardware driver that isn’t working properly</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: You need to update the driver for your display adapter component under Device Manager</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

    <title>Problems with Media Center recordings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beagle01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Media Center recordings</h2>
                    Started about a month ago: while watching recorded TV on Media Center, the show would stop and display an error message that "Media Center is unable to find the required files to display______. Please restart Media Center or your computer." Restarting
 Media Center and/or my computer did not help and the show would always stop at the same spot in the recording. If I restart the show, and fast forward through the "bad" portion of the recording, I can generally finish the show, but miss several minutes/seconds.
<br />
<br />
Also, and probably related, MC will sometimes record the show in two parts with some data missing in the middle. In either case, I'm missing seconds or minutes of the recording and it's very frustrating. Any help?<br />
<br />
I used Computer Management and found the following message on a few of the recordings:<br />
<br />
"Recording of ________ began late on 03/23/2009 18:58:03 due to a temporary failure caused by either a system malfunction or a power loss and was stopped due to a lack of audio/video data. Another recording attempt will be made."<br />
<br />
And no, I didn't restart or turn the computer off during the recording. <br />
<br />
I also tried sfc /scannow, with no luck.<br />
<br />
No new hardware installed, and never had a problem with WMC until around a month ago or so.
<br />

<p><span>Hey Beagle:</span></p>
<p><span>You’re most welcome.</span></p>
<p><span>**SNIP*** “</span><span>My screen sleeps after 20 min, but would that
 really be the problem after running this way for over a year?” (No, this won’t cause any trouble at all)…</span></p>
<p><span>Ok, let’s try some simple trials and see if somebody is stuck in the background. First let’s check performance
 and see what the unit is showing.</span></p>
<p><span>Performance and Reliability Monitor:</span></p>
<p><span>Click start, to search, type in Performance and Reliability, after booting the Performance and Reliability Monitor, click on “Reliability Monitor”, look in
 the system support section on the right side. If you can see what has failed, then you know what to search for and remove.</span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t find any problems or crashes in there, then let’s try a clean boot configuration.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span>REMEMBER.. After doing the “Clean Boot” and testing to see what the unit does.. Go back in to clean boot, and start working to boot programs down from there.
 Do not LEAVE the system in Clean Boot; you might need it again some time.</span></p>
<p><span>These Diags, will tell us what’s running, what’s crashing (if anything)..</span></p>
<p><span><span>THEN
</span><span><span>J</span></span><span> if you want to try to “Uninstall” the last update you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Let me know the name of the update and we can look up the “remove” instructions to make sure it doesn’t “remove” other stuff with it.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks again for the post. We look forward to hearing from you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and giving us opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you are facing issues with printing photos and receiving error message saying “Function address 0xe9861a45 caused a protection fault (exception
 code 0xc0000005) some or all property page(s) may not be displayed”. To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message or error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the links mentioned below to help troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Follow the steps in step 1, 2 and check if you are able to view printing preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Follow steps from the article and check.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Printer problems in Windows
</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/printer-problems-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/printer-problems-in-windows</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 2:
</b>Start the computer in clean boot to eliminate issues like conflicts with third party software and security programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of
 startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></a></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After troubleshooting, make sure to set the computer to start as usual as mentioned in<b> Step 3
</b>from the KB article mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>You may try running the following commands and check if the issue occurs and also see if the printer prints correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on the <b>
Start</b> button, and type <b>cmd</b> in the Start Search box</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Right-click</b> cmd in the Programs list and select
<b>Run as Administrator</b></p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<b>Continue</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>At the command prompt, type the following commands and press Enter after each one</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>net stop spooler</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>and then</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>net start spooler</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will stop and restart the print spooler service. If this resolves the issue of your printer printing incorrectly, please let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps. If you have any other questions related to Windows, please do not hesitate to let us know. We will be glad to help you.</p>

<h2>            How do I move all my libraries to a MicroSD card - not just make it the default save location&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good day everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows tablet is running out of storage space and I want to move all my libraries to a MicroSD card as it is taking up the most storage space on the device itself. Sites like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/188072/how-to-make-the-most-of-a-windows-8.1-tablets-limited-storage-space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="see the section">How-To
 Geek</a>&nbsp;provide details on how to change the default save location for different types of media, but they don't actually show how to actually move existing media to the new location - which I need to do in order to free up space on my PC's internal storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/136503/how-to-access-files-from-sd-cards-and-usb-drives-in-modern-windows-8-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Note the title:">
this article</a>&nbsp;describes how to make SD card files appear in Libraries for use in Modern apps, but I want to instead move the Library folders to the SD card from the PC - after all, I want to increase disk space on the PC itself for the upcoming Windows 10
 upgrade! My Library content takes up about 20-30 GB of the C: - can I move it all to a SD card and gain as much as possible of this space back for future use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>

<p>If you want to set your Libraries specifically to save to your SD card by default:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Document folder on your SD card, for example, F:\Docs.</li><li>Right-click your Documents Library, choose Properties.</li><li>Add the F:\Docs location to the list of Library locations, and set it as the default save spot.</li></ol>
<p>Now whenever you save something to your Library, it will save to the F:\Docs folder. &nbsp;Repeat for your other libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want to set your actual Documents folder to store on your SD card, as a silent/invisible redirect, you can also do this:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Document folder on your SD card, for example, F:\Docs.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Open up your "Personal folder" where your profile is stored. &nbsp;For me, this is C:\Users\Shawn. &nbsp;Yours will likely be similar.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Right-click your Documents folder, choose Properties, then the Location tab. &nbsp;Choose Move, then choose the folder you made in step 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Click OK, and choose Yes to move your current files to the new location.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Now whenever you save to your C:\Users\Shawn\Documents folder, the files will actually be automatically redirected to the F:\Docs folder instead. This is great for programs that don't "understand" the library method.</p>
