<h2>            Windows 10&#58; 0x80070005 Access denied, 0x80080005 server execution failed.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using windows backup on windows 10 for a year without any problem. But now I'm getting some stupid errors!
<br />
At the end of backup process it showed me 0x80070005 error code. I tried <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/backup-error-code-0x80070005/1ab5a681-0c88-4b98-a2c5-635d42fc314d?auth=1">
this solution</a>&nbsp;but didn't work for me. Block Level Backup Engine service could not start.&nbsp;<br />
When I selected my account name in LogOn tab still Block Level Backup Engine service could not start and showed me "error code 0x800700b7: Cannot create a file when that file already exist" and when I tried to backup I was getting error code 0x80080005 server
 execution failed. <br />
When I selected Administrator in LogOn tab&nbsp;still Block Level Backup Engine service could not start and showed me "Error 1069: The service did not start due to a logon failure" and another stupid error at the end of backup!<br />
Why is this happening?<br />
<br />
I didn't change anything since the last successful backup and I have +250 GB free space in the drive that backup stored.<br />
<br />
Sorry for my English,<br />
Thanks for helping :)</p>

Yes, the last update I did was "Feature update to Windows 10 Enterprise, version 1703" in 7/23/2017.<br />
Since that update, I had 3 successful backup without any problem.<br />
<br />
And no, I'm using two computer, a laptop and a desktop. Both are synced to an outlook account for logging in. The backup problem is happening on my laptop. I did no change anything to my desktop computer and I never tried to backup up on the desktop computer.

            <p>Hello Henri,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Hello is a more personal, more secure way to get instant access to your Windows 10 devices using fingerprint, face, or eye recognition. Most PCs with fingerprint readers are ready to use Windows Hello now, and more devices that can recognize your
 face and iris are coming soon. So, you might need to check with Dell support if your system is ready to recognize with Windows Hello or if there is a driver update needed for your system to work with the new Windows utility.</p>

            <p>It has been a week trying to resolve this problem. Numerous chats, &nbsp;spending hours and hours to get windows ten to work. Microsofts final answer: Contact Dell support. DELL Supports final answer: &nbsp;Roll back to windows 8.1? Wow, &nbsp;after their site confirmed
 my PC was ready for 10! </p>
<p>I did find on Google numerous developers complaining on the same issue and Microsoft did nothing about it. &nbsp;After a certain build number, &nbsp;during development, their fingerprint scanners stopped working! I guess Microsoft just launched windows anyway? &nbsp;I
 know for many a fingerprint scanner is no big deal, &nbsp;but it worked well where numerous people needs to gain access to the PC and you don't want to give them your password.</p>
<p>My version of win 10 have no "hello" &nbsp;anywhere?&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a week typing a password to open my PC (like in Windows 95)I am not that impressed with Windows 10. My laptop is slower overall. &nbsp;During startup sometimes you are staring at a blank screen for more than a minute before anything happens. &nbsp;I turned off
 almost everything in startup, &nbsp;but nothing improved. I am happy to report that the annoying slide out menus from win 8.1 aren't bugging me no more.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Do you have the right drivers installed for your dell? . I had the same issue after updating to win 10 on my Latitude e6410. But it seems that i didnt have the right drivers for the same laptop. Insted of searching for your laptop
 at the Dell support website. Try entering your service tag&nbsp; (probably found under your laptop) and then click on drivers and downloads and download the Control vault from&nbsp; there</p>

            It appears that some hardware is surely involved. Have you noted down the temperatures when it is running?

            The temps are good 70° when i game for my cpu and for my gpu 75° what i found is that my gpu (xfx r9 390x) on the site they say that gpu needs minimum of 700watt and i have 700watt so i think the reason why i crash is bcs i have to low watt?

<h2>            Appearance of a folder named &#34;Tracing&#34; affecting the final  location of video clip downloads to a secondary mirror video folder</h2>
                    
<p>Within this uninvited Tracing folder are sub folders, Logitech Cam, WPPMedia, Windows Live Messages(UCCAPILOG file), and Video.</p>
<p>I have attempted to delete the Tracing folder but it does not allow me to do so. On the appearance of the Tracing folder this upset the pathway to the video folder that i had previously set....consequently an additional and&nbsp;separate Video folder was also
 formed!!</p>
<p>This is causing havoc to where my vid clips are being downloaded</p>
<p>How did the Tracing folder appear, and what is it there for, AND how can i get rid of it??,</p>

<p><strong><span>Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I'm having a very strange problem here. Everything I do on my computer needs administrative privileges now, or else it will not function properly. I am unable to open iTunes without them because it says that it can't access the program folder, but if I open
 it with privileges, it works perfectly. Whenever I try to pin a program to the taskbar, clicking the "Pin to taskbar" button does nothing. Even right-clicking the shortcut and selecting Pin to Taskbar doesn't work. I can't download any type of files on Google
 Chrome; nothing happens when I try to save anything.&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span><span><strong><span>Chrome is also unable to save any new cookies as well, and I am also unable to watch Netflix Instant Streaming videos because of a Silverlight issue. Flash
 works, though.&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span></strong><strong><span>Whenever I try to delete any files or move files,&nbsp;<strong>in my "Documents" folder</strong>, it says "you'll need to provide administrator privileges... blah blah blah." This was working perfectly
 fine when I got the computer, but this just seemed to not work a few weeks ago.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
I have no flipping idea what's going on any any help would be appreciated. Thanks.<br />

<p><span><span>Hi&nbsp;ImBakinBacon,</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1. Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This may happen if the administrator account is corrupted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try creating a new administrator account and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Create a user account</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are unable to create user account, then<span>you may try to disable User account control and
 check if it helps:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Disable UAC (User Account Control) and check the result</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>See How do I change the behavior of User Account Control by using the slider?:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-change-the-behavior-of-User-Account-Control-by-using-the-slider" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-change-the-behavior-of-User-Account-Control-by-using-the-slider</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: You must restart your computer when you enable or disable UAC. Changing levels of notification does not require that
 you restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try to set the Default Administrator account and check if the issue occurs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click the Start button and click All programs followed by Accessories</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option and select'Run as administrator'.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may
 simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. In the Command Prompt window, type the command net user administrator /active:yes and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. Close the elevated command prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f. Log off (in Start Menu) and you will see your new built-in Administrator account next to your current account(s).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>g. Click on the built-in Administrator account display picture icon and log on to it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 3:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are not facing any issue, then try creating a new user account and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Fix a corrupt user profile:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is resolved then try to disable the default Admin account by following the command:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>net user administrator /active:no</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also enable the User Account Control.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Still can&#39;t log into my account after weeks of waiting</h2>
                    <p>It has been more than 2 weeks since I was able to access my main mircosoft and xbox profile. I have connect support several times and at this point I am being ignored. Is this normal to not fix a customers account. I have years of games, achievements and
 money that I have spent. I have software and licences that will only work if I am not using my Microsoft account that paid for the access. What is going on and why does no one care about this issue. Again when I try to log in i get these messages because the
 browser loops. This is in all my devices and my work computer. I have recovered my account multiple times and changed my password followed every support step available. I have waited over 72 hours to let the server reset and nothing! As you can see this is
 really frustrating. What do I need to do to have my account fixed....</p>

            When someone else repeatedly tries to sign in as you, it can usually make an automatic suspension of your account kick in. I had it happen to me and it can be a pain to get access back. Try talking to a customer support agent.

<p>if you call xbox support they will walk you through finding out what is wrong with your xbox. the lady i spoke with had me to to system info to give her the error codes while my xbox was turned on. that was how she verified that microsoft could fix my xbox
 for me. you might want to give it a shot. screaming at the support people for trying to do their job right does not help and will not get your xbox fixed either. be calm courteous, and you will probably get out of that call with a good chance of having not
 to pay to get your box fixed. no guarantees tho if you're outta warranty or the update is not responsible for your xbox meltdown, you're SOL. sorry.</p>

<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>Intellivision in 1979, then later Atari, the 2600 and 5200, the ColecoVision, a Texas Instruments TI 99/4A, a Commodore 64 and 128, eventually an Amiga.</p>
<p>A ton of old DOS games, especially anything made by Sierra and LucasArts.</p>
<p>Also had a bunch of games for the Apple II series.</p>
<p>Also NES, SNES, TurboGrafx 16, Sega Master System,Sega CD, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast, Neo Geo Gold System, &nbsp;3DO, Atari Jaguar, and for a while a Vectrex.</p>
<p>PS1, Xbox, Xbox &nbsp;360.</p>
<p>I still have most of it, and it all still works.</p>
<p>I've already given the kids the SNES and Genesis.</p>
<p>When they get older they're going to have an impressive pile of games to divvy up.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having trouble logging in to the Xbox App on an Android device is that correct? I recommend going to
<a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Account Site</a>&nbsp;and attempt to sign in there (top right corner) and see if it gives you any error messages or alerts. If you are able to sign in no problem then I recommend first
 restarting your phone and trying again. If it still does not work uninstall and reinstall the whole app and then try one more time. Let us know with a reply how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 throttles excessively, often down to 0.4 GHz</h2>
                    <p>I've recently purchased a 15" Surface Book 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When compiling large projects in Visual Studio 2017, I find that the processor often throttles excessively, often down to 0.4 GHz. As a result, compilation takes several times longer than it does on my 5 year old MacBook Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Core Temp app shows that the CPU at this point is at 50-55 degrees Celcius or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following question touched upon this problem, but the proposed solution did not work for me:</p>

<p>Hi T, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Newer devices have an adjustable power mode to allow you to balance your preference between best battery life and best performance. To view this setting, select the battery icon on the task bar. If your device supports it, move the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Power
 Mode</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>slider to either the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Better performance</strong> or
<strong>Best performance</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>setting.</span></p>
<p>You may check the this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4002019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for tips on how to improve your device performance in Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are few things that you can also try: </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. The toolkit runs through a series of tests to diagnose your Surface device.
<span>The diagnosis and repair time averages 15 minutes or less, but can take an hour or longer. This will also download the latest updates for your device. Please click
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> for more information about the toolkit. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool to determine whether your Surface memory is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the search box in the taskbar, enter<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>memory</strong>, and from the search results, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Memory Diagnostic</strong>.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Restart now and check for problems (recommended)</strong>.<br />
When your Surface restarts, the diagnostic tool will run and display the test status on the screen. Although the test may appear inactive, it’s still running. Windows will restart automatically after the test is complete.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Error Checking tool to scan for errors on your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>File Explorer</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in the taskbar and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>This PC</strong>.</li><li>Press and hold (or right-click)<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows (C:)</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Tools</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab, and under<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Error checking</strong>, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Check</strong>.</li></ol>

<p>Same problem here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SB2 worked fine until recently. I don't know it's the temperature (I bought SB2 in winter and there's no throttle problem encountered by that time) or updates, they said there is battery drain problem because of the poor power supply. Maybe they lowered
 the frequency in order to solve this.</p>
<p>Setting to Best Performace didn't fix the throttle at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a test chart by XTU, it's tested under&nbsp;<span>Best Performace setting, room temperature 30</span><span>℃.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c918c77-1eef-49e8-8e97-ba2f18f3a672?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c918c77-1eef-49e8-8e97-ba2f18f3a672?upload=true" /></a>The
 valley of the frequency curve is 0.4GHz.</p>
<p>Core temperature never goes beyond 65<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">℃. Actually, if the throttle was caused by heat protection, it's too conservative. Other laptops trigger its' heat protection at 80-90</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">℃
 normally.</span><br />

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Throttling issues can be caused by several factors. Have you done any troubleshooting steps? You might want to boot

<p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried troubleshooting &amp; safe mode today. There's no problem found by&nbsp;<span>troubleshooting.</span> And unluckily, I can not run any benchmark or heavy load programs on safe mode.</p>
<p>So I do not have any conclusion what the CPU behaves during heavy load on safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I noticed 3 details you might take as clues:</p>
<p>1. The throttling issue only happens during the daytime (30-35<span>℃</span>), which is 5 or more Celsius degrees higher than the nighttime(25<span>-28</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">℃</span>).
 So I think there might be a threshold at 30<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">℃.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. During&nbsp;</span><span>throttling, if you change Power Mode (just change it, from Highest to Lowest or from Lowest to Highest doesn't matter), the throttling issue
 will be gone for a very short period, like 10-20 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Put an ice bag behind the screen, where CPU is will stop&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">throttling.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I believe this is an overheat protection. And I still believe it's too conservative. The engineers might think a comfortable touchscreen cannot go
 beyond 60</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">℃. However, sometimes I don't use the touchscreen and prefer better performance. You know, an option could go beyond Best Performance mode without a 3rd party
 overclocking software.</span></p>

<p>And the temperature of my new house always stays at about 30 ℃ (or higher)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I noticed that while charging, the temperature is higher, and the throttle will more likely happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having the same problem. I tried to play a few games (different games requiring low and high performances), but the laptop CPU clock drops down to around 0.5 Ghz. Lowering the settings to even the lowest end doesn't change anything.
<p>One thing i noticed is that when I am in game, the fans hardly work (or very silent) and when the lagging starts and I go to desktop, then the fans turn on running fast and loud..Going back to the game seems to fix the problem for 20-30 seconds
 before which I get the problem again. So I am assuming that it is a heating problem where the laptop is not able to turn on adequate cooling process unless I exit the game.</p>
<p>This is a £ 3000 device and its breaking my heart that I cant play any game even with such high end components!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help someone&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm astonished people still have the same problem as me while Microsoft just ignored this and doing nothing.</p>
<p>In the previous month, I tried to learn things about CPU. Now I got a new conclusion, at leat for my case, that the throtting are caused by
<strong>Power Limit Throtting, not Thermal Throtting</strong> aka overheat protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Power Limit can only be configred by the manufacture normally. So yes,
<strong>it's Microsoft to blame.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c4c3a48-fd55-4b09-8fad-5d36c8f95696?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c4c3a48-fd55-4b09-8fad-5d36c8f95696?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>By ThrottleStop, we can know the reson why CPU is limited to is PL1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6fd8787b-c76d-49b9-b8dd-8278e3938c38?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6fd8787b-c76d-49b9-b8dd-8278e3938c38?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From this One, we can see when throttle happened, <strong>Power Limit Throttling was ON.</strong></p>
<p>And the <strong>core TDP</strong> dropped to an unbelievably low number at <strong>
1W</strong>. What's that mean? My smartphone got a CPU with power greater than 1W.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, what's the designed TDP for I7-8650U? Check this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c1d08d2-b958-41b7-b0ed-c017b513859b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c1d08d2-b958-41b7-b0ed-c017b513859b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>TDP-down is at 10W and 800MHz, whcih means, in the worst cases 8650U shouldn't go down beyond this line. UNLESS, I have said this before,&nbsp;<span>the manufacture configured it to another line. Let's see what my 8650U truly got:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0581c21-bbfd-4f21-adb8-4ad2d9677376?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0581c21-bbfd-4f21-adb8-4ad2d9677376?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Maximum is normal, shown as 300W but could go around 25W. However, <strong>the minimum is 0W!!!</strong></p>
<p>What's this crap? <strong>Allow 0W as minimum means it can go down beyond 10W at 800MHz and run at 1W at 400MHz.</strong></p>
<p>Now I am choosing to believe that <strong>Microsoft did this intentionally</strong> in oder to fix that power drain problem. And it's not as simple as a overheat protection.</p>
<p>Why not providing a power supply greater than 102W? Come on.</p>

<p>Having the same issue. Device becomes unuseable because of it. Changing power mode or removing the power supply fix the issue for a few seconds. It's a $3700 device.</p>

<p>Same problem here. In XTU or throttlestop you can see the Power Limit Throttling being flagged even though temps are ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on my 2nd surface book 2. I'm thinking about returning it for a 3rd time since I don't appear to have an option to refund a device that costs £3000.</p>

<p>Same issue here.</p>
<p>Started happening just as the European heat wave hit with high temperatures in the office (~30 degrees celcius).</p>
<p>After 2-3 hours of work the laptop drops to 0.4 Ghz max.</p>
<p>Placing an external table fan pointing directly at the laptop to keep it cool "solves" the problem.</p>

                    I recieved the 'black screen of death' on my Windows 10 PC, about a week ago. I've tried everything to fix it, and unfortunately, nothing has helped. It is a black screen with a blinking white underscore in the top left hand corner.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We are looking at a couple of possible reasons behind this incident. Mainly, a corrupted system file that caused the functions of your system to stop, pause, loop, or basically produce incomplete results. However, before we proceed to troubleshooting, we
 would just like to ask some questions first.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you able to boot your computer to any workable environment? (e.g. desktop, safe mode? etc.)</li><li>What are the steps that you have done so far?</li><li>Was there any changes to the computer prior to this concern? Installed update? Installed software?<br />
</li><li>Was there any particular application/software that you were using when you encountered this error?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Based from your post, our main objective is to be able to boot to a workable environment. Kindly try the suggestions below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Windows recovery</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us first try to enter<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recovery</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>mode. If we're successful, we should be able to fix the computer in no time. Repetitively tap the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>F8<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>key
 continuously before the Windows log appears until you end up on the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Choose</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>an</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>option</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>screen</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once successful, you will usually be presented with 3 options. Select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>. From there, select <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>
options</strong>. Finally, select <strong>Startup</strong> <strong>Repair</strong> first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Media Creation</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an alternative solution to be able to boot successfully. However, you will be needing an<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>installation
</strong><strong>disc<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>with<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>10<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>inside or if you don't have that, you can proceed by downloading the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows
 10 ISO files</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>from this<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. You can save it in an external device such as A Flash
 drive with at least<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>8GB<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>of free space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have Windows 10 installer. Have it connected/inserted into your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps that you will be following next:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be&nbsp;<strong>F12.</strong></span></li><li><span>The boot menu key might differ with each manufacturer. If you are unable to find the boot menu key, you may refer the user manual.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer, when the manufacturer's logo is displayed, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to&nbsp;<strong>CD\DVD</strong>&nbsp;ROM (in case you create DVD). Select USB in case
 you create USB.</span></li><li><span>Save then exit.</span></li><li><span>PC should end up on an installation screen. You will still have an option here to retain your old files. Please follow the onscreen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>I had the "boot to black screen" problem in 2016 and went through all sorts of gyrations before implementing Sharath Srinivasa's suggestion in his August 6, 2015 reply. I tried attaching an external monitor to my laptop (Lenovo T500),
 without success, and eventually disabled one of the two display adapters, which seemed to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, each time Windows 10 does a cumulative update, it enables all display adapters. So when the machine finally boots for the last time it is to a black screen.&nbsp; I've had this problem two or three times since 2016, most
 recently two weekends ago (3/11/2018), and so I was forced to implement Mr. Srinivasa's approach yet again -- which was to force a shutdown while booting three times in succession, then when in recovery environment after booting the fourth time, select Troubleshoot,
 then Advanced Options, then Startup Options, then Restart, then press F5 for Safe Mode With Networking, then open the Device Manager, look at your Display Adapters and see if you have two that are BOTH enabled. In my case I have an on-board chip set for video
 plus a Radeon HD3650 card. I disabled this card and rebooted, and after a few very slow starts, it started to boot up normally again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is disheartening to have to do this each time there's a cumulative Win10 update. I have a Lenovo T520 with only one display adapter, and it updates without this black screen problem each time.</p>

 were experiencing the same problem (or, variations).&nbsp; I fought the problem for 3 weeks, trying every approach offered by MS and tech-bloggers.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

            Hi  emvya, a new version of Windows was released this week, it is a large upgrade, if you install that, it should resolve any problems you are having with Windows 10 Updates and will make all the 1709 updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding your issue, I would first suggest is to
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:

<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

            Why would he need to contact XBox support for a windows driver error? &nbsp;I've been checking out this forum for the past week, and have found very few solutions posted to any Windows 10 gaming issues....&nbsp;

Wasn't the last version released on April 26, 2009?&nbsp; May not be compatible.&nbsp; Contact the manufacturer of the product.

            That's two separate problems.&nbsp; We;ll try to address each.<br />
<br />
For the USB, is there any reason you can't format it (is there data on it you don't want to lose)?&nbsp; Perhaps you can copy the data to a temporary folder on your PC and just let the system format the USB even though it's already formatted.&nbsp; Hopefully it will
 be a one time thing and not prompt you to format every time you stick it in the machine (then we'll need to check your system files for corruption or check the USB for corruption).<br />
<br />
For the music files, go to C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Music and see what's there.&nbsp; Can you double-click on a song and have it play?&nbsp; If so, select the songs you want to copy and right click and click copy.&nbsp; Then move to the USB drive and right click and select paste.&nbsp;
 If it won't copy the files but will play them then I'll be very confused because it obviously is able to see them.&nbsp; Let me know.<br />
<br />
If you still can't copy and paste the music, then <span>
let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.</span>
<div>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning
 copy or paste functions (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work (or if SFC found corrupt files), we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            The &#34;Windows Default&#34; sound scheme has an combination of XP and Windows 7 sounds instead of Windows 10 sounds</h2>
                    I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 a while ago but there is one very annoying thing: The sound scheme has an combination of Windows 7 and Windows XP sounds. I gone to settings and I seen that, very weirdly, the Windows 7 sounds schemes where there.
 I selected Windows Default sound scheme and it had the same Windows 7 and XP sound combination. I really like the new sounds that Windows 10 comes with and It's sad that they don't work properly.
