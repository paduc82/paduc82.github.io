<h2>            Windows media player does not recognize Zen player</h2>
                    I have Vista 32 bit. I've been using WMP 11 (the latest version) to sync files to Creative Zen (latest firmware) for a long time without a problem. But I've been having problems for a month wherein WMP does not recognize the player. I've tried<br />
http://support.creative.com/kb/ShowArticle.aspx?sid=19287- I dont have the USB permissions problems as I figured out that was for vista.
<br />
and this http://forums.creative.com/t5/MP3-Players/If-your-Zen-is-not-being-recognized/m-p/525888<br />
None of these seem to work. <br />
Please suggest any other options. <br />
Thanks!

            Erm.. I thought I was clear. WMP11 is not <strong>detecting</strong> the player in the first place to do anything with the sync (the sync tab says "connect a device" even though the device is connected). I was using WMP11 to sync my files for a long time
 and suddenly this started last month. My player does get recognized in device manger. What I have tried.
<br />
(1) Device specific functions like clean-up, format, updating firmware <br />
(2) Tried to reinstall WMP11- found that you dont get the 11.0.6 version anywhere. But the one I have is the latest, and does not have updates. Apparently the only way to reinstall WMP11 is to reinstall whole OS. Please send me the 11.0.6 version if you have.
<br />
(3) Tried different USB ports.<br />
None of these work.<br />
Please help me<br />
Thanks!

<p><span><span>Hello jangajarn,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Have you checked if the Creative Music Player shows up in the Windows Explorer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Most MP3 players will appear as a 'drive' on your computer, and you can browse the files on them simply by opening them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you can do this, you should be able to copy / delete / move files between the MP3 player and the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Your best bet would be check if the Music Player is showing up in the Windows Explorer. Try to format it from the Windows Explorer and then try to
 sync with the Media Player: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>NOTE: Formatting the Music Player can delete all the contents permanently, it is recommended that you backup the files before formatting the Music
 Player.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also try to install the below Hotfix that will that is released to fix when the Windows Media Player cannot synchronize media to an MTP-capable
 device on a Windows-Vista based computer : </span></span></p>

<p>Hi Irfan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your response. My device does show up in Windows explorer. I've tried formatting and it still does not recognize the player. And Windows said that the fix you provided 'does not apply to my system'. Is there ANY way to reinstall WMP11? I cant
 do anything with my player. Its very frustrating.</p>

            Sounds like your DLL got corrupted. You can try the SFC /SCANNOW command (<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/ht/sfc-scannow.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/ht/sfc-scannow.htm</a>) and see if that helps. It may ask
 for your install media, if you have it available.

<p>
Hi,&nbsp;<br />
after two last firmware updates (related to the pen issue) I have recognized that the screen on my Surface Pro 2017 is changing brightness when I am switching between dark and light backgrounds. For example, if I open Command Prompt black window full screen
 and wait 20 sec and then switch to File Explorer white window full screen, Surface Pro screen is changing brightness. First few seconds white background looks like grey. This effect I can see at any time when I am switching between applications windows that
 have black and white backgrounds and my Surface running by using battery. It is annoying.&nbsp;<br />
'Change brightness automatically' and 'adaptive brightness' settings are disabled.<br />
Do somebody have the same?</p>

<p>I've noticed this from the beginning (roughly a year ago). I read a while ago that it seems to be something related to Intel's settings, but I never got to trying to disable it. I find it mildly annoying, but not too much.</p>

            Yes I had the same problem and It was very annoying but just 1 month ago I found a solution thanks to the surface's customer service. You have to download the surface_tweak-tool, that is a mini-program that find the issue and solve it, then you reboot
 the device and the issue there's no more :D

Thanks for your info.&nbsp;It is a joke that MICROSOFT is not competent enough to offer this publicly, and above all, here in the forum for download. That was a lesson to me anyway. No more MICROSOFT.

<h2>            Can&#39;t install .NET Framework 4 that Garmin GSP needs to install</h2>
                    I have Garmin Sat Nav with lifetime updates, but since last autumn the update facility has been telling me that it can't update because my .NET Framework has to be some version of 4.
<div>I looked at what versions of .NET Framework I had and found I only had No.2 .</div>
<div>I then downloaded version 3.1 and installed it ( to see if it was easy ).</div>
<div>During the installation I had the usual progress boxes with a horizontal column expanding to the right as the installation proceeded.</div>
<div>Next I downloaded v4-no problem so far, then I pressed instal, big click from inside the PC tower, hard drive accelerating?, then nothing, no progress boxes nothing.</div>
<div>I downloaded a different version of 4, same result.</div>
<div>Where am I going wrong please? </div>
<div>All the Best</div>
<div>Neil</div>
<div>ps my OS is Windows XP sp3</div>

<h2>            Spellchecker built-in Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the newest skype (version 8.37.0.98) and I am on Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is in my native language, but I set skype to English, and each time I reset my PC skype forgets the set language for spellchecking and turns back to my native one. It is very frustrating. Is there any fix for that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me ASAP.</p>

            Hi Pyroro,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Did you mean Reset your Windows?  Why would you reset again and again? Default in Skype is device language only and if you reset your computer, you will have to install Skype again.

            Hi Pyroro,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />Skype spellchecks based on your system's settings. Let's double check that all the correct settings are in place:-
<br />
<br />Display Language
<br />1. Right Click your Windows Start Button and Select 'Settings'
<br />2. Select 'Time &amp; Language'
<br />3. Make Sure that your Windows Display Language is 'English'
<br />4. At the bottom of the 'Time &amp; Language' Windows make sure that 
<br />
<br />System Locale
<br />1. Right Click your Windows Start Button and Select 'Settings'
<br />2. Select 'Time &amp; Language'
<br />3. To the right Select 'Administrative Language Settings'
<br />2. Make sure that current language for non-unicode programs is 'English'
<br />
<br />Multilingual Text Suggestions
<br />1. Right Click your Windows Start Button and Select 'Settings'
<br />2. Select 'Devices'
<br />3. Select 'Typing' in the sidebar
<br />4. Scroll down and uncheck 'Multilingual Text Suggestions' if it is checked
<br />
<br />Then restart your computer and let me know if the problem persists.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype HAS build-in different spellchecking languages. It worked fine with being set as English (UK) for a long time until an update came.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not changing my windows 7 language so skype can work from it, because there is an option to change the language from the program, otherwise what is the use of giving me as a user a choice of my preferred language?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b45b430-baf8-4b24-8678-543d4248e1e9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b45b430-baf8-4b24-8678-543d4248e1e9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can clearly see that English (UK) is the chosen language. And yet even though it is CHECKED, it still spellchecks in my native language.</p>

            The option change the language from the program is to set the language of the Application. This has no effect on the spell-checking effects of Skype, which are coming from your Windows Settings.

<p>Well that is quite funny then, because after switching it around, without resetting skype, it accepts English as the spellchecing language.</p>

<p>This should work. Just in order to exclude the possibility that some files or settings are corrupt, reset all local Skype settings.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately it did not - it restarted to my windows language setting and upon switching to English (UK) it again remembered to spellcheck in that language only until I restarted skype. The program is still in English, but the spellcheck is not.</p>

</p><p>You would want to contact customer support by clicking on the following link <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Customer support</a>. If the controller is less than a year old they <strong>may</strong> be able to help you out as a one time exception.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no direct number to call support anymore there should be an option to request a call back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But like previously stated the only Xbox items that have longer then a 90 day warranty (within the US) is the Console itself and when it was still around the Kinect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unless you purchased the MS extended warranty at the time of purchase. If purchased from a retailer they would not offer MSs extended warranty.</p>

            I find it absolutely ridiculous that microsoft gives a 90 day warranty on a product I paid $170 for. I've been a loyal xbox player since the day the original xbox came out but this experience has me packing up all my games and hardware and buying a PS4.

<p>Hi there, Randman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for keeping us updated with your reply. Insofar as the warranty period for Elite Controllers, it&nbsp;<em>is</em> a 1 year warranty. The 90 day warranty period is for standard controllers. If you're still experiencing difficulties with your Elite Controller,
 and its still less than a full year, go ahead and request a call back from Xbox Support for assistance if you're having problems setting up your device for service on your own.</p>

<h2>            Why is the britness on my computer not working, and why is my internet constantly becoming &#34;limited&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS&nbsp;laptop with Windows 8.1 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I have been unable to change the brightness on my computer.&nbsp; Unable to use the FN keys, change it in the charms, or change it in PC settings, my computer has been the same brightness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when using my Wi-Fi, my internet will go in and out of being "limited."&nbsp; Usually I can temporarily fix this by turning the Wi-Fi off then back on again.&nbsp; But this only fixes it temporarily.&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens even when other devices in my house are having
 no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Posting the above, I restarted my computer and the brightness worked.&nbsp; If anyone knows what happened that'd be great! I'd love to avoid that problem in the future.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate the efforts which you have out to try to resolve the issue. Please write to us with the following details.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the model number of Asus Laptop?</span></p>

<p><span>As you have mentioned that you do not face any issues with the brightness of your laptop now, but this issue is usually due to outdated or corrupt display
 drivers. Incase if you face this issue again in future you can go ahead and uninstall and reinstall the latest display driver from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.

<br />
They are when they first play, however&nbsp;if you have a fast connection they switch to HD as soon as they have buffered.&nbsp; I've tested this with a number of known&nbsp;HD Vevo Video's.&nbsp; Note that not all Vevo videos are HD though.</p>

    <title>Laptop loses all internet connections, have to restart to fix&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kolbadar109  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop loses all internet connections, have to restart to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Several times a day, my laptop loses all internet connections. It seems to be completely random, and varies as to how many times it can occur.
 This did not happen when I originally had the laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. All other devices are still connected to the internet when the laptop loses internet, and they are fine.</span></p>
<p><span>2. The internet runs fine when connected.</span></p>
<p><span>3. I have changed the router and used it on a wireless router elsewhere: same thing happens.</span></p>
<p><span>4. I've tried re-installing the most recent drivers, from the acer website.</span></p>
<p><span>5. I have changed the internet security from using mccafee to norton.</span></p>
<p><span>6. I've tried using an ethernet cable, and the same thing happens: the laptop suddenly loses the connection.</span></p>
<p><span>7. In order to regain the connection, restarting the router doesn't always work, but restarting the laptop always works.</span></p>
<p><span>8. I‚Äôve disabled the power management options in device manager to allow the computer to switch off the network adapters.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm using an acer aspire 5750g and windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any help much appreciated.</span></p>

            Thanks Sathish. I tried method 1, but it didn't change anything.
<div><br />
<div>So I tried method 2. Again, no progress.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After trying method 3, the internet didn't go down for the next two evenings (i work 9-5.30), but it just did the same thing again right now so I don't think its fixed!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any ideas as to what I should try now?</div>

<p><span><font color="#000000">Manually assign the default gateway and the IP address and check if it works fine. Before assigning
 the IP address and the Default gateway manually, make a note of the IP address on the computer. To do this open Command prompt and type

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">To assign the IP address and default gateway manually, follow the steps below:</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">a. In system tray, right click network icon. Choose Open Network and Sharing Center.<br />
b. Right click on Local Area Connection and click on Properties. </font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">c. Double click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and assign the IP address manually.<br />
Example: Old IP address is 192.168.0.1<br />
Change the IP address to 192.168.0.50<br />
d. Let the Subnet mask and default gateway be the same.<br />
Subnet mask = 255.255.255.0<br />
Default gateway, usually would be 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1<br />

            Hi Mahesh,
<div><br />
<div>When I try to set it manually, it asks for a DNS server (I can't click to obtain automatically) and I think because I leave this box empty i can't change the IP address correctly, so I'm wondering what I should set it as?</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

<p>I have found the solution!</p>
<p>For some reason when you check the "keep my device from sleeping to say hey cortana" option, in the power &amp; sleep settings, the sleep option is set for "sleeping when pc is plugged in" to "Never", so this option prevents the&nbsp;&nbsp;"keep my device from sleeping
 to say hey cortana" option from being unchecked. What you need to do is to go to&nbsp;power &amp; sleep settings and set a value for&nbsp;"sleeping when pc is plugged in" option, then when you return to the cortana setting you will find your problem solved.</p>

            That's correct, figured it out already but forgot to post back. Typical kind of Microsoft bug. They really need to concentrate on sorting the new interface out. Windows 7 was pretty good by the time it got discontinued. All those profits and free OS like
 Linux can blow Microsoft's Explorer out of the water. Crashy as well. Poor API.<br />
<br />
Crazy to think elements of explorer hark back to Windows 3.1, 26 years ago. How far we've (not) come.

<p>Hello Herbert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>are you following <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up#CallerID_2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the instructions I linked above for skype number</a>? If you want to set up Caller ID to use your Skype number, you should follow only those instructions at the end that specifically mention Skype number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are trying to enter your Skype number to that input for number, then it most likely won' t work. The Skype number is a landline number, and for Caller ID you need mobile number, so that it can receive verification SMS message. (But as mentioned above,
 there is different way to setup Skype number as Caller ID).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other issue, please describe it a bit more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michal</p>

            Hi Michelle, 
<br />
<br />Before uninstalling/reinstalling, let's try to open those jpgs with another app. 
<br />
<br />Right click on one of them, and select "open with" - Try to open with another app available on that list, paint is fine. See if they'll open. If not, it may be a problem with the jpgs instead of photos. 
<br />
<br />Let me know, and we'll figure this one out!

            Hi Michelle,
<br />
<br />When you say, you cannot open some of your files, does the Photos App open other file Okay?
<br />
<br />If so, there may be a problem with the jpg files . . .
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer, navigate to the Pictures library
<br />
<br />Can you preview those jpg's in the preview pane in File Explorer?

<p>I can open other JPG files. I have opened these files before on my last PC. What is so different about Windows 10 that they cannot be opened now. Or, how do they get corrupted between the last time and now?&nbsp;</p>

            Richard, let's see if it left a Startup item in one of the places where those freeloaders lodge.  Do Step 4 from this Checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />That many infections could certainly affect performance even if there are no System Files reporting damage.  If curbing the Startup freeloaders doesn't improve performance, try the other steps in the checklist to see if those help.  It leads up to if necessary doing a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This reinstalls WIndows while saving your files and apps in place; takes about an hour, resolves most problems.

<h2>            win 7 to win 10 update on VAIO vpcm12M1E</h2>
                    <p>I have a Sony VAIO VPCM12M1E (Atom CPU N470 32-bit 1.83GHz) with 2GB RAM. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft informed me that my Update to Win 10 reservation was confirmed, Download Complete and Upgrade Available. I have made 4 attempts to download, each time with VAIO freezing at 84% Configuration of settings and each time the reinstalling of the previous
 version of Windows (Windows 7 Starter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows Error code C1900101-4000D, the explanation for which or what to do does not come up in the help screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that now I cannot actually fully revert to Win 7 Starter, Updates&nbsp; as the error tells me to 'try again' with Win 10 and if I try to do anything else the VAIO freezes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I right in thinking Win 10 will not run on my VAIO?</p>

            <p>I don't think you fully understand my difficulty. I have tried everything suggested (except the .ino suggestion as the VAIO does not have a CD/DVD facility). Every time I approach the 'configuring settings' at 84%,&nbsp;the VAIO&nbsp;freezes. I force a shutdown, restart,
 and it&nbsp;immediately reinstalls my previous version of Windows. I have deleted all printers and disconnected the internet after downloading to no avail. The actual upgrade goes smoothly until it gets to the final stage and then 'Poof'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 'previous Win version' is Windows 7 Starter version - not a full version of W7 I imagine. Am I kidding myself in thinking that this VAIO will cope with a full W10 version if it was designed for a cut-down version of W7? I know that I doubled the RAM size
 from 1 to the max of 2Gb and have set the Virtual memory also to Maximum of 5Gb&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Factory Image partition is full</h2>
                    The Factory Image partition on myCompaq is full and causing the computer to run slowly. How can I remove files or clean up the disc as it is a recovery image drive and won't let me in. Or, can I increase the size of the partition without losing the data
 on it?

<p>You will have to contact Compaq about this problem.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Here is some general info re Recovery Partitions:</span></p>
<p><span>Your D: Drive normally is the Recovery Partition

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Contact your Computer Manufacturer on how to remove anything you have saved to the Recovery Drive, as it is their Recovery Partition, not Microsoft‚Äôs.<br />
<br />
It is not for you to save anything to; and it is not to compress and/or Index,, Disk Cleanup, use for Backup, Defrag or have System Restore turned on for it.<br />
<br />
<span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span><br />
<br />
Ask the Manufacturer if you can make them, and how to delete/fix what has been done there.</span></p>

<h2>            WP8060 Graphics Tablet</h2>
                    <p>I was having trouble with my tablet, the pen only covers 2/3 of the right portion of my screen.&nbsp; I wiped out my laptop and did a brand new install of Win 10.&nbsp; It then worked fine.&nbsp; But after the last update of Win 10, the previous problem has cropped up
 again.&nbsp; I don't have any special drivers for this tablet, it is quite old and I rely on Win10 to support it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to have to do another install of win10, it is a lot of work to put my laptop back together, software wise I mean.</p>

<p>It isn't just the last update.&nbsp; Win10 doesn't seem to support my tablet.&nbsp; I put the tablet on 2 other computers I have which run Win10 and the same thing happens.&nbsp; The top of my screen seems to be mapped to the middle of the graphics tablet.&nbsp; I know that
 if I were to install my original Win10, the problem goes away, but I don't want to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My tablet is a WP8060, originally manufactured by DigiPro I believe.&nbsp; I don't have any software to calibrate this tablet, apps or drivers.</p>

            You would need to find out from the vendor of the tablet to see if they are going to provide drivers\updates for the latest version of Windows.
<br />Windows will try and use the compatible drivers but they wont make drivers specifically for a vendor that is the vendor that does it.

    <title>Yet another laptop keyboard broken with Windows 10 installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fireball003  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yet another laptop keyboard broken with Windows 10 installation</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had Windows 7 installed in my Asus K45VD laptop, and it never had issues with my keyboard. Recently I upgraded to Windows 10, and keyboard of my laptop started behaving unreliably. Most of the times most of the keys (excluding Enter key) don't work right
 from the log in page. I tried to use logitech USB keyboard, but no luck. It's the same for the same keyboard. However, the mouse connected through the same USB receiver (unifying) works without any issue. So, I decided to go back to windows 7 with clean installation
 (full hard drive format). But the problem remains same right from the beginning, my keyboard remains as unreliable as it was with Windows 10. I installed all the Asus drivers as many times before, I upgraded BIOS of my laptop, but no change. I couldn't find
 any solution online. Some people suggested pressing fn+space keys or other random ideas which didn't work for me anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution to this problem? Has Windows 10 finally broke my laptop?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Andrew. Thanks for your letter. I have tryed this and i still am unable to solve this problem, I have 86 running processes, and don't know which ones i can stop or disable. I feel that there is a program that is running, all the time, and making my cpu run
 at 50% all the time and my threads just keep going up. i have checked with my old harddrive and don't get these problems, and also checked the setting, and change them to the same, but this didnot work. the thing that is using the cpu you the is svchost.exe
 (netsvcs) and uses 50 % of the cpu, i can stop this, but the threads still keep going up. which makes the computer slow. and every time i restart wondows i have the same problem.<br />
can you help some more please.</p>
<p>stephen</p>
