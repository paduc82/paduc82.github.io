I'm sorry to hear about any issues you may be having due to an enforcement action. For information about the ban and to see about submitting a case review, you would need to go to
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enforcement website</a>. That is the only way to contact the enforcement team. There you will see the length of the ban and all that. IF the ban is 1 day they wont let you submit a case
 review, due to takes 2 days for them to look at it usually.</div>

<p><strong>I upgraded my computer from vista 32-bit to windows 7 64-bit about 2 months ago. &nbsp;In that time I have been unable to get my mic to work in any of the mic jack slots. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I first thought it was the drivers for the onboard sound card so I tried to update them but it did not solve the problem. &nbsp;Then I went and got a rocketfish 5.1 PCI Sound Card, that also did not work. &nbsp;I tried "Device Manager"&nbsp;strategy&nbsp;stated on other
 forums but the set up mic stage still gives me the error "Wizard could not start" &nbsp;I also tried going into the BIOS and fooling around with the sound settings in there because I heard windows 7 may have turned off the sound settings during&nbsp;installation&nbsp;but
 I was not too sure what to look for so that did not solve the problem.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>What other trouble shooting&nbsp;technique&nbsp;should I try to make my mic work</span></strong></p>

<p>Ok, I have found the solution:</p>
<p>Posting this on as many sites as I can find because everyone is having this issue. I went without a mic for a good year year and a half now, and I was angry not being able to talk in vent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution:</p>
<p>Go to the dell.com site &gt; go to for home &gt; drivers and downloads &gt; service tag &gt; enter your service tag (on back of computer) &gt; go to either vista 32 bit or vista 64 depending on which windows 7 you are running (I'm using 64 bit). &gt; download and install
 the chip set driver &gt; install &gt; restart computer &gt; go back to the dell site &gt; install the audio driver (even if you have installed it before) &gt; restart &gt; BAM YOUR MIC SHOULD NOW WORK :) It's because you have to install the chip set driver saying that your
 mic is actually at the front of your computer (no port in the back) :) &nbsp;Man am I happy!</p>

    <title>DLNA Only supports PlayTo&#63;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> videowrestling  say:</h3>
<h2>            DLNA Only supports PlayTo&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Ridiculous. Why would they remove the ability of the XBOX to act as a pull device and let me browse my files located on another networked device? I can't fathom why they would have removed this. My PC is not in the living room...I don't know too many people
 who keep the computer that hosts their video files or music files next to their TV. This is a massive step backwards in functionality...please come up with an app that will act as a media browser and let me pull via DLNA, like the XBOX 360's video player will.</p>
<p>This decision was a giant head-scratcher, to me. At least they didn't eliminate it completely, the way Sony did...but come on. Microsoft has gone to great lengths to make media consumption in every other way easier, yet they've actually managed to make DLNA
 LESS convenient than it was, before.</p>

<p>Whether it's a player that allows me to browse a shared drive that contains my video files and directly play them, or DLNA which accepts metadata and shows poster art and whatnot...I don't care what it is, but it needs to be something I can initiate from
 the couch, from within the XBOX One itself. I shouldn't have to walk to another room to start playing media on this thing, when the previous generation did it easily.</p>
<p>From all of the early reviews I'm reading, it doesn't support acting as a pull device on your local network, at all. Only acts as a receiver.</p>

<p>The Xbox One will let you stream content to the console using DLNA, although on day one there's no native support to initiate those streams, so the console acts as a receiver only.</p>
<p>That means Xbox One won't go out and find content on your network, so it can't retrieve those files on your DLNA-compatible media server, for example, that all your other connected devices enjoy.</p>
<p>This is something that could easily be overcome with an Xbox One app in the future, but so you're not kept waiting, here's how you can get streaming to your console right away:</p>
<p>You can easily send content to your console from another DLNA device directly and Xbox One will recognise the incoming stream and open the app required to play it. If you're streaming music, you'll need to have Xbox Music installed as this will act as the
 receiving music player. If you're sending video or photos, you'll have to have installed Xbox Video. Both apps are free in the Xbox One's store.</p>
<p>Many Android phones have a native app to do this from media applications, but sometimes they are only good for sending local content from the phone to the Xbox One. We tried it out with the HTC One and found it worked well enough.</p>
<p>However, the Skifta app will solve all your problems, as this free app can be the intermediary between your DLNA media server and your Xbox One.</p>
<p>All you have to do is install the app, search for the source and select the playback device: Xbox One will be listed, ready to receive your content. Then you identify the file and across it goes. We've streamed a range of content from our network to the
 Xbox One without a hitch: it's great for impromptu photo slideshows, great for video and great for music. Bear in mind that your smartphone will need to be able to play the files - ie, have the codecs for the video format.</p>
<p>Skifta is also available for iOS and we've tested Skifta on the iPhone 5S with the Xbox One and it works in exactly the same way as the Android version. Both apps are available for free, right now.</p>
<p>Happy streaming!</p>

<p>This doesn't address or answer the issue at all, White Westie - the point is not that it will act as a receiver. The point is that it will not initiate or "pull" from a server, at all...and that's totally unacceptable. I can't upgrade my 360 to a One until
 they support this functionality, we use it way too much to have it absent and I'm not going to go upstairs to start playback on the computer, whenever we want to watch something.</p>
<p>For a company that is usually pretty forward-thinking and seemed to have the "all in one" scenario in mind with the XBOX One, this oversight is mind-boggling to me.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 32 bit driver upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zepyrofilms  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 32 bit driver upgrade</h2>
                    So recently I bought a game off of Steam and it won't run because I'm running on 32 bit instead of 64 bit. I looked around and the only answers I got as far as going from 32 to 64 bit all mentioned a USB drive or a disc to upgrade. The thing is; I don't
 have either of those, so I'm a bit lost. And yes, my computer is compatible with 64 bit, so I can upgrade once I figure out how.

<p>Are you only planning to upgrade drivers from 32 bit to 64 bit or planning to upgrade OS from 32 bit to 64 bit ?</p>
<p>If you are planning to upgrade OS from 32 bit to 64 bit, Unfortunately, it's not possible to upgrade. If you are running a 32-bit of Windows version, you can only upgrade to another 32-bit version of Windows. You'd have to do a clean install, there is no
 such mechanism to upgrade/change architecture from 32 to 64 either from Disk or USB. You'd also have to reinstall your programs since they're all configured to run on a 32-bit system.</p>

<p>If the DVR software is prompting you to input a passcode, this can only be done with the DVR remote, as the DVR is the actual device asking you for a parental passcode (not the Xbox).</p>
<p>The Xbox One only simply shows what's being sent to the HDMI-input -- the Xbox has no actual control over the connected HDMI device.
</p>
<p>There is no way to use the DVR user interface with the Xbox One controller, if that's what you're asking. Just stick with the DVR remote!</p>

<p /><p>Hi Mister Mascot,
</p>
<p>I attempted that with Xbox Live support, last night.&nbsp;Unfortunately, it did not work.&nbsp;Other things I have attempted on my own or with Xbox One support:</p>
<p>- Reset Xbox One (minus games and apps)/<br />
- Clear MAC&nbsp;address.<br />
- Remove and readd my Xbox Live profile.<br />
- Hard reset the Xbox One.<br />
- Clear the Xbox 360 storage cache on the Xbox One.<br />
- Reset my router.<br />
- Put my Xbox One IP in the DMZ.<br />
- Temporarily disable two-factor authentication.<br />
- Attempted to login from the Xbox 360 menu.<br />
- Attempt to connect via both&nbsp;wireless&nbsp;and wired connection.</p>
<p>There might be a few other things I am forgetting.</p>

<p>Good luck with that! &nbsp;I canceled my Skype account, AND got a cancellation notice from them, and they STILL tried billing my bank account. &nbsp;The ONLY way I know of to stop them is TELL YOUR BANK TO QUIT PAYING THEM, and TAKE THEM OFF "AUTO-PAY!!!"<br />

 under "System".&nbsp; I have three questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How can I determine how much data is just Windows Updates in particular?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) How many different things are counted under "System"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) How can I get this data historically?&nbsp; Is it logged somewhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

<p>Thanks, I see how I may not have been clear.&nbsp; In this case the issue isn't how much space is used on the drive, the issue is how much data is used in the past 30 days according to the Data Usage check under Settings. &nbsp;</p>

<p>75GB came from a similar post I found about a user trying to find out what gets counted as "System" under data usage.&nbsp; I wonder... if Windows Update, Windows 10 file backup, and Windows 7 Backup &amp; Restore all get counted here, that over 600GB used within
 the last 30 days would start to make sense.&nbsp; It would also mean, similar to the point you are making, that local traffic and internet traffic gets counted here.&nbsp; It would be very useful for Microsoft to break down this information further. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had same issue with Surface Pro 3...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some advice that worked a treat!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download "Compass+" by Asparion, there is an option to calibrate. &nbsp;It is the figure of eight method that people are mentioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a big strange to get right but if you do I slowly and copy the image examples exactly, its quite simply (don't just wave it in a figure of eight, notice how it faces inward on one side but outward on the other...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I completed this I immediately opened my Sky Chart app and finally East was East!!!!, just need the clouds to go now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone.</p>

<h2>            Window slamming</h2>
                    Both of my computers recently automatically updated to the new Windows 10.&nbsp; They BOTH now have the same problem.&nbsp; Every time I drag the arrow cursor across the screen it "slams" into a multi-window mode.&nbsp; This is VERY ANNOYING and wasteful.&nbsp; I can find
 no way to fix the problem in the settings.&nbsp; I spend 10% of my time being "slammed" into and clicking out of a mode that I don't want to be in.

            Hey wyorom,
<br />
<br />That feature is called Snap, and it can be disabled. Hit Windows key + I together, head into System, then on the left pane, navigate to "Multitasking". Under Snap in the Multitasking menu, then toggle off "Arrange windows automatically by dragging them to the sides or the corners of the screen".
<br />
<br />I hope this was helpful.

            No,&nbsp; This did not fix the problem.&nbsp; In fact it is now worse.&nbsp; I double checked to see that I followed your instructions.

            wyorom,
<br />
<br />If you want a Windows 7 styled snap, and it seems that since you do not want the multi-window function, here's a solution:
<br />
<br />Re-enable "Arrange windows automatically by dragging them to the sides or corners of the screen". Make sure every option is toggled on, and keep "When I snap a window, show what I can snap next to it" disabled.
<br />
<br />Hopefully that does it.

            No problem, let's try this instead:
<br />
<br />Click any of these links below and tell me which one best represents the issue:
<br />
<br />1.) Task View (I think this is the one): <a href="https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/07/windows10taskview-100598445-large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015...</a>

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

<h2>            Symbolic links and ransomeware</h2>
                    Just had a question. I work for a company running mostly windows 7 environment with dc etc. We currently use alot of drive mapping, but my boss wants me to look into shortcuts to states instead of mapping drives. Ive created and tested a batch files and
 notice symbolic links point locally instead of to the file server. If we get hit with ransomware would that just encrypt the symbolic link or would it also encrypt the actual file on the share folder?

            It depends on how the virus is coded. It the hacker knows his evil trade then it will encrypt the file. Since you are likely to have a solid backup scheme, encryption would be the least of your problems in case of an attack.

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you sign into Outlook 2010 and the Skype for Business 2016 client with the same Office 365 account, you can see the presence of the user such as

<p>
</p><p><span>No, the article isn’t applied to the Skype for Business 2016 client.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regarding “Also I got to know that support for outlook 2010 has expired ad MS won't support it if any related issues”, yes, you are right.
<del>Official support for Outlook 2010 has expired. We don’t support any Outlook 2010 client related issues.</del></span> Office 2010 (Outlook 2010) has left the mainstream support in October 13, 2015.<span> Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Given the situation, I suggest you use the updated version of Outlook client such as Outlook 2013, Outlook 2016 (Outlook 2016 is preferred) instead of the Outlook 2010 client.</span></p>
