    <title>Bluetooth Audio Bus Device preventing me from upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth Audio Bus Device preventing me from upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1, PLEASE HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's the situation. I reserved my free copy of Windows 10 about a month or two ago (I'm upgrading from Windows 8.1), and when it was finally released, I still was not getting any notifications about when it would let me download it. So I checked and
 found out that the only thing holding me back from upgrading to Windows 10 is the Bluetooth Audio Bus Device, made by Ralink Corporation. (In the picture I circled the message in red)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After seeing this, I simply thought to myself <em>Well that's easy, i'll just uninstall this Audio Bus Device and it'll let me upgrade!</em>. But i looked everywhere and simply could not find where this Audio Bus Device was located on my pc. I also tried
 upgrading the same driver to a newer version, but even after i did that, it still was not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, I have no idea what to do! </p>

            I am also having this issue. It has been two weeks since I started the upgrade &nbsp;on this computer. I have searched both Microsoft and Hp's support sites and where there are several posts about this problem, both Hp and Microsoft have not responded. I am
 at the point where I feel that there will not be a windows 10 upgrade on this computer which makes me question where I will ever buy another HP product. Good luck everyone hope they find a fix.

            What about the Media Creation Tool? The upgrade should work from within the tool. You can then wait&nbsp;for an updated driver from&nbsp;the manufacturer or from the Windows Update&nbsp;in Windows 10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            As far as I know, Microsoft will not solve your problem. It's Ralink's issue. And similar issues existed with Ralink cards for Windows 8 to 8.1. I don't think they'll ever fix it. Plus, it is not&nbsp;certain that Bluetooth won't work as the audio bus device
 is not the main Bluetooth that your machine is using to connect. In addition, for the first 29 days of Windows 10 installation&nbsp;you can downgrade from Windows 10 to your previous operating system without reformatting and losing anything by using the roll back
 feature.

            Does it just have to do with if you use bluetooth devices or does it have to do with wireless internet connectivity? Did you upgrade to Windows 10 and, if so, how is it working?

            After waiting to see if this would be resolved by either Microsoft or RaLink, I just decided to take the plunge and see what would happen. The upgrade went well, everything works (wireless &amp; cable LAN, Video (both cards) etc etc etc) except I cannot connect
 to anything with Bluetooth. Go figure!!!!!! Since I can still connect with a USB cable anything I would normally connect using Bluetooth this isn't an issue for me. For what it is worth, you just need to make a decision if Bluetooth connectivity to your PC
 is vital to you or not. If it isn't go ahead an upgrade. BTW I did a upgrade from Windows 8.1 and not a clean install,&nbsp;I couldn't be happier, Windows 10 is a huge improvement in terms of stability on my machine (HP DV7 Laptop).

            Did you try uninstalling the driver and installing it in compatibility mode with Windows 8.1? After all, if there is any driver update it will be implemented automatically by Windows 10 when it is installed, so if the Bluetooth is not working from the
 beginning, it may work later!

            I also had the same message holding me back from the upgrade for my HP pavilion G7-2240us notebook with Win 8.2. Yesterday, I also decided to go ahead and upgrade with existing apps and data&nbsp;to Win 10. My experience for 12 hours has been no problems at
 all. It immediately picked up my Bluetooth speaker and works just fine. Kind of puzzling as I was prepared for some bugs in the process, but&nbsp;am pleasantly surprised.&nbsp;A month ago&nbsp;I upgraded an older G7 notebook with windows 7 and that process did have some
 bugs with system&nbsp;freezes for a few days, but it is running very stable now.

<p>Hi Jolene,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Office 365, the Skype for business conversation history is stored in its Office 365 mailbox. So, I'd like to confirm if you are using Skype for business online service and have its Office 365 mailbox as well. If so, you can recover conversation history
 via Outlook client (you can recover it from Deleted Item folder). If not, it is not feasible to recover deleted conversation from Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>
<p>Edward</p>

            Hi Garrylawton<br />
<br />
When Messenger is opened, click "Tools" from menu bar, click <br />
<br />
"Options", Select "General" or Sign in tab for Windows live messenger, then remove the check mark from
<br />
"Automatically run messenger service when I log on to Windows".<br />
Click "Apply" then "OK". When you restart next time Messenger will not open untill you double click to open it.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps

&nbsp;the web page will try interact with Windows live messenger, so it will start automatically<br />
<br />
Go to When Messenger is opened, click "Tools" from menu bar, click "Options" click<em> Security
</em><br />
Uncheck the last one <em><strong>OPEN WINDOWS LIVE MESSENGER WHEN I CLICK A LINK ON A WEB PAGE AND TRIES TO INTERACT WITH WINDOWS LIVE MESSENGER.<br />

            Hi Garry<br />
<br />
I have only one way to disable it, if you are using IE with windows live tool bar,<br />
Open IE, close windows live tool bar which is located left hand side, after pressing X for closing tool bar, it will pop up the Add on window select all or check mark all settings, click disable,<br />
<br />
try the issue in other Web browser by making windows live home page default. <br />
<br />
try it.<br />
Create new Admin Account and check the issue.<br />
<br />
Does it work?

<p>Depends. &nbsp;If you're the host and you intend on chugging a bunch of estus with a ton of poise and you're only standing there because you can't get backstabbed, then I would say it's not. &nbsp;If the other person is backstab fishing and you just don't want to

<p>I really don't get all the hate for backstabs. Yes I have been lag-stabbed (and with servers in DKS2 it should be better)</p>
<p>But really it is a game mechanic. Don't get me wrong, Backstab fishing is pretty lame but oppertunity based backstabs are compleatly fair (as punishment for giving your back to your opponent)</p>
<p>If the fight moves naturaly to the bridge fine, but intentionaly going there to exploite a glich and negate a INTENDED game mechaninc is cheap. I wouldn't say it isn't "fair" because in return they can't be backstabed but it is cheap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just hope that they don't nerf the backstabs too hard because the "rouge"/"theif" class where you are basicaly a melee type glass cannon is very fun to play. Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge CRITICAL FREAKING HIT FTW!!</p>
<p>I dunno I think its fun. Without proper backstabs and riposte in DKS2 EVERYONE is going to play as a tank or caster. There would no&nbsp;be</p>
<p>point to being a rouge/theif. And with out that third type you lose part of the "rock paper sissors" aspect of PVP where people have to be able to adapt and overcome.</p>
<p>Instead it will be poise up Zweihander R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 R1 (see where this is going?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I also think the fall-down animation is lame and compleatly misses the true concept of riposte. Go watch some fencing video's to see what a "true" riposte is)</p>

<p>Well, I feel in Dark Souls the window for backstabbing is far too great and thats the main problem, dead angling and such. It's far to easy to play as a 'rouge' than it is to play as a tank. While tanking requires the right spells and multiple different
 sets of equipment for the types of damage you will receive, playing a backstab build is laughably easy because of the hit window for backstabs.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Parrying was never &nbsp;a problem, it's pretty hard to do with sever lag unless you play a lot.</p>

<p>I understand your point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I think the problems with tank classes is that the weapons scaleing is garbage for 99% of the weapons in the game. And the only weapons with good scaleing are easy to parry and/or leave you wide open if you miss a hit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm ok with "shrinking" the widow for BS's but I don't want the actual damaged nerfed. I also don't like being wide open while preforming a parry or BS. The invincibility frames for parry and BS's are the only good way to deal with gankers.</p>

<p>Thats true. I hope they dealt with ganking in some way in Dark Souls 2. I think it would be a good idea to have an area in the game where you can be invaded, but not be able to summon.<br />
<br />
I still think there is something a little wrong when 50% of pvp fights wind up like

<p>I don't hate backstabs. &nbsp;I just dislike when the other person simply fishes for backstabs, because it is boring. &nbsp;I used to hate it because they would usually get the backstab on me, until I learned how to counter. &nbsp;Now, whenever I see people fishing, I
 generally counter them and backstab them instead. &nbsp;(Unfortunately, it probably only reinforces in their mind that they should fish more.)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Without backstabbing, the game would be boring as all hell. &nbsp;People would go all poise and tank it up. &nbsp;You could stand there and drink estus while the other person attacked and not have to worry about it. &nbsp;Then, when you fully heal and the other person
 is out of stamina, you could then just attack them. &nbsp;It would be rather dumb and every fight would be a race to break the other's poise.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>There are, however, situations where backstabbing makes no sense. &nbsp;Honestly (and I use this move against gankers) pivot backstabs are complete trash. &nbsp;There's no way someone is going to run straight at me and then run past me only to flip around and stab
 me in the back in real life. &nbsp;That's an effect of the window being too forgiving. &nbsp;I wouldn't mind them tightening up backstabs, but removing it would be a mistake.</p>

            Hi Partik, it is not easy to remove a file association in Windows 10,
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the view Ribbon (tab) check the box marked 'File Name Extensions'
<br />
<br />Close File Explorer
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop and choose New - Text File
<br />
<br />Change the file extension on that new file from .txt to .exe
<br />
<br />Confirm the change
<br />
<br />Right click a .bsp  file, choose open with - Choose another App 
<br />
<br />Check the box marked 'Always use this app to open .bsp  files' - IMPORTANT! 
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom and click 'More Apps' 
<br />
<br />Again scroll to the bottom and choose 'Find another app on this PC' 
<br />
<br />Navigate to the dummy file exe on your Desktop and click OK
<br />
<br />The .bsp  file will not open 
<br />
<br />Delete the dummy exe file on your Desktop and restart your PC 
<br />
<br />The file association will then be broken!

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for bringing up your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing in Windows 10.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Not to worry, weâ€™re here to help you out.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Which application are you using to back up?</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Few reasons as to why&nbsp;you were receiving the error message
<strong>the</strong> <strong>drive is not a valid backup location</strong> are as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Advanced share allow permissions are set to full control for the USB drive you are referring to.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>The size of the System Image could be bigger than the size of the USB drive.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>File History did not list it in available drives as because the drive was not shared.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Drive letter changed unexpectedly.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Let us try the following steps, and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Step 1</strong>:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Hardware and devices troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with hardware and devices. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is
 with your mouse. </span></p>
<p><span>Refer these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows key +X</strong>, select <strong>Control panel.</strong></span></li><li><span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
troubleshooting</strong> and click on the <strong>view all</strong> option on the left panel.</span></li><li><span>Run the <strong>
Hardware and devices troubleshooter.</strong></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to refer the link to set up a driver for file history and check if the issue persists.<br />
<strong>Set up a drive for File History<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/set-drive-file-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/set-drive-file-history</span></a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
If you receive any errors or if anything goes wrong in file history,&nbsp;please refer&nbsp;<strong>What if something goes wrong in File History?<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-something-goes-wrong-file-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-something-goes-wrong-file-history</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also, try connecting USB flash drive to a different USB port and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us know the status, we are glad to assist you further.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Game Controls &#38;amp&#59; Instructions</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am new to xbox.&nbsp; I recently purchased an xbox 360 and a few games.&nbsp; One of the games is NCAA Football 12, but the insert does not include instructions on the game controls.&nbsp; Is there a place where I can view or download the game controls and instructions?&nbsp;
 I know you can look up some of that in the game, but it would be great if there was a way to print them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

If you do have they been reset in a&nbsp;modded&nbsp;lobby?. There is nothing you can do to fix that, I would suggest you contact they game Dev's but I wouldn't want you to waste your time because they do not fix them.<br />

<h2>            Wifi problems after reintalling Windows XP</h2>
                    I've been experiencing some problems with my wifi connection after reinstalling Windows XP Home on my laptop (Fujitsu Siemens Amilo Pro V3515). Both the wifi adaptor and driver are in place and functional, but the problem starts when I want to connect
 to my home network. The laptop is able to connect to any new network listed in "Networks Available " but not to my home network or that of the local pub, both of which I'd been accessing without problem prior to reinstallation. It almost seems as if the laptop
 'remembers' having accessed these networks in the past and now refuses to do so again. When I try to connect to my home and local pub networks, a message pops up saying something like "Connection failed. Access to this network may no longer be available" (a
 loose translation from Czech). Any idea what the cause of the problem may be and how to fix it?

<p>If connecting to other wifi networks is working properly, then do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start &gt; Run &gt; ncpa.cpl &gt; OK </li><li>Right-click on the icon for your wifi adapter </li><li>Select Properties </li><li>Click the "Wireless Networks" tab </li><li>In the list under "Preferred networks" find the entries for your home network and the local pub network and "Remove" them.&nbsp; You can also Remove any other networks listed here that you don't need.</li><li>OK your way out </li></ol>
Go back to the list of available networks.&nbsp; Now when you click "Connect" on your home network you'll be given an opportunity to re-enter your password (encryption key set in your router).&nbsp; The same should be true for the pub's network (if there is a password
 for that one).<br />

<h2>            Netflix app dims screen when using 4K&#47;HDR</h2>
                    <p>Netflix dims the entire screen on my Xbox One. If I press the guide button, everything is dim but it will return to normal if I quit Netflix or open another app or game. If there anything I can do to fix this?</p>



<p>Example: Xbox One S - Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, so dark you can barely see things. (I do know the color is crushed and color corrected a bit on the blue side due to the way it is filmed)

  </p>



<p>Retried with a 360 even worse!!!! (I do know that itâ€™s not 4k)

  </p>



<p>Retried with a Wii U and perfect. (I do know that itâ€™s not 4k)

  </p>

<p>TV: Samsung UN65JU6700FXZA

<p>Xbox One S: HDMI to TV

  </p>

<p>Audio: optical to receiver.</p>

 at a few of the points but always come up with error&nbsp;0x80070017. Sould i reinstall windows or take my computer in for a fix, could it be a virus. I only just installed windows 10 a month ago, and my computer was wiped before the installation. Is there any
 way this problem can be fixed. I cant get into my PC it starts up until just before I can log in.

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Final option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.

            Hi LadyBubble, please try this:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

            You will need to download Windows media ISO for this purpose. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10.
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

    <title>USB Server Drivers for Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelece  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Server Drivers for Windows 7</h2>
                    Can anyone help please. I have had a USB Server working fantastically&nbsp;with Windows XP Pro (32 Bit) for many years now but since I have upgraded to Windows 7 (64 bit) the device no longer works. I can see the Server and log on to it OK and I can see the
 connected USB devices in Windows but cannot connect through to them. In XP it came with 32 bit drivers that you ran first. These do not work in Windows 7. Thanks in anticipation and I know perhaps you'll be thinking I should have stayed on XP but I wanted
 to upgrade to take advantage of the 64 bit achitecture and my computers ability to use it. I could have gone to 64 bit XP but was looking ahead as XP is getting old now.

<p><span>1. Right-click on the installation file and select properties.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Now click on the compatibility tab.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under compatibility mode, check â€œRun this program in compatibility mode forâ€.</span></p>
<p><span>4. From the drop down menu, select Windows XP(service pack 2).</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click Apply and then click OK.</span></p>

    <title>Remote Desktop Connection Timezone Redirection Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steven sterling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection Timezone Redirection Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Just switched to Windows Server 2016 Standard implementing RDS. We want remote users to be able to use Timezone redirection and enabled it in Group Policy. It does not work with the Remote Desktop Connection. We tried the&nbsp;Microsoft Remote Desktop APP and
 it works in the App, EXCEPT we just found that the APP does not seem to support multiple monitors.</p>
<p>So more Microsoft frustration. We have to decide which is more important, timezone or multiple monitors.</p>
<p>Has anyone been able to get Timezone Redirection to work with the&nbsp;Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection (NOT APP)?</p>

<p>Solution 1: Use the gamertag used to purchase the content</p>
<p>Sign in on your console by using the gamertag that you used to purchase the content.</p>
<p>Try to play or use the content.</p>
<p>Note If you recently transferred content to a new console, you can play the content on your new console if you sign in using the gamertag that originally purchased the content. If you want to use the transferred content without signing in to Xbox Live or
 with a different gamertag, youâ€™ll need to transfer the content licences to your new console. For information on how to do this, see Xbox 360 Digital Rights Management.</p>
<p>Solution 2: Delete and download the content again</p>
<p>If your console was repaired or you used the licence transfer tool to transfer licences from one console to another, the locally stored licences might be out of date. You must download the content again to update the locally stored licences. Here's how:</p>
<p>On your console, sign in to Xbox Live using the gamertag that you used when you originally purchased the content.</p>
<p>Go to Settings and then select System.</p>
<p>Select Storage and then select the location of the item (for example, Hard Drive).</p>
<p>Select Games &amp; Apps and then locate the game and select it.</p>
<p>Select the item that youâ€™re having a problem with, and then select Delete.</p>
<p>Return to Xbox Home.</p>
<p>Go to Settings and select Account.</p>
<p>Select Download History.</p>
<p>Note To access music or video content from Download History, select Xbox Music and Video Purchase History at the top.</p>
<p>Select the item that youâ€™re having problems with, and then select Download Again.</p>

<h2>            KB2919355 remaining files in Windows Update &#40;194.3 MB&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I just updated my windows 8.1 to the new update that was just released.</p>
<p>But I have a concern...</p>
<p>This morning, the updates are 6 (if I remember correctly) but I excluded to install the KB2919355 because of the file size.</p>
<p>Then this evening, I started downloading it but it the progress is not even moving, that's why I downloaded the standalone installer in the Microsoft site.</p>
<p>At first, I had trouble installing it but finally, had found a help in the internet. Then I successfully installed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I went to windows and recovery under PC settings and check for more updates. I saw a 2MB file that says its recommended so I successfully installed it.</p>
<p><strong>Then after restarting, I went to PC settings and noticed that KB2919355 is still there but instead of the original 887 MB (if I'm not mistaken), now its just 194.3 MB.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is that remaining file?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Have I done wrong in the update process?</p>
<p>I already have the features like running apps in the task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 8.1 KB KB2919355-x86.msu is 319.0 MB and Windows8.1-KB2919355-x64.msu is 690.8 MB. Means if you are using 32 bit Windows 8.1 the file size would be less if you are using 64 bit Windows then the update file size will be more. It might also include
 few perquisites updates necessary for Windows 8.1 update 1 which update size may increase.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Check if you are using 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 8.1.</span></p>

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv"multiple times
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1709 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:

            Hello,
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade...</a>
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

only&nbsp;Â£4.20 (5k) of Â£5.70 (7k) was successfully deposited back in August <br />
and as in the images below show i haven't used my account until today so<br />
i request either my last purchase be refunded and the the rest be <br />
credited back to my account or just add the missing funds ASAP.</strong></p>

    <title>Day one Xbox One controller broken, can I get a replacement&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Day one Xbox One controller broken, can I get a replacement&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>My left bumper no longer works, will I need to buy a new one? Or is there a way I can get a replacement?</p>

<p>I don't expect a new controller for free, but I figured I'd find out for sure before I go spend $79 I don't have to waste. If I need to send my controller out for a replacement, how long can I expect it to take? Because I've been excited for Horizon 2 for
 a while now, and I was hoping to play it.</p>
