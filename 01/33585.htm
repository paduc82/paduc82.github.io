<h2>            Can&#39;t bring up Windows 10 desktop on my new Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>I have spent today setting up my new Surface Pro 4 - earlier everything seemed to be working fine, but now I can no longer bring up the Windows 10 desktop by hitting the windows icon in the bottom left corner of the screen. This seems to have occurred after
 attaching the Type cover. The touch screen has also stopped working.</p>

<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It will be helpful if you can provide us a screenshot of the issue.</p>
<p>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 1:</strong></td>
<td>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 2:</strong></td>
<td>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.
<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
</td>

<p>I fixed this by issuing a hard reset. Hold the power button for about 5 seconds while the xbox is still on. This will turn off the xbox and clear the cache that was messed up. Just turn it back on and it should be good!</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Ultimate x64 Installation hangs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jure89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate x64 Installation hangs</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys, I have a problem with Windows 7 Ultimate x64 setup and it's quite frustrating. Before I explain what is happening let me give you my system specifications.</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core i7 870</p>
<p>Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-P55A-UD4</p>
<p>Ram: Excelram 2x2GB Red Culvert 1600 mhz</p>
<p>Disk: Seagate Barracuda 320GB SATA II 3Gb/s</p>
<p>Graphics: Sapphire Radeon HD 6870 1Gb GDDR5</p>
<p>DVD Drive: NEC Optiarc</p>
<p>Ok so I've put in the Windows 7 DVD, booted from it, deleted the partitions and created them anew and formatted the non-system one where Windows is to be installed. Windows then extracts the files normally and reboots the system. Here's where the things
 get tricky. The system hangs after the screen "Setup is updating registry settings" and doesn't move anywhere. I even left it on during the night and it didn't budge. In some instances (I've tried installing more than 10 times) I actually get pass this screen
 but then get stuck at "Completing installation". And I even got pass that screen in one attempt when I ejected the CD, but when the system rebooted, it hung at "Starting Windows" screen.</p>
<p>Now I have read a lot about this problem on the forums and here's what I've tried so far, to no avail of course:</p>
<p>Removing one stick of ram</p>
<p>Removing all external devices, everything not needed and setting the floppy drive to NONE in BIOS</p>
<p>Removing everything from USB slots and disabling them in BIOS</p>
<p>Entering Safemode and opening Device manager through the command prompt and disabling/uninstalling VGA drivers</p>
<p>Switching SATA connectors on the motherboard</p>
<p>Thats about everything I tried with no success. Does anybody have any idea what could be causing this and what the solution might be? It's a new computer, was built yesterday and it's really frustrating not getting it to work.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Jure</p>

<p>Set of test utilities for DIY computer builders:</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are OverClocking or use any automatic overclocking BIOS features, Intel EIST or Turbo Mode (Disable it),&nbsp;<br />
then drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p>Disconnect any other internal hard drives and external USB devices.</p>
<p><strong>First try running Memtest86+,</strong> this runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or<br />
confirm if your one or more of your memory sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

If you have a copy of Windows XP around try installing it temporary (if not Windows 7 will work as well)<br />
"No need to activate as you get a 30 day grace period which is perfect for testing"<br />
and then use the following tools (this assumes the memtest shows no failures)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>After Windows is installed:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Device Drivers:</strong> Did you install the motherboard manufacture's latest device drivers? Check their support site for the latest drivers as the CD that came with the motherboard may have older less stable drivers.</p>
<p><strong>Check the Graphics card manufacture's download site</strong> for the most recent Windows 7 drivers for your card.<br />

<p>Are you using any wireless input devices such as Keyboard and mouse? You could try using wired ones, do a cold boot, see if it picks up where it left off and complete the installation.</p>
<p>As for Network adapters, you should also try removing any such as Wireless or Ethernet adapter.</p>
<p>Is this a Digital download of Windows 7 or a store bought DVD? If its a digital download, try reburning again at the lowest speed possible using good quality DVD media.</p>
<p>You could also try using a USB thumb drive and copy your Windows 7 installation files to it.</p>
<p>I’d suggest you to access the Microsoft link given below for detailed info about the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool, frequently asked questions, and troubleshooting steps to be carried out:<br />

 disable it and let you know how it goes. Thank you!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi TheTuxEffect,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Windows Vista Answers Forums!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Are you able to save in other locations?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are not using an Administrator account, then try using the Administrator account and check what happens.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try to set the Default Administrator account and check whether you can fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the
<strong><span>Start button</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click
<strong><span>All programs</span></strong> followed by <strong><span>Accessories</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Accessories menu,
<strong><span>Right Click</span></strong> on the <strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong> option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the
<strong><span>'Run as administrator'</span></strong> option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may
 simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type the command
<strong><span>net user administrator /active:yes</span></strong> and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. Close the elevated command prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Log off (in Start Menu) and you will see the built-in Administrator account next to your current account(s).</span></span></p>
<p><span>9. Use the Administrator account to log in.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful</span><span>.<br />

    <title>Windows Media Player cannot play the DVD because the disc prohibits - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buzzard104  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player cannot play the DVD because the disc prohibits playback in your region of the world.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows Media Player error: Wrong region (but it isn't) [Unable to play windows media player get message Windows Media Player cannot play the DVD because the disc prohibits playback in your region of the world. You must obtain}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently when I burn a CD-R or CD-RW disk and then try to play it back, Windows Media Player gives this error message:</p>
<p>"Windows Media Player cannot play the DVD because the disc prohibits playback in your region of the world. You must obtain a disc that is intended for your geographic region."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that plainly isn't possible, as I have used these for a number of years, haven't imported anything, haven't moved etc etc. I have run a Troubleshooter, which found nothing, I ran FixIt which didn't solve it either. I have even just now fitted a brand
 new DVD/CD&nbsp;Disk burner thinking this might be the problem, but nothing changed.</p>
<p>It's NOT a DVD (so I don't see why I should change the region in Properties, which currently says 'No region selected'), it's a plain
<br />
CD-R.</p>
<p>The same CD-R will play in the VLC Player.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what's gong on?</p>

Windows 10 has an entirely new web browser named Edge. The Edge browser is Flash compatible and will work with a large variety of Pogo games. But, similar to the Chrome browser,&nbsp;<em>Edge is not compatible with Java games</em>.
 Fortunately, both Internet Explorer 11 and Firefox continue to support Java on the Windows 10 operating system. Windows 10 ships with Internet Explorer 11 and you can still install Firefox. Google Chrome can also be installed of course, but will only work
 with our Flash games.</p>

                    <p>Computer BSOD'd 2x today.&nbsp; The event log states: </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. The bugcheck was: 0x00000001 (0x00000000742d2e09, 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000001, 0xfffff8800aa00b60).
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>APC_INDEX_MISMATCH (1)<br />
This is a kernel internal error. The most common reason to see this<br />
bugcheck is when a filesystem or a driver has a mismatched number of<br />
calls to disable and re-enable APCs. The key data item is the<br />
Thread-&gt;CombinedApcDisable field. This consists of two separate 16-bit<br />
fields, the SpecialApcDisable and the KernelApcDisable. A negative value<br />
of either indicates that a driver has disabled special or normal APCs<br />
(respectively) without re-enabling them; a positive value indicates that<br />
a driver has enabled special or normal APCs (respectively) too many times.<br />
Arguments:<br />

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Most applications and hardware drivers designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor to find out about support
 for Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to refer to the reply posted by “Andre Da Costa” from this thread to know more.</span></p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking to upgrade my Lumia 730 mobile to Windows 10. So, I wanted to know if we can downgrade back to Win 8.1 if I am not satisfied/face any issues with Win 10. As my phone's warranty period is exausted, would I get any support from nokia care if
 I need any assistance to downgrade it back to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            EDGE recently started giving the "Hmmm cannot find page, etc" with many searches. If I immediately close EDGE and use IE there is no such problem and the target is found with no problem, ever. It appears to be a new problem with EDGE.

            I have just noticed Edge doing this as well, while printing a ups label to a local Zebra label printer. I had no issues before, and in fact I was having more problems using firefox. Now, I have to use IE to get it to work. Something has changed in Edge.

            Maybe.&nbsp; It sounds like your drivers are not compatible with Windows 8.&nbsp; You need to download the latest versions and run the ones that are not compatible in Compatibility Mode:

http://hosch250.wordpress.com/2013/05/29/using-windows-8-running-programs-in-compatibility-mode/</a>.&nbsp; Maybe your motherboard isn't compatible with Windows 8.&nbsp; I don't know to much about motherboard problems, so I won't be able to help with this.&nbsp; How old is
 the computer?&nbsp; The older the computer, the more trouble you have upgrading, usually.

            My drivers were fully functional until updates were installed after a reboot on 5/31/2013.&nbsp; Did you even read the body of my request for help.&nbsp; Your non-answer suggestion was no help at all.<br />

            Well yes, I did.&nbsp; You only said you did a 'restart,' you didn't specify because of updates.&nbsp; Problems after restarts and after updates are two very different types.&nbsp; You could try uninstalling the updates and reinstalling them one at a time.&nbsp; Find out
 which update causes the problem and report back.&nbsp; If you have Norton or McAfee installed, this is a fairly frequent problem caused by these, although any third-party anti-virus can cause these problems.

            I did not restart because of updates.&nbsp; Updates were ready to pounce and installed after I rebooted to escape a frozen program.&nbsp; Your compatability suggestion was a good stab in the dark but failed to pin the tail on the donkey.&nbsp; Please re-read my original
 post carefully before you reply.&nbsp; Youir last response still tells me that either you did not read my post completely or you failed to understand what you read.&nbsp; All update uninstalls/System restores/driver re-installs failed as my original post states.&nbsp; Your
 suggestion that Norton may be the cause of my problem has merit, but does not point to a solution.&nbsp; At this point a complete Windows 8 re-install with automatic updates rejected and Norton installation delayed seems to be the best solution.<br />

            Your right, I had missed a key word in the original post.&nbsp; Yes, if I had this problem, I would re-install Windows 8 and start over.&nbsp; You could try with Windows Defender before you install Norton, but I don't know if it would help.&nbsp; I never do automatic
 updates.&nbsp; I hear it causes automatic restarts at any time, and doesn't save your work that it cut you off in the middle of.&nbsp; Also, I like to know what I am installing.&nbsp; I hope you can solve your problem soon.

            Thank you for your input.&nbsp; I will give it 48 hours to see if any experts can provide a solution.&nbsp; It looks like the update corrupted too much stuff to make this install viable.<br />

            Method 1: Go to the web site (you obviously have Internet access from another computer) and find updates that can be downloaded for later use. These may be listed a administrator updates. You can use any type of storage device you want - CD, external hard
 drive, flash drive, etc. For some programs, you will just need to download the new versions and install them over the old ones.<br />
<br />
Method 2: For Microsoft updates, get a Technet subscription on disks. You will get disks mailed to you monthly with updates.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the File Explorer icons display has changed after upgrade to Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused by software installed on the system for customizing the display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if the issue occurs in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Safe mode with Networking starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers, services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer below link to Enable Safe Mode with Networking.</p>
</span>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10
</a></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a
<strong>Clean Boot </strong>to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this, refer below article on how to perform a Clean Boot in Windows.<br />
</span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></strong></p>
<span><span><span>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The troubleshooting steps in the above link are meant for windows 8, however, you can use the same for windows 10 as well.
</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted with the results. I would like to assist you with further information from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I would suggest you to check if the&nbsp;view settings of the File Explorer icons are set to
<strong>Large</strong> <strong>Icons</strong>/ <strong>Extra Large Icons</strong>. If it is, then you may set it to
<strong>Medium</strong>/<strong>Small Icons</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The following steps will help you to set the icons layout to view with either <strong>
Medium icons</strong>, or <strong>Small icons</strong></p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Press <strong>Windows logo + E</strong> to open Windows Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Now click the <strong>View</strong> tab present at the top of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: Now select <strong>Medium </strong>or <strong>Small Icons</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another easy way of checking if the view of the icons can be changed,&nbsp;in the active File Explorer window or on the desktop, press and hold the
<strong>Control </strong>(CTRL) key and roll your mouse scroll wheel forward and backward to change the size of all icons in this specific location to be larger or smaller. When finished, release the
<strong>Control</strong> key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Write to us with the updated information and we would be happy to help you further.</p>

<h2>            WIN10 1809 reseting my date format dd&#47;MM&#47;YYYY every date</h2>
                    I need to have date format in dd/MM/YYYY and currency in "$". It seems the only way I could get both is set my region to English (Australia). That work fine except the computer reset my date to d/MM/YYYY every day when I boot up my computer in the morning.
 That is very annoying especially when you need to enter date info in an Access database.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to stop the WIn10 doing that?

<p>I tried setting WIN10 the regional format like you suggested to English (USA) and edited the date format to dd/MM/yyyy, the date stayed in that format for a while, then Windows reseted the date back to default to that region, M/d/yyyy for USA.&nbsp; It is the
 same if I set the regional format to English (Australia), in this case it will reset it to the default d/MM/yyyy although dd/MM/yyyy is on the option list for Australia.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it was on 1803 version, Windows did not give me much problem with date format. I have been fighting this since I upgraded my Windows to 1809 release.</p>

<h2>            Nikon D90 won&#39;t connect via USB cable to my laptop with windows 10 OS</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help. I am trying to connect my <strong>Nikon D90 </strong>to my laptop that runs&nbsp;<strong>windows 1</strong><strong>0</strong>. I was able to do so in windows 8 without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, there was no driver installed on my computer for the camera (wondering if it got wiped during OS upgrade), so I have installed a driver for D90 and the device is showing in the
<strong>Device Manager</strong> under<strong> Portable Devices</strong> as Nikon D90. I've made sure all of the latest updates to the driver have been installed. When I go to
<strong>Devices and Printers</strong> in <strong>Control Panel</strong>, Nikon D90 is not displayed. I've tried to
<strong>Add a Device</strong>, but the camera is not being listed. I've tried all 3 of my USB ports and none of them display the camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit at a loss and don't know what the next steps are to get the camera display. Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sylvia</p>

 no fix and I think there won't be any) and now I can't login on my phone and in result I can't get any achievements. Please do something with it!

<p>Either unlock remaining achievements manually on your side or clear game's cloud data, so I could start from scratch, whatever. Why all of your games must be glitched?</p>

<h3> slugrunnerzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD&#43;-RW drive suddenly stopped recognizing blank DVD-R discs</h2>
                    <p>I am running Microsoft 10 on a Dell Inspiron laptop that is 2 years old. All software and drivers are current. In the last week I've made about 20 discs with family videos. I ran out of DVDs and bought a spindle of 50 DVDs of the exact same brand/type (SONY
 DVD-R 120 min/4/7 GB). I put in on of the new discs and the pop up window came up like normal asking me to give the DVD a name and whether I wanted to use it as a USB drive or as a CD/DVD. I selected CD/DVD (the bottom option). The drive began spinning around
 and acted as if it was copying the files, then it ejected the disc and said "There was a problem burning this disc. The disc wasn't burned successfully. Please make sure you have the latest firmware for your CD or DVD burner installed, then try again later."
 There was an option to try again with another disc, which I selected. I inserted a new disc and the drive spun around then ejected the disc and said&nbsp;"There is no disc in the CD or DVD burner. Please insert a writable disc."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that happened, every DVD I put into the drive has the same result...nothing happens. If I right click on the DVD drive from Windows Explorer and click "Format", Windows says "There is no disk in drive D. Please insert a disk"...yet there is a disk
 in the drive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following solutions:&nbsp; uninstall and reinstall the driver; uninstall the driver, shut down the computer and reboot; boot in safe mode. Nothing works. I know my drive is working fine and I believe this is a software issue, but I am at a loss
 as to how to fix it. Some have suggested that it is a problem with Autoplay - but changing the settings in Autoplay has no effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I obtained a Dell external CD/DVD burner from a friend and tried using that instead. The process with the external DVD burner went exactly like it did with my internal CD/DVD drive. It acted like it was going to burn a disc, then choked on it, ejected it,
 and thereafter refused to format or work with any DVD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a Memorex DVD-R 120 min/4.7 GB disc instead of Sony. Same result. I tried a Staples 700 MB CD-R.&nbsp; Same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help.</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install

<p>Thanks Andre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is your theory that the most current release of Windows 10 is unstable and that instability is was caused the DVD drive to suddenly stop working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for me to find out the date that Windows 10 was updated? Intuitively, it would only make sense that the version of Windows 10 was the cause of the problem if the software did an update within the last few days. (e.g. between the date when
 the drive was working fine...June 24th...and the date when it stopped working....July 3).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not opposed to reverting to an older release, but it is a big headache to find another computer to get a download from.&nbsp; I was hoping for a simpler solution. Wha!</p>

<p>Check with these utilities to see if any information can be gathered : (Be sure to run this since there<br />
may well be other Bug_Check codes.)<br />
<br />
This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />
<br />
<strong>BlueScreenView</strong> - Free -&nbsp;scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of death' crashes,<br />
and displays the information about all crashes in one table.<br />

<br />
MyEventViewer can be checked at the time of the BlueScreen (BSOD) to within a second or so of the<br />
time of the BSOD to provide more information as to possible cause - see TIP.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer</strong> - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />
<strong>TIP</strong> - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file -<br />
set it to a bit before and&nbsp;after the time of the BSOD.<br />

<p><strong>AppCrashView </strong>- Free -&nbsp;a small utility for Windows Vista and Windows 7 that displays the details of all<br />
application crashes occurred in your system. The crashes information is extracted from the .wer<br />
files created by the Windows Error Reporting (WER) component of the operating system every<br />
time that a crash is occurred. AppCrashView also allows you to easily save the crashes list to<br />
text/csv/html/xml file. <br />

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :&nbsp;Run DriverView&nbsp;- set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names.&nbsp;(Also update the BIOS and<br />
chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.</p>
