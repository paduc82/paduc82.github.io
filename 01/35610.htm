<h2>            BSOD error, when boot from SSD.</h2>
                    <p>I have seen this problem for a long time and reinstalled system for nearly 100 times trying different settings of BIOS, everything doesn't work. The BSOD is still there. I really need help to solve this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would link my minidump file&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>it is not a memory's fault or motherboard's fault or SSD's fault since I have raplaced them several times but cannot solve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AHCI is ON and 4k is aligned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, my system is totally fine if I booting from my old HDD. only when booting from SSD would cause such a problem,&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Yangzixin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can understand the inconvenience that you are receiving a Blue Screen of Death error repeatedly while booting from SSD storage.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your effort for providing us more information through mini dump files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Are you able to boot to the desktop after the blue screen?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you able to boot on other computer using same SSD storage?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I tried to research on it and found that
</span><span>we are getting
</span><span>KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR with an error code <span>&nbsp;</span>0x0000007A.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR bug check has a value of 0x0000007A. This bug check indicates that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</span>It appears that there are some issues with the hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let’s try some steps to fix this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Use check disk command for any errors on hard disk </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Microsoft does not recommend interrupting the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity of the disk if the CHKDSK program is interrupted.
<strong>For safety you can back up your data before using the check disk command.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.25pt">Use the check disk commands as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Windows Start Screen, type <strong>cmd</strong> in search option to open <strong>
Command Prompt</strong>(cmd).</li><li>Right click and select <strong>'Run as administrator'</strong>.</li><li>Type at the command prompt <strong>CHKDSK /P</strong> and press ENTER to scan the disk.</li><li>Then type <strong>CHKDSK C: /F /R</strong> and press ENTER to repair corrupt sectors, if there are any.</li></ol>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then press Y to schedule a task and restart the computer to perform chkdsk.<br />
Once chkdsk completes, boot to the desktop and then check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the below mentioned link for more details:</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I highly recommend <strong><span>backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device</span></strong> before attempting any type of OS repair or upgrade.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>System Restore disclaimer: </strong>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>

            It is a big mistake to have more than ONE antivirus program.&nbsp; Pick one and remove all other "protection" programs.&nbsp; They conflict with one another.&nbsp; This may not be the cause of your problem, but it will cause other problems for sure.

            <p>The following from your list are all programs trying to protect your system.&nbsp; It is highly likely that one or more of them will conflict with one or more of the others.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>McAfee endpoint encryption</li><li>Microsoft security client </li><li>file sanitizer for HP protect tools&nbsp;</li><li>AVG UI</li><li>vprotect application </li><li>AVG framework </li></ol>
<p>You should not have more than one antivirus program on your system.&nbsp;&nbsp; I emphasize ANTIVIRUS.&nbsp; Please understand that most of the products being offered in the market today are multi-function ones, that contain an antivirus component and several others, none
 of which you need.&nbsp; FYI, I look after 150 client computers and my clients know well that if they load one of these multi-faceted programs, I will&nbsp;refuse to work on their computer unless the program(s) is completely removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other stuff in those multi-faceted programs is not needed by Windows 7 which is more than capable of providing those functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not at all sure that the correction of this particular problem will solve an over-heating problem, if indeed that is what is wrong.&nbsp; If there is indeed an over-heating problem, it is likely caused by a hardware issue that would require the help of a
 competent technician.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will pass along my advice on how to select an Antivirus program:&nbsp; I will not name one unless you specifically ask me to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Which Antivirus product to choose?</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p><em><strong>The “Security” software installed on your computer may be causing problems that can not be diagnosed or fixed.&nbsp; Try removing it temporarily.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a controversial topic, but your choice of AV software may be something you want to take a 2nd look at.&nbsp; I suggest you visit this web site to get a sense of which AV software does the best job, depending on what kind of user you are:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.av-comparatives.org/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a non-profit that has been around for a long time and I trust their results.&nbsp;&nbsp;Download and read the 2015 summary report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you interpret these results, keep in mind the difference between a product that detects 95% and another 99% of infections, is actually 5 times more likely to allow an infection.&nbsp; A view of this chart will illustrate this point quite well:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://chart.av-comparatives.org/chart1.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://chart.av-comparatives.org/chart1.php</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am speaking from a great deal of experience.&nbsp; I support 150 client computers.&nbsp; I have been doing this for 14 years.&nbsp; My clients NEVER have infections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em><strong>only products I will use or recommend are ANTIVIRUS-ONLY products</strong></em>.&nbsp; Any product that is called complete protection, Internet security or deems itself to be a comprehensive security product is prohibited on my client computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have good reason for this. Over the years and hundreds of PCs, I’ve learned a lesson well.&nbsp; That it is very difficult to diagnose and fix the problem(s) when components of an Internet Security product are actively working to prevent that diagnosis.&nbsp; The
 software sees the technician (me in this case) as a threat.&nbsp; I discovered that if I uninstalled that software, I am able to much more likely and&nbsp;quickly discover an fix the problem.&nbsp; Antivirus ONLY products do not behave like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other components in these IS products (other than the AV itself) cause more problems than any benefit they bring and mostly work by shutting down the Windows component that does a very good job of that particular task anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the Antivirus software that you need.&nbsp; It is actually <em><strong>all</strong>
</em>that you need with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the big name suppliers much prefer to sell their all-in products because they can sell them for a higher price.&nbsp; Some do not offer an antivirus only product.&nbsp; Some push their all in ones and still sell the AV only product, but you may have to look
 for them.&nbsp; There is at least one and it is either the best or close to it.</p>
<p>Beware of products that try to actively engage you in the security process by asking your permission to run a program named xd43_45d*.exe, or the like.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do not&nbsp;use any product that claims to make your computer run better</strong>.&nbsp; Virtually all of them are either bogus, themselves an infection, or put your computer at risk.
<strong>Remove everything that claims to be there to prevent infections</strong> or claims to make your computer run better, with the singular exception of just one antivirus product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note well.&nbsp; You should <strong><em>never have more than one protection product installed</em></strong>.&nbsp; Always ensure that you completely remove any and all protection software packages before installing a new one.&nbsp; That includes software that may have
 come pre-installed on your computer when new.&nbsp; Some products will conflict with one another, causing yet more problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot fully remove most any AV software by simply using the standard Windows 7 uninstall tool.&nbsp; Most of the majors also publish a “removal tool” that gets the rest of it.&nbsp; If you do not completely remove it, it will cause very hard to understand and
 diagnose problems.</p>

    <title>Updates caused loss of internet connection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Updates caused loss of internet connection</h2>
                    <p>For the second time this year, after doing a Microsoft Update on my WinXP Home netbook, I lost my internet connection. The two current (June) updates involved are KB2518864 and KB2478658. I tried restarting the computer a couple times, and I still didn't
 have a connection. I did a System Restore, and the internet connection is back. Any idea of what's going on? (Yes, I know, Robear, that it's bad to use System Restore, but it seems to do the job.)</p>
<p>I tried reporting the problem to Microsoft but got someone who seemed not to speak very good English and was uninterested in the problem. When I said that System Restore got the connection back, he said, "So what do you want me to do?"&nbsp;He added, "We recommend
 that all updates be installed." I said that it wouldn't do me any good to have the updates if I then couldn't use the computer. He said he'd report the problem--but he didn't ask me for any personal info,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I don't have a case number.</p>
<p>One other issue: I installed all the high priority Patch Tuesday updates for June on Thursday, June 16--and was told that everything downloaded and installed OK. I was notified (by the yellow shield) about the two new updates on Saturday, June 18. Any idea
 of why these two showed up late?</p>
<p>Finally, do I need these two updates (they're for the .NET Framework) if I'm not a programmer?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>If you don't install you leave your system vulnerable. If you lose your internet connection you can remove though Add / Remove Programs in Control Panel.</p>
<p>Hiding and not installing leaves you vulnerable. I would try one at a time. If you lose your internet connection remove the one causing the problem. It is always helpful to narrow&nbsp; the area where the problem lies. Getting even one installed reduces your
 system vulnerability.</p>
<p>You have raised an incident report. You will have more information to hopefully get the problematic update issue resolved..</p>
<p>I would not bother about Robear. His behaviour is irrational at times.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
&nbsp; To resolve the issue with sleep mode, follow these methods:<br />
<br />
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: I would suggest you to run the <strong>
Power</strong> troubleshooter and check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key</strong> to launch Start screen.<br />
b. Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without quotes and click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
c. In the new window, click <strong>View all</strong> on the left pane.<br />
d. In the list of options, click on <strong>Power</strong>.<br />
e. Click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: Follow these steps to make sure Network Adapter is not interfering with computer entering into sleep mode:<br />
<br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Key</strong> and <strong>X </strong>
Key, select <strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>.<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand the <strong>Network</strong> <strong>Adapter</strong>, right click and select
<strong>Properties</strong>. <br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the power management <strong>check</strong> the box which says “<strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong>”.<br />
d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press <strong>Ok</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: </strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue still occurs, I would suggest you to check if there is any devices that is preventing the computer to go to sleep mode. Follow the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Type cmd on the Start screen and right click on it. Select Run as administrator.</span><span><br />
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Powercfg -devicequery wake_armed</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c) You will get the name/names of the devices. To disable a specific device from waking the computer, run the following command:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Powercfg -devicedisablewake "devicename"</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Make sure that you replace the “<strong><span>devicename</span></strong>”placeholder with the name of the device that you want to disable.</span><span><br />
 command: </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Powercfg -deviceenablewake "devicename" command.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For further reference, you can refer to the link to update the display card driver to try and fix the issue:</span><br />

            <p>Vijay B,</p>
<p>This is not an issue with the computer not going into sleep mode. It is an issue with the option of telling the computer to go to Sleep is gone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first installed Windows 8.1 on my computer&nbsp;I could right on the Start button and mouse over 'Shut down or sign out' to expand its options and&nbsp;there were four options: Sign out, Sleep, Shut down and Restart. Currently there are only three options -
 the Sleep option is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure when it disappeared, but I would like it back! I have a desktop tower (not a laptop) and at night when I was done for the night I would tell my computer to go to Sleep - this was a LOT easier that shutting it down and a LOT better than leaving
 it active on the internet all night. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is something Microsoft has done, can you please UNDO it?! If this is something that maybe a program has done, can you please tell us how to restore the Sleep option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Keith</p>

            <p>Hi V Tag</p>
<p>I had the same problem as you with the sleep option not being there and saw this thread and went and did further research.</p>
<p>And from what I found out, its all to do with the HomeGroup and Network settings...
</p>
<p>Firstly I left a "made up"&nbsp;HomeGroup my PC\Tablet had made up&nbsp;(running Windows 8.1 btw). To do this, search for HomeGrouo and open the windows version of it (not in Windows 8.1 PC Setting), and click "Leave HomeGroup" (or something like that)..... Doing
 this ensures that the PC don't think that any files are being shared across a network.</p>
<p>Next you need to uninstall ALL network adapter drivers. Navigate to Device Manager in Control Panel through Hardware and Devices,&nbsp;and&nbsp;under the first green link labelled Devices and Printers, in blue Device Manager with the User Account Control symbol should
 be there. (If required to provide administrative permissions, do so).</p>
<p>Under the heading Network Adapters, (AFTER you downloaded an install of your drivers to reinstall them) right click on all of the adapters and Uninstall all. If given the option do not delete software for your device.</p>
<p>Once you have uninstalled them then click on Scan for Hardware changes which is located in the top command bar, and the drivers may start to install them selves automatically. If they don't then this is where the download of your driver installs would come
 in handy.</p>
<p>Good luck with it (and if this doesn't make much sense, type in Google How to re enable the sleep function in Windows 8.1).</p>

            <p>For ne the problem was Seep used to work, then one day my tablet's power button (set to sleep) no longer did anything.&nbsp; Sleep option was still there for the button, but no longer shown in my Power/shutdown options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was obscure - I just had changed some advanced Wifi network adapter settings to troubleshoot a flakey&nbsp;connection, and in the process disabled&nbsp;its "'Wake on pattern match' option.&nbsp; Re-enabling this fixed it.&nbsp; I guess this meant that the Wifi adapter
 could no longer be woken from a low-power state, so Sleep was automatically disabled (but without any warning).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cause-effect here was kinda weird, even for a seasoned troubleshooter like myself.&nbsp; MS should add this check to the built-in Power Troubleshooter.&nbsp; Hope it helps someone.</p>

<br />
<br />If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />Are you opening the Command Box using Run as Administrator from right click menu?  
<br />

<p>I picked this up at our tip shop about a year ago, and it does run on Win10 if you use a noCD fix\hack.
</p>
<p>Using a noCD fix&nbsp; has become mandatory with hundreds of&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
disc based games </span>due to MS forcing their DRM Blocking</p>
<p>'security' feature on Win10 users.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have more details on DRM Blocking and another DRM related issue in my post at&nbsp;
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
---this thread---</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- You can get a noCD fix&nbsp; <a href="https://megagames.com/games/max-payne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
--- here games/max-payne -</a>Use the version you have patched the game to.</p>
<p>- I'm using the 1.05 patch --- <a href="https://www.fileplanet.com/archive/p-2842/Max-Payne-v1-05-Patch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.fileplanet.com/archive/p-2842/Max-Payne-v1-05-Patch</a></p>
<p>- You can also get a few mods for the game by doing a search,&nbsp; if interested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Use the <em>Compatibility</em> option - <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Change High DPI Settings &gt; Override High Scaling Behavior.</span></em> or the game may not fit the screen properly.</p>
<p>No need to use Compatibility with an older version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Also verify <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Direct Play</em></span> is enabled in...</p>
<p><em>Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows Features On or Off</em>&nbsp; -- Scroll down to and enable
<p>
</p><p>- When the game first launches it may seem to get stuck on a white screen. Just click on Escape and it should continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- It would be pointless posting a complaint to MS. This 'feature' is hard baked into Win10 and MS are not going to make</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As I understand the issue, you are unable to upgrade to Windows 8 as the hard drive is not detected during installation. Please let me know if this is not correct.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.</strong><br />
1. How are you trying to install to Windows 8 Pro?<br />
2. Do you have any Operating System installed on the computer currently?<br />
3. What is the make and model number of the computer?
<div><br />
I would suggest you to run Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant, if you have any Operating Systm installed on the computer to check if your computer is ready to install Windows 8 or not.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hope this information helps. Reply with the required information to help you to fix the issue.<br />

<p>After I did the diskpart it found the drive, I deleted the partition windows found as it couldn't install on that partition.</p>
<p>Created a new partition, allowed windows to create several overhead partitions for systems and now Windows 8 formats that partition and installs.

<p>the store works just fine but some of the apps doesn't work very well&nbsp;</p>
<p>for example , the mail app doesn't sync emails by it self , unless I enter the mail client and press the syncing button&nbsp;</p>
<p>it used to work and shows notifications in action center and shows emails via live tiles&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you sir!&nbsp; I continued to browse the help and support, and learned that 8020002E is caused when the download is interrupted.&nbsp; This makes sense because I did get disconnected several times while trying to do the updates due to restrictions on the public
 WiFi.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this was the "magic" fix, but here is what he told the other poster to do:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Stop Windows Update service using services.msc;<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Delete Temp Update files in Windows/Software Distribution/Data Store - delete all files;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then go back to Software Distribution/Download - delete all files.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Start the Windows Update service again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, I decided to take a different route as time is getting critical: I used Windows Update just to look up the KB numbers of all the updates I needed, then went to MS Downloads, downloaded and saved them, and ran them in date order.&nbsp;
<b>All seems to be OK now - except I cannot find 2769166 for .Net 3.5 published 12/12/12.&nbsp; I cannot find it online and the Update service can't find it either.</b>&nbsp; Can you advise me on that?<br />

            Hi Doug and Julie.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are some solutions for installing and running this older software on Windows 10 here:  <a href="https://support.waspbarcode.com/kb/articles/windows-mobile-device-center-and-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.waspbarcode.com/kb/articles/win...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try installing the package in Compatbility Mode:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Sharief,<br />
<br />
basically I would want to use another email account in place of my current email account used for this WIndows 8.1 login, but with the same settings and whatever synced data made to the current email account be available on the new email account.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Current sign in email with settings synced)<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Wanted to use this email with *** Email address is removed for privacy *** settings synced migrated over to this)<br />
<br />
I kinda understand that by logging into a different email address, is it like a new account?<br />
<br />
I will go understand your supplied URL now.<br />
<br />
<b>Update:<br />
The method works. THanks!<br />
<br />
On this note, now will the settings previously synced on *** Email address is removed for privacy *** still exist if I sign in to that on another Windows 8.1 installation? If so, how to reset what was synced on *** Email address is removed for privacy *** if I only want one set of sync data which currently exists on *** Email address is removed for privacy ***?
 Thank you!</b><br />

<p>You should be able to burn the CD the same as in older versions. &nbsp;Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 all use the same methods, so you don't need to change or learn anything new, it's been the same since about the year 2001.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just open your folders, find your CD-Burner drive in the "Computer/This PC" section, and drag your powerpoint file on top of it. &nbsp;You can drag more files, and whenever you're ready, just right-click it and choose "Burn".</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The majority of the Group Policies are implemented when the Group Policy Editor makes a change to the Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are knowledgeable about editing the Registry, you can implement any of the Group Policy changes by simply making the change in the Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the Group Policy Reference that shows the Group Policies and the associated Registry Keys for implementing the policies.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Download Group Policy Settings Reference for Windows and Windows Server from Official Microsoft Download Center:
</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not attempt this unless you are an advanced user and are comfortable making changes to the Registry.

<h2>            Connect App HDCP Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to use the Connect app to mirror my Samsung Galaxy S8 on my Windows 10 PC. I open the connect app and connect fine, but I get a "protected content cannot be viewed on this device" warning. My graphics card (nVidia GeForce RTX 2080) and
 monitor are both confirmed by the nVidia control panel to be HDCP compliant. Is the problem with the Connect App? Can you help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Same, bought and installed it from the console storefront it acted like I never bought it when I tried to play it. Figured deleting and re-installing it might have fixed the problem. But nope, can't even re-download it now.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kate.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. The issue you are facing it could be due to the display driver is being outdated. To assist you better I would like to know, what is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Meanwhile, let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to uninstall/reinstall the display adapter driver and check. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>
Device manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Locate for <strong>display adapter</strong> and click on it to expand.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the <strong>device </strong>and click on <strong>
uninstall</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once you are done uninstalling the driver, restart the computer. It will automatically install the generic display adapter driver.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If this doesn’t help to fix the issue. I suggest you to update the display adapter driver. Skip step3 from the above steps and right click on the
<strong>device</strong> and click on <strong>update.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above method did not help to fix the issue, I would suggest you to<strong>
</strong>go to the computer manufacturer website and download the latest display adapter driver. If the display driver is not available for Windows 10, try installing the available driver in compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check Run this program in <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, I suggest you to install the latest Windows 10 build 14342 and check if the issue still persist. Click on the link for more information.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for the quick reply!<br />

Graphics:<br />
<br />
Radeon Software Version 16.5.2.1 (latest beta)<br />
Graphics Chipset - AMD Radeon R7 200 Series<br />
</p>
<p>System:<br />
Windows Version - Windows 10 (64 bit)<br />
System Memory - 8 GB<br />
CPU Type - Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3570K CPU @ 3.40GHz<br />
<br />
I actually just updated my display driver this week, since the software notified me there was an update, and that did not fix Spotlight.&nbsp; I just installed the beta version of the drivers. That didn't help either.
<br />
<br />
I enabled Windows Insider, but when I hit "Windows Update" it checks for updates and says "Your device is up to date, last checked: Today, (time)".&nbsp; I can't seem to get the latest insider build? Will see if I can manually download it somewhere..<br />
<br />
I've fully shut down the PC and rebooted a few times in the past hour. The one thing that has changed is that it now seems to correctly show the preview of the Spotlight image in Settings where that used to be gray. But still it's not showing on my lock screen.
<br />

            <p>Well, that windows 10 build 14342 was a huge disaster.</p>
<p>The update seemed to go OK, but then my PC wouldn't boot and was stuck at a light blue screen with spinning circle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to download windows 10 to USB from a different PC, then it went to 'attempting to fix boot issues', didn't work, and I apparently have system restore not turned on (??), so that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no clue what option I selected that got it to boot correctly and everything is working to where I can now reply (except for Spotlight, that still is not working)... I'm going to spend the day backing up everything, and maybe leave my PC on forever..?</p>

            The display adapter has absolutely Nothing to do with windows spotlight working or not. pretty ridiculous that I always see Microsoft moderators give generic answers that are not related to the issues people are having.

<p>Hello Jewels,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that you said Skype for Business will not launch. Do you mean that the desktop client cannot open, or the user cannot sign in? Based on the description, I think you mean that the user cannot sign in Skype for Business 2016 successfully.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to help you better, please let me know what error message you see since the users cannot sign in Skype for Business. You can capture some screenshots for better understanding. Meanwhile, please try the manual configuration to
 see if there is any difference: </p>
<p>1. Click the <strong>Settings</strong> icon in the upper-right,&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong>-&gt;<strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click&nbsp;<strong>Personal</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
<p>3. Enter&nbsp;<strong>sipdir.online.lync.com:443</strong>&nbsp;as the&nbsp;<strong>Internal</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>External</strong>&nbsp;<strong>server</strong>&nbsp;under&nbsp;Manual configuration. Click OK and try to sign-in again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please feel free to post back if you have any update. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

My laptop specs are:<br />

HP Spectre x360 - 15-bl112dx
<p>Intel Core i-7 8550U CPU<br />
Display Adapters:</p>
<p>Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620<br />
NVIDIA GeForce MX150&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My screen keeps flickering like this whenever there is a change in display which is either when i close my laptop to sleep or turn it off. But if I turn off my laptop for 30-40 mins this issue goes away and this occurs everytime. So i have to waste 30-40 minutes
 for it to come back to normal.<br />
<br />
I have tried updating all drivers. Uninstalling and deleting the driver and then downloading the latest Intel Graphical Drivers.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Reach to Power options as in previous step &gt; Click Choose what the power buttons do &gt; Click Change settings that are currently unavailable &gt; Scroll down to Shutdown settings and uncheck Turn on fast startup &gt; Click Save changes
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall / Install Battery Driver (Only for laptops)
<br />Shut down your computer &gt; Detach power chord &gt; Remove battery (if fixed no need to remove) &gt; Attach power chord &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; Expand Batteries &gt; Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System &gt; Uninstall &gt; Shutdown the computer &gt; Remove the power chord &gt; Attach your battery &gt; Attach your power chord &gt; Reboot the computer to automatically install the driver
<br />
<br />5. As a last resort, you should perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not an install of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Hey thanks for the answer. I did the first four steps and while it still flickered, but it only flickered for couple minutes instead of the normal 30-40 minutes. Could you elaborate on what the problem might be.<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Most of the time, the flickering cause lies in the power. That is why it improved. Repair upgrade would correct / rule out any Windows related cause.

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor and Office Insider for Android. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As you have tried update drivers and Uninstalling and deleting the driver etc., 
<br />
<br />I recommend to Check for bad 'Ribbon Connecter' (laptop screen cable) to the Motherboard in service center, since you get issue while closing your. laptop . 
<br />
<br />You can try installing the windows 10 in UEFI mode instead of Legacy 
<br />( It converts hard disk to GPT from MBR)
<br />
<br />Refer this site for more on software related fix:

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    I've already "saved" my frequent favorites that were in the Favorites Bar, but with over 25 sites in my favorite list, I need a similar, compact way to save all these on an internet site on Windows 8.

<p>You can copy Favorites from one computer to another using the network (if sharing is setup), using an external device or using the cloud. Open
 File Explorer (was Windows Explorer) and copy them to C:\ \Users\[Your User Name]\Favorites.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the ‘star’ top right to access them in ‘Desktop’ mode. Access them in the App version by clicking in the Address bar and they will appear
 along the bottom of the screen.</p>

    <title>Product key suddenly become invalid - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Product key suddenly become invalid</h2>
                    Hi! My windows 7 came preinstalled on the laptop. after over two years of using, it failed activation process saying that the key is invalid. I've spoken to microsoft on the chat and they said the key is blocked,  but to find out the reason I need to contact computer manufacturer. Since the warranty expired and I still have the geunine sticker underneath the laptop it has got nothing to do with computer manufacturer. How do I contact Microsoft in the UK to unblock the product code? Please help!

<p>
<span>2) Next press the 'ENTER' key</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Additional information:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Computers, which are built by large manufactures that come with Windows Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the special instructions found only on that Manufacturer's computer
 hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory) Windows 7 looks at the motherboard and sees the special instructions and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;COA SLP:<b> This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom,[ or inside the battery compartment]) of your computer</b>. It is a valid product key, but
 should only be used in limited situations (such as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate of
 Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)</span></p>
