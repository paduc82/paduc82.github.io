<h2>            Linx 10&#47;10 Tablet Bricks&#47;Freezes After Windows 10 Anniversary Update Ver 1607</h2>
                    <p>Hoping someone can help here, I recently updated my Linx 10/10 Windows tablet to the anniversary update 1607 (KB3176936) Everything went fine, downloaded, started the update. Right thru to "getting things started". Device restarted to the lock screen image.
 and . . . NO TOUCH. so I couldn't open my tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A day later I borrowed a set of keyboards which attach to my tablet from a friend, and presto I was in, but . . . No screen rotation, No landscape, No Touch, had to type one way (landscape) while looking sideways (portrait). After trying various settings
 with no luck. I eventually after a lot of fiddling had to set my tablet to go back to an earlier version ( Version 1511 ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my updates from Microsoft where set to automatic until this occurred, now all updates of every kind I have stopped&nbsp;in the hope that a resolution to this&nbsp;can be found. Something I found interesting, when I looked up the system information of my tablet
 it stated "System Type: 32-bit operating system, x64-based processor". Does this mean Microsoft's Auto Update is updated my device with the wrong operating system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I've lost rotation completely on my wife's Linx 8 with no resolution, now my Linx 10/10 what next my Laptops, Desktop?? I love the new Windows, I've being a user since Win '98, but seems to me like Microsoft is now taking an Apple stand in forcing
 their users to update their devices, though in some cases&nbsp;only a year old. A lot of us just can't afford that. Ubuntu or Solus are starting to look extremely tempting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to place this in the correct category (apologies if I chose incorrect)
</p>
<p>Any help at all would be&nbsp;greatly appreciated, and&nbsp;Thank You in advance.</p>

<a href="http://www.linxtablet.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.linxtablet.co.uk</a> etc and still NO resolve. My Linx tablet is as they say Bricked. now to add to my dilemma my wife's Linx 8 is now gone the exact same way. I am as I write this,
 trying to do a reset on the tablet, I don't expect any good results there either. Why is it that when Microsoft does these updates that they can't just leave the manufacturers drivers alone. They are not all seeing and all knowing. At this moment all I can
 see is that Microsoft (unless resolved) has cost me hundreds of euro.</p>

    <title>Device Manager keeps refreshing - due to network adapters - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Device Manager keeps refreshing - due to network adapters</h2>
                    <p>I do audio production work on my PC, and ever since upgrading to Windows 10 I've seen disruptions with MIDI devices every 30 seconds, along with latency issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out, something is causing Device Manger to refresh every 30 seconds and that is linked with the issues I'm having. I narrowed it down to the Network Adapters and/or IP Stack. My desktop has 2 wired NICs, as well as a PCIe wireless card. I noticed that
 it happens when any of the three adapters is active. Example: if I disable the two wired NICs and have the wireless connected, it does it. Or if I disable the wireless adapter and one of the wired ones is plugged in, it does it. I even removed the wireless
 card and uninstalled the driver for the 1st NIC, and it still did it with only the 2nd NIC active. If I disable/disconnect all 3, everything is stable, no refreshes, and my software and hardware works perfectly. This is not an option though because my software
 uses online authorization for plugins and such. Here are some other steps I've done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- reset IP stack</p>
<p>- disabled Defender and any other malware protection</p>
<p>- disabled all firewall rules</p>
<p>- disabled all other performance software bits; like Intel Rapid storage, Samsung Magician, backups, motherboard tuning apps, etc.</p>
<p>- uninstalled all network utility software (Intel PROset and Killer Network Manager)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it continues to happen when any network adapter is connected. It's driving me nuts. Anyone have any ideas on how I can get Device Manager to stop resetting/refreshing every 30 seconds when network is active?<br />

            <p>Hi Timm,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Device Manager refresh tends to happen when a new hardware is plugged in or removed, whether its a flash drive, and/or etc. This also happens when a driver is not working properly in which the Device Manager attempts to refresh to restart the said driver.
 Plausible reason is that your Network adapter requires update since all this started right after upgrading to Windows 10. If you haven't done so, you can update it by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> and right click on <strong>Network Adapters</strong>.</li><li>On the drop down, click on "<strong>Update Driver</strong>".</li><li>Follow the instruction in the <strong>Update Driver Software wizard</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also as an alternative check if this issue persist on Safe Mode. You can go to this&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> for the steps on how to boot to safe
 mode. You can also go to your PC manufacturer website for the latest driver update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

            <p>John, appreciate the quick response. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. I failed to mention that one of the first things I tried was updating and rolling back drivers. And keep in mind, it happens when ANY of the 3 network adapters are active, with or
 without the other adapters being disabled or completely uninstalled. So is there something, from a hardware perspective, where all network adapters come together, like a bus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I already narrowed it down to the network adapters by removing all peripherals. Started with USB devices, then removed all PCI-based cards, and even disconnected all non-OS SATA drives. I also uninstalled and downgraded the Intel Management engine.
 I built the PC, so there really is no manufacturer to reach out to. I did open a ticket with Gigabyte though, who is the mainboard mfg though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually don't have to ask for help, but this one has me stumped.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>We'll have to isolate the issue completely and narrow it down as this may be a problem with the hardware itself.

            <p>Hey John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the TCP/IP reset and reboot, but no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I booted into Safe Mode (no networking), and to my surprise it was still doing it. In fact, it was doing it faster than normal. Usually Dev Mgr will flash about every 30 seconds. In Safe Mode, it was doing it every 5 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: In Safe Mode, should it still be showing all my network adapters and USB devices as being enabled? I thought if it was only loading the bare minimum and basic drivers, that all those things would show up as disabled or not at all. I tried removing
 a bunch of the USB devices to see if the refreshing would stop in Safe Mode from them too, but no such luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>
        </p>

            Timm, did you ever solve this problem?&nbsp; I am having practically the same problem and symptoms (the Device Manager refreshes go away when I disable the network card....I have done a tremendous amount of troubleshooting USB device before posting this, etc.
 etc.)&nbsp; Thanks!

<h3> markbenjakov  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable the Mail app embedded in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm paying for a Microsoft Office subscription and I use Outlook for email. When I get a pop-up notice of newly arrived mail, if I click it, Windows 10 opens the pre-installed Mail app instead of Outlook.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set Outlook as the default app for email, but that appears to have no effect on Windows 10 handling of email alerts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mail appears to be immune from being disabled or uninstalled from Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone figured out how to rid their PC of the Mail app?</p>

<h3> wylht  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power plan doesn&#39;t have hard disk setting</h2>
                    <p>I have a USB Hard Drive. Due to Windows's power saver option, it would stop after only a few seconds of inactivity. That is really crazy! When you are dealing with some photo editing, you will have to wait few seconds for every photo, because hard disk need
 time to spin up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On my other computer, there is an option in the power plan setting, to set how long should the hard disk to spin down after inactivity.
</p>
<p>But on Surface Pro 4, there is no such option. This makes me unable to set my hard disk to keep spinning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please solve this problem. Or how can Microsoft expect people to use this computer to deal with photos?

            <p>I have the very same problem; this is causing errors with my video editing program, as the external disk spins down after about 30 seconds ( !!! ) of inactivity, and my editing program is pretty prompt to give errors when the drive isn't responding in a
 very timely manner; small portable USB disks spin up in a couple of seconds, but larger and older 3.5" drives may take more than 5 seconds to wake up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a registry setting for this, please inform us !</p>

<p>Since the internal drive is SSD, I don't think a spindown timer will affect performance noticeably, since there is no spin-up delay. Correct assumption ?</p>

            I expect that the timer will have no effect on the ssd. &nbsp;Good to know that the timer does actually work on a usb hdd.

<p>Well actually it looks like I was somewhat optimistic: while apparently an external USB2 disk with separate power supply seems to have now a longer timeout, working with a USB3-powered external HDD still results in short-delay spindown despite 240 minutes
 timeout set in the advanced power settings for the current power plan.</p>
<p>I guess there is nothing much more to do to make this Surface 4 Pro a little more suitable for [basic] video-editing....</p>

<h3> just different  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to install XP on a virtual machine with only an upgrade disk&#63;</h2>
                    My original PC came with Windows ME....we purchased a Windows XP upgrade disk to upgrade the OS.&nbsp; We now have a new Vista 64 bit PC but I need&nbsp;XP to run an old application.&nbsp; Problem is, I only have an XP upgrade disk.&nbsp; The old PC has been recycled - hard
 drive died.<br />
<br />
How can I install XP on a virtual machine with only the upgrade disk?&nbsp; It seems ridiculous to have to purchase an entire XP OS (which I already owned).

<h2>            The sticker on which the Product Key is typed has been scratched, thus Product key got unreadble.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>My laptop came from the factory with a Windows 7 Home Premium reinstalled. However, I have given it to another person who reinstalled a Windows Xp SP3 on it, thus the Windows 7 got removed.
</p>
<p>I now want to reinstall the same version of Windows 7 Home Premium preinstalled previously. However, if I have reinstalled it from a generic editions non numeric, &nbsp;the&nbsp;sticker on which the Product Key is typed has been stretched, so I couldn't read the product
 key of the Windows 7 home Premium(OA) came preinstalled on the Laptop:</p>
<p>Toshiba,<br />
Satellite&nbsp; Pro L450-EZ1510<br />
Part No: PSLY1-01J010.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As a result, if I have reinstalled a Windows 7 Home Premium , how could I activate it?</p>
<p><br />

<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt
 the need to use the product key also.</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>If the neither options 1 or 2 is possible, then you need to invest in a new retail full version license.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot</p>
<p>I really when tried open the MiniTool Partition program, I found that there was a partition hidden and labeled with&nbsp;'RECOVERY'. I really let the partition unhidden, then the partition show in my computer. However, I still don't know if this is the the Factory&nbsp;Recovery
 partition or not because as it said before that the Windows 7 Home premium&nbsp;which was reinstalled by the factory. However,&nbsp;another person has&nbsp;installed a Windows XP. Thus, I am expecting that&nbsp;all partitions&nbsp;along with Factory Recovery Partitions&nbsp;must have been
 deleted via the installing Windows xp.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyway, when trying opening this Factory Recovery partition, I didn't see any executable file to be run. Thus, how can I restore from this partition if this is for&nbsp;Factory Recovery partition to let&nbsp;&nbsp;windows&nbsp;7 Home install again.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know&nbsp; I can boot to&nbsp;my HP Factory&nbsp;Recovery partition by pressing F11 while restarting, however, for the TOSHIBA I don't know how to do.</p>

<p><br />
Thank you so much indeed,</p>
<p>I really have pressed and hold during the power up, however, I have only seen a notification 'HDD Recovery' showed to me and then nothing else loaded. In the end, I have ended with loading the Windows 7 which is being&nbsp;installed.
</p>
<p>NOTE: Some person have installed a windows xp which removed the Windows 7 coming from the factory. However, as said, there was a HDD Recovery partiton is still there. Also, I myself have installed a Windows 7 which moved the windows xp without effecting
 the HDD Recovery partition.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What was showing to me while pressing and holding on '0' a notification in the bottom of the screen. Then the existing windows loads.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, I've tried doing this on another new Toshiba laptop which still have its factory Windows 7, but the same happened(only a notification, but there are no recovery environment appearing to me.)</p>
<p>I think I should press and hold 'Zero' along with something else.</p>

Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>But as said before I have tried this with a new Toshiba laptop&nbsp;with its default layout and no systems installed other than its original system&nbsp;coming from the factory.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, when if the HDD Recovery partition were corrupted, then the partition must have been&nbsp;reomved.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Besides, I notied that there are some files inside that HDD Recovery parittion when I&nbsp;opened it.
</p>
<p>I will send you the screen shot of the content of that HDD Recovery&nbsp;partition later.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>By the way, when you said beore and during the power up, you mean I must shut off my comuter, then I run it again. While it is powred up, I must press and hold '0'.?</p>

<p>Next, press '0' and while it is being held down, press the power button, ensuring that you are still holding the '0' key down. Continue to hold the '0' down until the machine&nbsp;boots into recovery options. If it doesn't, the recovery partition has been damaged..

Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>NOTE: I have done this on Toshiba laptop still having its own Factory layout and Windows 7&nbsp;system.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've really tried doing exactly what you have said, and then only a notification(a tip) saying 'HDD Recovery' in the bottom of the black screen showed to me, then I have ended with a screen titled with 'Winodws Boot Manger' and in its content 'choose a windows
 system to boot, and there is only a windows 7 system existed&nbsp;is listed, then I have chose it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If HDD Recovery&nbsp;partiton were corrupted, then the tip(HDD Recovery) wouldn't have shown to me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, when I have run the Mini Wizard Partition on that laptop, I found that a&nbsp; partition labled by 'DATA' in which HDD Recovery folder is existed. When I opened&nbsp;Data partition, &nbsp;I found that it contains&nbsp;HDD Recovery folder, which contains&nbsp;files and folders.&nbsp;A
 readme file containing this.</p>
<p><strong>EN<br />
TOSHIBA</strong></p>
<p><strong>HDD Recovery Folder</strong></p>
<p><strong>Warning!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not delete or modify these files and folders.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any modifications may damage the HDD Recovery system! </strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, the laptop's user was saving&nbsp;his own data on the&nbsp;same&nbsp;partition where HDD Recovery Folder is saved which maybe caused some problems for HDD Reovery folder. Because that laptop isn't mine, I&nbsp;couldn't have&nbsp;known if the partition containing HDD recovery
 folder&nbsp;was hidden or unhidden. It should have been hidden as long as it cotains&nbsp; important files and folders. Thus, the user wouldn't be able to save in it.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Anyway</strong>, I have run the program associated/packged with Toshiba named with 'Toshiba Recovery&nbsp;creater media'&nbsp;&nbsp;which I think &nbsp;is&nbsp; used to create a Recovery media(Recovery DVDS). When running it, it showed to me a windows in which I was asked
 to insert a two-DVD media.</p>
<p>Thus, should running this program be making a reovery DVDs to be used to restore the Toshiba laptop to its&nbsp;&nbsp; case in which it came from factory.</p>
<p>If so, then why&nbsp;can still&nbsp;I be creating&nbsp; Recovery DVDS if&nbsp;HDD&nbsp;Recovery partition&nbsp;got corrupted?</p>

<h2>            Japanese IME writes in qwerty instead of dvorak in windows 10 apps</h2>
                    <p>I use a Japanese IME to type in windows. I set the IME to type in dvorak instead of qwerty because that's what I prefer. After the update yesterday (october 10), when I type in the start search or any other windows 10 apps (Universal Windows Platform apps)
 like settings, calculator, photos, but not control panel or chrome, I type in qwerty instead of dvorak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that this is a software issue because it did work just fine before the update. I have a feeling that the problem is that the Layout File (in regedit) that UWP apps use is not the same as what everything else uses. If that is indeed the problem then
 please point me to where in regedit it is and I'll fix it. But if it isn't then I have no idea what's wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I set it back to dvorak?</p>

<h2>            How to disable password expiration reminder in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been getting notifications saying something like... Consider changing your password. Your password will expire in 5 days. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del.</p>
<p>Click change a password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had this before until Windows 10 updated to version 1809.&nbsp; I don't want to change my password. I tried Microsoft's virtual support agent which led to a couple of articles written in 2010 for Windows 7. The suggestions in those articles don't work
 for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't get a satisfactory response either after chatting with a Tech.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I did some searching after chatting to the tech <span>and this is what I found ...</span>...</p>
<p>Click on the Windows logo Start Button&gt;Settings&gt;System&gt;Notification &amp; actions</p>
<p>Scroll down to Get notifications from these apps, then scroll down to Windows log-on reminder.</p>
<p>You can turn this notification Off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone else.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one - wrong location</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>So I've got a Xbox one from the US and live in thailand, I've already migrated my xbox live account to thailand appropriately. When I go into the Movies app and try to watch anything that I've purchased, it says I can't do that, my console settings do not
 match my location. Alright, so off to the location settings and let's set it to thailand, well I can't there is no thailand in the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I do ?</p>

<p>Also, why can't the system tell me first that I'll not be able to watch anything I'm going to purchase, before I spend my money on it ?</p>

                </div>

<p>Thailand is not a supported country for the xbox one. So you would have to set your location to lets say the US to use it. Your movies dont show up because when you change regions on your account they do not migrate with you. Have a look at this link for
 info about region change <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-account/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../change-region</a></p>

<p>The movies do show up, they did before i migrated the xbox live account to thailand (it was US previously) and they do now after migrating it to Thailand, the Xbox itself is set to the US.</p>
<p>No matter how I switch it around, it won't work:</p>
<p>US account - US settings in console -&gt; doesn't work - you can't stream outside the country that your xbox live account is set to.</p>
<p>Thailand account - US settings in console -&gt; doesn't work, your xbox live location settings do not match the console settings - can't change console location settings, no thailand in the location settings selectable.</p>

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

    <title>Problem with System image backup feature in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> migamax  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with System image backup feature in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hi<br />
I have a PC that comes with Original Windows7 Ultimate installed in a WD Caviar Blue Drive 320GB<br />
<br />
so i bought an original windows8 pro installed it on a new WD Caviar Green 1TB and got the update and now it becomes 8.1 anyway<br />
<br />
i have a dual boot screen to let me choose between which OS i want to use<br />
<br />
the problem is regarding system Image Backup utility<br />
<br />
even it got hidden from the control panel as it used to be in windows8 and now it is deep inside a File History feature in Metro<br />
<br />
&nbsp;i don't know why Microsoft did that btw!!<br />
<br />
it selects both operating system the one with windows7 and the one with the current windows8.1
<br />
<br />
and i can't tick-out either because its grayed out<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c806d1b4-3e20-4171-aaaf-5da0896ebd62" /><br />
<br />
so i can't backup my windows8 without backing up windows 7 system as well which will cost me over 55 GB !!!
<br />
<br />
so in order to avoid that i figured i need to unplug the 320GB which has windows7 so that the program do a system image backup to windows8.1 only<br />
<br />
problem is if i unplugged the 320GB windows7 hard drive<br />
<br />
&nbsp;i can't boot with the other OS i get a black screen with the" Loading Operating System" msg and a blinking arrow and nothing happens:(<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i set windows8.1 as a default Os from the dual boot option menu unplugged the hard which has win7
<br />
<br />
but with no success of making it to boot directly into windows8.1 <br />
<br />
so i had to plug the win7 drive back to see the dual screen window<br />
<br />
i though maybe because i have so many partitions in my 1TB windows 8.1 HD that windows8 can't see the OS !!<br />
<br />
so i changed the drive letter making sure that the partition with windows8.1 comes first in alphabet letters before other partitions<br />
<br />
&nbsp;reboot again with the Win7 Drive unplugged but with the same Loading OS msg :(<br />
<br />
went to right click on "This PC" icon on desktop aka "My computer" selected manage from the menu went to disk management set windows8.1 Partition as Active again did the same with unplugging win7 HD same result :(<br />
<br />
so what should i do<br />
<br />
should i delete the Windows7 from the boot order when i type in Run the command "msconfig"<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0bcbb1a5-c02c-42d0-825f-20b15f8d04a5" /><br />
<br />
i can't go throw the hole process of formating and&nbsp; installing windows again with updates, driver updates, office 2013 hotfixes updates, Microsoft .netframework 3.5 and 4.5 updates&nbsp; and my programs because my internet connection is not Flat rate and it is a
 painful process<br />
<br />
Because i think what i did wrong is i didn't unplug the W7 HD first time i installed 8.1<br />
<br />

<p>I figured it out. &nbsp;Turn your 2 and 1 to portrait then rotate is clickable again. &nbsp;Somebody should fix this. &nbsp;Makes no sense at all. &nbsp;It sounds like a windows problem. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the same problem on my Surface Pro 3 but when I try the fix by changing to tablet mode so the grayed out option becomes available, turning off the locked screen does NOT change anything.&nbsp; It is still locked in landscape.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your Surface is designed to rotate the display automatically as you turn it so that what you see on the screen is always right side up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve your issue, kindly refer to this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-surface-touchscreen-rotation?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a> to troubleshoot Surface screen rotation.</p>

</p><p>Let us know if you have any other questions.</p>
<br />
<p>

<p>I also have this problem on my brand new HP Spectre 360. I guess if I can't get it fixed within a few days, I'll return it, and get a non-HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried and in tablet mode got the Rotation Locked switch changed easily, but only for that mode. I cannot see using my laptop in upside down tablet mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot understand why this and many others in my Goggle search don't work. I would think MS would consider this important to fix. Oh well.</p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be few reasons why the auto rotate on your toolbar and settings is greyed out. To help you resolve this concern, kindly answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes to your computer prior to getting this issue?
</li><li>Have you tried the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023475/surface-troubleshoot-surface-screen-rotation?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>link</em></a> provided by Robelene Win from Microsoft that was posted

<h2>            Event ID 20 - WHEA-Logger - AMD Northbridge</h2>
                    <p>Since resolving an issue with my ATI Video Driver recently, I have started getting the following errors, once a day, which cause my system to restart unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe this to be a driver issue, even though it looks like a hardware issue.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Rob L,
</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you get error Event ID 20 - WHEA-Logger on Windows 8 computer. I will help you with this
 issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1.</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the graphics driver and the chip set driver from the manufacturer’s
 website and check if that help.</span></p>
<p><span>You may download the drivers here:
<a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>Steps to update the driver.</span></p>
<p><span>1-Press
<b>Windows key + X</b> and select <b>
Device Manager</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>2-Right click
<b>graphics driver</b> and select <b>
update driver</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>3-Follow the on screen directions to complete and remember to restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause
 serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2.</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the update driver does not help, then you may uninstall the driver and then reinstall it to check
 if that helps. You may first download the required driver from the manufacturer website and save it before uninstalling the driver from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to uninstall the driver.</span></p>
<p><span>1-Press
<b>Windows key + X</b> and select <b>
Device Manager</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>2-Right click
<b>graphics driver</b> and select <b>
Uninstall</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>3-Follow the on screen directions to complete and remember to restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3.</span></b></p>
<p><span>To run the System File Checker you will need to open an elevated Command Prompt. This can be done
 by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Enter the Start screen</span>
</li><li><span>Press
<b>Windows key + C</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar. (If you are using a touch screen: touch the right edge of the screen and swipe your finger toward the center of the screen to show the Charms bar)</span>
</li><li><span>Click Search</span>
</li><li><span>Type
<b>Command Prompt</b> into the Search field</span>
</li><li><span>Right click
<b>Command Prompt</b> (If you are using a touch screen: Touch and hold your finger to the Command Prompt, slide your finger down until you see an outline around the tile, and finally release your finger from the screen.)</span>
</li><li><span>Click
<b>Run as administrator</b></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Enter the command:
<b>sfc /scannow</b><br />
Note: If you are using a touch screen you can open the touch keyboard for the Command Prompt by tapping the keyboard icon displayed on your Taskbar near the System tray.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Run a full computer scan with the Microsoft Safety Scanner to make sure that the computer is free
 from viruses.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></b><span>:

            Hi there,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The system file checker did find a problem "Repairing corrupted file [ml:60{30},l:58{29}]"\??\C:\WINDOWS\SysWOW64\en-US"\[l:46{23}]"windows.ui.xaml.dll.mui" from store"</div>
<div><br />
<div>It also noted many rows where it said</div>
<div>"[DIRSD OWNER WARNING] ...."</div>
<div>and also many where it said</div>
<div>"Ignoring duplicate ownership for directory "</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do these matter?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then rebooted and re-ran the file checker, and it has said there are no problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'll now have to wait and see if the problem happens again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>

            I've done method 1. &nbsp;No updated driver available.
<div><br />
<div>I've done method 2, it still crashed after I did this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've done method 3, it found problems, but then crashed and rebooted twice after that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've done method 4, all clear, never had a virus on any PC I've owned.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I'm on to method 5. &nbsp;I'm also going to try a beta driver of the next version of the AMD Catalyst driver, which sounds like it might help.</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STILL getting this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CLEAN install of Windows 8 onto a NEW SSD hard disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything working perfectly except for this fatal hardware error every couple of days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I DO NOT believe it is actually a hardware problem, because it never happened once with Windows 7 and that is just too remarkable a coincidence!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very deeply frustrating</p>

            I believe this is an overheating problem, although I don't understand why this has only started happening with Windows 8. &nbsp;I've fitted a fan to the top of the Northbridge heatsink and am hoping it won't happen again - fingers crossed!

            <p>I too have been having this problem, however I have been having it for AGES!&nbsp; I had it under windows 7 pro x64 and at first no problems under windows 8 pro x64.&nbsp; Then out of nowhere it crept back up.&nbsp; I had noticed in the past that my GPU would reach 100
 deg C then power down.&nbsp; I "reseated" the heatsink/fan on my GC and the problem went away.&nbsp; Now the card is crashing at 56 deg c.</p>

            Hello marcelt,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for your reply back!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;When are you being notified of Kernel32.dll?&nbsp; Are you getting any other error codes when you are notified?&nbsp; I know you advised you had no luck with a system restore,&nbsp; did you try to log in Safe Mode and perform a system restore?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Since you have Norton for your antivirus, disable the software and see if you are still getting an error message.&nbsp; Again I don't know when you are being notified of Kernel32.dll file, but I found a link with a user who had a similiar issue.&nbsp; Please let us
 know status.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

    <title>windows 8 desktop slideshow changes too often - even when set to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesnerd  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 8 desktop slideshow changes too often - even when set to &#34;1 day&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I've been googling and binging and can't seem to find an answer, nor anyone else having a problem with this. So maybe I'm special, lol.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 8 seems to operate the desktop slideshow quite differently to Windows 7.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I set my desktop background to change once per day. With Windows 7 it would change less than once per day - it seemed to change after about 24 hours of the PC being awake. And because my laptop is off or sleeping much of the time, that would end up being
 once every 3 days or so.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With Windows 8 on the same setting - 1 day between changes - it changes the background every time I wake up the computer. Since I'm moving around most days and my laptop goes from sleeping in my bag to being used in all sorts of places, that's a lot of changes.
 I'd like my desktop background to stick around for a while before surprising me with a new one. It's not like this is a huge performance drag, but cycling through them constantly is tiresome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The "pause slideshow when on battery" setting helps, but not enough - this is a 4-year-old laptop and plugged in most of the time anyway because the battery doesn't last long these days :)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Ideally, I want my desktop to change once per week, so if anyone has any tips on how to do this, point me to settings in the registry or whatever, I'd be very interested.</p>

            Hi James,
<div><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for the post on it. </div>
<div><br />
It looks that you would like to change the Desktop Wallpaper once a week. </div>
<div><br />
<div>I would like to inform you that this is by design. There is no option to change the Desktop wallpaper once a week. You can set it as one day or less than that.</div>
<div><br />
You can refer to the link given here for further assistance to change the wallpapers and pictures.

            <p>No, being able to change my desktop once a week is what I'd like ideally, but that's not my main problem.

<p>"This is by design" is a meaningless statement unless you offer some explanation for WHY it is designed this way. &nbsp;Your link is for basic use of the Windows 8 system and isn't helpful.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sorry, I rambled a bit in my OP, and my meaning wasn't clear.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My problem is: Windows 8 changes the desktop background more than once per day even when set to "1 day".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If it changed once per day that would be okay, but it changes every time I wake or start the computer, which can be 6 times or more in one day.</p>

            JamesNerd: I have the same issue, exactly as you described it for Windows 7 and now Windows 8. On Windows 7, it never seemed to shuffle, even when I had it configured as such. On Windows 8, it shuffles much more often than once per day. I guess that is
 what MS calls a "fix". So frustrating, this is why I hate MS products.&nbsp;

            My problem is the opposite. No matter what interval that I set, the image never changes. If I go to Personalize,
<u>and change nothing</u>, then go back&nbsp; to the desktop, the image changes. Then it is locked to that image.<br />

            I'm having a similar issue. Mine changes to often. I want to control the "Time Frame" set for how often the background image changes. Window only gives me the low options of 10 and 30 seconds. My eyes and I prefer closer to 20 seconds, maybe even 15. Where
 can I go to change that setting? Is it in the registry, an ini file, a temp file or somewhere else?

            It's been over a year since OP posted this, but has this been solved? I too have had a Windows 8 laptop for a year now and this problem comes and goes. I have it set to change every 30 minutes but it changes every few minutes and I don't know how to solve
 it.

            <p>It doesn't sound like anyone found a solution for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on WIndows 8.1 and this problem hasn't been fixed. I have my work PC set to change the wallpaper every 6 hours. If I reboot the computer on Friday at the end of the day and leave it sitting here all weekend, then when I log in on Monday morning, the
 wallpaper changes repeatedly at least 6 or 7 times over a few minutes. Then it usually slows down and changes every couple minutes for awhile. Then it seems to change randomly, but definitely more than once every 6 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like a really basic coding problem to fix, but obviously it's a broken feature that MS isn't interested in fixing.</p>

<h2>            When I insert my Windows 7 Professional disc I get this error&#58; &#34;This disc contains a &#34;UDF&#34; file system and requires an operating system that supports the ISO-13346 &#34;UDF&#34; file system specification.&#34;</h2>
                    I just bought the Microsoft Window 7 Professional 32-bit upgrade version. I put the CD in, it just gives me this message "This disc contains a "UDF" file system and requires an operating system that supports the ISO-13346 "UDF" file system specification."
 I am very disappointed and annoyed now as I never thought that uploading the programme can be this difficult. I am just wondering is this my laptop problem or the CD problem??<br />

            Thank you that worked. Chat did not give me the extra steps just had me put up a cc and once the charge went though it allowed me to give permissions but those other steps helped and took me off child account. Thank you

<p>When I went through the verification process recently the dropdown menu for the date of birth options was not working properly and grabbed on to a year (I don't even know which as I couldn't backtrack). Now skype thinks I am a child even though my correct
 info is held in my microsoft account. I am not a US citizen and don't have a credit card (why is this proof of adulthood?), nor do I want the hassle of sending a fax, just want access to skype, which used to be perfectly easy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried recovering my account and changed my password but that didn't solve the problem.

<p>The next time you run across the inability to input correct information, I suggest you try rebooting your computer, or trying another web browser (if the prompt is browser-based).&nbsp; That may be a hassle but it can avoid other hassles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I need to fax anything I simply use my scanner to scan required documents into an image format.&nbsp; From there I use one of the free online electronic fax services to convert the image into fax quality and have them send it on my behalf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to use the methods already mentioned then you can contact Microsoft support to try to regain access to your&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft&nbsp;account
</strong>as that is where the restrictions lie.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact us</a>&nbsp;- Ask the virtual agent for help. &nbsp;If that virtual agent cannot help, an option will exist to communicate with Microsoft support to address concerns
 with your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that issue is resolved you should be able to sign into Skype.</p>

<p>Often how long does it take for a response using a fax? I sent one in a couple days ago with no response, and I am wonder approximately how long before I get a response. Thanks!</p>
