            <p>Not sure necessarily if the command itself will fix the issue for you, but I wanted to respond in at least a "Maybe tweaking the powershell syntax will get&nbsp;the command&nbsp;to work" to see if it helps. The error from running the command is showing it's trying
 to find the App manifest file directly on C:\, instead of wherever the InstallLocation property spits back. One thing I'd also recommend is run the command directly from Powershell instead of the command prompt&nbsp;</p>
<p>since this will help prevent weird things from cmd trying to pass the commands to powershell. When I tried on my test machine I was able to run all the following variations of the command:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58462014-508f-4bbd-9569-5187c9b1a037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58462014-508f-4bbd-9569-5187c9b1a037" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The first command is essentially the one you were trying, but being run from powershell directly. The second is me just manually getting the InstallLocation. Then the third and fourth are manually telling powershell where the manifest file is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again not sure if this will help the overall issue, but should help get the powershell command aspect to work to try and re-add the Windows Store for you.</p>

    <title>option on xbox one to play games with no disc in drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            option on xbox one to play games with no disc in drive</h2>
                    
<p>After hearing microsoft have removed DRM and Internet Check every 24hrs. I was wondering if you are connected to the internet constantly you can play games without the disc in the drive. I was looking forward to swapping games without switching discs. Does
 any1 think this is possible. Obviously i understand you would need the disc in the drive if you was not connected to the net. I think microsoft should have a look into this because that no disc in drive was a good idea.</p>

<p>That's what the 24hr check in was all about... It was checking to see what games you've installed. It doesn't do that now, so the DISC has to be kept in while the console checks instead.</p>

<p>lets be realistic here how often do you turn on your xbox and are offline . i would guess never</p>
<p>the 24 hr check in was to confirm you still had your license for that game &nbsp;.like i said if people were worried that if the internet goes down for 24 hrs they cant play all they need to do is put the disc in &nbsp;problem solved.</p>
<p>now regarding trade ins participating retailers would have been everyone &nbsp;no retailer including mom and pop shops would be stupid enough not to opt in . oh but its up to developers you say &nbsp;well guess what &nbsp;they would have done the same thing on all consoles
 not just not allow it on xbox&nbsp;</p>

<p>It would have been nice to not have the disc in the drive to play disc based games but seeing how the disc is only being read for like a minute and then stops after the console confirms that its installed on your hdd is not a big deal.

<p>I have had my xbox connected to the internet from the day i got it and that was on launch day i dont think i have ever unplugged it from the internet apart from when i moved house, and i bet in all those years my internet has been down for a total of 5 days.
 The main reason i started this post was because i had my pad plug in on charge while playing grid 2 and my misses tripped on the pad dragging the 360 of its shelf leaving a deep scratch on the disc making it unplayable. So if MS could check you console every
 24hrs i would not need my disc in the drive to play it and not end up with a waste of disc. It just seems like they could still do the online check im not bothered about leaving my console plugged into the net, and i bet 90% of live users never unplug there
 consoles so i dont get why every1 kicked off about that part in the 1st place. I can understand why ppl where concerned about trading games in cos there is nothing worse then buying a game thats rubbish or you dont like and not bein able get rid.</p>

<p>The 24 hour check in treated every paying customer as a thief having them verify their innocence ever day by verifying the encryption keys to the discs you own...checking once the disc is in the tray simply wasn't enough for this DRM, it needed to make sure
 you didn't even let anyone else play the disc. This is too extreme. The DRM had nothing to do with the ability to play the game without the disc after a one time install...the check may have had something to do with it, but that can still be done on digitally
 purchased media. Quite simply the DRM treated the physical disc like a digital download with the same restrictions and that should not be accepted.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If Ms want to go to an all digital future, they should have gone full steam ahead with a digital console and not tried to drag the money that 46% of it's customer base provided (46% is the percentage of 360 sold that never connected to the internet). Don't
 let MS persuade you into thinking that family share couldn't be accomplished without manipulating the DRM for physical discs..they can still provide the service to the paying live gold customer...while I agree the 24 hour check in wouldn't have effected many
 gold members, it's wrong all the same. It's selfish not to see it other wise...you know "it doesn't effect me so I don't care and neither should you". Wrong is wrong</p>

                    I'm trying to transfer settings from W7 64bit to W8&nbsp;64bit&nbsp;on my laptop but without any success.
<div>It refuses to do this as it says the installations have different languages - rubbish!</div>
<div>Both are English (UK).</div>
<div>I had the same problem with my desktop upgrade but gave up and had to set them all up manually.</div>
<div>I had the foresight to do this on a new disk so can still run up W7 and make changes if necessary.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What should I do to 7 &amp;/or 8 to make them use the same language &amp; do this transfer?</div>

            W8 setup as English (UK) everywhere!
<div>On the W7 installed and currently Eng UK too.</div>
<div>If, at any time in the past, I had additional keyboards/languages installed would this affect it?</div>
<div>Is Eng (US) the same language as Eng (UK) for easy transfer of settings?</div>

            <p>​Hi,<br />
<br />
You may set the language on both win 7 and 8 to default/recommended. If any language packs installed temporarily uninstall it and check.<br />
<br />
This seems to be a registry entry missing in Windows 7 that is probably required by Windows 8 Easy Transfer.<br />
<br />
a. Under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\MUI\Settings in Windows 8.<br />
b. There is a value PreferredUILanguages of type REG_MULTI_SZ. Create this value in Windows 7 using the Windows 8 value as a template (make sure the language is actually the same!)<br />
<br />
<span>Note: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if
 you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back
 up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base. How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></p>

<h2>            Digitally purchased games won&#8217;t launch </h2>
                    <p>I’ve bought several games on the Microsoft store and they have taken me ages to download since my internet connection is not the best. They finally finished yet give issues and either won’t start or freeze immediately. The games are diablo 3, Skyrim special edition, mortal kombat xl,&nbsp;human fall flat and hello neighbor. They keep giving error codes such as taking too long to start or being corrupted. I have tried power cycling, restarting, deleting local saves and checking my internet connectivity. I even removed my account and signed in again. If it makes a difference, these games are all stored on an external hard drive. Please can anyone help me with this issue as it is more than a little frustrating considering the time and money put into it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Limited Touch Support &#33;</h2>
                    In system properties, under system category I see this "Pen and Touch : no pen or touch input is available for this display" while my laptop was running Windows 7. The last week, I upgrade to Windows 8. (Upgraded with clean installation method) In PC Info,
 I notice the change like this "Pen and Touch : Limited Touch Support with 5 Touch Points". I don't understand what happened to my display. My laptop model is Acer Aspire V5-471G.<br />
<br />
Sorry for bad English :)<br />

            <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Touchscreens support a feature called multi-touch, the ability to recognize the presence of more two or more points of contact with the touchscreen surface. For example, you can use two fingers at the same time to perform
 a specific tasks like pinch/stretch. Some touchscreens allow two touch points whereas others allow multiple touch points.
</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>The surface RT has a multi-touch screen, which can recognize multiple touch points. So this might be displayed as “Full touch support” whereas your laptop might be displayed as “Limited touch support with two/three touch

<p>Getting it. Adding some stockpiled Bing rewards codes tonight, downloading it &amp; playing as soon as I get the kids off to school. (gotta love being off on Wednesdays!) Loved TMNT Arcarde &amp; Turtles in Time growing up, this is supposed to play very much like
 those with some new additions. I'll have my game open if anyone wants to jump in. Annoyed that the ONLY title I was interested in at all was the last one released.

<p>This is a no brainier, it looks the best out of the 5 games on the SoA, plus even though Im not a hardcore TMNT fan I still love the turtles. Maybe we can relive the days of the old Arcade game or the NES/SNES versions again.</p>

    <title>Cumulative Updates for Win 10 - x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steeboo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cumulative Updates for Win 10 - x64</h2>
                    <p>I think that MS needs to take a good look at it's update system for Win 10</p>
<p>and start again</p>
<p>I am trying to locate a cumulative update for Win 10 x64</p>
<p>ie KB3135174</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start with - WSUS is only for servers</p>
<p>So try - googling "standalone installer for windows 10 x64 updates"</p>
<p>I don't believe it - MS has removed this from the web - what a bl@@dy stupid thing to do ...</p>
The site was a godsend to many - and now its gone !
<p>
</p><p>Why on earth - remove the only way that some PC's can get updates ?</p>
<p>http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Thanks.aspx?id=140 - Tells me that my version of IE (11) IS INCOMPATIBLE with the program - demanding version 6 or greater !!!!!</p>
<p>Which leads me to believe that MS is either STUPID or Awkward (which is it ??)</p>
<br />
I may as well forget Windows and return to Linux...

    <title>Update breaking internet March 2017 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jameskchambers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update breaking internet March 2017</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys so every-time windows downloads these updates it's basically preventing me from accessing internet services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The icon on the lower right shows I am connected but trying to access webpages or the steam store page results in a time out as if it cannot see the connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since reinstalled the operating system (windows 10 pro) twice which resulted in the internet working again but then as soon as the updates are applied i am right back to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since uninstalled the updates once I knew it was that which was causing the issues and now prevented windows from updating automatically, but this isn't really an ideal situation. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Offending Updates in question are:</p>
<p>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB4013429)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Security Update for Adobe Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1607 (for x64-based Systems) (KB4014329)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool for Windows 8, 8.1, 10 and Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2, 2016 x64 Edition - March 2017 (KB890830)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are any of these known to cause problems?</p>
<p />

<p>Answer-by-number:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did&nbsp;you do a clean install of Win10,&nbsp;or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!]&nbsp;to Win10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When was the last time you "reinstalled the operating system" and how did you do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Have you ever run the <strong>Norton Removal Tool</strong> and/or the <strong>
McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. What OS Build of Windows 10 Version 1607&nbsp;is currently installed? </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press &amp; hold the <strong>Windows Key</strong> and press the<strong>&nbsp;R </strong>
key.&nbsp;In the&nbsp;RUN dialog, type&nbsp;<strong>WINVER</strong> and press the&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong> key.</li></ul>

            <p>Thanks for replying&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I originally bought Window 8.1 and upgraded to Windows 10 last year when they where running the upgrade program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The computer wasn't pre built, but the mother board is a MSI Z170A Gaming M5 if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Reinstalled yesterday evening using a USB pendrive, the pendrive was formatted with the Windows 10 download tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have the pendrive with the copy of Windows 8.1 I originally bought and downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. No antivirus installed, just windows defender running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. No, never run any norton or McAfee software on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Windows 10 Version 1607 (OS Build 14393.0)</p>

            <p>Yeah that's what I did yesterday evening, the problem was gone after the fresh install but after a while windows downloaded the updates in the background, and when i would restart it would apply the updates and no more internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the updates, restart, internet is back to working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's strange because Windows can see that the connection is there, the icon on the lower right shows no sign of error or limited availability, it looks like its connected but i can no longer browse webpages or access dropbox, googledrive etc.</p>

            <p>1. When (approx. date) did you install Win8.1 on the custom-built (I assume)&nbsp;computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Was the initial upgrade from Win8.1 to Win10 offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you choose to upgrade manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Were updates "breaking the internet" immediately after the initial upgrade to Win10 or did that start later (i.e., before the first "reinstall")?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. When (approx. date) was the&nbsp;first time you "reinstalled the operating system" and how did you do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. You have digital entitlement to Win10. Have you considered formatting the HDD and then doing a literal clean install of Win10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. How does the computer-in-question connect to the internet (e.g., ADSL/cable broadband; dial-up; Wi-Maxx; mobile wireless)?</p>

            <p><strong>PA Bear</strong> - Winver 14393.0 doesn't make sense as a version in the 1607 release stream. However, where I am we are troubleshooting problems with KB4013429, which has already been superseded *twice*&nbsp;by Microsoft in less than a week. I'm not
 too terribly surprised that James is seeing problems, though loss of internet browsing access strikes me as odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>JamesKChambers: </strong>Try this, just to see if Microsoft actually fixed your glitch in their latest patch. Go to the Windows Update Catalog, and install Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB4016635) or</p>
<p>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 (KB4016635) depending on whether you are 64-bit or 32-bit respectively. With a gaming motherboard you're likely 64-bit Windows but you never know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worse case scenario if that doesn't fix your problem, manually update yourself to the OS update prior to that version (which is KB 3216755) and turn off automatic updating for a little while.</p>

<p>1. Installed Windows 8.1 around May last year I think</p>
<p>2. I think the upgrade was offered via an update.</p>
<p>3. No, internet has been fine, up until maybe a few weeks ago where the connection would sometimes show an error, unplugging and reconnecting the Ethernet cable solved this.</p>
<p>4. First time I reinstalled was probably Sunday 19th March.</p>
<p>5. Haven't considered this option would this &nbsp;make any difference?</p>
<p>6. Connected via Ethernet which is running from a powerline adapter.</p>

    <title>can&#39;t select custom profile picture. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            can&#39;t select custom profile picture.</h2>
                    So I'm having trouble, uploading a custom profile picture on Xbox (Windows 10 App). Whenever I try to upload a custom avatar, it says, that I'm not old enough or something like "custom avatars are for adult accounts only" (Might be a different message
 in English, but that's the German one translated). This doesn't really make sense to me, since I'm well beyond 18 years of age and it even says I'm an adult in my Microsoft family. I really don't know what to do right now, as there's also no option to check,
 whether my Xbox account also has the right age.&nbsp;

</p><p>Have you given it a try on the Xbox App for mobile?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest going over your Xbox Live privacy settings to see what the account is set to. If you put your real age when you created your account then it should be set to adult defaults and should let you set a custom picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your privacy settings on your console or on Xbox.com and make sure you can customize your account to allow everything. If it doesn't let you or asks for an adult account to sign in, then the account is still listed as a child account based on the age

<p>I've set everything to Allow / Everyone but it still doesn't allow me to change the profile picture. I might've accidentally chosen a wrong birth date when I created my account. I'm actually pretty sure, that that's the problem, since I couldn't even access
 my Privacy policy settings. (I fixed this, by having a friend invite me to his Microsoft family, so he could set everything to Allow / Everyone in the Privacy and Online Safety tab of my account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried changing it on the mobile App, but I'm getting the exact same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure, my Xbox account has a wrong birth date / age and that's why I can't change anything on my account. Is it possible to change this information or make my account an adult account somehow?</p>

<p>Well, I'm not going to send in a picture of my ID just to be able to set a custom profile picture. This is just plain
<span><strong>[Mod Removed – Profanity]</strong></span>. When creating an account, it doesn't ask you for your ID either, so I don't quite understand, why I should send such sensible information
 to a big company, where I don't know what's going to happen with it. Also why is it possible to change the age on the Microsoft website, but not on the Xbox Website? Because I said I didn't know if I've accidentally entered a wrong birth date when I created
 my Microsoft account, I went on the Microsoft page, where I could see my birth date and it seems to be correct there. So why does my Xbox account have a wrong birth date then?</p>

<p>Hiya Mtg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Forum support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason they ask for an ID is to confirm the age, since anyone can just create an account. So if the account was created with the wrong information and want it to be corrected, then you would need to send in proof to verify and validate&nbsp;your age.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a Microsoft account is created you have the chance to change the account age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although, once an Xbox account is created (with the age set up on the Microsoft account) it will then lock the age into the Profile and will not be suitable for change unless the process is completed.

<p>I still don't understand, why you can change your birth date on the Microsoft account, but on the Xbox account it's forbidden. Anyhow, I think I should be allowed to change the birth date without having to send in a picture of my ID, like this is some sort
 of important security step. After all, it only changes, whether I can change my profile pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Link doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm definitely not going to send in a picture of my ID, as I don't trust Microsoft and I'm not going to take the risk of getting my Identity stolen, just so I can change my profile picture.</p>

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the time is always resetting when you reboot the computer, then either the BIOS time is incorrect or the CMOS battery is dead. Accessing the BIOS can be done when system is first turned on. The time is usually on the general settings area. If it does
 not hold after restarting, then this indicates that the CMOS battery is dead. If that's the case, you need to replace it. We suggest contacting a technician in replacing the battery.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other concerns, let us know. </p>

<p>There is a small shiny coin cell battery in your computer.&nbsp; It is almost always the standard 2032 .&nbsp; This battery is recharged by your computer but has a life of about 5 to 8 years.&nbsp; This battery keeps constant power to the memory that contains today’s date
 &amp; time as well as a lot of the features in your system.&nbsp; When it starts to fail, it commonly will start asking you to re-enter the date each time you startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Notebook PCs it is likely going to be difficult to find the battery and will require a special part, requiring the services of a technician.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Desktop computers, this is an easy change:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Unplug the power to your computer</li><li>Hold the ON button in for 7 seconds</li><li>Lay the computer on its side with the side where the wires are, down</li><li>Remove the side panel</li><li>Peer in there and you will see a shiny silver battery about 1/2″ in diameter.&nbsp; It looks like a quarter. &nbsp;That’s the battery</li><li>Go to just about any store and buy a 2032 coin cell battery.&nbsp; They cost less than $5</li><li>Find a very tiny flat bladed screw driver (like one used for your eyeglasses)</li><li>Very carefully pry the battery loose.&nbsp; It will pop up so be prepared to catch it.</li><li>Press the new battery in with the embossed markings on the up-side facing you.</li><li>Close the side panel</li><li>Turn it up vertical again</li><li>Start up the computer</li></ol>
<p>Your computer&nbsp;will now need to have the date and time set but only once more — at least for this 5 years.&nbsp; You need to enter the BIOS, which you do by pressing F2 &nbsp;immediately on startup&nbsp;&nbsp;in most systems to get to the place where the date and time is stored.&nbsp;
 Put in current time and date.&nbsp; Close this the way it tells you to save what you did.&nbsp; You may hear more whirring and chugging while some of the stuff is again set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once Windows is up and running again</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click once on the time/date in the bottom right corner</li><li>Click on Change date and time settings</li><li>Click Internet time</li><li>Click change settings</li><li>Select time.b.nist.gov and click the Update button — this will synchronize the computer clock with the US govt time labs system</li><li>Close</li></ol>

            <p>It sounds like your keybaord ahs been switched to the UK layout.&nbsp; This can happen if you accidnetally pressed a particualr combination of keys that has been set up as the means of doing that switch deliberately.&nbsp; Here's what to do:-</p>
<p>1 Go to <i>Control panel</i>, <i>Region &amp; language</i>, <i>Keyboards &amp; languages</i>,
<i>Change keyboards</i>, <i>General</i> tab, select the correct keyboard for your region* if is not the one already shown [click on
<i>Properties...</i>to see a preview of the keyboard layout] or click on <i>Add</i>... &amp; select a new keyboard from the list [whilst you are in the list, click on the
<i>Preview</i> button to see a preview]. When you've finished adding a new keyboard, move it to the top of the list using the buttons in the dialog box.</p>
<p>[*
<i>The region for which the keyboard was made and for which its layout has been set.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I understand that there is a "US International keyboard" that suffers from this confusing change quite easily so, unless you have some particular need for its special versatility, choose a specific US keyboard layout instead if you find
 that this was what was set up on your system</i>]</p>
<p>2 Afterwards, go to <i>Control panel</i>,
<i>Region &amp; language</i>, <i>Keyboards &amp; languages</i>, <i>Change keyboards</i>, <i>
Language bar </i>tab and, if you don't routinely need to change language settings, make the language bar hidden.</p>
<p>3 Then, go to <i>Control panel</i>, <i>Region &amp; language</i>, <i>Keyboards &amp; languages</i>,
<i>Change keyboards</i>, <i>Advanced key settings </i>tab where you will see the shortcut key sequence that might have got you into this problem by accident. You'll also see the
<i>Change key sequence </i>that you might wish to alter by clicking on the <i>Change key sequence
</i>button and setting <i>Switch input language </i>&amp; <i>Switch keyboard layout </i>
to <i>Not assigned</i> [when I changed these, I had to set <i>Not assigned </i>for the
<i>Switch input language </i>and accept the change then come back to the dialog to set
<i>Not assigned </i>for the <i>Switch keyboard layout</i>].</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Mail app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and see if the issue is resolved now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

Please tell us what "unable to restart" means. How did you try? What happened when you tried? If you got an error message, please quote it verbatim.</p>

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, it looks like recent OS upgrades are causing issues, sometimese severe. So please try the below:
<br />
<br />1) PERFORM A SYSTEM RESTORE OR A STARTUP REPAIR
<br />
<br />a) Power on and off your computer three times. On the third time, your computer will boot into WinRE
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />b) In Windows 10, select Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; recovery &gt; Recovery &gt; under Advanced Startup, click Restart now.
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />c) Boot to recovery media.
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />d) You can configure a hardware recovery button (or button combination) to run a secondary boot path that includes WinRE. - <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/dn898475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/dn898475</a>(v=vs.94)
<br />
<br />THEN
<br />
<br />Follow the instructions below under "System Restore" or, if unable, under "Startup Repair":
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/advanced-startup-options-2625805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/advanced-startup-optio...</a>
<br />
<br />2) GO BACK TO PREVIOUS WINDOWS VERSION
<br />
<br />If less than 10 days are elapsed from your upgrade, you can try the below under "Go back to your previous version of Windows"
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />3) If none of the above works, proceed with a clean install:
<br />
<br />DOWNLOAD OFFICIAL WINDOWS ISO FILES
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />PERFORM A CLEAN INSTALL
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224342/how-to-clean-install-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224342/how-to-clean-i...</a>
<br />
<br />If there are files on the drive you want to recover, see:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped somehow.

<h3> spuser80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Harassed for 2 Months over Laptop Replacement</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro 4 was having issues and a repair order was generated in July. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue 1 :</strong>My horror story started then. Warranty details were incorrectly updated that too when I had followed up in 2016. I had to email multiple times to get that corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Issue 2:</strong> Fedex refused to pick up device as documentation was not complete. We offered we can fill the information yet they did not accept. Only after 1 week long follow up they agreed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Issue 3: When they agreed, Microsoft cancelled repair order that too after the device was shipped.&nbsp; NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN WHY IT WAS CANCELLED.????</strong><br />
Now Fedex said they will not deliver unless the new request is raised by MS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Result I had to email MS and call them. Another week lost. Only after posting on Facebook and Community things moved.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Issue 4: My unit was </strong><span><span><strong>delivered</strong></span></span><strong>&nbsp;on 8th August and till date no update on delivery.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">Believe me, if only the process and policy permits it, we will not hesitate to process an Advance Exchange and send you a brand new unit. As much as possible what we're aiming for is to give you a great customer service experience
 but there things that are already beyond our control just like what happened during the pickup process and the Advance Exchange currently not being offered in India and finally a brand new replacement. These are a few examples of scenarios that even us can't
 change or override.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">I know it's been a long and stressful process, I wish there is something I could do to turn the entire experience into a positive one.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I sent my surface pro 2017 in for power failure issues close to a month back and was initially told that I should get it back in 5-8 business days.

 never called back, and now it’s ‘sorry we only just started looking into it, you’ll need to wait for us to get back to you, say 2-3 business days!’).

</p><p>I bought the surface pro because it was marketed as reliable with excellent support, and also because I loved microsoft. Now, I’m not so sure. I was left scrambling for an urgent replacement to sit a major online exam, and now praying for a free spot on

<p>
</p><p>Come Monday (the end of their ‘2-3 business days’ justification), I’ll be entering the 5th week of my 12 weeks semester WITHOUT my surface - something I bought purely for uni - how very ironic.

<p>They are so unprofessional, it has been over 1 month and its under commercial warranty. If they do this to BUSINESS USERS, what happens to normal users.&nbsp; What if they do not pay you? Also, how fair is this to make likes of US suffer
 because they do not have refurbished units. Apple is awesome in such cases. Had my MB replaced in 2 days while time given was 1 week. Never again MICROSOFT PRODUCT in my life except for Windows. Was planning One X now will rather buy Sony PS. SHAME ON MICROSOFT.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What is awful is we have written to TOP US Leadership and all are quiet. NOT A SINGLE RESPONSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I finally got a laptop today. PATHETIC UNTIDY UNIT WITH MARKS ON BACK. SLIGHT ONE BUT UNTIDY ONE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, warranty details are again updated to end in 2018. Instead of 2019. Again someone messed up with it. I had it corrected to 2019 in 2016 and again in July 2018. It is back to incorrect one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ITS A SHAME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No evidence of laptop replacement provided either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER BUY A LAPTOP&gt;</p>

<p>I feel for you, mate! Yup, I’m the ‘home’ user you are talking about :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose following from your experience, the problem doesn’t necessarily stop when they finally send out a replacement, because you’d hope they don’t send you a brick!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally had a break through with support got in contact with the ‘global escalation team’ and the best they could do was to ‘expedite my shipment’. Pending the 2-3 business days approval, and 5-8 days shipment -this is the best they could do.
</p>
<p>Seriously?!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just saying, if I promised to pay Microsoft after receiving the device but ending up taking my own sweet time to repay them (and giving silly excuses each time) they wouldn’t be sitting so comfortably on their chairs anymore!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hardly used it for 30 min and feels like a junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not just that they have changed warranty ending date to 11/18 from 11/19. This is 4th time they have done so. They now asking for warranty papers 5th time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add to it not a single paper showing it is a replacement unit was sent by MS. What else will they do to harass me??</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">I have written to TOP Leadership including SATYAN, no one is bothered.
<strong>No wonder it has become an Indian Brand where no one bothers about consumers.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>They are so ignorant they are emailing me that status is still WIP while laptop was delivered to me. THEY ARE NOT EVEN CONNECTED INTERNALLY.</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems MS takes pleasure in harassing consumer specially those who happen to be outside US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider these 4 pointS. WOULD APPRECIATE POINT WISE RESPONSE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Laptop got delivered at home today. A Pathetic looking laptop with marks on back.&nbsp;<br />
WHO SENDS A LAPTOP IN SUCH MESS? Untidy and unclean unit.</p>
<p>2. No Documentation provided or appended to box.How will I prove it got replaced? Where is letter of replacement?</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Shocking warranty is back to 2018 from 2019. NOW WHO CHANGED IT??? Is it my part time job to chase MS to change warranty period every month? PDF file is old version. Screen shot 2018-XX is new as on 21st August.</strong></p>

<p>Mate, sounds like you are in a bit of a strife. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was lucky that I bought it off a local retailer and had protections under Australian Consumer Law.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I brought my empty box in with a pre-filled compensation form and told the retailer I was happy to negotiate, but I didn't have too much wiggle room left because Microsoft has screwed me over royally, that I needed a resolution that morning or I will be
 forced to sue, and I am happy for them to join Microsoft to the suit. They gave me a new replacement on the spot, and the Store Manager (this is a massive store, mind you. so that guy has a lot of managerial seniority behind him) went to the back and took
 Microsoft to task.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Here's the context:</span></p>
<p>I had an exam on Thursday afternoon and I kept stressing to the team a week prior that I needed<em><strong>to know
</strong></em>- not 'to have received' - but just to know whether they will be able to get my replacement delivered by Wednesday, of if I should take pre-emptive action and source a replacement separately. I was given all the 2-3 business days disclaimers strongly
 hinted with 'I don't actually know what is happening tone'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I got onto one of their overly enthusiastic support staff, Davin E, who suckered me into believing him that, in words that are not verbatim but to the effect of 'trust me, I have been through what you are currently experiencing, but you have my
 assurance that I have a solution that could work and a few alternatives just in case. Whichever the case, I need a bit of time, but I am very optimistic that you will be able to receive my replacement by the Wednesday.'
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Wednesday came and I still didn't have an update on what on earth was happening. I contacted Microsoft again and Davin E again said he had the solution. I stressed that I needed a response before the shops close so that I can dart in to buy a replacement
 for my exams tomorrow (and also to prepare for it the night before). He begged for a final time extension and I gave him 15 minutes before the store closes. He rang late and stored for time again, assuring me that he had the solution, that I should give be
 patient. Turns out, his 'brilliant solution' was to refresh the system on his end for a status update. And because he persisted that I waited for him, I was no longer able to contact the store to secure a device, leaving me without a computer and no chance
 to get one the day before my exam. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure at some level, I was foolish to have left myself with little time to react, but I cannot stress enough how the only reason why I left so late was because (1) of the misrepresentations by their support team and (2) I tried to be nice and kept cutting
 Microsoft some slack each time they asked for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Conclusion:</span></p>
<p>If you want something done, you best find a way to the top - the 'support team' they have know nothing, and can do nothing except to wait. Also, don't be afraid to take Microsoft to task - through the courts if you have to - because, sadly&nbsp; (from my point
 of view in Australia, at least), that is the <strong><em>only </em></strong>way you can get through to someone else other than their 'support' teams, who from my experience can achieve very little.</p>
<p>For me, I was lucky to have the law on my side. I hope it is the same for you as well.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<h2>            GoPro Apps on Windows 10 Spectre x360</h2>
                    I own a Spectre x360 with Windows 10. I downloaded both the GoPro apps, "Quik" and "GoPro Studio." When I open these apps everything is fine and I can download my GoPro content, however, when I try to edit the videos or pictures, the apps crash. My computer
 meets all the app requirements listed on the GoPro website.&nbsp;

<h2>            lost partitions and Disk Management errors</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I reimaged an older laptop that has a 500GB drive. As part of the process, I partitioned the drive into three&nbsp;volumes: a drive T: and V: each with&nbsp;100GB and C: got the balance. A day or so later, I noticed T: and V: mysteriously disappeared. Fortunately, I
 hadn't put anything in them yet, so there was no data loss. However, it seems that I've lost access to the disk space. Disk Management presents me with this:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fw3-connections.ibm.com%2fforums%2fajax%2fdownload%3fnodeId%3da0e303d6-7646-471f-9b66-0d4610bf514d" height="283" width="600" /></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<br />
All traces of T: and V: are gone. The C: volume shows 226GB (of which&nbsp;148GB is free)... which is about what I think it had after I had partitioned the drive. But then below, the entry for Disk 0 shows C: is allocated 465GB... it's unclear where the 35GB balance
 went.&nbsp;If I try to shrink the volume,&nbsp;it presents me with the total size 476938MB and&nbsp;available shrink space 151834MB. If I try to shrink by even 1MB, it fails with error "Virtual Disk Manager: The parameter is incorrect."</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Now that I'm in this state, is there any way to recover without starting over from scratch?</span></p>

    <title>Driver Power State Failure - Is there an issue with the battery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riesay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver Power State Failure - Is there an issue with the battery perhaps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop suddenly went off with the above message and did a restart on its own. Now this is not the first time, and has&nbsp;happened once before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surprisingly, this is only the first month of my usage of this laptop and Windows 10, so I am still getting used to it. But, there has been a parallel issue of the battery losing its charge pretty fast and not getting charged as fast as it initially did.
 The power runs out pretty fast and wont go up no matter how many hours I put it on charge. So I have been suspecting my charger in the beginning, but since the charger works well with other devices, I ended up suspecting that the problem might be with the
 battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an absolute novice, so please guide me if something is seriously wrong with my laptop. If possible, I would like to get it repaired on time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Same problem here. Spotlight is not available in the current insider version. But it is available on two other pcs which I upgraded the normal way. Perhaps its just disabled in the Pro Version? Because my other pcs have Win 10 Home.

            I think you definitely hit on something. My Windows 10 Home computers have the option,&nbsp; but my Pro editions do not.&nbsp; Would love a way to turn it on for my pro ones.&nbsp; Probably some registry setting, just wish I knew where.

<h2>            Facebook App for Windows 8&#47;8.1 Not working since update</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? Since upgrading to Windows 8.1 my Facebook Metro app does not work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be more specific all I get is a blank news feed screen, no friends list and no profile picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen other comments on here but none of the posted answers actually work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the App diagnostics, I've followed the App trouble shooter, I've uninstalled, rebooted and reinstalled. All with the same results - blank news feed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the support page on Microsoft but after the 'scan' it tells me my warranty is out of date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Barry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description I understand that you are not able to use Facebook app after installing updates. This problem occurs when some files in the update are missing, even though the update is downloaded and extracted successfully. Please do not worry I
 will try my best to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are able use other apps successful?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Are you able to install all the updates successfully? Is there any update pending or failed to install?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the link: </span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How will I know what updates have been installed -
<span>
Windows Update</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Perform <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System File Check</a></strong> to fix the corrupted system files and then check if this fixes the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Check the Firewall settings and check if it helps.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check the Firewall settings “<strong>Allow an app to receive info through the firewall</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, most apps are blocked by Windows Firewall to help make your computer more secure. To work properly, some apps might require you to allow them to receive info through the firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the link:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Allow an app to receive info through the firewall - Windows Firewall from start to finish
</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 3</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform a <strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting’.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues<span>, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

<h3> rexsunmar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Not Recognizing my Internet&#39;s Security Network Key</h2>
                    <p>I just took advantage of the upgrade to Windows 10, and it was working fine, except for one major thing: I can't get into my secure network, just an open/public network. I see the secure network I want and can call it up just fine, but when I put in my username
 and password, it just says "Can't connect to network" and gives up. I've tried troubleshooting the thing but it doesn't really work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10, on my Lenovo Yoga, which is a couple years old. I can work on the private network, but it's a lot less secure, and I'd really prefer to be on the private one. I am in college and work off of the internet for research
 purposes, so getting an answer ASAP would be helpful.</p>

<strong>OK. </strong>Close the Window, come back and try to re-enable it. Now check if the issue still appears.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d). If it doesn't fix the issue, then Right click on the same driver and select “<strong>Uninstall</strong>” then restart the system
 and let the system install the driver automatically on Start. Check and see if it resolve the issue. (<strong>Recommended step</strong>).</span></p>

            <p>Yes, I tried restarting my computer when the issue first occurred - didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Method 1 and got the same result as always - putting in my username/password, it didn't recognize me and said "can't connect to network." I'll try Method 2 later today, when I have a free moment.</p>
