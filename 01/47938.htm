            Hi Nigel,
<br />
<br />What version of Skype are you currently running?
<br />
<br />If it is version 7 I would wait a while before going to version 8 as it is a work in progress and lacks functionality . . .
<br />
<br />If you do want to get the latest version, you can get that here:

<h2>            Privacy Error</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed free windows 10.&nbsp; I immediately started to get privacy errors on&nbsp; my Advanced System Care 9 scans. Over 90 k&nbsp; the first time. So I scan after everty brief&nbsp; period online. Today I was searching flight options, and scaned afte things began
 to slow down or freeze. Over 300 k privacy errors.&nbsp; Took about an hour to fix them - assuming they
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">are </span>fixed. Malware scans do not help CC Cleaner does not help. Adwcleaner does not help. I am wide-open exposed and is affecting performance of course.

            it checks only on request. For all the years I have had Windows 7 it was the only one that gave me no trouble. Couldn't use Norton or Mcafee or AVG. What do you recommend? This is crazy - 320,000 privacy errors in an hour. And one disk error. and frozen
 internet. I need to solve this problem , not get airy negatives, rejections of what used to work for me before Windows 10. What WILL work? Or should I just go back to Windows 7?

            My Windows 10 problems get worse and worse. More privacy errors on the scans. Windows 10 offers me no restore points or system restore. Going back to Windows 7 will destroy all my files. I think I will buy a Mac if this cannot be resolved.

    <title>Xbox one controller left analogue stick - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snobbishsoup  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one controller left analogue stick</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I got my Xbox in December and since then I have been through 3 Kinnects (they failed to power up and had to do an advanced exchange each time). My issue now is I have been through 6 Xbox controllers. They break after a couple of weeks. It always happens
 when playing fifa, but I have had the same problem on every single controller.</p>
<p>The left analog stick feel like it pops out of place, it then doesn't register a 135 Degree angle and the players don't run at all. When I rotate the stick 360 Degree while the L3 buttom is clicked in it creates a clicking noise as if the bracket holding
 the ball at the base of the analogue stick is lose or weakened. If you carry on using it, it then gradually gets worse and worse until the stick doesn't recenter itself and stay flicked over to the right hand side.</p>
<p>Given this has happened to more than 1 of my controllers (and my xbox 360 and my ps3 never experienced such an issue) actually this has happened to 6 of my controllers I believe this to be a design fault. Although I find this hard to believe as you would
 think that these controllers go through a great deal of stress testing etc. What is going on here. Has my local HMV (game store in the UK) got a bad batch? If I replace with Microsoft will they issue me with a REV2 console?</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced these issues? Or have I been unlucky ... (very unlucky). I am thank full that the actual console hasn't broken yet (touch wood).</p>

<p>The left stick seems to be causing a lot of problems for a lot of users, and MS have yet to say anything about. It might be worth sending it in to see if they have fixed the issue with the left stick, but you have to pay for postage to the repair centre
 in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>I have just had one sent in for the same problem and my a button sticking, Just got the controller back after 2 weeks without one and the a button seems better but the left stick is exactly the same.</p>
<p>I also can't believe they want me to go without the controller for another 2-3 weeks because they couldn't be bothered to fix it correctly the first time, why am i not offered a swap at the door for my inconvenience?</p>
<p>Poor show microsoft poor show, my whole system is off back if i can't get this sorted so who do i need to talk to?</p>

<p>I'm on 15th or so controller. I normally play FIFA 14 and each controller hardly lasts a season; every time its gonna be the left Analog stick that starts giving issue. After playing couple of games, I could feel the lag while controlling and shooting the
 ball, plus I can't sprint faster (perfect recipe to lose a game). First I thought, may be I play rough (press the button/sticks harder), but after having the same issue in so many controllers, I'm quite certain, it has to do with the controller itself. I'm
 not sure whether MS is already working to get it fixed, but I'm loosing my patience, and I could see I'm not alone on this.</p>

<p>Check out the link below for the original locked thread. &nbsp;No where in any of the posts made by Misses Joust or anyone else from Microsoft do they cover anything to do with the left stick problems. &nbsp;All of the other issues they have answers for. &nbsp;But no where
 in the forums or in their troubleshooting paragraphs with bullet points will they acknowledge the fact that there is a severe issue with the controllers left stick. &nbsp;Microsoft or whoever makes the controller need to fix this issue with it's customer base a
 lot sooner than later. &nbsp;Acknowledge that there is a severe problem is how to start it off. &nbsp;There are even videos on YouTube showing the exact same problem that all of us are having. &nbsp;I myself in the locked thread below have pictures of how they ship it back
 to you without proper packaging on an already problematic controller. &nbsp;Not all that happy! &nbsp;I am and have been a loyal customer. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Soccerfanatics you have been through more controllers than me! I think impose a lot of games when I'm paired up against guys on the xbox 360 because their controllers work. I also agree with you it happens when flicking the stick to the right while exerting
 pressure. I heard all 6 snap this way. I took one apart and there is a square clips that appears to be loose. I was tempted to cover the bracket in epoxy or something but at 50 quid a pop it is a last resort as it would void warranty etc</p>

<p>SnobbishSoup, I don't think that's EA scripting issue because the new controller works perfectly fine for first couple of games; it just gradually starts showing the above mentioned issues as I play more games. And I maintain the protection plan for the
 controller (or will buy new one when expires) from my retailer, so I don't want to void it by opening it up. But it is really frustrating to go to the store for the exchange time and again for the same issue. I hope MS is listening to us and coming up with
 the fix sooner rather than later. I have already started questioning my loyalty to XBox (and MS).

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Upgrade Not Available on Activated Windows 10 Home Computer</h2>

<p>
</p><p>The computer settings say Windows is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I go to settings - upgrade - Activate - Store, there is no option to upgrade to Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>I try this on my wife's laptop and it immediately comes up with an option to upgrade to Pro for $99.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, Windows is Activated.&nbsp; I can change the themes/background.&nbsp; I don't get any notifications or watermarks on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to Settings - Upgrade - Activation it even says my copy of Windows is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can I NOT upgrade to 10 Pro?</p>

<p>RESOLVED</p>
<p>
</p><p>ok, the problem everyone is missing as that there was never an option to upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>No option on Microsoft's site, no option on their store directly from my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a ton more research and found out....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 Home install USB is original.&nbsp; It's too old.</p>
<p>Once I let Windows upgrade itself to the most recent version, I could see all the upgrade options and then spent $99 and upgraded to pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h3> gredunza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound Blater X-Fi Gamer PCI has distorted sound on Windows 10 Pro &#40;32bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I encountered a problem after last couple of updates. I have a dual boot machine (because of sound editing software that I bought in the past). It has Windows XP and used to have Windows 7 Pro 32bit which was updated to Windows 10 not long ago. Now -
 the PC did not run for three weeks till yesterday. Windows 10 downloaded some updates (I'm already running the Anniversary Update and at the point of update it was still ok). This is where the problem seems to start. Unfortunately it is the worst kind of glitch
 because it's not happening all the time. Just once in a while, e.g. Windows system sound plays choppy and distorted, or it crackles during YT playback. It was not happening before.<br />
<br />
I have the latest Creative driver (the one for Windows 10). I followed some advice from Microsoft forums and uninstalled the driver, restarted, installed once again the latest driver, restarted and the problem occured again. I did not try to reseat the card
 because under Widows XP everything still runs just fine, therefore I believe it's not a hardware level problem. It sounds more like the sound card was competing for the same IRQ with something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to disable all enhancements, moved the volume sliders down and also disabled HDMI audio driver that comes with my video card to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how to solve this or what changed in the operating system for this to happen. I would be grateful for any help. Thanks.</p>

            Thank you. This help is over a year old. The PC did not have any trouble for a long time. In my case, the problem occures in Windows desktop, not in games (PC is not used for gaming). I don't have nForce chipset nor SLI, my BIOS have not been changed for
 years. I'm not sure how to make sure that SATA and PCI memory resources are not in conflict since they were not before the last portion of updates. Everything worked fine until then. I guess I'll try to reinstall Windows.<br />

            Well, no luck. I installed fresh Windows 10 from an usb stick and downloaded latest driver. No change. I would like the machine to be working like before. I'm going back to Windows 7.<br />

            I found a workaround elsewhere. Setting Minimum Processor State in Power Management at 75% removed the crackling. I'm still not happy with the solution, but it's better than nothing.<br />

            <p><span><span><span><span><span>Sounds like a driver problem based on the troubleshooting plus the fact it works without the crackling sound in the dual boot situation. Try to
<strong>undo </strong>the Power Mgt settings so the crackling comes back. When it is happens again, go to the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/feedback-hub/9nblggh4r32n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">feedback hub</a></strong> and submit a

            <p>To remove the old driver, go to Device Manager and uninstall version 10. Be sure to accept the option to remove the driver components when offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot and check that the driver is not an older version. If so, remove it as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you start with the Microsoft Basic driver Windows Update may provide a new driver or you can install the version 15 Intel driver.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 No Longer detects printer in USB - cannot install it</h2>
                    <p>So I wanted to install my printer driver for Epson Aculaser AL-CX16 and windows 10 no longer detects it in USB - I can´t install it, even in safe mode without driver signature, and even in compatibility mode.</p>
<p><br />
It worked before, each time I reinstalled windows, but since the latest updates it seems to have stopped working and no longer detects it when it comes to driver install. It shows it in device manager though. Any ideas? I ´ve emailed Epson support, they don´t
 seem to have a clue, I tried different usb ports of course, but it just worked before!</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Home premium to Ultimate Edition Upgrade Question</h2>
                    <p>Hi and good morning! :),</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded my Windows 7 64 Bit Home Premium Computer to Windows 7 64 Bit Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I entered the upgrade key and everything went fine except now I have 54 Optional language pack updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how would I get rid of these permanently? I know I can hide them but they will always be there showing there are 54 optional updates along with 6 others related to Windows 10 that I've hidden..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other option to just get these out of the update list instead of just "Hiding" them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any input!</p>
<p>

                    I upgraded to Win 10 from Win 8.1&nbsp; and now I have two recovery partitions. Why do I need two recovery partitions and can I delete one. I assume one of them is for windows 8.1

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the disk manager then it will be like :</p>
<p>
</p><p>One recovery partition for <strong>WindowsRE (winre.wim)</strong> and another is for
<strong>Recovery Image (install.wim).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a screenshot provide us to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If you have any other questions or you need any other information about Windows, feel free to post your questions and we will be glad to help.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Which&nbsp;program&nbsp;&nbsp;are you(user)&nbsp;using?<br />
There might be a setting in that application which needs to be changed, to save files in the user profile.</p>
<p>If you want to give full permission to the user who has to save his work in C Drive then follow the below suggestions:<br />
1. Open Computer<br />
2. Right click on c: drive.<br />
3. Select share with <br />
4. Select advanced sharing<br />
5. Select "share this folder" checkbox.<br />
6. Select permissions.<br />
7. select the full control checkbox and check.</p>

<p>no i might have not went through yet on your computer, but trying it on your xbox will definitely help. you only need one place to do it, but a error could have occurred during the action. try on your xbox and see if it works. :D</p>

<p>Hi, I have changed my password via xbox.com without issues. Sounds very odd though, first try this, delete your xbox 360 profile from your 360 or any other device with your gamertag on it then log into xbox.com, change password again then re-download your
 gamertag to your desired devices.</p>
<p>Try and log into your 360 using your new password, if not try and change your password using your 360, then again to and recover your gamertag to all your devices.</p>

            <p>HI there,</p>
<p>a console may be set to remember a password, even if the password changes the console can still use that profile.</p>
<p>To remove the remebering option go to this link: <a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-us/Profile/Protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live.xbox.com/.../Protection</a></p>
<p>This will remove the password remembering so you can test if you will need the new password the first time you use your gamertag again on your console</p>

<p>Delete your profile from your Xbox and then use the recover Gamertag function to download it again.</p>
<p>http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete</p>

    <title>windows 7 ultimate booting to black screen with pointer and not - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 7 ultimate booting to black screen with pointer and not windows desktop</h2>
                    After normal updates the computer did a restart. When it came up, I get the password screen, it looks like it's booting and then goes to a black screen with a curser. I am using Windows 7 Ultimate. I have tried safe mode, which works ok, checking for disk
 and memory errors and booting from the repair disk and doing several system restores. They say they are successful but the same thing happens when booting up. Can't get back to desktop and windows screen. I have tried the repair options which says they work,
 and all checks show no errors. I have had this system for a couple of years with no prior issues. I have done a clean reboot which fixes nothing. Don't want to do a total wipeout if there is some other thing wrong. I am afraid I will lose everything for no
 good reason. Can anyone offer another suggestion?

            Hi,<br />
<div>1.&nbsp;Do you remember which updates caused this issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;What is the make and model of the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use “Low resolution video” to boot up<br />
This mode starts Windows using your current video driver and using low resolution and refresh rate settings. You can use this mode to reset your display settings.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use F8 while restarting the computer.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Windows Advanced Boot Options menu, select “Enable low resolution video”<br />
&nbsp;Check if you’re able to boot into windows.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2: Update the graphics card drivers.&nbsp; Check driver manufacturer’s website for the latest graphics driver.

            <p>My computer is an HP pavilion desktop model P7220Z</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't remember which update it was. I was getting ready to quit working and it said due to an update the computer needed a restart. I said ok and went to bed. The next day I was having this problem. Here are my responses to your suggestions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1: I do not get the option to boot with low res graphics. It says it shut down incorrectly and all I have to chose from is Safe Mode, Safe Mode with networking, and safe mode with cursor. I have been using safe mode with networking to try what fixes
 it allows me to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2: I did try replacing the graphics and video drivers, but since I get windows in safe mode with all the graphics I don't think this is the issue. It didn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3. I was running a clean boot so explorer was not running, but I ran it, disabled it, ran it again and checked the registry. It was correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done a restore to a point that was working before and it said it was successful. However, it did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It boots up, asks for the password with the nice blue background, accepts the password, then I get the blue screen that says processing with the little circle that says it is working on something, then eventually, instead of opening windows it goes to a
 totally black screen with the white arrow pointer in the middle. I can move it with the mouse but there is nothing to click on. and I can't even open the task manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since safe mode works, and all of my programs and files are still there it must be something with windows that is messed up. I have been reading any posts I can find, but there are no suggestions and Microsoft won't help unless I pay them since it is out
 of warranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone can help I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Sorry, typo on model number. It is an HP Pavilion P6270Z</p>
<p>In fooling around, it will boot to Diagnostic mode through msconfig, though not a clean or selective boot for some reason. I can't seem to do anything in diagnostic mode but it does show everything there and that the drivers are working. There is something
 preventing windows from coming up with almost any program but the basics running.</p>

<h2>            error 1935 when installing league of legands</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated my hard drive to a SSD and I reset my windows before doing so. I have windows 10 and when it starts to install the patcher I get the error 1935. which is much longer in its entirety but when I search online they are all the same. I have
 tried to repair the .net files and I have also set C drive to my main drive and restarted between both steps and I get same error at same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read somewhere that there is no current fix but I feel that there may be one out there and that was just a dead thread. but any updates ??? I did see that my computer updated today so I would think this would be a top priority cause I see a&nbsp; lot of issues
 after reset. the program also worked just fine in windows 10 before I reset and I have also tried to run in compadability mode and same error occurs.</p>

            <p>Hi Marsh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to help you better, could you please confirm a couple of things:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Are you able to install other games without any issues?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What exactly happens when you try to install the game?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What is the version of League of Legends you are trying to install?</span></li></ol>
<p>I would suggest you to download the game and save it on the desktop. Boot the computer in Clean Boot and try installing the game in Clean Boot and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow the steps to perform Clean Boot.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to the below article on how to perform a clean boot to know <strong>
“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</li><li>In the ‘Run’ window type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</li><li>On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</li><li>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

            <p>I have this same issue and I can install ANY other games.</p>
<p>The Launcher tells me that "error 1935 occurred" and that a C++ video file isn't installing properly. There are some repair sites that tell me to open command prompt and put "<strong><span>fsutil resource setautoreset true C:\"</span></strong><span> there
 and it doesn't fix it. I think windows 10 is missing something the previous windows had. I'm going to try to use your suggestion now and let you know but this is a main game I play and theres no solution! Please help!</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the Methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to <strong>temporarily disable the antivirus security software program</strong> installed on your computer and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and\or
 troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

<br />
Your computer is badly infected.&nbsp; The most prudent course of action would be to do a clean install of Windows.&nbsp; See the following advice from long-time MS MVP PA Bear.&nbsp; If you will not do that, post in
<br />
<p>&lt;Quote PA Bear&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>If (a) you do NOT have an anti-virus application installed and/or (b) your subscription expired, however briefly and/or (c) you didn't have a valid, fully-functional anti-virus application installed when your
 computer got infected and/or (d) you've neglected to keep the machine fully patched at Windows Update, see...</p>

<p><br />
Back-up any personal data (e.g., online banking &amp; credit-card passwords, none of which should be considered 100% trustworthy at this point) then format the hard-drive (typically the C: drive) &amp; do a clean install of Windows.

<b>HOW TO do a clean install of WinXP:</b> See <a href="http://michaelstevenstech.com/cleanxpinstall.html#steps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://michaelstevenstech.com/cleanxpinstall.html#steps</a> and/or Method 1 in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978307</a><br />
<br />
NOTE: If your computer didn't come with a set of disks, there will be a hidden Recovery partition (not to be confused with System Restore) you would use to do the clean install (AKA a "destructive recovery").<br />
<br />
After the clean install, you will have the equivalent of a "new computer" so take care of
<b><i>everything</i></b> in the list below, <i><u>in order</u></i>, before otherwise connecting the machine to the internet
<b><i>or a local network</i></b> (i.e., other computers) <b><i>and before connecting a flash drive, SDCard, or any other external drive to the computer</i></b>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the Windows Firewall is enabled.</li><li>Uninstall any <i>now-invalid</i> Norton, McAfee, etc., free-trialware which was also reinstalled, run the appropriate removal tool (see below), then install an anti-virus application of your choice (e.g.,
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspxMicrosoft%20Security%20Essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspxMicrosoft Security Essentials</a>- free).</li><li>Check in at Windows Update &amp; get the computer fully-patched.</li><li>Install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/defender/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Defender</a> or another anti-spyware application which includes realtime protection.</li></ol>
<p><br />
TIP: Use another, uninfected computer to download the installers for, e.g., SP2 and/or SP3, the installer for your new anti-virus application and either of the removal tools cited below. Transfer these files to CD or DVD (not a flash drive) then transfer the
 files from the CD or DVD to the desktop of the computer you're working on.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Not Installing -- At 0&#37; -- Error 80072ee2</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to figure out how to install Windows 10 Updates for a long time now and I'm running into lots of trouble. I'm having others problems (like problems installing apps) and I also believe this is a root to that problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into settings, and then trying to manually install the update, it is stuck on zero percent seemingly forever. In addition, when I use the Windows 10 Update Assistant to do the update, it shortly gives me the error code 80072ee2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching and searching and changing things and command prompts it seems like for most people the successful solution is to use regedit, then HKEY_local_machine/software/policies/windows/windowsupdate and delete all those files, but for me I do not
 see that path. After Windows, I do not see WindowsUpdate so this solution doesn't work for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried so many things, seemingly everything. I currently have Windows 10 for home, and I need help to install/download these updates so I can move on with my life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>I've been trying to figure out how to install Windows 10 Updates for a long time now and I'm running into lots of trouble. I'm having others problems (like problems installing apps) and I also believe this is a root to that problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into settings, and then trying to manually install the update, it is stuck on zero percent seemingly forever. In addition, when I use the Windows 10 Update Assistant to do the update, it shortly gives me the error code 80072ee2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching and searching and changing things and command prompts it seems like for most people the successful solution is to use regedit, then HKEY_local_machine/software/policies/windows/windowsupdate and delete all those files, but for me I do not
 see that path. After Windows, I do not see WindowsUpdate so this solution doesn't work for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried so many things, seemingly everything. I currently have Windows 10 for home, and I need help to install/download these updates so I can move on with my life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>EVERYONE.</p>

</p><p>I spent a very, very long time trying to solve these problems trying so so many different things. I just eventually reset my PC through settings after finding out my Windows was corrupted... Just save the time and do that. Everything except your documents
 will be erased but just save yourself some time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>You need the purchasing gamertag on the console so are you&nbsp;100% using the same console and the same gamertag you purchased the DLC with?.<br />
<br />
If not then you need to have that account on your HDD or it will not work.<br />
<br />
If so go into memory&gt; games&gt; Fallout and delete the DLC files.<br />
Then go to your account management page on your console, the DLC will be listed there and you can re-download it for free.<br />
<br />
You could also try clearing your cache. (<strong>Try this</strong>&nbsp;before deleting the DLC and see if it has helped, if not try the first suggestion).<br />
Go to memory&gt; highlight the HDD&gt; press Y&gt; select yes.</em></p>

<p>I think not having your console connected to Xbox Live 'may' be the problem. I've found from my own experience, that to use DLC associated with games, having the console connected online enables a sort of 'software check' somewhat akin to the server connection
 for games like Mass Effect 1/2 and Dragon Age: Origins/II etc.</p>
<p>I had Fallout 3, and trying to play it without being connected to Xbox Live, told me I had no DLC available (Exact same thing happened with Saints Row 2 as well), so if you can somehow connect your console to Xbox Live that 'should' fix your problem
