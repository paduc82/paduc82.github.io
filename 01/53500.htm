<h2>            what is the procedure to swap a hard drive on windows10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>what is the 100% Microsoft solution/procedure to replacing a harddrive where Windows10 is installed?</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am getting errors on my laptop pointing to a failing drive and need to replace it.</p>
<p>I assume that there must be a full procedure from Microsoft on how to do this regular kind of maintenance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody point me in the right direction - so far I have only seen solutions involving 3rd party tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>No problem. Swapping hard drives is a very common procedure. All the major hard drive manufacturers have detailed instructions on their websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you buy a retail hard drive from one of the major manufacturers, you get the drive itself, all the extra hardware you might need, the necessary software and detailed instructions. Plus, the major manufacturers' technical support teams are well-versed
 in the procedure and will help you to get it done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you're not going to worry about this, okay? Thousands have done it before you, and they didn't need to visit the Wizard of Oz and ask for a brain. If
<em>I</em> can do it - twice - so can you.</p>

            <p>Thanks everyone for the input I just wanted to let everyone know how I ended up resolving this supposedly simple activity:</p>
<p>- essentially it would see there is no pure Microsoft solution for CLONING a hard-drive&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the Microsoft solution seems to involve a great deal of copying data and reinstalling applications</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seem to be many tools available but also a problem in finding which ones are genuine and not including malware. So the tools that I used in order to do this were from recognised open source projects:</p>
<p>- tuxboot (http://tuxboot.org/download/) - used to make a bootable USB stick</p>
<p>- clonezilla (http://www.clonezilla.org/) - used as the image on the bootable USB stick</p>
<p>The concept is to boot into the Linux distribution clonezilla and use the functionality included here to copy the current internal drive to the future internal drive to be mounted as an external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was relatively straight forward however here are the issues I faced and how I solved it:</p>
<p>1. had some strange issue with the downloaded image from clonezilla - resolved this by not using my downloaded version and letting tuxboot do this for me (i.e. choosing to create USB drive image based on the first option in tuxboot and not using the local
 image).</p>
<p>2. had to change in BIOS the booting options from UEFI to Legacy (and setting this back once the cloning was done).</p>
<p>3. as the driver for this whole activity was an old hard drive which was starting to fail I had some issues initially with clonezilla skipping some areas of my harddrive as unreadable. I overcame this by using the --rescue option (easily accessible via clonezilla
 options).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But all in all I was very happy with how this worked and how easy it was to then be able to boot onto a hard drive which acted precisely the same as the broken hard drive.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can even use it to clone the old drive over following<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSqIuk1vXQAhVmyVQKHdy5BuMQFggfMAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fknowledgebase.macrium.com%2Fdisplay%2FKNOW%2FCloning%2Ba%2Bdisk&amp;usg=AFQjCNEX3HEcMwEWh0Gsad5Cjv0Aept0eg&amp;sig2=5co0dqOMHSu2DinczRwDyw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Cloning a disk - Macrium </a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has built-in imaging but it doesn't play well with new hard drives and requires recovering to the exact same partition position on the disk.&nbsp; With Macrium you drag the partitons to where you want them and it resizes them automatically to fit or to
 where you slide the borders, handles drive letters and boot issues automatically and always flawlessly.&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox One Nat open, Destiny Nat Strict - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Nat open, Destiny Nat Strict</h2>
                    
<p>Good evening</p>
<p><br />
I've looked for help pretty much everywhere so this is my last place I can ask.</p>
<p>Due to age, I exchanged my BBox 2 for a BBox 3 from my provider Belgacom.</p>
<p>I was able to connect my Xbox to it no problem yet whenever I try to play Destiny</p>
<p>I receive warnings that my Nat is strict and get kicked a lot from game.</p>
<p>My first attempt to fix this was call my provider for assistance but those ' people '</p>
<p>refused to help me as it ' doesn't get supported ' for game console issues, his answer was look online. (thumbs up for that customer service btw)</p>
<p>I tried looking on my Router adress to see if I could Port forward or DMZ. </p>
<p>Did not work, infact it doesn't even allow me to do it. I looked on the Portforwarding website guide</p>
<p>but funny enough the screenshots they have of the BBox 3 internal settings doesn't even come close to what settings I can change.</p>

<p>Static IP doesn't seem to help aswell seeing I'm unable to change my xbox one network settings.</p>
<p>My Primary DNS doesn't even look right (instead of an IP looking number, I have a lot of letters, numbers and :'s in it)</p>

<p>If anyone would be kind enough to help me with this issue I'd appreciate it because at this point the game is unplayable.</p>
<p>(It might be an issue with the game but I can not be certain about that)</p>

<p>it maybe a issue with destiny. i had the same issue. my nat type said open and destiny said strict. i do not know how to open port forwarding on bbox3 as i do not have one. the best thing i can tell you is to log into it if you can. most login info can be
 found on the box or device itself. click on the tabs until you find port forwarding and fill in all the ports xbox live and bungie recommends. do be scared to search for it. as long as you don't mess with the other settings it shouldn't give you any problems
 in the future.</p>

<p>I did log in on my router to see if I could do anything in that area.</p>
<p>I used the Portforwarding website as a guide but the screenshots they have </p>
<p>do not match what I see when I log into it. I have no portforwarding option whatsoever
</p>
<p>and DMZ didn't work either. There are 3 login options on my router:</p>
<p>User, Expert and Admin. Customer service told me I can't change anything for the Xbox on it and I can't have access to the Expert and Admin login.</p>

<p>Boy, Andy, I hate to say it, but you might need to check into buying a cable modem/router on your own, because it sounds like your ISP is more like a Gestapo. I don't know for sure, but simply getting a router (linksys, netgear, etc.) may allow you to forward
 the ports as necessary, while still using the BBOX. I have a DOCSIS 3.0 modem through my ISP that I've never actually logged into, I've only ever logged into the router, set up the port forwarding there, and everything worked perfectly.</p>

<p>My XBox One is saying that my NAT is open, then when I log into Destiny it mentiones i have a strict NAT. I have tried to port forward and all that and even UPnP, but the xbox is saying that the NAT is Open, just destiny is saying its not...i do not know
 what to do.</p>

<p>Hey Assassin! Try visiting this page: <a href="http://portforward.com/english/applications/port_forwarding/publishers/Activision.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
portforward.com/.../Activision.htm</a> and forwarding the ports which are specific to Destiny. For some reason, Activision's port communication is very odd and doesn't stick to the seven xbox one ports. Many also notice issues with Open NAT but the Call of
 Duty mp menus saying strict or moderate.</p>
<p>Let me know!</p>

<p>Destiny requires port 1200 for an open NAT.</p>
<p>You should also forward 1001 as well as I've seen that listed somewhere as a possible port.</p>
<p>Port 3075 and 3076 are the call of duty ports.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi cutehunter22,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try the following steps after
<strong>re<span>connecting VGA monitor cable from PC to TV</span></strong></span></span><strong><span>
</span></strong><span><span>and check whether you can resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Select
<strong>the PC input on the TV</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.
<strong>Enable external display on laptop</strong>. It would be a good to consult your laptops instruction manual or help file since this procedure varies from model to model. On most laptops there is a F key that enables the external monitor. You will typically
 see an icon on one of the F keys that look like a monitor. Remember that you will also need to press the Function Key (FN) at the same time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.
<strong>Configure Windows Display properties.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>1.
<strong>Right click </strong>on the desktop and <strong>Left Click </strong>on <strong>
Personalize</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2.
<strong>Left Click </strong>on <strong>Display Settings</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3.
<strong>Left Click </strong>on the <strong>Advanced button.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>4. You should see a
<strong>tab </strong>along the <strong>top row </strong>for your laptops specific video card.</span></p>
<p><span>5.
<strong>Left Click </strong>on it.</span></p>
<p><span>6. You should see a
<strong>large button </strong>that says <strong>Start the Control Panel.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>7.
<strong>Left Click </strong>the <strong>large button</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>8. You should see a
<strong>Window </strong>with <strong>Displays </strong>as one of the options.</span></p>
<p><span>9. Left Click on
<strong>Displays </strong>and then choose <strong>Change Display Configuration.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>10. Choose
<strong>Clone </strong>or <strong>Mirror.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

            AVG are aware of this issue, there are a number of AVG support tickets,
<br />solution offered by Avinash on <a href="https://support.avg.com/answers?id=9060N0000000Qc5QAE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.avg.com/answers?id=9060N0000000...</a>
<br />
<br />Open AVG Internet Security
<br />go to Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Components-&gt;Firewall-&gt;Customize-&gt;Network Profile and change it to Private.
<br />then go to Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Components-&gt;Firewall-&gt;Customize-&gt;Policies-&gt;System Rules and set all rules to "Enabled".
<br />
<br />in my opinion (and probably that of most windows experts) it is better to uninstall third party security software and enable Windows defender

            Wait until you get ahold of Windows 10! It is the worst and THERES NO GOING BACK!, They claim to let you know up front but I must have skimmed over that part.....!?!? I couldn't wait to get out of Windows 8 and my impatience led to my being stuck with
 the test version of an even worse operating system. swell! My monitor screen flipped 180 degrees and the solution is unknown as of yet. All I do know is the old screen flip combo alt+shift+&gt;arrow DOES NOT WORK!

<p>Hi Savan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the response, i should have thought of that at first. I went ahead and tried it on a laptop and the same keys still don't work.</p>
<p>So assuming that the keyboard was already broke, i went&nbsp; ahead and opened it up. Doing that i learned a lot on the anatomy of a keyboard. Inside are four layers the rubber portion were the keys strike and 3 plastic layers, so did a little inspection and
 noticed some dirt. Used some compressed air duster but the hard part was cleaning in between the 3 plastic layers, i used a clean dry cloth wiping in between and concentrating on the letters that weren't working. This is while the keyboard was plugged it so
 i can test it and know if its working. And guess what, it WORKED. Continued cleaning and re-assembled the keyboard. And works great ever since.</p>
<p>I hope this info helps others, sometimes we think air dusting the top is enough to clean the keyboard, but some times can get dirt way underneath those plastic layers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

                    <p>I am using the same server as I have used for several years on XP, 7 and Vista but since getting a new laptop pre-installed with Windows 10 about 6 months ago, I have unending problems with Mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, though the mail downloads OK now, it vanishes after
 24 hours and I can't find it anywhere, eg recycle bin.&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, when I do delete mail, the Deleted Mail folder&nbsp;only keeps it 24 hours then it disappears; &nbsp;&nbsp;previously I could re-visit deleted mail, it was kept for months, &nbsp;(and I still can in my gmail account),
 sometimes useful when wanting to retrieve data.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the Sent Mail folder occasionally works but not reliably.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, there doesn't seem to be a Junk Mail folder, previously I would occasionally be advised that doubtful mail had been put in the
 Junk Folder and I could check it to see if it really was junk.</p>
<p>I put this question to the Forum a few months ago but had no answer .... this time, please, help!</p>
<p>ps Windows Mail still works without these problems&nbsp;on an old XP we still have, so it's not the server that is at fault.</p>

            <p>Hi -</p>
<br />
When did the issue occur? - Wasn't running Trigger II until this week. This was a new install I assume from Windows update<br />
What troubleshooting have you tried so far, aside from uninstalling your Trigger II External Graphics? Rebooted in safe mode&nbsp;to verify the issue was with Trigger II<br />
Do you get any error messages? No, the monitor just stopped working so that is why I went into safe mode to verify the&nbsp;problem.<br />
Were you able to use both monitors when you boot in safe mode? Yes, before I uninstalled Trigger II.&nbsp;<br />
Now that I uninstalled Trigger II I can't use any monitor<br />
Do you have latest update of Trigger II External Graphics drivers? yes and that is what caused the problem. &nbsp;My other &nbsp;PC does not run Trigger II - is there an alternative? I run Windows7. &nbsp;Many thanks for any help you can provide.
<p />

<p>For initial troubleshooting, we suggest that you perform <strong>System File Checker
</strong>scan by going on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/bd832f07-1420-0c14-d2a5-0a5a24ba40be/using-system-file-checker-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. You can also run the

 the target server principal name (SPN) is registered on an account other than the account the target service is using. Ensure that the target SPN is only registered on the account used by the server. This error can also happen if the target service account

 target domain (NEWDIOIKHSH.LOCAL) is different from the client domain (NEWDIOIKHSH.LOCAL), check if there are identically named server accounts in these two domains, or use the fully-qualified name to identify the server. Error ID=4</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 anniversary update fails with 0x80070057 error.</h2>
                    I find tools to supposedly fix this error, but I can't tell if they're appropriate for Windows 10. &nbsp;Some specify that they're for Windows 7, but others don't say.

<p>
Go to&nbsp;<strong>Windows Update</strong>, by opening the<strong>&nbsp;start menu, search for 'update' and open "Check for Updates"</strong>. Now look down for&nbsp;<strong>Learn More</strong>&nbsp;and click on it, it should open a link on your default browser, now click on&nbsp;<strong>'Get
 the Anniversary Update now'.&nbsp;</strong>File name should be '<strong>Windows10Upgrade28084'. &nbsp;</strong>
</p><p>Open it and make sure it downloads the files. Watch for&nbsp;<strong>Verifying Download and make sure to turn off your Internet/WIFI/LAN if it reaches 100% IMMEDIATELY.&nbsp;</strong>since you already have the error, file is already on your computer so it's going
 to just verify like a hash check to make sure the Windows 10 update files are intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it should install upgrades <strong>but get stuck at the usual 2%</strong>,
<strong>make it stay there for about 30 seconds and re-enable your Internet/WIFI/LAN and the upgrade should finally pass 2%</strong>. You can then live in peace.<br />

<p>By golly, disabling then re-enabling the network did the trick!&nbsp; Thank you, TheCFCHenri!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already downloaded the file with several previous attempts, and so I started the process, let it verify the download, disabled all network adapters, waiting for a couple minutes when it appeared to hang at 2%... then re-enabled adapters, and after
 about 30 seconds it started to proceed.&nbsp; Much appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Black Screen during Windows Memory Diagnostic</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to test some newly installed RAM. It is detected by the PC and everything. The issue is, when I try to run Windows Memory Diagnostic tool, the computer reboots and gives me nothing but a black screen. The PC is powered on, I've got fans and the
 monitor detects an input, but, No display. The tool won't run. I have to force restart and the PC boots up just fine. How can I run windows memory diagnostic?</p>

<p>Hi Chad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get a black screen while using your Windows 10 device, it could be that the display have turned off after a period of time. You may try a Windows key sequence to wake the screen. You may do so by simultaneously press the
<strong>Windows </strong>logo key + <strong>Ctrl </strong>+ <strong>Shift </strong>
+ <strong>B</strong>. If Windows is responsive, a short beep will sound and the screen will blink or dim while Windows attempts to refresh the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, feel free to ask us.</p>

            <p>If the motherboard is UEFI then it may well want to change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get to the command prompt when booting from the Windows 10 installation and&nbsp;enter
<strong>DiskPart</strong>. This is a command line version of Disk Manager but&nbsp;is more powerful with additional option. However it will do exactly what you ask, it does not have the same protections as DM. Use it to Clean the disk</p>

            I cleaned the drive, and tried to convert it to gpt, which didnt work. I dont recall the error message anymore. However, i did manage to get the 32 bit version of windows installed. Im probably going to give my hdd to a friend, and let him convert it to
 gpt with a program, since i cant do it myself because i only have one drive, and if THAT doesnt work, then i'll most likely get a new drive. But if someone knows why it wont convert to gpt, that would be lovely :)

            I got it working. I went to a friend with my hard drive, and converted it there on his pc with a program to gpt, after that installing windows was pretty straightforward&nbsp;

    <title>change which monitor an application appears on when it opens - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> programmerbruce  say:</h3>
<h2>            change which monitor an application appears on when it opens</h2>
                    
<p>One application appears on the secondary monitor when it opens. As long as my laptop is docked, that's ok, because I can move it from one to the other. But when it's not docked and I open that application, it's like it's still stuck on the secondary monitor
 - I can use Alt-tab to switch to that application, but I can't see it, I can't move it, even with keyboard shortcuts (Alt-space-M to move, Alt-space-X to expand it to full-screen, Alt-space-R to reduce from full-screen, Alt-space-N to minimize to the taskbar.
 All seem to work - it flashes to the taskbar if I minimize it, flashes back - in the direction where the secondary monitor would be if it were docked - when I Alt-tab to it - except that Alt-space-M won't move it onto the laptop screen. Naturally, I can click
 on it in the taskbar, but that just has the same effect as Alt-tabbing to it - I still can't see it.) V annoying!</p>

<p>Try these:<br />
1.&nbsp; Right click a free area of the desktop, select "properties"<br />
2.&nbsp; Click the "settings" tab<br />
3.&nbsp; Click the mouse on the seconary monitor grapic,<br />
4.&nbsp; UNCHECK the box "extend my Windows desktop onto this monitor"<br />
5.&nbsp; Click the primary monitor graphic<br />
6.&nbsp; Make sure that "use this device as primary monitor" is CHECKED</p>
<p>If you're not sure which is 1 and which is 2, tap the "identify" button. It should display a huge, gigantic "1" on the primary monitor.</p>
<p>Or if that does not work, right click the application on the Taskbar, click Move, then use the arrow keys to move the program. The mouse cursor locks to the program window and you can use the mouse to position the program on your screen, you just have to
 use the arrow keys initially.</p>

Hope I could help

    <title>Text is highlighting without clicking and will open links. Vista. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Text is highlighting without clicking and will open links. Vista.</h2>
                    I am new to Vista with a new computer. When I move the curser (with the touchpad) around a web page it will highlight text and also, more worrying, it opens links and new web pages.<br />
<br />
How can I stop this? I want to have to double click to highlight text.<br />

Thanks in advance.

I unchecked "tapping" in the mouse properties and it seems to have solved the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Looking Tray near clock on lower right for Pointing Device Icon - double click it OR<br />
Control Panel Mouse - Pointing Device - set it as you wish. There are also probably<br />
tap zones so if you are using one of those then it auto clicks as well if that is set.<br />
Check with the manual for your system at system maker's site if it did not come<br />
with one.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
