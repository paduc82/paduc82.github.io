<h2>            Why have skype removed the ability to edit webcam settings and why won&#39;t you bring it back&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I would like Skype to consider adding back the ability to edit webcam quality. This was in the old version but it's been taken out and I really don't understand. Could someone who has any ability to please pass this forward and make sure someone hears
 about it? It's so frustrating and makes me sad :( There is nothing I can find online that works to adjust brightness, hue, saturation etc. and with a below average webcam it helps to be able to turn up brightness sometimes.&nbsp;

<h2>            Factory Reset and it created &#34;other user&#34; account.</h2>
                    I recently bought a new laptop, but my old one is still is excellent condition. I decided to do a factory reset and hand it down to my younger brother. However, when it finished, I noticed that there was this "other user" account on there. I can't log
 in, and administrator is "inactive." I tried resetting it again, but it won't let me. What can the issue be?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be experiencing this issue due to corrupted game files or compatibility conflicts. To help us identify the cause of this error, we would like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you only get this error when playing Roblox?</li><li>Are you getting the error upon launching the game or in the middle of playing it?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your computer before experiencing this issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you uninstall the game and install it again. After reinstalling it, try launching the game and check if you will still get the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>We appreciate the update. Since Roblox requires a stable connection to the server, you might be getting this error due to a connection issue. Additionally, sometimes firewall software might prevent you from getting connected. You can see if the connection
 issue is caused by a firewall by turning it off temporarily and then trying to play the game again. If you find the firewall software is causing the connection issues, contact the software manufacturer or visit their website to check and see if updated software
 is available. You may also refer to the following link for additional troubleshooting steps that you can try:

Why can‚Äôt I get connected?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest that you reach out to Roblox support or visit the official Roblox forum for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you require further assistance, please do not hesitate to post a reply.</p>

    <title>Windows changes the playback device automatically mid-work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gymnor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows changes the playback device automatically mid-work</h2>
                    <p>I have a MSI GE70 laptop with an internal soundcard and an external USB audio device (Steinberg CI1). I've updated to Windows 10 a week ago. Until today, everything worked fine, although I've noticed in my device manager that I suddenly have both my speakers
 (High Definition Audio device) and my line (Steinberg CI1) twice under audio inputs and outputs. My USB device is set as default and works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since today, my music suddenly stops playing through my USB device. If I check the Sound panel, it tries to play it through something called "digital audio (S/PDIF)" which I never installed and which might be a replacement for the driver of another USB soundcard
 I need once in a while, the M-Audio FastTrack C600. That one is not connected to my PC unless during live performances. If I disable this device in my sound manager, the music comes back through the USB soundcard. Funnily enough, Windows sounds are still sent
 through my USB soundcard, only the music isn't any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don't and simply restart my music, it comes through my laptop speakers instead of the USB device, although that is still the default one.&nbsp; If I go to "Sound" &gt; Playback and test the USB device, it says that the device is in use by another program. But
 I'm not actively running a program that would take control over my sound device and block the rest. There's not a single indication something changed.<br />
<br />
After unplugging and replugging the USB device, it tests again. But I have to close down the app playing music and restart it to get my music through the USB device again. And that works for about 30 minutes, after which the exact same happens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all troubleshooting, including running the troubleshooter, updating all drivers, reinstalling the devices.&nbsp; I have noticed that although I install either device once, they pop up twice in the device manager under Audio Inputs and Outputs.&nbsp; If
 I check under sound, video and game controllers, I find the High Definition Audio device, the NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device (WDM, comes with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX) and my Steinberg CI1 USB audio device.<br />
<br />
I did the troubleshooting already: reinstalled the drivers, made sure everything is updated, ran the troubleshooter (which is not really helpful), unplug and replug, the whole rimram. Problem persists. So don't bother copy-pasting the usual "have you tried
 turn it off and on again" answers. Yes, I did, and I did the rest too.<br />
<br />
Even more: If I uninstall and reinstall a single USB audio device and restart my computer, it starts showing up twice in my device manager again.
<br />
<br />
I was led to believe this might be related to how either Windows or the NVIDIA system updates, as I've noticed they released a new driver yesterday (2016/01/21). But disabling NVIDIA completely didn't make a damn difference. So something in Windows is claiming
 control over my USB audio device and blocking my music from playing time and again.<br />
<br />
Anybody an idea what the heck is going on here? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx</p>

Also turned off that irritating "fast start" option so I'm sure I'm working with the latest installed drivers and not some previously loaded ones.<br />
<br />
The problem is also that I can't set the Steinberg as default. It is set and used as default for Windows sounds, it works when I'm working in Ableton, but when I'm listening to music in the background, somehow Windows decides after say 30 minutes that it sends
 the audio stream to a seemingly random other device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is solved (I believe) for now. What I did after all the other things I tried :</p>
<p>
</p><p>- uninstalled the FastTrack completely (I'll reinstall that once I have the soundcard back)</p>
<p>- completely reinstall NVidia, after removing it completley using DDU ( from guru3d.com)</p>
<p>- turn off the fast start option</p>
<p>- shut down computer completely, unplug USB and restart</p>
<p>- plug in USB and try some different sound generating programs. Worked, but NVIDIA gave other issues (showed a pop-up asking for a smart card, issue is known to NVIDIA community)</p>
<p>- shut down computer again completely and restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, I have -again- both the High Definition Audio device and the line appear twice in the device manager. The instances are linked as siblings. Screenshot attached.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently Windows needs two instances running to function properly on my setup. This might be related to the NVIDIA card.

            Honestly, I am not sure if proxy server was setup or not. But is it possible to setup proxy server to block ping when you ping to web address and allow it when you ping to same web address using it's ip address.

            Google have long been monitoring ping requests and blocking the subsequent attempt to go to their website normally through the browser&nbsp;- the response message was something like
<em>Your IP address has been detected sending automated messages</em>.&nbsp; Perhaps they have set themselves up to reject pings completely now.

    <title>Battery issue of surface RT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chesterym  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery issue of surface RT</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just got my RT on 3rd Feb this year. Little did I know about this new gadget as a norm user. Especially regarding the battery issue of losing capacity when you cycle charge it below 10%!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder why Microsoft did not give us a battery charge warning. Until I came across the info of checking the battery with powercfg/batteryreport 2days ago and found out the HUGE disappointment as a new surface RT user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the report I found with my surface RT battery report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Battery capacity history&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>31,502 mWh </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As the report shows, I wonder :</p>
<p>1) Why as a new gadget the surface was not in full design capacity at first instead a 31,334mWh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) As a NEW GADGET I would assume it's at least to be able to hold the amount of charge to the design capacity. My&nbsp;battery was never been able to hold to the design capacity not even once, and shame to say it's NEW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Why is the Newly not even a month old (2weeks plus) NEW GADGET to be losing capacity so fast?&nbsp; Dropping to 31,073mWh???? (With just 7 charge cycles,2was at below 10%) is this a faulty battery at the start?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the above some info said to not deep cycle charge the battery as it'll lose capacity. If that is the case, Microsoft shouldn't have set the Critical battery to 4% &amp;low at 6%, set it to 10 OR 20. Misleading users to deep cycle charge it and lose capacity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I UNDERSTAND WEAR N TEAR, but this is disappointing to my view as a new gadget from Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not get me wrong till this point, I like the surface RT. Just being a NEW GADGET OWNER to found out the surface is losing capacity so fast (7 cycles in my case)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am disappoint over the hardware issue of losing battery capacity within 2 weeks and the battery didn't even been able to hold full design charge&nbsp;when it came out of the&nbsp;manufacture.</p>
<p>I hope Microsoft would at least explain this issue.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the reply, I have updated my surface once I got it. So it's up to date and I did a update check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried calling microsoft, asking about the send in process just to be sure what will I go through if the capacity drops again. They did ask the same as to update the windows. Just wondering did Microsoft have an update in fixing that battery?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I hope I don't send in my unit as I need it and I am not feeling comfortable in getting a refurb unit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>refurb units to my understanding&nbsp;is a faulty unit by other users, send in, fix and replace it to another customer that sends in, so who knows what issue I would face with other users' unit? So far besides the battery, everything works fineüòä</p>

    <title>How do I hide temporary files &#40;for example MS Word .tmp - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I hide temporary files &#40;for example MS Word .tmp files&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I made a big mistake earlier and accidentally hid my entire "my documents" folder. After that, I un-hid everything, trying to fix the mistake, but that means now that all the temporary files and folders (for example Microsoft Word garbage files) are in
 every single folder. I'm a writer and some of these folders contain novels with dozens or hundreds of Word files, which means there are hundreds of temporary files - it's utter clutter and makes Windows Explorer essentially unusable. Does anyone know a way
 to re-hide all the temporary files while keeping the actual files visible?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div><br />
<div>What you want to accomplish will be very work intensive from your part. Two ways you can approach this problem:</div>
<div>1.- Delete all temp files (they're temp so they're not needed anymore anyway.)</div>
<div>2.- Set the hidden attribute to each single one of the files (a lot of work).</div>
<div><br />
<div>1.- &nbsp;Select all temp files. If they're&nbsp;contiguous, then click the first one, press
<b>shift</b> key (do not release it), click the last one, release the <b>shift</b>&nbsp;key. If they're not contiguous, select<b>.</b></div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Press the <b>Del </b>key.</div>
<div>(Disclaimer, if you delete files, do it at your own risk. There's always inherited dangers when deleting files. Dangers like user errors.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>2.- Select all files and/or folders (refer to 1).</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Right click .</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Click <b>Properties</b>.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- On the <b>General </b>tab, click the checkbox next to hidden. If you have folders selected, you will be prompted to choose to hide the contents of the folders or just the folder itself. I will suggest to just hide the folder and not the contents.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do not forget to mark my posting as answered and/or helpful. I'm trying to build a good reputation here.</div>

            If you have to go the 2nd route and set the hidden setting for every temp file (not sure why you wouldn't just delete them though), you can try typing
<b>*.tmp</b> into the search box<b>&nbsp;</b>to find and then select all of them at once.

</p><p>So, I have a little issue with my PC, a faulty ram - which causes several visual glitches in games and makes the PC hard shut down and open by itself from time to time, a restart so to speak - usually when that happens it opens up and gets back to normal,
 but this time it seems as I was very unlucky and it shut down while Windows was probably downloading updates in the background, because it shut down, booted back up and it opened that "update screen" specific to Win10, it updated from 0% to 30% at a snail's
 speed and then told me it would restart - common enough, it restarted and then continued the update, this time it went from 30% to 100% in less than a minute, which is weird but besides the point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It completed the update and I got to the desktop, first thing I've done is try to open a game but it wouldn't open - I thought it was lagging and I waited...and waited... and waited until I decided to open the task manager and try to close the game and reopen
 it, but task manager wouldn't open at all. The PC wasn't frozen, it seemed that it was working just fine, but I was pressing the task manager button (I have it pinned on my task bar) and it wouldn't open, not even the little blue "disk" besides the mouse cursor
 wouldn't show up so I guess it wouldn't even load up, so I tried to shut down the PC - the start button seemed to work...kinda, the only option that would show up when pressing the power button were : update and shut down/restart" and "sleep", so I guess the
 update failed if it wanted me to update again, I pressed the "update and shut down" option but it did nothing, it wouldn't close at all. I waited 5 minutes for it to do something but to no avail, so I've hard shut it down and rebooted it - it gave me a black
 screen with no cursor or anything so I've hard shut down it again, this time it got to the desktop, and, as stubborn as I was, this time I tried to open task manager again, but directly from system32 (file explorer was the only thing working, settings wouldn't
 work, the start button was buggy, etc.), I've searched for "taskmgr" and found it there, right-clicked, opened as admin and... nothing again, except that this time these errors popped up https://imgur.com/gallery/5wp9B - the first error looked like it was
 from Avast. but the rest - I don't know. Nothing would open at all, so I've shut it down and rebooted but this time it only gives me a black screen (without the cursor) and I can't do anything about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a digital license for Windows 10, so I don't know what will happen if I reinstall it or if I'll lose my license, I can't associate the license with my microsoft account either because I'm completely locked out of my pc, and I con't have a repair disk
 so... what do I do?</p>

            Hi, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a Product Key and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Important:
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Alright, after a last attempt at fixing my PC without a reinstall I entered safe mode and everything was working (I attempted to enter safe boot from the desktop itself by pressing shift+restart but the restart button wouldn't work, only now I've realized
 that I could do the same at the log in screen without actually... logging in as the start button wouldn't even work on the desktop) and everything seemed to work fine, especially the task manager. Considering that the 1st error I talked about was certainly
 from Avast, I tried to uninstall Avast altogether in a last, desperate, attempt. Avast has caused me troubles before (I couldn't go to any site although the internet was certainly working because the "ping" command on CMD was working with no interruptions)
 but not on the scale of "breaking" my OS - after uninstalling Avast I restarted my PC and everything was working. I don't know what caused that error but I guess it's fixed now and I'll stick with AVG because Avast seems to not tolerate me

    <title>My Windows 10 taskbar and Start menu are missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chitoge  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Windows 10 taskbar and Start menu are missing</h2>
                    A few days ago, my taskbar was not auto-hiding and wouldn't go away unless I chose a specific option on the taskbar properties. I can't remember what it was called, but it was really frustrating. I restarted my computer to see if that would help, but instead
 it was completely gone. I don't know how to get it back and the Start menu isn't working either. When I go into safe mode the taskbar is there but when I'm in normal mode it's not. I would&nbsp;<strong>really</strong> like a solution that does not involve me restoring
 my computer to it's default settings, because that's what I&nbsp;<strong>don't</strong> want to do. Help would be very much appreciated! Thank you!

<h2>            Windows System Defender Virus - all antivirus software disabled by virus</h2>
                    I somehow managed to get the windows system defender virus (ugh!).<br />
<br />
I've googled and googled but all the solutions I've found do not work.<br />
<br />
I had malwarebytes before and now the virus has deleted it. It also will not let me run McAffe On-Access Scan or Spybot Search and Destroy. Every antivirus software I run, it disables it.<br />
<br />
I cannot open task manager.<br />
<br />
I deleted all the entries in run -&gt; regedit that had 'defender' in them. The desktop icon for the virus is gone now but I still cannot run any antivirus software to completely get rid of it.<br />
<br />
help?! anything else you need to know, i'll be keeping my eyes on this topic.<br />
<br />
<strong>ETA:</strong> one thing it does which is super annoying is change the website i want to go to. for example, i tried going to microsoft.com to download their security essentials and it redirects me to "Dealing with a miscarriage | Momversation" wtf?
 So, if the virus doesn't agree with where i want to go, it'll just change it to something totally odd. i ended up googling microsoft and having to click 'cached' to be able to get to it.<br />
SUPERantispyware seems to be working well, it's found a couple trojans and a few adware and 'Rogue.WindowsEnterpriseDefender'

            I had something similar - not a Defender virus, but something that kept like multiplying, even after I ran AVG and Malwarebytes.<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;finally ended up just formatting my computer - you know, wiping everything clean and putting the boot disk, and reinstalling everything. This is a last resort - and make sure you save EVERYTHING you want to save before you do this, and write down all programs
 and&nbsp;registration keys - becuase it will obviously wipe everything out.<br />
<br />
But use this only as a last resort. For now, I'd&nbsp;keep trying to Google your problem, and any possible error messages, to see what you can find. There's bound to be something.<br />
<br />
But like I said - formatting will work - and only use as a last resort because it will wipe out your harddrive (and if you do, don't forget to defrag after you're done). Hope this helps somewhat.&nbsp;

oof! yeah, formatting is hardly an option right now. I'm a college student with tooooooo much to back up!<br />

            Did you remove the virus? If not, I'd seriously invest in an external harddrive (Seagate or Western Digital) and back everything up to it, format my computer and re-install Windows.<br />
<br />
I had to do this earlier this year (I'm in college as well) and it took care of the problem. Obviously you have to reinstall all of your programs (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc...) but it takes care of the problem.<br />
<br />
Let me know how it goes for you.

                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 and now my monitor doesn't work correctly. &nbsp;I'm stuck in low-res VGA mode. &nbsp;I have an HP 2509b monitor and I am unable to load a new monitor driver. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10 is using a Generic Monitor driver.</p>
<p>I have tried several third-party apps to get the correct monitor driver loaded but have had no success.</p>
<p>I tried following the Troubleshooting procedure but that also did nothing.</p>
<p>From my research I have discovered that there is no Monitor Driver for my Monitor that works in Windows 10.</p>
<p>Do I have any options?</p>
<p>or has this 'free' upgrade forced me to buy a new monitor?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide us the information stated below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which web browser are you using to access the web?&nbsp;</li><li>Do you have favorites saved in the browser?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, I would like to inform that auto complete&nbsp;in a web browser refer to the function which allows you to save your passwords, email address, home address, etc. This will ensure that when you enter&nbsp;your personal details, you will not have to type
 the entire form or dialog boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Internet Explorer, you can refer to the link below and check.</p>

            <p>I'm using Microsoft Edge. &nbsp;From what it sounds like if I delete my saved passwords, it will then delete emails, addresses, etc. on everything, BUT it will also delete the autocomplete info. &nbsp;I wish they could separate the two - saved passwords as one thing
 (if you've checked to save) and saved searches (autocomplete) as another.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the above response, I would like to begin by&nbsp;explaining that auto complete pertains only to the information that&nbsp;the browser saves&nbsp;to make it easier for you when you have to enter your regular personal details via the browser.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to searches,&nbsp;if you would have created and saved favorites in the browser, it will display or prompt the URL when you enter it on the address bar. However if you didn't create such settings, clearing the browser history should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having stated the above, I suggest that you follow the steps below&nbsp;just to check if you are able to clear your browser history</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on the
<strong><span>More actions (‚Ä¶)</span></strong> icon next to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the feedback icon present on top right corner of the Project Spartan &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; homepage.</span></li><li><span>Select
<strong><span>Settings</span></strong> and click on
<strong><span>Choose&nbsp;what to clear.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Check the boxes
<strong><span>Browsing history, Cookies and saved website&nbsp;data and Cached data and files
</span></strong>and click on <strong><span>Clear.</span></strong></span></li></ol>

<h2>            ftp timeout</h2>
                    Copying a large number of files from an FTP site to my local network using Windows Explorer, if the copy encounters an error with any one of the files, the entire copy is aborted. Why is that? Why can't Windows give the user options, like Retry, Abort,
 Skip?<br />

As it is, the user has to start over, or else try to figure out which files were copied and pick up from there -- a big job, if many directories are involved.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Karl,</p>
<p>I empathize&nbsp; with your issue, however the long and the short of it is that that's how Windows is wired, and nobody short of Microsoft's programmers can change that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that I recommend an article to you at techsupportalert.com; its a comparative feature on alternative freeware copy programs. The article is here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.techsupportalert.com/best-free-file-copy-utility.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.techsupportalert.com/best-free-file-copy-utility.htm</a>&nbsp;. Download links to the various programs are at the end of the article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if one of these fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Taskbar won&#39;t show running programs when minimized. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nymlord  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar won&#39;t show running programs when minimized.</h2>
                    this is just one out of the many problems i have been experiencing. to start off, i was running vista ultimate 32bit perfectly, I decided it was time to buy the new windows and give it a try after the beta had worked perfect as well! once doing that and
 upgrading it from vista several things werent working, such as, running programs never show up on the taskbar, even when minimized, so once minimized only thing i can do to find it again is press ALT + TAB. Another problem im having is my aero theme, or any
 theme in general, there is no theme option in personalize in control panel. <br />
<br />
when running windows vista 32 bit, i had downloaded quite a few themes including windows 7 theme from deviantart, sometimes replacing dll files such as, uxtheme.dll, pnidui.dll, and loads of others. what i thought was that when i updated to windows 7 from vista,
 some of the dll files are now corrupt and my laptop seems to be in somewhat "confused". please help me, i have searched everywhere for taskbar problems but cant seem to find anyone with the same problem as me. thank in advance!

            If something was corrupted and you encouraged some troubles after upgrading you may try to run scanning which check integrity of system files and repair if there is a need. Try this:<br />
<br />
press <strong>WinKey+R</strong> &gt; type <strong>cmd</strong> and press enter &gt; type
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and press enter &gt; after finishing you may need to restart your system.

            I've already tried that and it didnt do anything. ive tried most tune up programs hoping that they would replace and fix the dll files it self, however that never worked. what it seems like ive managed to do, is to enlarge the taskbar from its original
 size AND made all running programs in the taskbar just be an icon. im running out of options and i dont think any program or scan will do it, it would probably have to be done manually. if any help i can post a picture of the taskbar to show an example? thanks
 for the reply.

<br />
"Found it! Removing HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Streams\Desktop"</blockquote>
<br />
This is not the first time when I saw this suggestion. Every changes made to taskbar are connected with that registry value (I know that there is a key called TaskbarWinXP, but I can ensure you that this is connected with taskbar in Windows 7). So after removing
 it Windows should restore it to its default (appropriate) state. You need to run registry editor: press WinKey+R &gt; type regedit and press enter &gt; find mentioned branch &gt; and delete it &gt; restart you system.<br />

            damn, i really thought that would work., but didnt. :( <br />
<br />
i was wondering however while looking through the regedit folder, since my theme doesnt seem to be working properly either, maybe i can delete following &lt; HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\visualeffect\themes &gt; however i dont
 dare trying to delete anything in registry editor without being certain that it will be replaced once restarted.

            Does the problem is related only to Aero Theme, or maybe also to Windows 7 Basic Theme, or Classic?

            its any theme, currently its running in classic( looks like classic but is actually windows 7 theme) but still with SOME visual effects,. i took the chance in deleting the &lt;theme&gt; folder, restarted and nothing. and returning to the folder, visual effects,
 Themes hasn't returned. the thing is, before deleting it, i noticed that all folders have 2 files, one default reg_sz, and one DefaultApplied (regdword)., but in the Themes folder there was no DefaultApplied, like its been deleted. so that might have been
 the problem ?

            I had trouble to find exactly the same article which I found few days ago. TaskbarWinXP wasn't the only value which is responsible for taskbar<br />
<br />
<a href="http://petermartinconsult.supanet.com/computer/windows/taskbar.htm#buttons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Another suggestion</a> says to remove this key also, and restart system after that:<br />
<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StuckRects2</strong>
<br />
<br />
First try that what above.. if it doesn't work you may read this topic: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/forums/TechOff/5977-Are-you-a-Windows-XP-Guru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            thanks a lot for your help, i tried the program Taskbar Repair Tool Plus v1.1.1, it seemed to work at first for my minimized windows to return but then after some time it just goes back to being unusable.
<br />
<br />
also tried deleting and restarting doing what u told me with : <br />
<br />
WshShell.RegDelete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\<strong>StuckRects2</strong> \"<br />
WshShell.RegDelete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\<strong>StreamMRU</strong> \"<br />
WshShell.RegDelete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Streams\<strong>Desktop</strong> \"<br />
<br />
didnt work either. however i still have the rest of the things u told me to do to try out. so hopefully after going through carefully all of it, it
<br />
will work. thanks again for your help ! much appreciated :)

            heh.. great.. now there is no even similar topic.<br />
<br />
I guess it won't change anything but you can check something: right click on <strong>
Computer</strong> &gt; <strong>Properties</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced system settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Advanced</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Performance</strong> - <strong>Settings...</strong> &gt; uncheck
<strong>Use visual styles for windows and buttons<br />
<br />
</strong>After that you should be able to see the title of window instead of thumbnail preview. Try to select again Use visual styles... and see what happens. There is also some option like
<strong>Save taskbar thumbnail previews</strong> , check how it will behaves in different states.<br />
<br />
ps<br />
<br />
You should unmark this topic as answered until you find a solution. Other way people may not looking here to see what the problem is.

                    <p>hello<br />
i updated win7 home to win10 home<br />
always i use three languages - english, russian and ukrainian. always i install windows in russian (system language as i understand), with it choosing english as default by using russian-languages system. while work i open some different programs, in every
 of them choose language, which is comfortable in moment, for exapmle browser with eng, excel with russ, word with ukr. i all the time switching among all opened windows and now im verrrrryyyy negative surprised that:<br />
1. which language i choose by default, this language becoming as system language;</p>
<p>2. when i switch to another language in one of prog, this language is also in all another progs, when i jump among them<br />
i very hope that i just cant find tool, which can help me to change this real problem, as i never can understand what for to change good working and cozy setup to more primitive one</p>

<p>i think every next product must be more comfortable for users, more rational, and need to make some movements where earlier was enough just one (i use different combinations of keys all the time while working and not only) is quite disappointing</p>
<p>anyway i decided to come back to my win7, and actually not just because language inconvenience</p>

<h2>            View Screen Share in Conference Calls on MAC</h2>
                    <p>When in normal 1-1 calls, I am able to share my screen with others, and also see the screen they are sharing.&nbsp; However, during conference calls, when a user is sharing their screen, I am unable to see any screen sharing.&nbsp; I click on the elipse (...) at the
 bottom of the call and choose "show content", but nothing ever shows.&nbsp; It appears this only happens when someone is attempting to share a screen during a conference call.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; The user sharing their screen is either on Windows or MAC.&nbsp; The same issue occurs.</p>

<p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7a07c093-ffc1-4686-8c62-09656162885a" title="Bryant Duke">
<p>
</p><p>Since you are in a conference call and sharing screens, this will consume&nbsp;much of your&nbsp;bandwidth. If you are able to share yours without any problems to your contacts, then it's not your connection that has a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Applications using your bandwidth&nbsp;can slow your computer down. For example, music streaming applications such as Spotify, or file-sharing applications such as iTunes. Notify your contacts about this and see if there will be changes while sharing screens.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments.&nbsp; This is not a bandwidth issue or multiple application running issue.&nbsp; I have 16GB of RAM on my MAC, and I am rarely using more than 6GB at one time.&nbsp; In addition, my connection at work is 200MB and 150MB at home.&nbsp; Like I explained
 in my original post, I am able to share my screen with others, and they can share their screen with me in a 1-1 session (most of the time).&nbsp; However, in a conference call with more than 2 or 3, when they share their screen, everyone else can see it except
 for me.&nbsp; I have tried killing Skype and re-launching, restarting my MAC, joining multiple times, and even being sure nothing else is running.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional help would be appreciated.</p>

            The Microsoft store is another DRM service like steam but you can't use a steam activation code on the microsoft store - you will have to buy it digitally on the microsoft store to login to the windows live platform.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hello,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you insert the Blu ray disc, do you receive any error message or code?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may please insert different Blu ray disc and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may also uninstall and re-install the Blu-ray device drivers and check. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue still persists, you may follow the below methods and check.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter (Before running the troubleshooter, connect the Blu-ray device).
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter checks for common problems and makes sure that any new device or hardware connected to your PC is installed correctly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Type Troubleshooting in the search bar.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select Troubleshooting.<br />
3.&nbsp;Select View all on the top left corner.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click on Hardware and Devices.<br />
5.&nbsp;Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2: I suggest you to perform System File Checker (sfc) scan and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To perform SFC Scan, refer to the below link:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</span></a><br />
Note: Steps mentioned for Windows 8/8.1, will work fine with Windows 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may also download and install latest drivers and firmware for your device and check.<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/install-update-activate/download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/install-update-activate/download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface?os=windows-10</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would recommend you to check for latest Windows Updates. Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates. If you have any pending updates remaining to install, kindly install them and check if it helps.</div>
