            Thnak you, I am running Win 7 right now as I had to reload after a disc failure using the OEM disc that cam with my computer. I upgraded to WIN 10 before the hard drive crash using a digital download upgrade from Microsoft. I did not record the key so
 now I cannot re-install WIN 10. I was thinking that Microsoft would have a record of the WIN 10 key that I was already given.

Find Windows 10 Product Key After Upgrade
<p>After downloading it, extract the zip file then launch <em>ShowKeyPlus.exe</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.groovypost.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f12%2fkey-plus-1.png" height="293" width="493" /></p>
<p>Immediately, ShowKeyPlus will reveal your product key and license information such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product Name</li><li>Product ID</li><li>The currently installed key, which is the generic product key used by Windows 10 depending on the edition installed.</li><li>The Original product key. This can be your Windows 7 or Windows 8 retail or OEM product key before upgrading. This is the product key you want if you encounter product activation issues in Windows 10.</li><li>OEM Key OR Retail: ShowKeyPlus will check for the presence of an OEM marker; that is how big name vendors activate multiple machines at the factory running Windows.</li></ul>
<p>If you’re encountering product activation issues, once you use ShowKeyPlus to find your original product key, you can use it to update the product key values in Windows 10.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.groovypost.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f12%2fkey-plus-2.png" height="395" width="534" /></p>
<p>Copy the product key and go to <em>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.groovypost.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f12%2fupdate-product-key-value.png" height="391" width="628" /></p>
<p>Then select the&nbsp;<em>Change product key </em>button<em>&nbsp;</em>and paste it in<em>.</em>&nbsp;Restart Windows 10, and you should be activated.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.groovypost.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f12%2fChange-Windows-10-Product-Key.png" height="348" width="557" /></p>
<p>You can also use ShowKeyPlus to find your product key from a Windows Backup, and also to verify which edition your product key is associated with using the
<em>Check product key </em>function.</p>

            If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.

<h2>            XP won&#39;t show Login Screen after I upgrade to 3GB RAM&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hiya, my vaio runs Windows XP (SP3) MCE. It has [2 x 1GB RAM] config which I just upgraded to [1x2GB &amp; 1x1GB] (both DDR2 667MHz). I did some research on that and turns out&nbsp; that my i945PM Chipset can support a max of 4GB RAM but only 3-3.5GB can be addressed.
 So I just bought one 2GB stick to replace one of my 1GB sticks, hence 3GB in total.<br />
<br />
After booting, BIOS displayed the 3GB and a Linux boot-cd was able to test the whole 3GB as working. My problem is the following: XP boots but blacks out on the login UI! Safe Mode does the same thing. But the hard-drive keeps processing though.<br />
<br />
If I remove the 1x1GB stick, then booting is normal. How can I fix that login UI with the 3GB RAM in place?<br />
<br />
I've tried moving the 2GB stick around and addidng "/PAE" or "/3GB" in boot.ini but no success. XP still won't show the login UI!</p>

Will your Vaio accept different capacity sticks? You might want to check your documentation for that.<br />
Does the 2GB stick utilize the same timings as the other, such as latency, delay, and cycle times?<br />
If you have just the 1GB stick in, will it allow you to login then? If both sticks work installed separately, that leads me to believe they have different timings.</p>

<p>Vaio is a complete numb skull on hardware upgrades. I mean, I recently upgraded my CPU which according to them is something impossible or I shouldn't do. I used the information from i945PM Chipset sheet, and guess what I went from 1.83GHz to 2.33GHz (without
 any overheating). I even followed the steps for hacking their locked BIOS and now I have intel VT-x activated! Vaio does nothing to help us.</p>
<p>The problem is with the RAM. Vaio says it's 2GB max but I know other Vaio users have upgraded to 3.25GB (using 2x2GB). Since they were losing out on that last gig, I just went for 3GB [2GB + 1GB]. They are both from Crucial and share these characteristics:
 DDR2 PC2-5300 • CL=5 • Unbuffered • NON-ECC • DDR2-667 • 1.8V&nbsp; ...The 2GB is made in China and 1GB is made in Singapore :)</p>
<p>I changed the boot.ini from /3GB to /PAE but no luck. I've tried XP on that 2GB stick alone and it works (just like on the default 2x1GB setting).</p>
<p>My problem is the following: BIOS detected the 3GB. A bootable Linux CD ran fine with it (even tested the full 3GB). Windows XP shows its startup logo but then doesn't show the Login screen. So even though the computer is working, I have a blank screen.
 Does the Login UI do a hardware check or how can it lock up?</p>

Even though the chipset supports 4GB doesn't mean that the motherboard design will allow it, and it looks like Sony has locked that particular MB at 2GB. If you know others with the exact same model and revision level as yours that are using 3GB, I'd ask if
 you could put your RAM in their machines and see if it works OK. My guess is that even though theirs run it, yours may have an earlier revision MB that won't go as high as 3GB.<br />
Ask if you could put their 2x2GB in yours and see what happens. Yours may run 2 2's but not a 1 and a 2. Besides, if you put 3GB in and you can get it to login and run, you probably won't see all 3GB anyhow. Some of that will be reserved for overhead, and you
 won't see it.</p>

<p>Did u read the other stuff I wrote? BIOS detects it. A bootable Linux CD tested it and loaded up. XP shows its startup screen (with the dotty things moving), and then does not show a Login Screen!? That is weird.</p>
<p>Why would 3GB of RAM suudenly affect the login user-interface. What is the connection between that and Sony's lock on the motherboard? Did Sony include a hardware or software lock? Clearly my laptop is booting and BIOS is detecting it.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure it's an XP problem.</p>

Of course I read all your "other stuff." The point I was trying to make is that if the MB is locked to 2GB and you have more than that installed, then Windows is probably confused and that's why it locks at the login screen- that's as far as it can get. Or
 it may be the video chip that's confused trying to write to or read from a memory address it thinks is there, but isn't because of the MB limitations.<br />
And by hacking the BIOS and making changes there, you may have hosed it yourself that's preventing it from reading the rest of the RAM correctly.<br />
Good luck with it :-)</p>

<p>So BIOS detecting the RAM is not good enough? The MB could be locked?</p>
<p>A bootable Linux CD running on the 3GB RAM is not good enough? The MB must be locked and the GPU is confused.</p>
<p>I even had a bootable MSDOS usb-stick running but I don't think it counts.</p>
<p>I don't know what other tests I can do. It seems weird that [2GB,1GB] config won't work in XP.</p>
<p>As for the BIOS hacking, it just required changing one register value from 0 to 1. Once you do that, Virtual PC will ungrey the hardware virtualization option.</p>
<p>Am pretty sure XP is at fault here. The XP Welcome screen shows up and then blanks on the Login Screen. Same thing goes for Safe Mode. So the GPU got confused just before the Login screen was initiated.</p>

<p>Put your Old RAM back.</p>
<p>1- Go to virtual memory&nbsp;and press change.</p>
<p>2- On (C:) drive, let system manged size and press set.</p>
<p>3. shutdown your pc and replace your RAM with new once.</p>
<p>Byway what kind video card do u have? isn't build-in?&nbsp;if so, deductible that from you total&nbsp;RAM. as long you have RAM 4GB&nbsp;you should on range.</p>

<p>hey! Unfortunately due to lack of answers, I returned the 2GB stick I bought, so now I'm back to my old setting of [1GB, 1GB].</p>
<p>My laptop's GPU is nvidia Geforce Go 7600 128mb.</p>
<p>On another website, someone suggested I go for 2*2GB, but the resulting visible ram will be 3GB, what would you advise?</p>

<p>My advise is, If you really wanna add&nbsp;extra RAM use any Flash drive as RAM(USB,SD..etc.)........ simple. Just format Flash drive and then put in drive.</p>
<p>1-Go to start menu click on right click My computer go down to Properties.</p>
<p>2-On system Properties go to Advance and click on Performance click settings.</p>
<p>3-Now at Performance Options go to Advanced and click on Virtual memory click Change.</p>
<p>4- Find which driver your flash driver located at and selected and then choose system managed size or custom size(2000mb or 4096mb) Press Set. I normally choose system managed size cause I really don't need&nbsp;to the&nbsp;flash drive space for later saving files.
 The down side is speed MAYBE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Byway if can remember that date and time&nbsp;that you had&nbsp;problem, check your event log at Administrative Tools it should show your error massages. &nbsp;</p>
<p>4GB (2*2) stick wouldn't work. 1GB+2GB&nbsp;make show there&nbsp;ddr2 533mhz/ddr3 667mhz and&nbsp;total should be 3GB&nbsp;otherwise it won't&nbsp;work for windows xp. Also your GPU isn't 128MB, is 256MB.</p>
<p>Good luck tho. Also don't let anyone&nbsp;tell you&nbsp;it can't be&nbsp;done.</p>

<p>Every time i go to sign in my account is saying that this file is corrupted but still continues to load my profile with all of my guns set up the way they were, it just has everything highlighted like i just unlocked them...... after my first match it says
 you just unlocked blah, blah , blah..... any one have any ideas why my profile would be corrupted after this long of having it? I have not done anything new, so i have no clue what is going on, it is just annoying to have to unhighlight everything again.</p>

<p>This problem happens a lot with Battlefield 3. Unfortunately you'll have to delete your campaign data save to remove the corrupt data. This may mean you have to run the campaign from the start, and you may lose a few other save bits here and there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find the Battlefield 3 game saves, go to the Xbox dashboard, go over to 'Settings', then go to 'Storage', select your storage device, go to game saves, and find your Battlefield 3 saves.</p>

<p>It has to be some kind of Battlefield 3 data, so it could be a multiplayer save for the class set-ups etc. If you do try to delete them, this could mean that all gun and attatchment set-ups are reset.

<p>- Xbox 360 "Existing profile data appears damaged.." </p>
<p>For those of you on Xbox receiving the error message "Existing profile player data appears to be damaged and cannot be used," try going through this step by step process as follows:
</p>
<p>1. Go to your Xbox Dashboard. </p>
<p>2. Enter 'System Settings.' </p>
<p>3. Select 'Memory.' (Select your hard drive) </p>
<p>4. Go into 'Games' </p>
<p>5. Choose 'Battlefield 3' </p>
<p>6. Select the 'Profile Save Data' </p>
<p>7. Delete it! </p>
<p>Please be aware that by doing this, your single player campaign progress will be erased. However, you should be fine as long as you have unlocked the achievements for it already. Multiplayer stats will remain unaffected as they are linked to your account
 and not your hard drive. In order to avoid this error message in the future, do not turn off your console while the game is in the midst of saving.
</p>

<h2>            Programs and Features isn&#39;t accurate</h2>
                    <p>I'm looking in the utility and there some weird data in it., It's saying that microsoft money essentials is taking up 100 GB of space and&nbsp;a C++ update is taking 4 TB of space, I dont even have 1 TB of hard drive memory.&nbsp; Any fixes for this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I have&nbsp;the defraggler tool from piriform and its saying somehow&nbsp;100GB more of memory all of a sudden is being used from&nbsp; few hours ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, I can't seem to get into World of Warcraft from the launch screen.&nbsp; Keeps on saying it's initializing even after 5 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, for some reason the computer is taking longer to register when a program or device is running&nbsp;or plugged in ever since I defragged.</p>

            <p>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</p>
<p>Boot the computer to safe mode with networking and download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only), update definitions and run in safe mode. Disable
 other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />

<p>I did a system restore...solved third and fourth problem.</p>
<p>Haven't ran defraggler yet....will do that when I go to bed.</p>
<p>Although I didn't follow exact procedure by disabling MSE and updating in safe mode...maybe I should do that.</p>

            <p><span>Select Start, Run, type cmd and press ENTER. Type "chkdsk c: /f /r" without the quotes and hit ENTER.&nbsp;Make sure you
 include the spaces indicated. Enter Y when asked whether you wish to run chkdsk on restarting the computer. Exit and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Marking off bad sectors on a hard drive takes time so be patient. Marking off does not repair a bad sector. It places
 pointers on the drive telling the system not to read or write to those sectors which have been damaged.</span></p>
<p><span>If the number of bad sectors continues to increase after you have run the procedure above several times then you
 should replace the drive. If an important system file is written to a bad sector you can corrupt registry hives and lose the whole contents of the drive.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand if having run chkdsk you see no more new bad sectors then the drive can work for you for years.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: I'm also having a problem uninstalling an internal card reader application from programs and features...from the window that was brought up the utility needs to be in windows vista mode in order to uninstall it...how do I do that?</p>

<p>What I mean by irregular data usage is that they're displaying innacurate data storage...it's saying that MME is taking 100GB and the C++ taking 4TB.</p>

            <p>Well..I havent reinstalled them.&nbsp; They became listed like that when I upgraded to windows 7.&nbsp; Other user accounts list the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure if reinstalling them would work...microsoft money essentials came with windows 7 so I wouldn't be sure if reinstallign will fix it.&nbsp; The C++ update though I can understand since that was installed when I was using vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll try the update first and will post the results.</p>

            <p>The C++ was uninstalled but when I scanned for windows updates it didnt show for it to be reinstalled.&nbsp; I assume the update was only valid for vista and that is why it isn't shown on update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft money essentials, however, had an error when uninstalling.&nbsp; When it was on the phase of removing files the application stopped working and I selected for it to close.</p>

<p>In my experience that pattern or many differing BSODs is most often caused by a RAM issue.&nbsp; I suggest you run the Windows Memory Diagnostic or MemTest86+ (which I prefer). That's available here -

            To evaluate the BSOD please post logs for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Using administrative command prompt copy and paste this whole command.<br />
<br />
Make sure the default language is English so that the logs can be scanned and read.<br />

<p>I don't know if the is related but my laptop kept freezing the last week after 30 minuets of gaming when I usually play for hours, of course overheating came to mind or failed ram but tests went Ok ... it's be running fine for the last 10 years ... did a
 few other test and well ...&nbsp; I decided I would try a system restore ... anyhow, after checking the effected programs ... I seen that a driver was updated on the 15th ... same date as this post ... but I could not see it listed on the installed updates, it
 is marked as critical update and I don't know which exact driver component in device manager it is linked to other that a generic suggestive name and I have maybe at least 10 drivers referring to processors ... I am guessing it was part of the recent quarterly
 roll-up&nbsp; ... any idea on how to just undo this driver upgrade to the previous version and prevent a subsequent update? ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Skype not working on android, update only made things worse</h2>
                    <p>Conversations stopped being updated on my android. I updated skype, hoping this would fix it.&nbsp; Since the update, my contacts are no longer listed, and the conversations are (still) missing. How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your Skype contacts and conversations should sync on Skype whenever you try to sign in to Skype.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In your case, most likely you’re signed in to a different Skype account linked to your email address.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Enter your registered email address on this
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>. </span></li><li><span>If you created your Skype account with a unique or personalized
<strong><em>Skype Name</em></strong>, always sign in to Skype using the <strong><em>Skype Name</em></strong> and not the email address.
</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

    <title>Audio dropouts in Windows 7 64-bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlos eduardo cavalcante  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio dropouts in Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a new computer using an Intel Core i7 2600 processor, Intel Motherboard with Realtek onboard audio and&nbsp;installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit in this fresh new computer in an Intel SSD and I'm experiencing audio dropouts when playing audio or video.</p>
<p>Most of the time it happens when I'm opening new Windows and loading pages in Internet Explorer, but a few times it also happens&nbsp;when only playing media. Keeping track of system resouces from&nbsp;Resource Monitor&nbsp;I didn't notice any high&nbsp;usage of the system
 (in fact they are quite low -&nbsp;normally 4&nbsp;cores are parked). The only thing that helps me analysing&nbsp;it is DPC Latency Checker. When the dropouts occur (and sometimes even when I don't notice audio dropouts) DPC reads peaks from 35000 to 60000 microseconds.
 Normally it stays below&nbsp;500. On a 5 minutes song I get about 2 or 3 dropouts, and sometimes DPC reads 2 or 3 consecutive peaks&nbsp;with 15 secs between each other. I also ran LatencyMon, but no driver o service got a execution higer than 0.12 ms which seems to
 be pretty normal. </p>
<p>The dropouts&nbsp;happen&nbsp;to all player tha I tried: Windows Media Player 32 or 64-bit, Winamp, and&nbsp;a few others.</p>
<p>I installed latest drivers, updated motherboard BIOS, tried disabling some hardware, phisically removed some USB devices, uninstalled current and installed older driver versions, disabled pagefile, disabled sound enhancements, set Windows priority to background
 services, tried other codecs, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>My computer also has 2 HDDs in a RAID1 array in which my songs and movies are stored,&nbsp;but I tried copying&nbsp;them and run from&nbsp;my SSD boot drive, but&nbsp;also didn't get any success.</p>
<p>Just to complete my problem description, I don't have Microsoft Antimalware system installed, I'm running AVG.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate if someone could help, because I spent some $$ to get a pretty good machine and this is really getting me upset.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>With 8Gb of Ram you shouldn't have too many problems - nice&nbsp;set up&nbsp;!</p>
<p>No need to disable the onboard network adapter.</p>
<p>Just as a matter of interest : the realtek drivers here :</p>
<p><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;ProductFamily=Desktop+Boards&amp;ProductLine=Intel%c2%ae+6+Series+Chipset+Boards&amp;ProductProduct=Intel%c2%ae+Desktop+Board+DH67CL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;ProductFamily=Desktop+Boards&amp;ProductLine=Intel%c2%ae+6+Series+Chipset+Boards&amp;ProductProduct=Intel%c2%ae+Desktop+Board+DH67CL</a></p>
<p>those were the ones you downloaded and installed ?</p>
<p>If you're getting such high spikes, then the only route is to turn off one by one the different services until you find the one thats causing these efects. The Black Viper website can be of help here.</p>
<p>With W7 (and your 8Gb of RAM you really don't need to tweak W7 as such, it should run out of the box. T</p>
<p>he only thing I can think of other than the above, is that there is some software somewhere on your machine that you may have installed then un-installed
<u><strong>BUT</strong></u> for whatever reason the un-installer letf bits and bobs all over the place. And they're causing problems due to W7 looking for them but not finding them. Check start-ups as well. Disable what is not necessary - it all gets loaded
 into memory.</p>
<p>You can also try running an app such as Ccleaner or Glary Utilites (only the Registry cleaning bits) to get rid of those leftover registry strings.
</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

            Hi,  RahulIT1
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer? </li><li>Are you getting any error message or code?</li><li>How are you trying to update to Windows 10? Are you using a DVD/setup.exe file or through Windows update?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be because of several reasons such as the security software you may have installed on the computer, any program or application running on the computer at the back ground or due to some errors in the hard drive of the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the methods below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong><strong>Unplug your removable media from the computer.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to unplug all your removable media from the computer, such as removable disks (Blu-ray disks, DVDs, CDs), memory cards (CompactFlash card, Secure Digital card, Memory Stick), and USB flash drives.
<br />
<br />
These removable media may cause this issue during the upgrade of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Restart </strong>the computer in Clean Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Method 2: </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Perform Clean Boot
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot</p>

<h2>            NBA 2k15 My Player&#47; My Career Problems. </h2>
                    
<p>I got on NBA 2k15 with no problem after downloading it. After playing My career for about 4 hours and everything was fine. I got offline and I returned to My Career. Suddenly, I got a connection error and I had to remake a My Player face again. But after
 doing so the same error appeared and made me create a new Face thus crating a never ending loop of creating a face and connection error. Is anyone having this issue. This game is having tons of issues regarding My Player and My career.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I haven't been able to play my career last couple of days. It continues to ask me " connect to xbox live". But I've never actually been disconnected to xbox live. Although I'm online, it seems I can't connect to the nba2k15 servers. Is there something I'm
 doing wrong? Lol</p>

                    <p>My son's account was suspended because XBox live claims he made inflammatory remarks, verbal harassment, and bullying.&nbsp; He filed a protest and was told it was now suspended due to an offensive gamerpic.&nbsp; Well....which is it?&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at the pic and its a guy wearing a donkey kong suit.&nbsp; There is nothing offensive about it.&nbsp; It's kinda funny looking but that's it.&nbsp; Very benign.&nbsp; As for the original suspension reason, XBox Live dictators could not present any kind of proof that anything was said.&nbsp; There is no text log to back up their claim and subsequently prove themselves wrong.&nbsp; Or they DO have the log and realize there is nothing to back up the suspension so they looked elsewhere to validate the suspension.&nbsp;They upheld the suspension but simply&nbsp;changed reasons.&nbsp; SERIOUSLY?!?&nbsp; HOw the heck are they allowed to get away with this kind of fraud?&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are any lawyers reading this how would I go about star

            Hi Francine.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the Touchpad driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you also have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then enter Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  go to Mice &gt; Touchpad and then Driver tab.  Choose Roll Back or if not present choose Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />See the troubleshooting steps here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4027866/windows-fix-touchpad-problems-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402786...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad to go over the Settings.  Then choose Additional Settings which opens the Mouse properties box.  The Touchpad software installs a tab onto it - usually the last one - that should have more settings to check, including a checkbox to Disable Touchpad when USB pointing device is atached.  This prevents palm drag from causing the cursor to jump
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Some times this is caused by system corruption.  Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Missing touchpad options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jesse_81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing touchpad options</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently bought a Lenovo g50-45 and wanted to reverse the scrolling direction for the touchpad. I discovered that in Settings - PC and devices - Mouse and touchpad, is only one option for the touchpad: Changing the delay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reading other people's posts about changing the touchpad settings, it seems like there should be many more options, including reversing the direction of scrolling. Is this a driver issue?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
