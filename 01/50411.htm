    <title>My Computer runs into Audio Issues after the Windows 10 Update 1709 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> killertor2401  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Computer runs into Audio Issues after the Windows 10 Update 1709 and even after update 1803</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone! So before my computer updated to Win 10 Ver. 1709, I never ran into Audio issues, and when I did, I just needed to make a change on the audio settings to fix it up, but after my computer updated to Ver. 1709, I've been running into audio
 issues, these issues come on the way that after starting my computer, my audio and microphone will work for a while, and if on that brief moment I don't use any app that produces audio, then the audio and the microphone will stop working, so I got to keep
 using anything that plays audio to keep my microphone and audio working, otherwise, they just stop working if I don't use anything that makes a sound. I've updated my PC to Ver. 1803 thinking it would fix the audio issue, but it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated my audio drivers a dozen times, uninstalled them and reinstalled them, have downloaded the audio drivers from the Toshiba Page and from outsider pages, telling me that these drivers should fix the problem, but the problem keeps going, I use
 the Audio troubleshooter, and it does it's usual thing, but when it tries to play a sound to see what's the problem, the audio driver crashes, and then all the troubleshooter does is telling me that the "Audio Services not responding", so I searched this online,
 and it told me to change the format of the audio on my PC, and whenever I did this, it always told me: "Format not supported by the device", and when testing the play tone, it always says 'Failed to play test tone", so I did everything else that people normally
 tell others online, like restarting the Windows Audio Service and other services to no avail, so this is actually a problem with the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem gets fixed by restarting my computer, but if after restarting my computer I don't use anything that plays an sound, then the issue will start to appear, this issue wasn't present before the Win 10 Ver. 1709, so the version of Windows I had before
 1709 had no problems with the audio or microphone, so a few months ago, when my PC automatically updated to Ver. 1709, it started to happen, so I never found a fix, so I rolled back to my past version of Windows, and the audio issues went away, but then, 2
 days ago, Windows automatically updated my PC to Ver. 1709 and the audio issues started, I updated my PC to Ver. 1803, thinking it would fix my problem, it did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm asking for help in here, if anyone knows what I should do, I would appreciate it, I wouldn't want to rollback again, since I do like to keep my PC updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case it's needed, I'll leave my PC specs for any reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 10 64-Bits Version 1803 OS Build 17134.81</p>
<p>Manufacturer: Toshiba</p>
<p>Model: Satellite C55-C5241</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here hoping for any answer that might help, since I have seen countless of posts online, here on Microsoft forums and multiple pages, and all the answers never fix the problem, so I hope any of you might be able to help.</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />

<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Try a "clean boot" and see if it makes a difference: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a> 
<br />
<br />If a clean boot does resolve the issue there is a section in the article "How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot". 
<br />
<br />Reset the computer to start normally afterward. 
<br />
<br />As a general precaution create a System Restore Point prior to initiating a clean boot.

            Hi Vijay.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your Network and Sound drivers from the Dell Support Downloads web page here <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Products/laptop?app=drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Produ...</a>  using the  Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br /> 
<br />If that doesn't help try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help  ry Uninstall, restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />   
<br />Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br />
<br />----------------------------------
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

В итоге игра требует купить эти машины за игровую валюту, это не правильно! Помогите или верните деньги за три контента! Такого я ещё не видел, в 5 форзе оплатил и получил,а тут какая то фигня....

<h2>            DRIVER_STATE_POWER_FAILURE&#58; HP OMEN</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have an HP OMEN, and continuously and randomly I get the DRIVER_STATE_POWER_FAILURE and have to restart it. &nbsp;For awhile I would be getting it once every hour or two, recently I updated my BIOS and thought that would fix it, but I just got the error again
 a second ago after a few days of not seeing it at all.<br />
<br />
I've so far tried making sure everything was up-to-date, use the windows troubleshooting in the control panel, and read the posts and blogs about people having similar problems and tried to follow the protocols given to them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What information do I need to post in order for you to help me? and thank you in advance for any time you put into helping me resolve my problem!

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing. I would like to ask you:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Are you using any third party security software or firewall?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Is it while running a specific application or program?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Is there any specific error code upon system restart or when this message appears? If so, what is it?</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>It will be prudent for us to review event logs on your system for this issue and proceed with the troubleshooting in targeted direction.
</span></p>
<p><span>Event logs are special files that record significant events on your computer, such as when a user logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error. Whenever these types of events occur, Windows records the event in an event log that you
 can read by using Event Viewer. Advanced users might find the details in event logs helpful when troubleshooting problems with Windows and other programs. To open Event Viewer:</span></p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t get rid of this malware&#47;virus&#33;  Windows Advanced Security Center.  Help&#63;</h2>
                    My&nbsp;new computer (not the one I'm using right now)&nbsp;seems to have caught the "Windows Advance Security Center" virus that won't go away.&nbsp; It keeps trying to get me to buy their solution to phoney viruses I'm supposed to have.&nbsp; It has disabled my&nbsp;Microsoft
 Security Essentials antivirus software.&nbsp; I've tried loading windows in safe mode and running Mcrosoft's safe scan which does not find the virus&nbsp;and the Malwarebytes {free version} program will not&nbsp;even&nbsp;open.&nbsp; This virus also interfears with the internet (cutting
 me off) and claiming malware at work and I must activate this program to get rid of it.&nbsp; Short of wiping the HD and reloading Windows and everything else, what other choices do I have now?&nbsp; This seems to be one tough bug!

<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-smart-hdd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-smart-hdd</a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Try the removal instructions recommended by Bleeping Computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b><span>Alternatively, </span></b><span>try these on demand scanners which will not interfere with your resident AV program - you may need to run them in Safe Mode or Safe Mode With Networking:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Go to </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>www.malwarebytes.org</span></span></a><span> and download, install, update and run the free version – just follow the prompts.<span>
</span></span>The prompt<span> </span>asks if you want to <em><span>Start trial</span></em> or<em><span>Decline</span></em>. To get the free version (without real-time scanning or web site blocking features) you need to choose<em><span>Decline.<span>
</span></span></em><span>You may need to rename the installation file to 123.exe or something similar to prevent the malware from disabling/blocking the installation.<span>
</span>Or you might want to download the installation file to a flash drive or CD and then install Malwarebytes on the infected computer.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>And/or</span></b></p>

<p><span>SAS Portable is "designed" to be downloaded onto a flash drive (or CD) and you could then insert the drive into your computer and run it from there. If you do that you may need to scan the flash drive for malware after using it on the infected computer.
 SAS is a very good scanner but will also identify and remove cookies which are not considered to be malware.</span></p>

<h3> mgjsneedshelp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I stop WIndows 7 from automatically resorting files while I am renaming them&#63;</h2>
                    The reason why the auto sort doesn't work for me is that when I rename files it automatically puts them&nbsp;in the new order and then I have to go searching for where I left off in my renaming. If I could turn that function off then I could wait and resort
 after I have renamed all the files. Is there any way to do this in WIndows 7?<br />

            Microsoft intentionally removed the option to disable Auto Arrange, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
but it's still possible with a workaround.</span> &nbsp; See the Auto Arrange links below.

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Most important features to fix or return to Windows Explorer:</span></strong>
<p>1) The option to disable Auto Arrange.<br />
<br />
2) Fix The Left Pane Scroll Bug: If you are viewing a folder and expand it in the left pane to show it's subfolders, the folder is annoyingly auto-scrolled to the bottom of the pane causing the subfolders to not be shown, making it difficult to work with. Double
 clicking a folder in the left pane can also cause this problem.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote to fix it.</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
3) When multiple files are selected they should stay selected when changing the sorting order (ex: Name to Size). Maintaining selected files when sorting should be a requirement and this feature should not have been removed.<br />
<br />
4) The option to remember each folder's view settings (remembering individual folder window sizes and positions).<br />
<br />
5) The option to remove "Full row selection" for details view. "Full row selection" is very annoying when the folder is full and has no empty space to click on. Also, when dragging/dropping files to a different folder - if you release the file on the row of
 a subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file "full row selection" causes the file to be moved into the subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file rather the the intended folder.<br />
<br />
6) A search window with all the advanced search options. No syntax required.<br />
<br />
7) The option to always show free disk space and folder size in the status bar and/or details pane. Also always automatically show the size of selected files (when many files are selected it will not show the total size).<br />
<br />
8) The option to scroll the pane your mouse is in with mouse wheel even if that pane is not selected.</p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Let Microsoft know you want Windows Explorers features returned:</span></strong>
<p>Since many people seem to agree that some or all the changes made to Windows Explorer have actually made it less user friendly, you can go to the Windows 7 Feedback page and (politely) let them know your suggestions for improving it:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mymfe.microsoft.com/Windows%207/Feedback.aspx?formID=195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mymfe.microsoft.com/Windows%207/Feedback.aspx?formID=195</a></p>
<p>Note: don't make the message too long, there is a size limit to your message even though the page doesn't tell you about it. Also, don't just copy and paste from the list above - they will think the same person is repeatedly submitting feedback.</p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Classic Shell To Restore Some Features To Windows Explorer</span></strong>
<p>After installing the free <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Classic Shell</a> you can customize Windows Explorer closer to how you want it, the quote below is just one way to do so.&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/features.html#explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a> to see some of the options you can
 customize, and here is the&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FAQ page</a> for Classic Shell.</p>
<blockquote>A solution which did work for restoring some features.
<p>1) Install the free&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell.</a> &nbsp;This is very customizable, and works as a mod for Windows Explorer rather than a full blown replacement. You didn't need to install the Classic Start Menu
 option, but you can if you want.<br />
2) Reboot the computer.<br />
3) Launch Windows Explorer (Start - Computer) and turn on "Always Show Menus" (Organize - Layout - check Menu Bar). This is just for configuration, you can turn it off again afterwards if you want.<br />
4) Right click on the menu bar and turn on the "Classic Explorer Bar". This adds a series of cut/copy/paste icons to Explorer. Crucially, it also adds the "Configuration" icon.<br />
5) Go into the configuration and from here you can tweak things to your heart's content. To kill the horrible Windows 7 folder-jumping, switch the "Navigation Pane Style" to Vista. You can even knock it back to XP mode if you want (this adds in the lines to
 the folder tree and adds a classic "+" icon for expanding folders). The Windows Vista style folder view looks pretty much the same as the Windows 7 view, but gets rid of the horrible jumping.<br />
6) Tweak any other settings you want.</p>
<p>After this, you can turn the toolbar and menus back off in Explorer if you wish. Windows Explorer looks largely the same, but folders no longer jump around.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote
 for Microsoft to fix this bug.</a> </strong></p>
<p>Now, if only MS could code properly so that we don't have to mess with third party apps to get Windows to actually work properly...</p>

 call Microsoft and explain what happened to complete the activation. Activating it on the second computer will automatically in effect "deactivate" the license for the first computer. The key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed
 at a time. </span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Press Enter on your Keyboard

<br />
Yes you can if the Windows 7 Home Premium was a Full version, you may install it on the Latitude, then you may run the Anytime Upgrade. You will have to activate via telephone because you are moving machines.

            It's more than likely not being blocked. Do you get any noise from the drive? Does the DVD drive have two USBs and if so are both plugged in? Does the pc make any sound when the drive is plugged in?<br /><br />Thanks

            the drive makes noise, DVD is recognized in name and the system says its good, but nothing appears , no sound neither....I went thru the system looking for answers...the only thing I get is that Windows 10 has removed media player and go to Microsoft store
 to purchase app..I have been to utube also looking for answers but none of those work. I have tried several, manyy times over......I just want to know if their is a block on system from me using the product fully to its potential because Windows 10 pro wants

            Looks like Windows 10 Enterprises edition and Pro versions don't always have Windows Media Player installed. There are many great alternatives.  I suggest trying VLC player. Just bring it in Google and you should be good to go.

    <title>Documents Folder Disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radfordbean1787  say:</h3>
<h2>            Documents Folder Disappeared</h2>
                    After you guys updated my operating system last night, that took two hours for Pete's sake, my Documents folder disappeared from the Quick Access. I found the folder and all its subfolders had been moved to my C drive. What gives? How do I restore the
 folder back to where it was? It's currently located under Users and won't let me drag or copy it back. I sure do miss Windows 98. And how do I go about renaming my C drive to something that makes sense? It's currently name cprai.

<p>Hi Radford,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some users may experience this of the situation in which user settings may be reverted back to default if an update will be applied. You can easily place a folder to show up in Quick access by following the steps on this link

Pin, remove, and customize in Quick access</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Renaming your hard disk drive can easily be done by launching the <strong>File Explorer</strong>, and then select
<strong>This PC</strong>. Right-click on the drive that you want to rename and choose
<strong>Rename</strong> from the context menu.</p>

<p>Renaming the folder isn't an option. It appears to be protected. It looks like the file took on part of the email address I initially set up in Microsoft when used the laptop for the first time.</p>

    <title>Reinstalling software after a windows reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrianholbrook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling software after a windows reinstall</h2>
                    I had to reinstall Windows 10 after a major issue which meant it was a complete install. Luckily I had a number of programmes that I had installed on a separate hard drive - not C: Now I have the problem that I have the programmes, I can get them to run
 OK. I've even added shortcuts to the Start menu but they do not show up under settings in the list of installed Apps. Presumably this requires a registry update. The reason that I am worried about this is that there is an update to one of my programmes and
 I am not sure if it will work if the original version is identified as being installed. Is there a way of fixing this?

            Hi Adrian
<br />
<br />Sorry, there is no real way to fix this, other than re-installing that software, I am amazed the software still runs after clean installing Windows 10, most software will fail to run after a clean install
<br />
<br />When software is installed, it generally adds files and folders to the Program files folder, the Program Data folder and many other places,also a lot of Registry keys are created. It is next to impossible to recreate that structure without a re-install of the software . . .

            Hi Adrian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you reinstall Windows then you must also reinstall your personal programs and apps as they will not run from an old install and if they do it may have problems. 
<br />
<br />Follow  the steps to reinstall Windows in this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Always reinstall programs to C drive since they write registry keys to the WIndows registry and should be kept within the Windows partition. 
<br />
<br />If you need to save space then move the User folders off as they do not suffer any speed loss like apps do if they're not on an SSD hosting WIndows.  See here how to do this:  
<br /><a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-change-the-location-of-user-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-syst...</a>
<br />
<br />This way  if Windows ever becomes irreparable you can restore C in 20 minutes from recovery media, and your files will be current and safe in their own separate partition.  If they are left on C they will be dated from when the image was taken.  
<br />
<br />The best free imaging app for saving the backup image externally is here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have a Gamer Tag (A) that is associated with a Microsoft Live account (1) from about six years ago when I purchased my xbox</p>
<p>I recently purchased&nbsp; Windows 8 for my PC, a&nbsp;Windows phone&nbsp;and a Microsoft Surface RT and all are&nbsp;&nbsp;registered with Microsoft Live account (2)</p>
<p>I've followed the procedure on these forums for changing the Gamer Tag (A) to Microsoft Live account (2) on my xbox but I'm met with the prompt;</p>
<p>"Sorry, this Microsoft Account (2) is already associated with an xbox live profile. Try a different Microsoft account."</p>
<p>There is,&nbsp;apparently, &nbsp;&nbsp;a Gamer Tag (B) associated with Microsoft Live account (2) that I did initiate which has a silver membership.&nbsp; I've always purchased a gold since I've had my xbox.</p>

7.) Enter the email address you wish to change it to, and enter the password for that email address.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, but you cannot do that yet since the Microsoft account you wish to have is taken. In order to get that available, you will need to sign in to the profile that the Microsoft account is associated with, and change via the steps above. After you have
 done that (you can change it to an unwanted email, or an alternate email) the Microsoft Account you wish to have, once it has been removed from the profile you do not use, will then be available for the profile you do use!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, too add on, if you forget your Microsoft account, or password view the Forgot Microsoft Account | Xbox Microsoft Account page for further assistance in recovering the account / password.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!<br />

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>to add some additional information and steps.</p>
<p>you can also check this support page which explains on how to switch the gamertag (also a section for when there already exist a profile)</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account</a></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<p>1. Download gamertag B onto your console,</p>
<p>2. wait 30 days, a profile (gamertag) can only be moved to a different Microsoft Account when it has been on a console or at least 30 days)</p>
<p>3. Create a new Microsoft Account (3) or use one that hasn't got a xbox live account attached </p>
<p>4. Move gamertag B to that new/other Microsoft account (3) via the console, this will free up Microsoft Account 2</p>
<p>Be sure not to use the PC or tablet while doing this, because that might generate a new xbox live account for Microsoft Account 2.</p>
<p>5. Move Gamertag A to Microsoft Account 2 via the console</p>
<p>6. Optional If needed/wanted, you can cancel that new/other Microsoft (3) completely via this link: <a href="https://account.live.com/summarypage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.live.com/summarypage.aspx</a></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Result:</p>
<p>Gamertag A is connected to Microsoft Account 2, which is used on all devices and will have all subscriptions used on Gamertag A.</p>
<p>Gamertag B is on Microsoft Account 3, which may have been cancelled via step 6</p>
<p>Microsoft Account 1, is freed from any xbox live account.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you experience error message <strong>
0xc0000005 </strong>when trying to configure Backup in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A <strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Steps mentioned for Windows 8/8.1, will work fine with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>

            Having just installed Windows 10 freshly on this computer, I decided to simply live with the inconvenience for now. It appears that lots of people have this problem. I also discovered that I could get at the option I needed (see the status) through the
 control panel. &nbsp;Just can't get there through the new and apparently very buggy "Settings" App...

<h2>            How to delete printer icons in &#39;Printers and devices&#39;</h2>
                    Running Windows 7(64) Home Premium.&nbsp; PC has an Intel Core i3-540 3.6 GHZ processor on an Intel H55TC Mother board.<br />
<br />
My computer came with a parallel expansion card rather than use the existing parallel header on the mother board.&nbsp; It would not print until I assigned the printer to LPT3:.&nbsp; However the printer (by now I have added an original and 2 copies) do not show up on
 the Printers and Devices screen.&nbsp; I later removed this card and got a parallel header extender.&nbsp; I installed the printer again and this time on LPT1: (now the third copy) and it does shows up on the printers and devices screen.&nbsp; I&nbsp; cannot find a way to delete
 the copies of the earlier printers short of removing all references to them in the Registry (which I am reluctant to try).&nbsp; They all show up in the printer selection screen when printing a document.<br />

            Hi Marium.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It was not necessary to reinstall Windows 8.1 in order to do the inferior Upgrade install to WIndows 10.  You can Clean Install Windows 10 at any time and have a much better install.  Follow these steps which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you prefer to Upgrade then install the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />There is also no Product Key for free Upgrade which uses a Digital License which was permanently assigned to the PC when you first upgraded.  Just skip the key and it will reactivate after connecting to the internet.  If not run the Activation Troubleshooter in Activation Settings. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have same problem too and I have emailed KONAMI more than 50 times! KONAMI only answered me once is that "Unfortunately the issue is unknown to us and we would need to gather more information first." &nbsp;I also called KONAMI customer support main office in
 Germany. &nbsp;The reception girl gave me a very tough answer :"I don't know!" Ur guys can call this numbers - +49 (0)69 985 573 0 or email:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>KONAMI customer support is the worst customer support i have ever seen! They support nothing for the customers!</p>
<p>KONAMI is just a piece of ***! &nbsp;I have contacted XBOX LIVE and been told that KONAMI have not published the PES 2012 Data Pack to the XBOX &nbsp;live at all!! &nbsp;KONAMI only published it to the PS3!</p>
<p>*** Japanese!</p>

<p>I am having the same problem. I have 3 boxes ....1 x 360 original, 2 x 360 kinect, all on different networks / ISP / routers ....all the same household and all consoles bought over different periods. Plenty of disk space and no issue for years. Family has
 Gold accounts and we play everyday ....seriously.</p>
<p>Just today ...all 3 xbox 360 showed the same symptoms. On start-up ....fine, after the logo spins in ....you get the loading / auto-sign circle that goes round and round, the message pops up telling us how many friends we have online ....and then ...freeze.</p>
<p>The only way to get out of the freeze state is to manually turn off the device ....can't even do it via the controllers. Disconnected hard drives, network ....and it runs fine ....the minute you connect to the internet and login ...in freezes. This looks
 like the same proble the Canadians had in Nov 2012 after a recent update. We just had one from Xbox live recently.</p>
<p>Even tried using a clean drive to sign in ....went thru all the process and even recalled my gametag ...but on one of the download updates, the server came back as having some issue and cannot connect to xbox live at this time. There is nothing wrong with
 our collective consoles, drives or network. It is at Xbox Live server end. What is up? By the way ....we are out of Singapore.</p>

<p>Yeah my friend and I are getting this problem too and it's pretty irritating. To be specific, the console freezes after the x<em>box guide
<strong>minimizes</strong></em> and starts loading the home screen. <em>(The time when they tell you how many friends you have at the bottom of the screen.)</em></p>
<p>I tried clearing cache and everything and it looks like the hard drive doesn't look like it's the problem. It'd be great if this is fixed or a resolution is made up.<em><br />

<p>I'm having the same problem as well. The freezing only happens if you try to load the Xbox Home screen while you are signed in and connected to Xbox Live. If you sign in without connecting to Xbox Live, then start a game, then connect to Xbox Live, it'll
 play the game normally. However, the moment you try to load the Xbox Home Screen while signed in and connected to Xbox Live, it'll freeze. The freezing issue might be regional since I am from Singapore too.</p>

<p>Same issue here. &nbsp;I play GTA 5 online and it's been freezing during online gameplay also recently.</p>
<p>Now it freezes as it signs into Xbox live.</p>
<p>I switched my WiFi off and tried again and it went through to dashboard, but then switch WiFi back on again it tries ti sign in and then freezes.</p>
<p>I've got very little on he hard drive (2-3 games only) and it's only a year old+ machine.</p>
